@@44048104 @4048104/ <p> This will no longer have a beneficial effect with future changes to memory handling and swap space in the next version . I recommend reversing the changes if you made them . <p> --------------------- Having a recent Rev.B I 've modified my xbian set up to make a bit better use of the memory available . <p> First , I 've mounted /tmp as a tmpfs . The defaults are fine because half of hardware memory as the top limit appears okay for the intended use . ( Deliberately leaving /var/tmp alone as that may have large files written to it . ) <p> Add the following line to /etc/fstab <p> Code : <p> tmpfs /tmp tmpfs nodev , nosuid 0 0 <p> Stopping XBMC , I symlink /. xbmc/temp to /tmp/ , /. **29;38;TOOLONG and LONG ... to /tmp/ , then reboot . <p> If anything fills /tmp/ with data over 190mb , it 's going to fail . I 've yet to see this happen , and I do n't know of any xbmc addon that would do this . If you know of a addon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ask the addon 's creator to store these files in a cache in it 's addondata directory . . xbmc/temp/ and commoncache appear to be intended for small temporary files only . tmpfs can be expanded beyond free memory , because it uses swap , but it can never be set above total hardware memory due to memory allocation handling . <p> There is the minor possibility that this could cause an issue due to file name collisions with something else . I have n't seen this happen on xbian , but it might be worth making a init script that properly creates a unique directory name in /tmp/ and creates the symlinks on boot . <p> This seems to conflict with the zram improvements that are coming up , and needs to be reverted if you want to take advantage of them without the system bogging down . With zram swap loopback , I 'm noticing a great improvement in responsiveness . <p> despite the changes which are comming , I still like the idea of putting xbmc . /temp and some other caching files into memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 years old ! ! ! ) like tmpfs shm on it etc - as standard feature . <p> @JayBlanc specially for this purpose I would choose /run/shm , not /tmp and /tmp I would leave solid . It 's ok for you if you knows you system , but general many things can go wrong . /tmp is defined in posix with no limit in size . linux is changing /tmp from permanent to clean on reboot storage , but still no size limit . <p> feel free to play with /etc/default/tmpfs file , everything is managed via init according to those params . <p> and if you use mount --bind instead of delete / create symlinks , it will be completely transparent

Luckily , they have a Backligt On / Off switch that is going to be very useful for us . <p> 6 . Now we need to install the screensaver addon that will help us to do the trick . In Kodi go to : System &gt; Add-Ons&gt; Kodi Add-on repository &gt; Look and feel &gt; Screensaver &gt; I used " Unary Clock Screensaver " <p> 7 . Back in terminal , we need to place our GPIO code within the add-on . If you are using another screensaver , the correct places will vary . <p> Terminal <p> nano LONG ... <p> Add this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RPi.GPIO as GPIO <p> Scroll down and search for self.log ( " Screensaver starting " ) . Add these three lines after it and make sure to maintain the indentation : <p> 14 . Fire up your raspi and wait for the screensaver to kick in ... Notice : When you boot up , it can take up to 20 seconds before the backlight turns on . <p> Hope it works out for you Feel free to comment and improve the tutorial . <p> Some thoughts <p> Poti for Display dimming You can add a poti or resistor to dimm your display . Be aware : The poti WILL turn warm/hot . This is not a very efficient way . Consider using a poti with a transistor or whatever you feel comfy with . The " hot " poti works for me . The potis value should be 200 or 500 Ohm . The 50k poti in the picture was the last one i had and works .... quite fragile So value above represents max brightness to mostly off . A 100 Ohm one might work as wll . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waveshare 7 " HDMI LCD using GPIO and screensaver <p> As far as I can tell , the display control circuit is not affected by the backlight switch . The touchscreen keeps definitely working , even with switched off backlight and there is no kind of " resync " process when turned on . However , its true that the backlight leads react sensitive to very low voltage as it might happen , that it does n't turn on at all if you dim it till the point it turns off by itself . Meanwhile I replaced the relay with a transistor for smoother dimming . It works really good as long I do n't dim too much . Though , it is possible to drive it at very low brightness . As I said , the downside is , that it wo n't tuRn on again until you give it more power . I suspect there is another transistor in the backlight circuit that needs a specific voltage to kick in . The more i think about it , you might be right . Probably , even though its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls the whole display electronics excluding the touchscreen , which would be a much more reasonable explanation to the " does n't  turn on anymore " than the transistor theory i had before . I just checked the LCD with a bright flashlight and there is absolutely no image displayed , if the backlight is turned of . Interesting , that the electronics are able to be undervolted that far and still continue working . I think i will try to find the actual leads that are responsible for the backlight leds .

@@44048118 @4048118/ <p> I seem to recall that it is possible to boot to a previous snapshot by modifying the rootflags parameter of cmdline.txt in case your xbian copy no longer boots . That would be all dandy , except that there is no easily accessible list of snapshots when I put the SD card into my computer to change the parameter . It would be great if there was a " snapshots.txt " in the /boot partition which was updated when snapshots were created or destroyed . If your install failed to boot , you could insert the SD card into your computer , find the snapshot you want from the snapshots.txt file , update cmdline.txt as needed , and be on your merry way all without ever leaving the comfort of your FAT boot partition . <p> My suggestion was prompted by a recent occurrence where I was unable to even get to the recovery console . Can you confirm that setting the root parameter in config.txt to a different snapshot would have allowed me to boot from that previous snapshot ( assuming the previous snapshot was intact ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have a spare usb keyboard or spare usb ports , so it is much simpler for me to pull the sd card and edit the boot partition on another machine . I suspect many other xbian users run sans keyboard like myself , and thus might find this feature useful . Anybody else care to chime in ? <p> The problem is that the /boot ( FAT ) partition is the most troublesome part of most installs because it can get corrupt easily .

Anybody else care to chime in ? <p> there are few kernel parameters maybe interesting for you : 1 ) telnet ( kernel parameter ) - creates telnetd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and after rootfs is switched ( init called ) . in the second case ( switch root , init and starndard boot ) telnetd is killed immediately as sshd is started . in the first case ( initramfs ) your RPI will be that way accessible remotely in case rootfs is inaccessible ( impossible to boot ) as initramfs will drop to recovery console and wait for user action . 2 ) busybox conspy -f ( command ) - when you enter recovery console remotely via telnet , you get spawned shell . you can do repair stuff there , but normally you would like to continue boot process after the management tasks are done . conspy will change your " view " to console view - like you would be using ext. keyboard and siting in front of RPI. there you can just type " exit " and boot process will continue 3 ) rescue ( kernel parameter ) - if rescue is put into cmdline.txt , your initramfs will always be interrupted by dropping to shell - even if no other errors detected . this way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ca n't 4 ) ip=dhcp ( kernel parameter ) - to have use of RPI telnetd ( as in ( 1 ) ) you need network . ip=dhcp will force kernel to obtain IP even before initramfs stage , without use of external scripts or tools - so your RPI will have IP since cca 3s after switching the power on or reset . ip=xxxx can be in cmdline permanently - only if you configure your RPI that kernel should be responsible for IP configuration , set your eth0 from " static " or " dhcp " to " manual " in /etc/network/interfaces. that way system boot scripts will just mark eth0 as UP without any other operation on the eth0. otherwise is hard to predict what will happen . latest Debian versions are " working " ok , but older scripts &amp; tools for instance deconfigured the network and never configured again , or kept configuration in tact but did n't mark eth0 as UP etc etc .... 5 ) bootmenu ( kernel parameter ) - this is answer to your opening post . in that case initramfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to allow you to choose what disk/partition/snapshot you wa n't to boot . all available partitions are scanned automatically for presence of " boot.cfg " file which describes boot parameters for this particular partition it is found on . you can even boot another kernel , different command line parameters . for btrfs partitions it also gets all snapshots from subvolume " root " and lists them as possible boot target . template for " boot.cfg " is at **37;130;TOOLONG bootmenu can be also present always - it is possible to define " timeout " parameter . if no user action is taken in " timeout " limit , system is automatically booted with kernel and parameters from /dev/mmcblk0p1 ( as no bootmenu was used ) of course if one insist on walking to RPI each time something needs to be done , turning it off , pulling sd out , then editing , putting back , walking back , starting etc , creating txt file with snapshot names is the least problem . actually will do it asap . <p> but let 's imagine your problem with damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the other snapshot name is bootable or not . so how many times you will repeat this procedure ? for each snapshot RPI off , SD out , PC in , EDIT , SD in , RPI on - to realise this one is also bad . <p> with early(recovery) console being accessible via network you can just start " bootmenu " manually and just hitting enter to see , if it works . <p> ( ( bootmenu is not yet available as " released " functionality of XBian and was only minimally tested by myself - so one can expect some bugs as it was written from scratch ) ) <p> mk <p> ( 10th Apr , 2014 04:37 AM ) CurlyMo Wrote : What could be a good idea is to have a let 's say " second-to-last " snapshot . So , a snapshot that always refers to previous to last state and always has the same name . <p> this one can also be added easily . <p> let 's say btrfs-auto-snapshot tool will always create @lastgoodknown snapshot from currently created one . with next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freshly created . <p> if " bootmenu " will be adopted later ( in any functionality which can still " shape " for future ) , using it by default ( configurable to " off " by user ) can have another big advantage - and this is the problem CurlyMo is telling about - /boot consistency . <p> although it is not happening so often on XBian , there are still cases when /boot get 's corrupted - making system unbootable for standard user . and user seeing system unbootable automatically assumes that XBian as a whole is broken . - in majority of such cases user is going to re-flash whole install and wasting time with reconfiguration to previous state ( if there is no backup ) . - in majority of such cases rootfs is not broken and user can get system back by simply restoring /boot <p> currently , bootmenu &amp; booting uses /boot as with normal setup - there is kernel , initramfs , cmdline.txt etc. but assuming bootmenu as part of boot process ( even with timeout=0 in which case system will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be updated with setting changes , with kernel updates , etc. it could be unmounted permanently with a static " kernel " which would update on rare occasions only . the " actual " kernel &amp; boot setttings would be still in /boot but as part of rootfs. and " bootmenu " booting process would find the " real " kernel &amp; setups on rootfs as when it is now looking for other possible boot targets . <p> @mk01 thank you very much for your detailed and very informative post . The bootmenu parameter looks like a fantastic piece of work and I will try it as soon as my rpi is unpacked ( currently in the process of moving ) along with the telnet parameter . <p> When using the telnet parameter , I assume that since I use reserved DHCP addresses I would need to also set the ip=dhcp parameter . From reading your explanation of the rescue parameter , I assume that if my system was in need of some manual intervention ( me ) , I would have to add the rescue parameter in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume control via telnet , correct ? <p> Lastly , I am obviously not a linux guru by any means , but I would assume that at the recovery console since we are still running out of the initramfs that I would not be able to use wlan0 and I must use eth0 since the system loads kernel modules/drivers ( please tell me which is the correct term ) later on in the boot sequence . Is that also a correct assumption ? <p> Lastly , thank you for all your hard work on xbian . IMO it is the most useful , feature-filled distro in the whole rpi community . <p> CurlyMo has initramfs extended with wifi support , but for official stable it has been dropped . <p> The telnet has no other dependencies and is processed at two stages . Imagine boot as two steps . One is initramfs . Normally it takes 2-3s if there is nothing to do . Then root is mounted and init started . There begins 2nd stage . <p> If you have telnet as parameter this happens : 1 ) if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing less nothing more . So reason for which initramfs was interrupted is not condition for telnetd , neither if you started network from kernel . It is only up to you if you allows network at kernel stage ( ip=dhcp ) and/or if you decide , that initramfs stage will hold for you unconditionally ( rescue ) . This is the only way to do VERY LOW LEVEL maintenance if you do n't have physical access . Without rescue even with telnet and with ip=dhcp initramfs will not wait for you and until no error happened 2nd stage is started instantly . 2 ) telnet has its use even after initramfs phase . Imagine network config went wrong . Or /etc/ completely . Or there is service in S runlevel which wo n't stop so runlevel 2 wo n't be started and this would mean no net , no multiuser mode not even CONSOLE at physical access . Telnet there means that as /sbin/init is started from initramfs , telnetd is immediately after predeceasing all other possibilities for system to fail . But you can login and fix - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ip=dhcp ) <p> the first telnet session is stopped as initramfs passes - so normally is not even started within the 2-3s. the second telnetd is stopped automatically as soon as net is configured - so most part of startup is ok and ssh is available -- so telnet can be sure you are not left without access . <p> All this was implemented because I 'm a bit lazy . And walking to RPI , handling SD card in another PC etc . It is too much demanding . that way I do n't have to move from place until BOOT gets completely corrupted.

@@44048128 @4048128/ <p> I created a guide which goes to all the steps how to get started with XBian and setup a fully automated solution to follow your favourite TV Shows and movies . This is a guide for beginners , it 's extensively written but the steps are short and easy . This uses http : //trakt.tv and Flexget and is a good and very lightweight alternative for Sickbeard/Couchpotato . <p> Nice and good tutorial . Some remarks on the tutorial : You forgot ( or I missed ? ) the step were transmission is installed , or does transmissionrpc also include the tranmission client itself ? If yes , is there a way the xbian-package of transmission could be used ? Since this one is patched for XBian and compiled specially ( lightweight ) for the RPi . <p> At step C , the folders /home/xbian/downloads etc are create when the download package ( of on of its includes ) is installed . So wo n't be there for default ( they will be when **26;205;TOOLONG is installed ) . <p> At the extra : If you enable portforwarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also not recommended to enable port forwarding for port 22 , because you will get several brute force attacks per day on that port . If you want remote ssh access from everywhere best is to change the ssh port number ( google for more info on this ) . <p> Flexget also offers support for newsservers , so you might want to add that to your tutorial . <p> Some remarks on the claims you made in the beginning . The claims to more relate to torrents vs newsservers then FlexGet vs SickBeard/CouchPotato . CouchPotato perfectly supports torrents , so no need for a newsserver . SickBeard offers limited support for torrents , but there is also a fork with full support ( which is also offered as an XBian package ) . So again , no need for a newsserver . The parring and extracting is related to using newsservers . The last claim about prioritising feature included in &gt;XBian beta 1 so can be applied for any package , also for SickBeard and CouchPotato ( which it also is ) . So these can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it : Flexget:pro : Lightweight . One solution for both tvshows and movies . <p> con : More advanced to install and configure . <p> **25;233;TOOLONG : Easier to install and configure .

I will update the guide this wkend , thanks for your feedback , much appreciated ! <p> edit : just updated the guide , re-added Transmission installation , updated cons/pros. transmissionrpc is a seperate ' tool ' , which helps to connect to the JSON-RPC service of Transmission . It is not part of Transmission and does not contain transmission .

Just for the experience , I might create a ddclient package . <p> BTW about the nice UI : with the Flexget setup from the guide you will be able to use the very fancy glamourous trakt.tv website to add/remove TV Shows and movies If all has been set correctly , you do n't need to edit the flexget config file anymore .. <p> Flexget is developing a webui and an experimental version is available though .

@@44048136 @4048136/ <h> How we make your life easier <p> Lately we have seen so many of you wondering and whispering , what is going on with XBian , if it is still under development , why there are no updates , no news posts and so on . As usual , we listen very carefully even if we do not response directly and often . We do not post or inform very often , if is it on our web page under News section or through our social media . This is not because we do not want to or do not care . Actually the reason is more simple , and more obvious . <p> The main goals of XBian is to make the most advanced but easily maintainable OS available ( for small form factor computers ) . This goal has almost been reached by using various ( self-developed ) solutions and with the help of various developers . <p> The first step was making everything open source . When XBian initially started by @Koenkk , the code was freely available but not officially open source . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @CurlyMo joined the project . He started to put everything on github and also started to document everything . He also developed the initial core of XBian by creating the apt repository and xbian-config for easy system maintainance . Since XBian has become open source a lot of users have already contributed in various ways . <p> As soon as @mk01 joined the project , this goal was taken to yet a higher level . We adopted the BTRFS filesystem , @CurlyMo and @mk01 wrote the really powerfull ( rescue ) initramfs . This allows on-the-fly resizing of partitions , filesystem conversion , boot from various devices etc . However , the big project was all happening on github. @mk01 worked for about a year with the help of @menakite to create github repositories for all XBian packages available and this currently allows everyone to easily build new deb packages from them . Users could now easily generate the latest XBian package themselves and install . <p> The apt repository itself was updated so users from Beta 1 and up can now install XBian updates no matter how old the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature about our currently running apt repository is that we are able to automatically create XBian images for all supported platforms . Generating these images is essentially nothing more than installing all required and latest apt packages available from both XBian and Debian . Soon , XBian new images will automatically appear on sourceforge and in the XBian installer each week . <p> In the last couple of weeks @CurlyMo has worked hard in streamlining the apt repository . As a user , you should n't notice any of it , but the repository currently has the following features : A new version of the repository is generated every four hours . All mirrors can easily sync the repository by using rsync and do this at least 15 minutes after the main repository update . It sorts the mirrors based on your location . It checks every 15 minutes if all mirrors are still in sync with the main repository . If not , the mirror will be removed automatically until its up-to-date again . All packages older than 6 months will automatically be removed . <p> Offering this great user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of our community and sponsors . <p> Felosity Automatisering for sponsoring a dedicated VPS for both XBian and pilight- and sponsoring a dedicated VPS for image generation.MirrorService for mirroring both our apt repository and downloads , but also offering a fall-back in case our main repository fail . As soon as this happens , we will point apt.xbian.org to MirrorService to keep the downtime as low as possible . @deHakkelaar , a dedicated XBian users that has offered free apt mirroring from the early beginning of XBian . <p> To make XBian even better we of course need constant input from the community . This especially means we need feedback from you about the packages we put in the XBian apt staging repository . These packages contain the latest fixes and features , and are generally stable , but need testing . Let us know if these packages work for you so we can move them to stable . And as soon as new packages enter stable , the XBian images will also be updated with the latest versions . <p> To offer apt mirrors close to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt mirroring . <p> And as usual , we all do this for free and we do not get paid for any of our work . But we would like to ask you for any donation to help us make XBian even better , to help us cover the cost of our servers , web host and hardware for our developers . Every donation is highly appreciated , no matter how big or small . <p> Thank you <p> XBian Team <p> Comments are closed . <h> Donate <p> XBian is a free product and will remain so forever . However , if you like to donate , please feel free to do so . All money we receive is used to support the project and to keep it up and running . With this money we can cover the server costs and invest in further development . Thank you 
@@44048138 @4048138/ <p> So , I 'm not sure if this is XBMCTorrent 's problem or XBian 's , but it seems to me if the title is provided in the metadata of a video file , auto-retrieval of the subtitles should run if both defaults for movie and TV show subtitle providers have been set . Currently , only videos in the library gets auto-retrieval of subtitles for me , and not a torrent video stream . Was this by design ? I get that I could be playing any home video , but that probably wo n't return any results anyway . <p> for sure subtitles fetch ( when triggered manually during video playing from xbmctorrent ) works normally , like on any other video played . <p> for the auto triggered download - maybe xbmctorrent is not starting the proper XBMC notification ( as normal playback is ) . but that should be traceable from debug log. turn it on and try . look yourself in log , or post it .

So , from the start I want to use Xbian with couchpotato , sickbeard and transmission ( or rtorrent ) . I tried installing it from packages , but it couldnt run with xbmc and did n't autostart . So i flashed my SD Card with Xbian 1beta2 ( windows installer ) once more , and started from the start . Next i used tutorial from:http : **34;324;TOOLONG So after flashing my new xbian i logged on SSH as root and : sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y -o Dpkg : : Options : : = " --force-confdef " -o Dpkg : : Options : : = " --force-confold " xbian-package-download installed correctly but also had problems with running those services all at the time ( I disabled autostart for nzbget and headphones cause I do n't use them ) So i tried sudo apt-get upgarde then my usb keybord stopped working and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transmission and sickbeard at a time . Is there any chance to get them working properly ? I 'll use TL-WN725N wifi dongle . <p> Ok , so when i rebooted my xbian . CouchPotato and Sickbeard had Autostart ON , but they were stopped . I could'nt start them through SSH , but could throuhg XBMC Xbian Config on my tvscreen , after starting them , the xbmc was not responsive . And as i said after installing them from package and typing apt-get upgrade my USB was not working at all . <p> which command did you use in the shell ? I have NZBGet and SickBeard running too on my XBian setup and everything works fine ( including autostart ) . I can easily restart sickbeard/nzbget with the following command <p> Terminal <p> sudo service sickbeard restart <p> you can also stop/start the service by using this word instead of " restart " at the end . <p> how long did you wait after booting up XBian ? SickBeard and CouchPotato can take some time to load up because it checks your whole database and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startup is to ssh into your Pi . then fire up xbian-config from the command line . Head over to services and look if your services are running if you are unsure . then wait some time and try to connect to the webinterfaces. ( make sure you use the right address in your browser http : //IPOFYOURXBIAN:PORT ) <p> Hi , I started from the start and now firstly upgardaded xbian , then install package . And installed Par3 Download package Next i switched off autostart for NZBget and Headphones . CouchPotato and Transmission seemed ok , but Sickbeard is crashing or something after some time and i need to restart it to get it working once again . And also transmission speed is pretty low its between 200-1600kB/s <p> I 'm getting around 1700kbps in NZBGet with SSL encryption turned on . I 'm using it behind a powerline adapter anyways .. but let 's be honest . for a quiet little box at this price point it 's not bad at all . I 'm actually pretty impressed that I can have SB , NZBGet and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV through XBMC because it does n't need much energy you can also leave it on in the night to download without having to worry about the bill or the environment <p> It 's not such a weak processor here I had tomatoUSB firmware on my WNR3500Lv2 router , I installed rtorrent+rutorrent ( specs of routere 480Mhz , 128MB ram ) , and without any problems I was downloading 30 torrents at a time with max speed . I think rtorrent is much lighter than transmission but hava a lot of depandancies if you want to use rutorrent . <p> I was just pointing to global picture - cpu pushed on the limit with encryption , then writing to usb storage at the same time ( and considering that usb here is not usb , but again cpu is managing all the data streams - and we know there is dramatic issue on RPI with USBs ) . <p> but I would surprised if 3500L would be faster there . I remember when I had WL500 asus , later linksys with quite fast CPU . but the problem always was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable speeds . impossible . solution is to put it directly as it is downloading to network storage . but if you have such device 24/7 , why bother with those slow devices like routers or pocket players ( sorry , pocket PCs ) . <p> Hi , It 's because I want to use couchpotato and sickbeard , but it 's too much for him . BTW . I managed to get rtorrent with rutorrent running on xbian , using webserver package , But to start it i need to go to /usr/bin and run rtorrent . But do n't know how to make it autostart , and how to make priorities likie in V3 AIO download package . Can someone point me where can I found those information ? After I finish all this I can make a guide how to start rtorrent with rutorrent on our devices , I think It 'll be much lighter than transmission so let 's hope it 's true . Ok so I made my guide to rtorrent on what i have done till LONG ... <p> for starting you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly there you can nice the process . binary itself can be started with " ionice " command which is also setting io niceness.

@@44048153 @4048153/ <p> despite the offset -lz4 package version is still matching the last kernel posted to devel repo . although the original patches are old and were developed for 2. xx kernels , it was possible to rebase it to actual kernels . <p> it is running for me with no issues for 48h , so I do n't expect issues there . just one thing to consider before installing and changing " compress=lzo " to " compress=lz4 " . <p> it will " mark " the filesystem with additional " feature flag " making it impossible to mount the volume on kernel without this patch - that means RPI is fine , problem would be moving the SD card to another linux with BTRFS with expectation to mount it ( after patching the kernel no problem again - tried with ubuntu-saucy kernel 3.10.11.62 - patch is at xbian-patches repo , in kernel directory ) . <p> awaiting some reports as I would really consider making this as default . <p> I expect the actual LZ4 implementation being a bit old , maybe it would be possible to match it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have ( and do n't plan benchs as general ones are as always on google ) but lz4 was highly demanded few years back by zfs community and running apt-get install on XBian reminds more to ext4 times again . <p> speaking general facts , compress ratio is not suffering much ( although our target was more " bandwidth " related than space saving ) , resource allocation goes minimal ( lz4 by default works with minimal buffers - it works only with 8K internal buffer ! ) and decompression speed is more comparable to flat reading than the usual decompression speeds . <p> ( when I cloned LZO -&gt; LZ4 , rootfs occupancy changed from 1.5GB to 1.6GB , cloning time was 3/4 , Gotham loads 2s faster , apt-get update is 28s vs 34s. so no revolution but definitely evolution for free . and RPI is more responsive if fully loaded by disk operations ) . <p> most importantly the patches to btrfs are really non-invasive to btrfs itself , it is clean add-on , not rewrite . <p> and as I wanted to try to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Linus 's tree . so maybe the patch at the end will be really minimal . will look at it right now . from total 18K patch , 17K is lz4compress and lz4decompress function . the rest 1K is just . h LZ4 defs and new BTRFS flag.https : //code.google.com/p/lz4/ <p> Just a curiousity , but would n't it be better to turn off compression for certain paths ? For instance , **37;360;TOOLONG and /var/cache/apt/archives contain almost exclusively compressed data and compression at btrfs level will in that case only add overhead/latency . <p> 1 ) there is somewhere my post answering some discussions about btrfs &amp; ext4 &amp; fs2 &amp; any other actual fs. - majority of user ( even myself ) is not able to " feel " difference there in daily usage ( for anyone willing to try just re-clone XBian with xbian-config by specifying filesystem type in front of block device name - for instance : fs2 : /dev/sda2 will clone to sda2 and use fs2 filesystem , ext4 : /dev/sda2 will use ext4 - XBian is completely universal in system setting files - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> 2 ) Curly just still consider that lz4 is effective for newly written data only . if you do n't re-clone by using lz4 as compression at destination , all the data currently being read are stored with lzo compression . - if you have enough free space you can just use btrfs send receive to another snap/subvolume like this <p> and then rename /@ and /@newlz4 or just boot from @newlz4. but you know that drills . <p> @Curly there is one more optimisation which was introduced to btrfs , it 's called tinymetadata. metadata are stored into 2x ( 3x ? ) smaller blocks what is speeding up metadata operations specially on " recursive " CoW operations ( which are almost all in case snapshots are present - and taking my words to the extreme - altering a file property can theoretically end up with writing lots of MB of data ) . <p> I made the tiny metadata as default when creating new clones ( lz4 not yet as the kernel was n't made public ) . <p> @Smultie once again to avoid later confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are scenarios you will see a difference . for instance apt-get installing 10 packages . <p> @all in case you will try to re-clone to clean lz4 XBian copy , it is needed to manually edit **29;399;TOOLONG line #603 and change " lzo " to " lz4 " . in next issue of **26;430;TOOLONG autodetection for lz4 support will be already present . <p> @#@all last info - in case someone is using " btrfs-tools " for any kind of low level filesystem operations ( btrfstune , btrfscheck etc ) , there is " btrfs-tools-xbian3 " in devel repo . it was needed to patch the tools for recognising new feature flags on filesystem. anyhow for standard use ( running XBian or even cloning it is not needed ) . @narotic <p> yes , definitely you are right . unfortunately btrfs until today does n't support some " flags " per subvolume. compression is one of them . although this is planned for introduction - maybe kernel 3.14 . <p> there is a possibility to use " chattr " and flag " +c " , but in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn compression off for filesystem in general and set +c for files ( subdirs ) we allow to compress . the other way around would be preferred in my case as it is in case of +C ( nocow which is used already on **36;458;TOOLONG ) . <p> but at least all those flags are inherited so we can consider one-time manual . img preparation with cp or rsync by creating the toplevel hierarchy first and flagging them as needed . <p> on the other hand I 'm not sure if benefits will outbalance the time spent - generally individual non-compresable files are not causing measurable difference ( or even /var/cache/apt/archives ) . until files are read &amp; written always with their full content , we are fine . real troubles are caused by small block read &amp; writes with SEEK inside one file . and this is again . /Databases. as for instance to get 4k DB data ( could be one row from DB ) , filesystem needs to read &amp; decompress for instance 128K or even 256K. later , on write of changed 4k back , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recompressed as 256K and written again as 256K. ( ( + imagine here CoW nature where on a write all complementary data needs to be rewritten to new area before it is considered as written &amp; commited ) ) . <p> so yes , let 's say there are some areas worth looking at , but most important message again . we do discuss here less than 10 ( maybe 5 ) % of total operations . overall " BIG PICTURE " looks and feels as always differently . <p> ---- I suppose if someone will take the time and effort in that areas - it will be welcomed and merged . <p> I have a question regarding mounting of btrfs filesystem with lz4 compression . <p> I 'm running Xbian RC2 Gotham on the RPi B+ . Connected to this is a 2TB USB drive . I cloned to USB according to LONG ... and afterwards moved my content over to this USB via a Samba share . Now I wanted to have a faster way to copy stuff around this USB drive and my PC ( moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linux Mint 17 and hoped I could just mount the USB there and copy stuff from/to other drives directly . Unfortunately I ca n't get Linux Mint to mount the USB drive . <p> From what I could see the cloning via xbian-config is creating a btrfs file system with lz4 compression by default . I basically used : mount -t btrfs -o subvol=root/@ /dev/sde1 /mnt <p> and the first error disappeared . However , I could n't get the second error to disappear ( I also tried all the other -o options I could see Xbian using for the mount ) . I then saw that Xbian uses a newer Kernel and btrfs version than what comes with Linux Mint v2 . I updated the Kernel on Linux to a 3.16 . X and also updated the version for btrfs ( now also on 3.16 ) . I also added zswap.enabled=1 zswap.compressor=lz4 to the grub config . The error is still there . btrfs check or any of the other btrfs tools wo n't work , because they ca n't receive an option to use lz4 compression . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think the filesystem is broken . Any other advice on how I can mount the drive under Linux Mint and avoid the " btrfs : openctree failed " error ?

It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows and when they are posted it downloads them , sorts and renames them , and optionally generates metadata for them . <p> CouchPotato For automating your movies downloads . <p> Quote:CouchPotato ( CP ) is an automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies I want " -list and it will search for NZBs/torrents of these movies every X hours . Once a movie is found , it will send it to NZBGet or download the torrent to a specified directory . <p> Headphones For automating your music downloads . <p> Quote:Headphones is an automated NZB downloader , similar to Sick Beard and CouchPotato , but for music ! Most of it is pretty automated - click a button and your whole music library gets imported .... or if you prefer , you can add your favorite artists in one by one .

So you can watch a movie without stutter while your downloaders and searchers are still running . <p> Fixed auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update to the latest version on github . Due to wrong permissions this did not work , it is fixed now so these will be updated automatically ( if enabled by you of course ) . <p> This installation guide is based on installing via SSH commandline ( How to connect via SSH ) . If you are running Beta1 you can also install this with xbian-config in SSH or XBMC . <p> Upgrading from previous package You can skip this part and continue at step 1 if you have n't used/installed the download package before or have completely removed it . You can upgrade from the previous download package but it is not guaranteed to work in all cases . You can always try upgrading and if it does not work do a clean install . If you decide to upgrade , I would recommend to backup settings files and database files . <p> Some remarks on upgrading for specific packages : <p> NZBGet Unpacking of rar files is now an included feature , so the old post-process script wo n't be required anymore . After upgrading , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interface ( x.x.x.x.:9092 ) , navigate to settings and press the button ' save all changes ' and then reload NZBget . This will upgrade some settings that were not in previous versions . <p> Sick Beard The database from the previous Sick Beard can not be used in this newest version , due to the fact this is ThePirateBay edition . So you will have to import your tvshows all over again , this is not a lot of work for you but the Raspberry Pi will need some time for this . <p> CouchPotato The database from the previous version will be re used . The database will be migrated to the new version , I ca n't guarantee this to work always . If this fails you will have to re add your movies and wanted list manually . You will have to stop couchpotato and remove the . db files from the folder /etc/couchpotato/ , then start it again . <p> After upgrading it is recommended to manually check your settings per package . It is known that some settings reset to default . Also give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue configuring . <p> Installation step 1 : Preparation <p> Run an apt-get update to make sure you 'll get the latest available packages : <p> Code : <p> sudo apt-get update <p> Optional 7z installation For most users this wo n't be necessary to install . If it turns out you need it anyway , you can always install it afterward . If you download from newsservers 99% will be packed in rar archives . Therefore unrar-nonfree is automatically installed if you install the download package . However in some rare occasions it might be packed in a 7z archive . To extract these you will need 7zip , you can install it simple with the following command : <p> Code : <p> sudo apt-get install p7zip-full <p> XBian &lt;=Alpha5 only If you are installing this on beta1 or higher you can skip this part and continue with step 2 . For alpha5 this is optional but strongly recommended . It will allow you to run the download package and watch movies at the same time . <p> Add this line **28;525;TOOLONG = 0 ' ( without the quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edit this file with a text editor , for instance nano : <p> Code : <p> sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf <p> After you have made these changes reboot your system .

CouchPotato has actually a wizard that can be accessed on : <p> Code : <p> CouchPotato : http : //x.x.x.x:9095/wizard <p> Now you are finished and you can start adding movies , tvshows and music .

Anyway it would of course be great if it would come in an XBian package so people can have some choice . <p> Normally you should have 3 quality profiles after installing . Sometimes this can fail on a fresh install , this is an unsolved issue of the original CouchPotato package . It can be solved by stopping couchpotato , removing the db file from /etc/couchpotato , and starting couchpotato again . This will remove your database ! <p> I have another problem with CP , but I am not sure if it 's due to the package or CP .

In this case CP did not download any subtitles at all . <p> Hi Fred . Thanks for the great work ! I 've been using the previous download package for some time now . All good .

@@44048164 @4048164/ <p> One of the things I loved with XBMC when I ran it " back in the day " on my Xbox were the included Milkdrop visualizations . Years go by and I 'm now using RPis for media players around the house . I 've really enjoyed the simplicity that goes into setting up a new XBian install but was disappointed that there were only two visualizations to choose from . The question of " why ? " has come up and the answers one would find tended to be lacking CPU/GPU/memory or no X server . Maybe that was true for the original RPi series , but now that I 've got a collection of three RPi2s around the house I thought I 'd investigate again . <p> And I 've found some ! <p> Over in the OSMC forums , user popcornmix has created a collection of Shadertoy based screensaver and audio visualizations . Have n't tried the screensaver(s) yet but I did play around with the audio visualizations and am happy to have more variety available . Now , these are not without problems ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the waveform <p> some presets do n't work , or at least I have n't been able to get them to work <p> the lone " randomize " setting does n't seem to work ( may be related to next item ) <p> changing presets has a problem and is thus more complicated than it needs to be ( see steps later in this post ) <p> Performance is by my standards acceptable for this humble little board , in my tests generally showing 20-30fps @ 1080p with CPU-KODI reporting 35-40% while streaming 32kbps over WiFi . I would suspect that these would choke a prior gen RPi . The selection of visualizations is n't as extensive as the Milkdrop/projectM collections but it is a welcome addition to have in XBian . <p> So , installation . These are the steps I used but depending on how your install is set up you may be able to go about the first few steps differently . <p> Either transfer the zip to your XBian system or place it somewhere that your system can reach it ( I used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kodi go to System/Settings/Add-ons and select " Install from zip file " <p> Browse to and select the zip file downloaded earlier to have that repository added <p> Browse into " Install from repository " , then into the new " Popcornmix Add-ons " , " visualisation " , and install the Shadertoy visualization ( optionally , install the screensaver ) <p> Shadertoy is now available for selection in the visualizations , and since it is installed from a repository it should ( by my understanding ) also be eligible for automated updating ! <p> Now , the trick about changing your preset once you have Shadertoy running ... <p> Bring up the preset selection and select your desired preset <p> Back out of the preset menu <p> Stop the audio playback <p> Restart the audio playback <p> I 'm not sure why this is necessary but through experimentation I found these to be reliable steps to change the preset .

@@44048166 @4048166/ <p> Situation : ----------- I have a setup where I 'm trying to use both eth0 and wlan0 network interfaces . - eth0 ( 192.168.1.15 ) will be used for xbmc and has internet connection via router 192.168.1.1 - wlan0 ( 192.168.2.10 ) will be used for something else , has no internet connection via 192.168.2.1 Both interfaces can ping to their individual routers , so far so good , on a network level everything seems to be ok . <p> Now the problem . -------------------- Once wlan0 is enabled , xbmc ' automatically ' selects wlan0 as the interface to be used as some sort of default behavour . What I want is to use eth0 for xbmc regardless of whatever happens to wlan0 . If I bring wlan0 down using ifdown , xbmc switches back to using eth0 which is what I want , but it also means I can not use wlan0 anymore . If I enable wlan0 using ifup , xbmc switches back to using wlan0 interface . <p> Questions : ------------ - how can I force xbmc to always use eth0 ( while wlan0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it also happens at boot time ? <p> this is for sure XBMCs internal " intelligence " ... ( and even probably useful on stupid systems ) . I see few options how to avoid that : - patch the code , should not be that difficult to find the relevant line of code and disable the logic - try reverse order of activating the interfaces - could be that the logic of XBMC is the easiest one - THE LAST activated interface is considered the correct/actual ... that means put eth0 into manual , let RPI + XBMC boot with wlan0 , activate eth0 only after manually . maybe I 'm right and you have solution - use OWNER iptable matching module . <p> linux 's network stack allows you to use so called SOURCE routing , that means routing traffic based on SOURCE conditions , not destination . that is easy to setup , but by default designed to work with IPs ( from which the pkts are originating ) . so you will use OWNER matching module which allows you TAG pakets based on process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match target for uid xbian ( or even PID of running XBMC ) , mark it and route with source routing conditions via eth0 . <p> it should be like 2-3 lines of commands , google is your friend . <p> decide , check the 2 ) , tell back . if you would consider the 3 ) too complicated , ask again - as last resort I can open the man pages and tell you the commands . <p> I have tried option 2 before with no succes , but this evening I tried again . But it 's giving me the same result . xbmc shows wlan0 as the active interface . A bit strange however is that it shows the DNS settings of eth0 ( ! ? ! ) . But I am pretty sure it uses wlan0 ; it does not show the correct time on the screen as it does not have internet connection via wlan0 and also any other network service fails . <p> Option 1 is something that should work , but I have never compiled xbmc before and the setback is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very eager to do this time after time again . <p> I have never heared of option 3 . With a bit of google-ing I found out that you might run into security issues and also I would like to keep things as standard as possible . <p> In the end it 's a bit of a design issue of xbmc . I do n't understand that there is a nice xbian-config gui and xbian-config command line interface that shows your network interfaces , but does not let you select which interface you want to use and instead uses ' smart ' logic which ends up in using wlan0 . But I guess that 's the way it is now . <p> Maybe I should buy another RPi and use the one I currently have dedicated for xbmc ( on eth0 ) and use the new one for all the other stuff ( on wlan0 ) . <p> But if anyone found an easy way to get my problem solved , please let me know . <p> I have never reported back on my workaround that seems to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help someone else with a similar problem . <p> 1 . Via Xbian-config menu I have disabled starting Kodi at boot time <p> 2 . I created a script ( startkodi ) that automatically runs at boot time and placed it in the xbian home directory executing following commands:sudo ifdown eth0 sudo ifup eth0 sudo service xbmc start Now I am sure that the eth0 interface starts after wlan0 ( and kodi is following shortly ) <p> 3 . I created the rc.local script that fires startkodi script using following content : # ! /bin/sh -e " on success or any other # value on error . # # In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution # bits . # # By default this script does nothing . /home/xbian/startkodi exit 0 <p> Thanks for the response , but my problem was a bit different I guess , because I am running Kodi on eth0 , so basically I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kodi . However Kodi seems to always choose the last interface that 's activated . I also noticed that sometimes it loses settings of the eth0 interface and uses the settings of the wlan0 instead ( gateway configuration ) which makes no sense . But my workaround seems to be working most of the times ...

@@44048177 @4048177/ <p> I use my RPi2 as a network drive to access music/movies and save backups via SMB . Since the Rpi2 with 100Mbit-Lan and USB2 speed is very limited , for me therefore counts every bit/s . With Raspbian and other distributions i always get a network speed of about 11-12MB/s(read/write) over SMB , with xbian however only 8-9MB/s(read) and 4-5MB/s(write) . Because as i said for me every bit/s counts , i wanted to switch to a Gbit-lan adapter . Since everything runs over a single USB controller , i expected no huge speedup , but with Raspbian or OSMC i reach a speed of 16MB/s(read) and 12-13MB/s(write) over SMB with the Adapter . With Xbian unfortunately i get again only asignificantly lower speed of 12MB/s(read) and 6-7MB/s(write) : LONG ... LONG ... -i testet the Speed with a fresh isntalled Xbian on a sandisk ultra 32GB SD Card . -The values in the test are based on the informations of the Windows Explorer when reading and writing a 2Gb large ISO file ( film ) on the external HDD ( ntfs ) -With my USB stick ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio are the same . -Is noticeable that with xbian at the start sometimes the reading speeds is as high as with OSMC ( 12MB/s ) but after a while it breaks down to 8MB/s ( like you cann see at the picture of Xian-write-100Mbit ) -same result with overclocking to 1100 Mhz <p> My question is now , does someone knows what the lower speeds with Xbian lie and is there a possibility to increase the network speed ? ( At least the same speed as with Raspbian or OSMC should be possible i think ? ) <p> Getting always read/write speed of 11.2MB/s +/- 0.3MB/s , but I do not have Windows for testing , samba share was mounted by my Cubieboard2 ( 1GHz dualcore ARM v7 powered ) home server ( 100MBit/s network ) . Tested ext4 and ntfs fs , ntfs is a bit slower than ext4 , but only marginal . <p> So my question , how do you mount your external disk ? <p> Make sure that you do not use sync and use bigwrites option when mounting external drive . <p> If bigwrites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ntfs , so this option is really necessary <p> i didn-t mount it by myself , i put it on the USB port an it works . ( In the Xbian setting automount is activated ( by default ) and my only change was to anable " shares schuld be world writeable " ) <p> But it semme you are on the right way , after i disable the " mount with sync option " at " XBian - XBMC - USB - plug&amp;play " , the writespeed goes up to 8-9MB/s ( before 4-5MB/s ) and is now on the same level as readspeed But i can-t find any option to enable bigwrites , can you tell me how i can enable this option ? <p> i-ve checked the file **27;707;TOOLONG , and as you say bigwrites option is enabled for ntfs . So this does not seem to be my problem with the lower networkspeed , i now got 8-9MB/s for read/write .

The ram usage is the same around 77/148 MB whatever I put in those settings . <p> I watch a stream at 1.3 Mbit/s and the download speed when I watch it on my router is around this . I wonder which part of software is responsible for this ( XBMC or Amazon plugin ) . My Kindle Fire seems to download the movie at maximum speed ( 3-4 mbits/s ) so there is no hiccup . <p> Setting cache to zero supposedly changes the cache to disk only but reading further posts put this to doubt .

@@44048180 @4048180/ <p> Just to make this clear for anyone reading this thread , following Nachteuel 's instructions do work and solved the problem for me . You can auto-mount exFAT formatted drives . Peiote made a typing error which seems to have caused his whole system not to startup ( so be careful what you type ! ) . <p> In a nutshell : <p> Terminal <p> sudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse <p> You will probably be told they 're already installed an up to date , this is just to make sure they 're there . <p> Terminal <p> sudo vi /etc/modules <p> Or whatever editor you prefer . Add just one word to the bottom , if it is not already there , on a line on its own : fuse Then save and exit the file . It should look like this : <p> Terminal <p> # /etc/modules : kernel modules to load at boot time . # # This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded # at boot time , one per line . Lines beginning with " # " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to load the fuse module into the kernel at startup . Reboot your system . Your exFAT drive should now auto-mount . Peiote wrote " modprobe fuse " not just " fuse " . <p> Why might you want to use exFAT ? If you require the Holy Grail of a USB drive that can : go between Windows , Mac and Linux ; is read and write on all those systems ; can handle files bigger than 4Gig ; and requires no 3rd party software to be installed , then exFAT is for you ! If you do n't have such requirements , then NTFS ( read only on a Mac ) , or HFS+ ( unreadable on Windows ) , or ext3 or ext4 ( unreadable on Windows or Mac ) , or just plain old FAT32 ( read and writeable on Macs and Windows but limited to 4Gig file size which starts to become a problem with HD video files ) may be easier for you . <p> Another consideration for using exFAT is that it was designed with SD cards in mind . exFAT does less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no journaling etc ) so the SD card can last longer . <p> There are only 10 types of people in the world : those who understand binary , and those who do n't <p> With kernel build tonight exfat driver is now available as kernel module . That means , fuse module is not needed anymore and mounting of exfat formatted hdd 's works now out of the box for all future image builds . <p> Unfortunately , if package exfat-fuse is installed ( that 's the case for all existing installations ) , this package has to be removed manually to make kernel module work .

@@44048186 @4048186/ <p> I love the Xbian back up feature as it backs up all my settings , add-ons , and metadata . However , I think it 's not going to be helpful in case of an SD card corruption because the backed up data is saved on the SD card . That defeats the purpose of a back-up in case of an emergency . So I think you should allow users to choose back-up path and backup frequency . For example , I have my Raspberry Pi connected to my network HDD 's 24/7 . So if you allowed my to choose one of my HDD 's as a backup destination and allow me to have Xbian automatically back up every 24 hours , I would never lose my data as it is saved on both my HDD and my Raspberry Pi . <p> Anyways , this is just a small issue compared to your great software .

The " identity " ( hostname and other stuff ) will be set via krb5 keytab during bootup <p> It is working surprisingly well so far BUT 1 ) Startup is way slower with / mounted ro only .

@@44048199 @4048199/ <p> A few weeks ago I was asked to make little guide on CPU/IO priorities handling . I 'm not an expert in the field so if you find something overly complex or incorrect ( I will surely try to avoid the last ) please tell me ! The idea behind this is fairly simple , have downloads running on background and whenever you must use xbmc make sure that it get 's most of the kernel scheduler attention . I manage to do that by simply altering the process CPU and I/O(Input/Output) priority . <p> Introduction The utilities Nice and Ionice manage the priority of a given process and its hard drive(I/O) priorities respectively . <p> Nice CPU priorities are handled according to a number which defaults to 0 and whose values range from -20 ( Maximum priority ) to 19 ( Minimum priority ) , a few system specific processes default to high priorities . You can see all of this using the top utility : <p> I 'm also running sabnzbd , sickbeard , transmission and couchpotato each with its own user , so you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value is the one called NI . Notice that I give my downloads a low priority ( 10 ) than default ( 0 ) and Xbmc a higher one ( -5 ) . <p> Ionice Harddrive access priority is divided in 3 scheduling classes : <p> -Realtime : Highest priority and subdivided in 8 priority levels with 0 being the highest one . Should be used with care as it can easily make your raspberry pi unresponsive . <p> -Best-effort:This is the default class , it 's also subdivided in 8 levels same as Realtime . The priority level is dynamically adjusted according to the CPU priority ( nice level ) by the following formula : iopriority = ( cpunice + 20 ) / 5 . <p> -Idle : A process under this class only gets disk time when no other higher priority process is using it . <p> Changing startup priority Now , this is how I have set it all up . All download related processes have its priority set up at 10 so that they have a lower priority than default . Thanks to it , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more CPU , for example if I wish to run apt-get update the downloads would throttle down until it finishes . The other way around for Xbmc , I have its priority set up at -5 so that it always has a little higher priority and it does n't stutter if someone is using Xbmc while I 'm running commands on the background . <p> If you want to keep it simple , you could just make Xbmc have a higher priority and leave the downloads at the default one , depending on your case that could prove enough , to do it you must change this file : <p> If that does n't prove enough , lower downloads priority , you should do the same change for each process init script ( sabnzbd , couchpotato , sickbeard , transmission ... ) note that only transmission and sabnzbd are I/O intensive , the other ones rely only on CPU . <p> Well , that 's it ! if somebody knows an easier way just tell it ! This is the easiest I found , although I have done it different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group and I have set that groups default priority to 10 ( modifying **25;1152;TOOLONG ) but it 's a little bit more complicated and the only real advantage is that I can easily change all the priorities . <p> ( 13th May , 2013 11:17 PM ) Fred Wrote : Thanks for this , I 'm already doing something like this but in an other way , but this seems to be a better solution .

@@44048201 @4048201/ <p> Yesterday i stumbled on a message of one of our users about an SD card corruption . This was due to a sudden removal of the power cable . Now and then , i experience the SD card corruption as well . Mostly because i have weeks in which i reboot my RPi like 100+ times to test new features . My idea was to let a script test the state of the SD card before it was mounted as the root partition so we know if we can expect corruption and if so , fix it automatically . <p> I have several ideas for this , but the one i would like to try first , is also the simplest . So , i 'm especially looking for people who experience the SD card corruption a lot ( due to filesystem incosistencies ) , and that like to test something . <p> The idea is simple .

I would like to crank the overclocking up ( for the first time ) and try to help test your new methods but honestly , I do not want to burn through too many cards . If it 's just file systems that get corrupted and not necessarily the actual physical cards , I 'm in ! <p> I can fix my FS most of the times with the rescue kernel . However , only had to do it two or three times . <p> Also , you just have to run the command to enable the ( possible ) fix . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not when the SD breaks . I ca n't guaranty that the SD card does n't break , depends on a lot of factors . <p> Seems to work for me . Usualy my card is corrupted every now and then ( because my girlfriend just turns of the switch ) But I have to admit that I 've ran the command after an update to Alpha5 . So I 'm not sure if Alpha5 or the command cures the issue . <p> hm ... it says last checked 07. february . so the sd card was n't checked since performing the command . I 'm gon na unplug the pi a few times this evening to see if something happens , though I 'm sure it was already unplugged several times since forcing fsck . <p> I got a kernel panic today at startup . It ca n't mount the root partition . So it seems the command does n't really help - unfortunately : - ( Would be a great benefit when these annoying filesystem corruptions could be prevented . Strange thing is that I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XBMC menu and .... booom ... kernel panic - arrrrgh . <p> i had still no corruption after unplugging pi several times . the only thing I could see during startup was something like : checking root file system ... fsck from util-linux 2.20.1 e2fsck 1.42.5 /dev/mmcblk0p2 : clean , 62621/245760 files , 497415/959104 blocks done <p> I 'm note sure if I get this post with fsckfix set to no . But no matter if its fsckfix or alpha5 , I had no corruption since days even though I 've unplugged the pi many times . So either alpha5 or fsckfix works for me

Another one says that it will not work , even with the best power supply , and that a powered USB hub is necessary . In my case ( RPi2 with XBian 20150407-0 ) I have tried to investigate the thing . I have run these commands : <p> I do n't know what the " 2mA " values mean here ( if two Amp+res are being provided by the power supply to the RPi2 or if there are two Amp+res on the USB ports or only that these USB ports can supply up to two Amp+res ) . So is this command output saying that the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added the below shown lines to the config , alternating the hash symbol on two different boots .

So , connecting such a device may work , or not . You always have to try it <p> usbmaxcurrent=1 doubles the current which can be delivered to the USB ports . So if the power supply is good enough and the current consumption is hot higher than the current allowed by the onboard fuse , again , it may work or not . <p> The 2mA value is the maximum current the USB device will consume from the USB port and has nothing to do with the power supply or the max current which can be delivered by the USB port

I have been working the last days in a script that detects when XBMC starts playing stuff and uses the signal SIGSTOP to pause all proceses related to downloads and then , when the video stops playing , it uses the signal SIGCONT to resume them . I have created the following folder /. **38;1631;TOOLONG where I store my script with the addon.xml file , the script is as follows:http : //pastebin.com/VmkqecST <p> I had to call the startall.py and stopall.py with sudo rights because the downloads are managed by other users and xbian user dose n't have the rights to manage them ( I added those files with visudo so that i do n't need a password to execute them with sudo ) . The startall.py and stopall.py are as follows:http : //pastebin.com/aSJnS0Tx <p> What I did to get the PID of each process related to downloads , is to add each user that started that kind of process to a common group " download " so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a member of the group download , same for transmission , couchpotato and sickbeard , they all belong to the group download . I just get the process list of that group of users and then i send a sigstop to each process . <p> The problem with this script is that i ca n't manage to autostart it within xbmc , my addon.xml looks as followshttp : //pastebin.com/H5Tp2hRm I 'm new to python so I 'm not sure if what I 've done is right , the default.py script is a copy paste of things I found around internet . According to what I 've read , the addon.xml will tell XBMC which script to start and when , but it dose n't seem to work . I found information regarding a workaround involving autoexec.py file , which I could n't find . <p> I would really appreciate some help here as I do n't know how to continue or how to debug this process . <p> Thank you very much for your help ! I will make the script print something in order to see it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find any other way of telling the " onPlayBackEnded " function when XBMC was n't playing video , I thought it would work that way , if video is playing funcion " onPlayBackStarted " is called and the While loop keeps VIDEO = 1 until video stops playing , then the whole script get 's executed again . I had to call that python function with os.system because I have to execute it with sudo , and i do n't know how i can do that without executing XBMC as root . In order to execute the python function that closes services with sudo , I configure it with Visudo so i can avoid password input . I 'm going to see if it is actually getting executed . EDIT : It dos n't seem to get executed at startup . Here is the log file:http : //pastebin.com/TdwtfYPD Near line 100 scripts get executed .

Great idea , you are right , making it stopstart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why , but I 'm sure that my script is only activated when I put it in /usr/local/share/xbmc .. when I moved the script folder there it started to work . Will check it later when I arrive home . <p> Thank you ! I have it fully working as I wanted it to . I implemented the scripts to be called upon screensaver startstop and when XBMC gets closed . It seems to be working flawlessly . It seemed I had a mistake in the addon.xml file which I corrected when moving it to /usr/home/share , when I moved it back to /home/xbian as you told it kept working . The final script is:http : //pastebin.com/2mCLmAeB <p> Quote:Saw my script being killed because it was longer than 5 seconds ' inactive ' . Or is that only with boot-scripts/services ? <p> Do n't understand what you mean . Script is ended when it reached end of the script . Thread stay alive after , but in this case ( no thread ) , you have to do a sleep at the end otherwise monitoring will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell , is that you can put more than 5 sec in xbmc.sleep , if you put 1 minute , and xbmc stop is requested , it will go out from xbmc.sleep , even if the minutes was not achieved . not really a big problem in this case to put 3 sec , but if you put 1 minutes or more , there are less loop . <p> Sorry for not posting earlier , I had a problem with the Hard drive used by the Raspberry ( I 'm still fixing it ) . Regarding the script , I set it to 1minute ( 60000 ) and deleted the init function and it worked as you told ! Thank you very much for your help

@@44048224 @4048224/ <p> I 've been having some resolution related problems since adding a Yamaha ysp-2200 soundbar to the output of my RPi ( which is running 1.0a5 ) . Here 's some background info on the problem and what I 've tried so far . <p> The first issue I encountered is that some of the HDMI modes stopped being available after I rebooted the RPi when it froze . After this the following happened : <p> 1 tvservice -e CEA would n't show all modes my TV is capable of ( for example , all 1080 modes disappeared ) 2 . XBian would boot in 480p 3. 1080 modes were not selectable from System -&gt; settings -&gt; video output . The max resolution I could set was 720p. 4. 1080p movies would not play at full resolution ( TV mode was still 720p ) <p> I think the soundbar introduced a problem with the HDMI EDID negotiation so I modified config.txt to load the EDID from a file : <p> Code : <p> These are the actual modes my TV is capable of ( not the reduced list following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then modified config.txt to load this . <p> I can select all of these modes from the System -&gt; Video Output menu now . <p> The problem I have now is that when I set the GUI resolution to 720 ( it was 1080 ) , I can only see the top left-hand corner of the UI ( approx 1/4 of the screen ) . If I change the Video Output to 1280x720p then the UI renders correctly - I can see all of the screen - but , 1080 movies play at 720p . <p> I 'm sure I 've messed up a setting somewhere while trying to fix the HDMI issue but I ca n't work out how to fix this . I 'd like to get back to having the GUI res at 720 but be able to play 1080 content at 1080 . <p> I just fixed the problem by doing the Video calibration the screen . I 've done this before when the borders were out by a bit but it never occurred to me to try it for the problem I had - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I found a couple of options on my TV - Auto Format ( on or off ) Screen Format ( Wide , Zoom or Smart ) <p> I just tried these but they did n't fully to correct the video calibration problem . I 'm not sure what they 're supposed do but perhaps they can only correct the calibration / timing within certain limits . <p> The TV is a Sony KDL40W2000U with a native / panel resolution of 1920x1080 . <p> I do n't know what the soundbar does to the HDMI input it 's not a full-blown AV receiver but it processes audio and acts as an HDMI switch . There are very few configurable options for HDMI video so perhaps it just passes the video through , processes the audio and messes around with EDID a bit . <p> There 's another setting on my TV called Display Area . This has four options Normal , Full Pixel , -1 and -2 . It 's set to Full Pixel now . Changing it in from Full Pixel results in some of the UI borders being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options that change the timing / calibration slightly and I 'm not sure how they relate to each other or what the defaults are ! <p> yes , you should start with disableoverscan=1 as by default and remove all the video calibration you did . Than play with the screen settings in your TV options . Not easy to say what which setting in your TV does exactly as I never had a chance to play with one , but I would definitely give it a try You can even try remove the EDID mod from the config.txt and start by adding just a hdmiforcehotplug=1 and see if that help at all . As you can see there are a lot of options how to do this so definitely not an easy one to say which way you should go . I 'm afraid you just need to try and find the right one for you Please keep us updated with your results and findings -thx- <p> I 've set disableoverscan=1 - I did n't realise this was a default option . <p> The UI and videos are a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top-left and bottom-right arrows and I kept the TV settings as they were ( full pixel , Auto Format=off and Screen Format=Normal ) . These TV settings are good for my SKY+ box too . <p> I do n't understand how the calibration was so far off but I 'd been changing the Video settings in XBian and config.txt a lot because of the EDID problem , restarting a lot and had some unavoidable non-clean shutdowns . I recall needing to change the calibration before but I ca n't remember why and have done quite a lot of messing around with different settings since then ! <p> Regarding the EDID mod , I did try hdmiforcehotplug=1 before configuring EDID from a file but did n't have any luck with that . It seems that the YSP soundbar gets into a state where it will only report a limited set of EDID settings . When it 's in this state , plugging the Pi into the TV directly , rebooting and doing tvservice -m CEA shows the full list . Whereas plugging it into the soundbar and rebooting shows a different set with no 1080 settings .

I used the most recent release on an RPi v2 and have it configured exactly how I want it - plug it in , it boots into XBMC , shuffles the videos in a playlist and loops them continuously with no interaction needed . It 's completely self-contained and everything is on the SD card . <p> Our store manager and I hit on the idea at the exact same time that if you could somehow clone that SD card with everything on it and ready to go , then you could have an identical kiosk in every store in the chain . Unfortunately , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen flat .

@@44048233 @4048233/ <p> I 've just installed a fresh XBian 1.0 alpha 4 , with my TV connected over HDMI . The default config.sys appears to disable overscan , but I still have it present on boot .

I 'm considering just copying the FAT partition contents from the working setup , but was n't sure if the XBian files included specific settings . <p> I had a bit of a hack , and found that using start.elf from Raspbmc and everything else from XBian gave the correct ( lack of ) overscan on the earliest kernel boot display . Though it ran into trouble later during bootup . Using almost all the Raspbmc boot binaries got further , but still gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the original XBian files , I tried forcing CEA resolutions in config.txt but the overscan was still bad . Though an accidental hdmigroup=2 gave me 640x480 , and overscan was correct there . The only trouble was that XBMC was also stuck at that resolution , with no other video modes available for selection . <p> I guess I need to learn a bit more about the boot file difference between the two distros . I also do n't understand why a seemingly successful boot would give a black screen on starting XBMC ( a known issue with earlier builds I believe ? ) . <p> It could also be a quirk with my TV ( Panasonic TH-37PX80B ) , but it seems odd it 's only XBian affected . <p> Probably because we use the very latest firmware and kernel versions possible . So , when it comes to those files , it mostly are issues caused by the Raspberry Pi foundation , so you need to file your issues there as well . Not much we can do . <p> just out of con a bit I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overscan or any other extra video settings as all works out of box Have you tried on your TV to force 16:9 aspect mode ?

However I notice that when running in 720p mode on my Sony Bravia , the on-screen display elements such as audio volume and the control buttons at the bottom of the screen , display partially beyond the visible part of the screen . I suspect this is what most people refer to as overscan but at the same time I think a lot of people may use the term incorrectly . <p> Anyway , I suspect this issue may be more related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playback to display <p> This setting enables syncing the video to the refresh rate of the monitor . <p> and/or <p> Quote : <p> Adjust display refresh rate to match video <p> Defines when the refresh rate adjustments should take place . <p> Although the term " refresh rate " is used , I strongly suspect this actually refers to display mode or resolution , colour depth AND refresh rate . My suspicions are based on watching smaller resolution video and having the monitor drop into 720p mode ( which the Bravia helpfully informs the user it is doing this by an OSD message that I suspect other displays do n't show you ) . Then when I play higher resolution video , or the low-res video stops and the XBMC screens appear again , the display switches back to 1080p mode . <p> Do you have the same symptoms ? <p> I 'd like to test this theory of mine through the tvservice utility and I 'll add some instructions in here on how to do that if anyone is interested . <p> We ca n't influence what setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they work , that 's determined by the Raspberry Pi firmware . However , that does not mean we do n't use and/or set the settings . <p> I do use the " Adjust display refresh rate to match video " option , and find it does switch from the 720p UI to 1080p video as required . That was a relief as my TV panel is 720p but for some reason only supports 24Hz with a 1080p input . <p> I 'd be surprised if the Wide setting makes a difference , as I 'm using it fine with other Pi distros . It 's easy to check though , so worth a go . As it happens I did have a look through the other TV settings for mentions of overscan , as I think the 42 " model has additional options controlling SD/HD content . I could n't find anything controlling it on mine though . <p> I can probably manage for now using the video adjustment to fix the overscan within XBMC . Though I would still like to get to the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after exiting XBMC " I 'm currently missing a text row from top/bottom , and 4 characters left/right , which makes editing on the device a bit awkward . I can ssh in , but it either means doing it on my phone or going upstairs to my PC . <p> It does look like it 's a firmware issue , so I 'll see if I can narrow down the revision it was introduced to report it .

I noticed that copying files from the disk connected to to Pi to my laptop or other device , over the network could take hours , specially if it was a HD movie , for example , so I installed a network speed monitor ( Readerror 's NetMeter , to be precise ) on my laptop and stared to copy a large file from the Pi to the laptop . Noticed that it started copying at a rate around 5MB/s for a few seconds and then dropped to 0 for a few second as well , and then back to 5MB/s and so on ... So basically it takes so long to copy a file because most of the time , it 's actually not copying anything . <p> Ran the top command on the pi , and compared what was happening on both ends . When it was copying at 5MB/s , the smbd process in the pi was consuming around 70% of the CPU . When the transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU in the Pi was over 90% . <p> So , i think it 's safe to assume I have a bottleneck accessing the USB drive . Why can that be ? How can I overcome this ? <p> Would appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction . <p> Thanks ! Oh ... Just remembered that the USB drive is connected to the Pi through a Powered USB Hub . And apparently the HUB is the problem on my setup . <p> Tried connecting the hard drive directly to the Pi and copy the file again and everything seemed to work just fine . <p> So , the question that remains is : is this bound to happen with any USB hub or do I have a faulty one ? If the problem is with mine , would you recommend any in particular ? Is the PIHUB any good ? <p> Well , guess a faulty USB Hub was in fact the problem . Tried with a different one I had laying around , even though it was not powered so I had to power my hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything worked fine . No huge IO-Wait any more ... <p> Would still like to hear your opinions on the PIHub or other powered hubs , but I guess that may be a discussion for another thread . <p> Anyway , the problem is solved and so the post was a bit useless . Sorry about that , but only remembered that the problem could be from the USB hub after posting it . It may help someone facing a similar problem though .

@@44048247 @4048247/ <p> After reading a thread on XDA about symlinking /dev/random to /dev/urandom and playing with the kernels read/writewakethreshold values on Android devices I thought I 'd try it on the Pi . There 's a debate going in the XDA thread and on ASOP that it 's just a placebo but hundreds of users have noticed a significant performance difference on their phones and Android kernel maintainers have begun to integrate the changes . <p> /dev/random generates entropy from numerous sources in the real-wrodl environment , e.g. keyboard strokes , mouse movement , touch screen swipes , and even sound via the microphone . With the Pi none of this happens as none of these devices are connected ( for me anyway ) so entropy generation is a little limited . You can check your current level with <p> Code : <p> cat **36;2084;TOOLONG <p> - it will probably be around 128 - 192 . The issue with /dev/random is that its blocking , so if you request 256 bits of entropy but the kernel only has 150 then the kernel will block your code until the extra bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> /dev/urandom is non-blocking so it wo n't hold your application , it will just keep generating entropy and thus faster responding apps . <p> NOTE : /dev/urandom is " less secure " then /dev/random ( Google it for an explanation ) - this does n't bother me . <p> Using XBMC I 've noticed a slight speed difference in just browsing through the menus , e.g. the " Settings " screen loads faster . fgrep-ing my way through the source code /dev/random is only used a few times within the XBMC code , one of ffmpegs libraries and libenca ( used for text encoding ) so it should n't make a difference . I know its used throughout the kernel and many other applications/libraries ( e.g Couch Potato ) , SMB , anything to do with SSL , SSH , etc . <p> I 'd be interested to see if anybody experiences any performance increases after doing this and its not just a placebo ? To revert this just stop the rng-tools daemon , restore the /dev/random.org file and set the read/write thresholds back to 64 and 128 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reboot , add them to /etc/sysctl.conf .

@@44048250 @4048250/ <p> Hey there , I recently got into raspberry . My first raspberry device is a Pi 2 . After some blood sweat and tears I managed to set it up asa NAS , Torrent Client and Web Server . Very happy with it . <p> Then , I discovered whole media center stuff . Bought another Pi 2 and set it up with OpenElec(do n't hate . I was n't even aware of xbian then ) . Spent a few nights on it , and manged to make it work just the way I wanted .... Except for one tiny , yet extremely frustrating problem ... <p> I live in an apartment and usually watch movies at night . So I ca n't just blast the sound from my TV . I figured i 'd try my bluetooth headset . Did n't work . From what I understand A2DP profile has n't made its way to Kodi just yet ( which is strange considering 10 years old Nokias has it ) . So without much hope , I pluged my Logitech G930 ( USB wireless gaming headset ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded a movie and started watching . 5 minutes in I noticed popping/cracking sounds . I 'm not stranger to this phenomenon . I experienced same thing with this headset before on windows ( logitech fixed it with a driver update ) . I fiddled with every setting on OpenElec ( network buffer , sampling rate , channel number etc ) Nothing helped . <p> After two days , I decided to experiment with other OSes . First I tried OSMC which look cool as f**k , but riddled with bugs ( not surprising , considering it 's still early beta ) . Anyway , popping sound was there . So I decided ( without much hope ) to check what other OSes were out there . <p> Long story short , I found xbian . No popping . Audio is crystal clear . So I decided to stay with xbian . Problem is , from my personal experience , xbian is at least as buggy as OSMC . As of right now ; youtube , flixanity or any other addon that streams video over the net does n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem ) . Pi restarts on it 's own , UI is choppy , getting frequent crashes , video player stops playing movie on it 's own and crashes to home screen etc ... All in all , not having a great time with xbian ... <p> So my questions are : 1 ) Does xbian has a stable release ? I 've found mentions of Xbian v 1.0 stable . But could n't find links to it . Also considering currently we are at v14 , is v1.0 an ancient release ? <p> 2 ) What 's the difference between xbian and all the other Kodi OSes ? I think it might have something to do with Pulse Audio ( which Open Elec uses ) and Alsa ( which xbian uses ? ) If that is really the only difference , is there a way to make OpenElec use whatever xbian uses for sound ? <p> 3 ) Am I only one who uses his media center with headphones ? It 's weird that there is pretty much no information about this specific subject . <p> 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I guess those analog FM headsets would work . But their sound quality is abysmal . I 'd like to avoid them if possible . Also , I 've tried pluging g930 dongle to my tv and use it as an audio source . Did n't work . <p> Anyway . thanks for the hard work you guys put to this project . Whether I stay with xbian or migrate to another distro , at the very least you guys made me realize that there was a solution to my problem <p> Cheers , Can Ups . Sorry .

Have you installed some other hardware or program that might affect this ?

@@44048253 @4048253/ <p> I have issue with my external hdd ( it 's WD Elements Desktop connected directly to my raspberryPi - it 's 3,5 " drive , so has own power supply ) . HDD is waking up after a few minutes after sleep ( sleep is after 30 minutes of inactivity ) . This problem is only on XBMC distributions - on Xbian , but I also tried Raspbmc . <p> On Windows and Raspbian HDD works properly and does n't wake up himself . <p> Yea , nothing that I know . Maybe something time to time try to acces the drive , but I do n't know how to check it . The LED diode on hdd does n't show that something reads or writes data , HDD just waking up I do n't know why . In XBMC is a lot more packets than in Raspbian , so maybe some of them do it , but i ca n't check witch . <p> HDD has build-in sleep mechanism , so hdparm is useless . I thought this is it , but I removed it and issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes is waking up . I also tried manually mounting drive in fstab insted of automount , but this is also not it . <p> I forgot write in first post - I 'm using newest version of Xbian and it 's rpi with 512mb memory . <p> I tried all this , too . Just right now i thought i had found the problem by removing the usbmount sleeptimer. i guess about 30 minutes the hdd was sleeping but then ... while this i was looking on the xbmc debug log , but no xbmc event seems to cause the wake up . <p> To disable built-in sleep i downloaded wd drive utiliters for windows from LONG ... . then i attached the hdd on my windows pc and just disabled the sleep function . to disable the usbmount spindown you have either to go on xbmc to settings -&gt; xbian -&gt; xbmc , scroll down and uncheck " spin down hdd " or you do it over ssh . there you have to set in **27;2186;TOOLONG around line 30 " SPINDOWN=0 " . ( and then do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the next days i 'm going to check the power consumption when standby and when only spindown , too . <p> But , this is the way how to work around the problem but it did n't solve issue , because your and my hdd should work propertly with built-in sleep mode . If drive is working properly on Windows , issue is on the side of XBian and not hdd . <p> You tried the tool ? Maybe it works . And the problem is that the system ca n't read the power state of the HDD when it is in standby mode . I checked this with hdparm . When my HDD was on standby I did hdparm -C /dev/sda and the HDD woke up . But when it is only on spin down the command returns correct the power state . <p> So you ca n't say whether the issue is because of xbian or because of the way of WD standby works . <p> ( 7th Jan , 2014 01:54 AM ) Alcoinus Wrote : So you ca n't say whether the issue is because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yea , you are right , but I think something is wrong if drive do n't work propertly only on XBMC distributions .

I was wondering about using a thermal control to aadjust the speed and this looks like a great help in building that . <p> I 'd be interested to know how you get on . My main RPi is cased , non heatsinked and runs at around 55 . I 'd like to lower it a bit , but a heatsink in a case seems a waste of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An active fan is the answer - USB powered of course and definitely silent but will it draw enough heat away from the chips ? <p> Also , as the optimal temperature of most electronics is about 50 degrees , is all this cooling really required for " normal " operation ? - OC for sure . <p> Just a thought . <p> I 'm going to run Beta 2 on " normal " OC for a couple of weeks , as it it so fast at the moment , that I feel that the Xbian OC may not be required .

I got a case with a 25mm hole in it and plugged a 5V 40mm fan ( It 's just one I had ) over the hole and spliced a male USB lead onto it ( It draws 0.07 amps ) and let it loose . <p> Ok it was a bit noisy but nothing that music or video would n't cover but the core temperature stayed around 23 degrees . <p> So if you want to cool your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pictures on request ) I went from 53 degrees to 23 degrees , <p> The RPi is made to stand temps . of no more than 85c so i would n't bother about temps . higher then 60c .

@@44048261 @4048261/ <p> Solved : Pisnes gamepad or keyboard control only after plugging in a mouse <p> I am currently trying to use my recently purchased Raspberry Pi as a mediacenter and retro game platform , using pisnes ( snes9x , adapted for the Pi ) . I am currently trying and comparing raspbmc and xbian . Currently I think xbian suits me better . There is however one very weird issue with xbian , that I do n't experience on raspbmc . I do not know if this is a problem in xbian , or in pisnes or even in the Pi hardware itself or a combination of these , but I have to start somewehere , hence my question here . <p> To start a game I exit XBMC and log in to the console . I can start snes games in Pisnes but only have control ( keyboard or gamepad ) after a mouse is/has been plugged in . Without it , a game launches , I have video and sound output but my gamepad does n't do anything and the only keys on my keyboard that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I return to the console I do see all the keys I have been pressing on screen , so the system does receive them . While troubleshooting this issue I installed Scummvm , as another application that uses SDL to see if the problem lies in SDL . Launching Scummvm it says a mouse is missing , so for testing purposes I plugged in a mouse on a free USB port . Scummvm started . And to my big surprise now I also can control games in pisnes. also after I remove the mouse . After a reboot I have to insert the mouse again to get it working again . <p> Like I said , I do not have this on my raspbmc setup installed on another SD card . Could this be a problem in SDL or the configuration of SDL on xbian ? Does anybody else experience similar issues with pisnes or other SDL based applications in xbian ? <p> I would prefer to use xbian and hope we can sort this wierd problem out . Of course I will continue finding a solution . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply rating : 4.8V 1A RPi model ( model A/B 256mb/512mb ) : B SD card size and make/type : Sandisk ultra II , 4Gb , class 4 Network ( wireless or LAN ) : LAN Connected devices ( TV , USB , network storage , etc . ) : Sony Bravia TV via HDMI , Logitech " Internet 350 " keyboard via USB , Trustmaster " Dual analog 4 " gamepad via USB Hmmm , I just did an apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to see if this would fix anything . When I exit XBMC now to go to the console , XBMC automatically launches itself . One of the reasons to prefer xbian over raspbmc was that xbian did n't do this . Now , to get a console I have to ssh into the machine and kill the xbmc.bin proces . Not handy . Also not handy is the fact that after killing xbmc I get wierd characters from the command prompt and I can not log in . These are however completely other issues . <p> I have eventually been able to test pisnes once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in the shower this morning where I thought that the plugging in of a mouse might trigger the load of a kernel module . This would explain why it works after plugging in a mouse . And indeed : lsmod showed the module " mousedev " loaded after plugging in a mouse while it was n't there before . I added the module to /etc/modules and all is fine now . A little weird that this module is needed to use my keyboard in pisnes but hey , it works ... <p> Next : starting a game from XBMC , but that 's a completely different challenge : - ) <p> 1 ) Have you tried the addon ROM Browser - I believe it was written to directly support some games within XBMC 2 ) You may be better suited to having Rasbian with Xbian rather that native Xbian - which was designed to be a Media Player rather than a mix and match - See LONG ... Not related - but I would check your PSU - 4.8V may not be enough in some cases ( 5.1V is the preferred supply )

My confusion comes from the apparent mixing-and-matching of SysV and upstart/insserv . <p> So , a more specific question is whether there is any documentation yet on how Xbian manages system initialization - and if it 's just following the " raspbian way " , maybe a forum post pointing to the relevant documentation . <p> As for the friendliness of Google , I guarantee I went there many many times before I posted here , and found the results for " Xbian upstart " or " Xbian upstart sshd " less than delightful . <p> it is the basic idea of XBian fully support standards , documents and all what comes from upstream distribution - Debian in that case . The biggest confusion you see is to blame Debian. let 's not discuss why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system service management . even if replaced by upstart , upstart will start the system and then call RL 1-&gt;target run level . <p> we started migration with Beta series ( introduce upstart ) and followed in B2 to minimize usage of sysv to minimum . As we do n't want to break Debian 's current distro valid standards in any way , we need to keep sysv running , keep aloe sysv service names etc <p> current status for B2 is that clean img installation has 0 services started within sysv subsystem . all is migrated to upstart. if there was n't analogue / setting / job to update because of Debian 's delays &amp; old versions , we were looking into Ubuntu Docs mostly and followed those standards - at the end almost all this ends back ported in Debian when attacking higher version - should be fine . so all upstart , SSHD &amp; SMBD managed via inter server and managed by Wheezy 's system tools around inetd subsystem . <p> If the XBian would be designed differently , I would agree on need for detailed docs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With XBian it was , is and plan is that will be always to use just what current base distro offers . We ca n't be more Debian and Debian . That 's why Debian is the base for others , not vice-versa . <p> So you need to mod a lot this topic in XBian , we are ready to help with your questions ( which might go to XBian specific packages ) . But in general , how those packages are using / altering Debian system the answer will be only one . In the way man pages describes and Debian 's Developer 's manuals allows you to .

@@44048280 @4048280/ <p> as it seems that you are getting here not only a super XBMC distro for the Raspberry Pi but also gold status support for free , I decided to give something back . <p> For all who want to use their Raspberry ( running XBian ) additionally as download manager , here is an simple bash script that will do all the work for you . <p> What type of download manager is it ? : <p> DownloadDaemon is a very lightweight download server daemon which supports among other features many one-click-hoster including premium accounts , auto reconnect , unpacking , etc ... ( lightweight alternative to JDownloader and pyLoad ) It 's just the daemon running on your Raspberry and you will use it via a GUI client that is available for Windows and Linux . There 's also a webclient , but this script will only setup the daemon as it 's more lightweight than running also a webserver . <p> Download xbianinstallDD.zip and unpack it on to your Raspberry with Xbian running . ( Ziped it , because I coud n't attach just the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the internet , as the script needs to download some packages/files . <p> Then run following commands in the same dir where the script file is via shell : <p> Terminal <p> chmod +x xbianinstallDD.sh sudo . /xbianinstallDD.sh <p> That 's it , the script will start to guide you through the install process but there is almost nothing more to do for you . <p> Afterwards you can just activate the downloadd service via xbian-config and connect via client to your own lightweight download server . Do n't forget to configure DownloadDaemon for your needs , this can be done via the client GUI . <p> Not what you was looking for ? -&gt; No Problem , just download the uninstall script and do the same stuff as you did with the installation script . This will undo all changes made by the installation script . <p> Terminal <p> chmod +x xbianuninstallDD.sh sudo . /xbianuninstallDD.sh <p> You may want to have a look on my pyLoad script as a more complex alternative . <p> That 's because there is no plugin for this hoster yet . But you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin system for parsing one-click-host sites . So everyone can write plugins that integrate in DownloadDaemon . Theoretically , most programming-languages can be used , as long as they can work with a C++-interface , however , C++ is prefered because of portability ( a Java virtual machine or a python-interpreter is just not available on every platform ) . <p> So copy an existing plugin and edit it to match the API for your hoster . <p> so I tested it out , installed everything which was very easy by just calling your script unfortunately I have to say that I do n't really feel comfortable with DD . so is there a quick way to uninstall DD including all the leftover dependencies ( bunch of packages that were installed before compiling ) ? would be grateful to know that <p> The package ' build-essential ' is just a collection of tools and libs you need to build/compile from source . You should be safe removing this from your XBian . But of course , you can just keep if you like to compile some programs from source again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build-essential ' by hand will not remove the packages it brings with during installation . <p> Thank you , your script was really helpful . I want to ask you the gui 's IP Port in order to get in the gui start configure EDIT : I installed gui for my Windows and I saw the port number " 56789 " but it 's not working like in the Transmission . Anyway I 'll continue use with the Windows software . Thank you again

@@44048288 @4048288/ <p> I 've just purchased a new 42 " LED LG TV and hooked my Pi up to it . Much to my delight the TV 's remote works to control nearly every aspect of XBMC , however the one thing that does n't work is the " Info " Button . This just brings up the standard TV Info ( i.e resolution and refresh rate ) instead of Video information . <p> Is there a simple way in which i can map this key or alternatively another key on the remote to bring up the video information/ library information ? I 've trawled the internet and found all the guides thus far very confusing ! <p> My remote is a LG AKB73615388 ( picture attached ) in case anyone has already created a custom key map ? <p> LOL , you 're in luck , I have almost the exact same remote . Good timing of your purchase too because a few months back , LG TVs were experiencing a problem with CEC whereby once you switch source ( say , back to normal DTV ) and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die . Are n't you lucky I bug reported that and the great guys at Pulse-Eight found a solution ? <p> Essentially when XBian is running and the active source on your LG , if you press a button that does n't apply to the current source , you should see an overlay from the TV software stating " This function is not available now " . So you can rule out those keys , they will not be available to you . <p> Secondly , there will be some keys that do not produce the " This function is not available now " message but nevertheless do not do anything in Xbian because they are not passed through the HDMI CEC wire . These include , for example , the red/green/yellow/blue buttons . <p> Thirdly there are the keys like the Info button that are always completely mapped to the TV 's system software . So you can not remap those . <p> Lastly there are the keys you CAN remap . To do this is reasonably easy if you are not afraid of a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a text file . The one aspect that is a little messy is the documentation . Loosely speaking AFAIK there are about half a dozen different representations of the keys on a remote control so that gets messy but I can help you out and hopefully others will too . Let 's keep it as simple as possible though .. <p> 1 ) In which mode are you in when you press the button ? The mappings for XBMC can be global or context specific . For example , pressing a key when watching full screen video can trigger a different action to pressing the same key when viewing a file list or the library . <p> 2 ) What do you want to do when you click a certain button ? <p> From what I can determine from your post , you want to have XBMC switch to the main Video menu when you press a button , is that correct ? <p> Just let me know a little bit more about those two questions and I can write you a simple XML file to help . <p> thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the problems with the LG remotes have been ironed out , though actually i still have the problem with changing sources , when i go back to the Pi i can not use the remote , so not sure what is going on there . <p> In answer to your questions : <p> 1 ) I am in the video library when i press the button . 2 ) I have attached a screenshot to illustrate . I want to be able to map a button on the remote to bring up this menu . <p> Would be really good if you are able to help at all . Am ok at XML but have got in a muddle trying to edit the remote.xml file as instructed on the various websites i have looked at . <p> Hmm , sorry to hear about the sources switching bug . What is the exact model of your actual TV , as opposed to the remote ? I have access to two LG TVs and both are ok with switching sources ATM . I tend to use the Input button as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cool that you already know that you need a remote.xml , the path and so forth . Here 's an example remote.xml that should enable you to use that menu , which is known as ContextMenu . <p> You might want to nominate a different key to assign the ContextMenu to , that 's up to you . I 'd suggest do the above and if that does n't get you access to the ContextMenu I do n't know what will , LOL , because there 's actually duplication there . You can probably omit the two MyVideo* sections as the global section covers that . <p> Anyway , just in case , the editing procedure that seems to work for me is : <p> 1 ) Start XBian , wait for it to boot 2 ) Click the power icon in the bottom left 3 ) Select " Exit " to close XBMC as cleanly as possible 4 ) SSH in to the XBian command line / terminal / shell ( whatever you like to call it ) , or log in if you have a keyboard plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding in the above code 6 ) run ... <p> Code : <p> sudo /etc/init.d/xbmc start <p> In other words , in my experience , XBMC does require restarting before it will attempt to use/implement your remote.xml edits . <p> Thanks for the instructions ! Unfortunately they did not work though : - ( <p> Just one question .. I had to create the remote.xml file as it was missing from the keymaps folder , do i have to register this or do anything so that XBMC will read it ? It does n't seem to matter what changes i make to the file it does n't make any difference to the key mapping . <p> My TV is an LG 42LM3450 .

@@44048299 @4048299/ <p> I 'm new here -- in fact today I just tried out XBian for the first time . I 'd used RaspBMC for a few months before now , but I 'd found a few issues that had popped up in recent builds that seemed to be mum from the devs about fixes ( not bashing them , I 'm sure they 're busy with other things ) , so I was looking for something else . <p> The first major issue I noticed with XBian was the inability to add SMB/CIFS shares . More accurately , my inability to add them , as I 'm not sure if this is occurring with everybody . Having used Linux and other Unix-like systems since the mid-1990 's , however , a workaround was n't too hard for me to find . <p> In searching for solutions to this problem , I noticed others having similar issues . They found some OK solutions ( such as restarting xbmc as root ) , but I think there 's a cleaner way . In this post I 'll highlight what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When I 'd go to add my SMB share via Videos -&gt; Files -&gt; Add , then selecting Windows Network ( SMB ) , I could browse my workgroup , find the Windows machine with the configured CIFS share , but when clicking on it I would receive a window with the text " Operation not permitted " . <p> To me , this looked like XBian is simply populating the window contents with the direct output of some shell command that it 's executing on the back end . In fact , there 's lots of things you can execute on the command line of any Linux system that would spit out the same error . This usually occurs when a user does not have sufficient permissions to execute a specific action -- I 'm guessing that whatever XBian is attempting to do in the background ( mount the CIFS share ? ) is being executed as the " xbian " user , and not a user with sufficient privileges to do that specific action , and thus the error . <p> Other workarounds : When looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions including updating packages ( eh ... maybe ) and re-launching the underlying xbmc process as root via the command line ( no ) . I do n't like these approaches for a few reasons : <p> 1 ) My packages were already up to date ( I 'm running the latest XBian build at the time of this posting , which seems to pull in the standard Raspbian repos as well as some of its own ) , and the two packages suggested to be updated in other posts should not affect this behavior anyways , and <p> 2 ) Relaunching the xbmc process as root is a brute-force maneuver . It 's the strong-arm solution -- sure , it works , but it 's almost like cheating . It also just feels wrong being a long-time user of unix-like systems , and there was no obvious way to make XBian repeat this behavior on boot ( maybe updating some init scripts , but I did n't look into it that far , because I did n't like the solution ) . Plus , the actual " xbmc " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in the latest build of XBian anyways ... so screw it . <p> My proposed workaround : My proposed workaround is rather simple , but does require just a little bit of command-line-fu . If you 're scared of a command line , you may want to enlist the help of somebody who 's not , just to be sure . I 'm happy to help others work through these problems , but preferably not because of basic usage issues with a Linux command prompt in general . <p> First , make sure you 're receiving some sort of " Operation not permitted " error when you attempt to add an SMB share via the normal method using the XBMC GUI . This may also apply to NFS shares , as well , but I did n't test that . <p> Second , make sure you 've got SSH enabled on your XBian pi , and then SSH into it with the ' xbian ' user . The default password is available via a google search ( unless you 've changed it ) . How to SSH will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sudo to the root user and make your directory structure for your mounted shares . In general , these shares seem to be mounted under the " /media " directory normally ( if things were working as intended ) , so we 'll be working from there . Make a directory under " /media " which will be named whatever you 'd like to call your share . <p> Note that in my example below , I will be mounting two shares ; one for " Movies " , and one for " TV " , so I 'll make those two directories accordingly : <p> Fourth , try to mount your share manually from the command line , as root . If this works , proceed to the next step . If it does n't work , then it 's very likely that there is either a connectivity issue between the XBian pi device and the device hosting the SMB/CIFS share , or there are permissions issues with the user you are connecting to the share as . Check those on the Windows host and try again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scope for this post ) . <p> The below example is for mounting an SMB/CIFS share . Mounting an NFS share is similar , but you would replace " cifs " with " nfs " . Make sure you replace " USERNAME " and " PASSWORD " in the below examples with your username and password on the Windows host you are connecting to . Similarly , replace the IP address of the Windows host with what you are connecting to . <p> ... if you did n't see any output , great . The command worked . You should be able to cd into the directory you just mounted , do an ls , and see all of your content . If that worked , then move on to the next step . If it did n't , then check connectivity , permissions , etc. on the remote Windows host . <p> Make another directory and mount other shares as needed for your environment . <p> Fifth , let 's make sure that Xbian mounts this share every time it boots up . For this , we simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to mount to get to our media . <p> Before doing this , we 'll make a file called " smbcredentials " under /home/xbian . This file will contain the username and password for the Windows share , and will be set to only be readable by root . Remember to substitute " USERNAME " and " PASSWORD " with your appropriate values : <p> Once that file has been created , make an entry in /etc/fstab for each share that we need to mount . Remember that in my case I 'm using two , you may be using one or 50 , I do n't know , but make the appropriate entries . Below is my example -- note that the two bottom lines ( under the snarky comment ) are the lines I added to the file : <p> Remember to substitute your own values in for the IP address , and if you 're attempting to do this with NFS and not CIFS , you should change " cifs " to " nfs " , obviously . <p> Sixth , reboot . Type " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come back up after a minute or two , and when it does it should have automatically mounted the shares that you put into /etc/fstab . You can check this with " df " once the Xbian comes back up from the reboot : <p> ... here I can see that the shares are indeed mounted as intended . Great ! <p> Finally , go back into XBMC on your TV , and add the source -- EXCEPT , do n't add the source as SMB . Add it as a local file -- choose " Root Filesystem " from the list , and then navigate to /media . You should see the shares you just mounted . Add each one individually , and Xbian should categorize them as normal . <p> I hope this helps . I know I was a little frustrated by Xbian seemingly not running with enough permission to mount these shares direct from the GUI , but a little command line fu and nothing is impossible .

@@44048324 @4048324/ <p> I 've tested some skins today and want to share the information with you . Some words about the current situation : 1 . XBMC Frodo The XBMC crew is heavily working on the new XBMC version . As far as I can see it will bring a new skin engine , so that most of the skins has to be adapted to work properly . Some skin developer already began to work on it , some not yet . So it will still need some time until more skins will be officially be available for the new XBMC version . Until then we have to live for example with Confluence or just try another skin and see if it 's working . 2 . Raspberry hardware The hardware of the Raspberry is limited . So some skins will be very slow and not really usable . <p> Installation methods 1 . Official Just browse to the official/standard Addon directory and select one of the available skins , which are already Frodo compatible . 2. 3rd party Repo Download the zip-file with the repo information , install via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the new 3rd party repository . 3 . Github Open the github repository with your web browser and click on the button ZIP button on the upper part . Download the zip file and transfer it to ... /home/xbian/.xbmc/addons Open this path in the command line and unzip the transfered file ... unzip &lt;filename.zip&gt; Restart XBMC Activate the new skin via System -&gt; Appearance . <p> Test method I did n't do a full functionality test . Just intalled it , browsed through the menus and watched the CPU consumption . The CPU number below will be from the Home menu and just waiting for about 1 minute . So it 's far away from being accurate , but perhaps a first impression if the skin will be usable on raspberry hardware . <p> metroTV LONG ... Method : 3 , see download link in the xbmc thread above the slideshow CPU : 45% ( all sub-categories 95% as nearly every page has any scrolling element ( like plots , casts , ... ) due the scrolling bug on the Rpi ) <p> For me a CPU consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIG " provides many options to customize and is well maintained ny the developer . So really worth a look . But for now my personal choice is " ReAlaska : Dark " . <p> @Enigmach Did you try to install the skin via the option " Install from zip file ... " ? If yes , it will probably not work for most skins as the skins are n't adopted to the new Frodo version . Please try the installation method 3 I 've described above , where you have to manually unzip the zip-file . <p> @flangefrog Yeah , sure it does . When just the skin is using 50 or 90% of the CPU , there is n't much power left for updating the library , artworks or other addons . Especially " Aeon MQ 4 " was very , very slow and it took some minutes until I was able to revert back to another skin as the screens loaded very slowly . But except " Vinci " neither of the skins broke my XBMC setup . As I said , you will just eventually need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU is fully loaded and the menus are very slow to navigate back to the options menu . <p> I tried to install refocus big , hybrid and aeon nox from github but only aeon nox worked , the others just crashed xbmc . What version of XBMC are you using ? Was refocus big an acceptable speed for you ? I would like to use that theme because confluence is a bit limited and does n't look as nice as some of the others . I use aeon nox on my main pc but it 's a bit slow on the pi . <p> ( 29th Dec , 2012 06:58 PM ) namtih Wrote : @Enigmach Did you try to install the skin via the option " Install from zip file ... " ?

After this xbian restarts automatically but there seems to be no change . There 's no cursor and touching the screen does n't do anything . <p> The touchscreen works with raspian , so I know everything is good at least on the hardware end . Any help will be greatly appreciated . <p> Thanks for your reply . Frankly ' a lot of stuff ' pops up after running the command but the word output is not there . Not exactly sure how to take a screen shot so I used the old fashioned method . Should be easier than my clumsy **28;2869;TOOLONG by James Shimp , on Flickr Kinda odd it lists my keyboard twice ? <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I downloaded xbian and set up the wireless . I did n't update , download anything or change any settings . I just did the install , configured the wireless and installed the driver by typing " wget LONG ... then after that downloaded i typed " sudo sh install.sh " <p> It then asked for the event number ( which was listed egalax 2 ) so i pressed 2 , did the calibration , it auto restarted and then like I said it just operated as if nothing happened . <p> Keyboard being mentioned twice is probably because its got mouse or touch pad as well ( seen as an extra input device ) . If tinkering with Pi 's , its better to connect from your PC to the Pi 's BASH command prompt via an SSH client over network as this makes copying and pasting text possible ( no need for clumsy pictures of your screen ) . <p> That script you mention LONG ... is suppose to do everything for you : 1 ) Install its own TSlib version ( Touch Screen Libraries ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will create another dummy input device with translated coordinates ( touch area usually being much larger than the screen resolution so you need something to translate x-y coordinates ) . <p> Looks like something went wrong with the script as after running that script , an extra input device should be displayed besides the eGalax one and keyboards when running " evtest " afterwards . Now " evtest " says " This device is grabbed by another process " . What does " evtest " say when you stop Kodi/XBMC and uimapper ? <p> Terminal <p> sudo stop xbmc sudo stop uimapper evtest <p> There are only 10 types of people in the world : those who understand binary , and those who do n't <p> OK bit of an update . I worked on this a lot yesterday and learned a lot . There 's quite a bit of info so I 'll try and make it as concise as possible . First off to answer your last question , stopping xbmc and unimapper does n't seem to work . ( I did this via SSH which works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a command . Anyway , ) <p> xbian@xbian $ sudo stop xbmc stop : Unknown instance : <p> xbian@xbian $ sudo stop unimapper stop : Unknown job : unimapper <p> **28;2899;TOOLONG <p> Evtest seems to be working to some extent for whatever reason ? This boggles my mind why it seems to work now but did n't before . The only thing is it reaches the ' interrupt to exit ' point but seemingly locks up . Here it is via the SSH : <p> I let it sit like this for around 40min before I tried to copy this ( ctrl c ) and this interrupted the testing . Right clicking does n't work either ( it enters previous commands ) <p> **32;2929;TOOLONG <p> The other thing to note is my original assessment as to the touchscreen failing to work all together was wrong . There is indeed a cursor but it typically starts somewhere ( way ) off screen . If you play with it a bit you can get it to show up , it 's just that the calibration is way way off and the x/y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at so far . I noticed in the evtest it says ' not running as root ' so I figure I 'll run the evtest as root and see what happens . <p> I suspect uimapper is not running because brantje script failed somehow . <p> Quote : ( touch area usually being much larger than the screen resolution so you need something to translate x-y coordinates ) <p> Ca n't test as do n't  have working touch setup at the mo . <p> Ps. when running evtest on device " eGalax Inc . USB TouchController " , and its not grabbed by other process , you can touch the four corners of you screen to determine touch area resolution ( mine is 4000 X 4000 I believe ) . <p> There are only 10 types of people in the world : those who understand binary , and those who do n't <p> &lt;type&gt; is one of : EVKEY , EVSW , EVLED , EVSND &lt;value&gt; can either be a numerical value , or the textual name of the key/switch/LED/sound being queried ( e.g. SWDOCK ) . xbian@xbian $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2853 <p> After this it loaded kodi . It then apparently automatically updated ' stuff ' as I was typing this in . Did n't look back at the screen in time to see what updated . That being said there does n't seem to be any changes . And again I seriously appreciate your replies . <p> As you already noticed , x-y coordinates coming from " /dev/input/event2 " are way of with Kodi because screen resolution differs from touch resolution . Solution is the " uimapper " Python script that runs in background , grabbing " /dev/input/event2 " and creating a new input device for example " /dev/input/event3 " . This " event3 " device will have the translated coordinates derived from the " /etc/pointercal " file , that was created with the " tscalibrate " tool , and coordinates coming from the " event2 " device . As the " event2 " device is grabbed already by " uimapper " , the only device still available for Kodi will be that " event3 " device with translated coordinates . <p> For you to check : <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 ) With what parameters is uimapper started : <p> Terminal <p> cat /etc/init/uimapper.conf <p> And please try to use the forums code or term tags when posting screen results or code ! <p> There are only 10 types of people in the world : those who understand binary , and those who do n't <p> Hmmm I tried myself to run that touch install script but noticed my touch is not detected/no drivers loaded so need to fix first to test . By the looks , everything looks configured correctly . Does that pointercal file exist that 's created by the " tscalibrate " tool ? <p> Terminal <p> cat /etc/pointercal <p> You can run " tscalibrate " from the bash command line if that pointercal file does not exist but need to activate SSH for the " root " account and set password using the " xbian-config " tool : <p> Hopefully this is useful . I 'm not sure what I 'm looking at here but I 'm going to look more closely to see if I can find some kind of error . And thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be .

Under such circumstances , the drive may take as long as 30 seconds to respond to a subsequent disk access , though most drives are much quicker . The encoding of the timeout value is somewhat peculiar . A value of zero means " timeouts are disabled " : the device will not automatically enter standby mode . Values from 1 to 240 specify multiples of 5 seconds , yielding timeouts from 5 seconds to 20 minutes . Values from 241 to 251 specify from 1 to 11 units of 30 minutes , yielding timeouts from 30 minutes to 5.5 hours . A value of 252 signifies a timeout of 21 minutes .

Worked ok with internet cable but want wifi so have bought a small USB wifi thingy . To try and connect to wifi I started up then exited XBMC and arrived at a dialogue box which allowed me to set up wifi info . After exiting the dialogue box there was something going on but got the impression all was well . I was then left with the Xbian command line and at this point I have no idea how to restart XBMC . Tried powering off and then restarting straight to XBMC but found no wifi connection . Not sure if it was connected first time or it does not store connection data when power lost . I think this is a very simple problem but my lack of knowledge makes it impossible . Any help would be welcome . <p> Have loaded Aplpha 5 successfully but I can not see any stuff in system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for Server , Username and Password whereas WIFI will usually ask for network name , security type and password . Note I see my nana usb doggle is flashing so that is positive . <p> Thanks I think I have got there . Have tried addons and only got 0% loading , but signal is low in current location , previously would not have seen any attempt at downloading . Is there any way to see if wifi is connected . In the system page it says internet not connected . OK , definitely up and running , thanks for your help . <p> I go to system --&gt; settings --&gt; xbian and then under system I changed the interface to wlan0 . So far so good , much better than Alpha 4 that would n't even recognize the wlan . But now it scans for signals and it finds them all , then I click on my ssid , I type in my key and it says " connecting wlan0 to my ssid " stays there for a few seconds and then sends me back to the part where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It never actually connects . Any possible solutions would be helpful . Thanks <p> forgot to mention that , no special characters . I have a simple wifi password because i like living on the edge <p> have n't tried ssh yet , i 'll give that a go in a minute <p> Edit : SSH worked , but interestingly , whenever i scanned for wlan through the ssh menu it would find my ssid , but when i would choose it then it would still kick me back out to having to scan again . Had to do it as a custom connection <p> Ethernet over eth0 is working A1 , however the ultimate goal is to have this RPi working wireless .

In the past when I used RaspBMC , I encountered this issue , and I solved it with this settings . Now , on my Xbian powered Rpi , I set this settings too and It works too . <p> It 's a Hisense , not at home so ca n't check the model . It does n't make sense but I indeed lose dynamic contrast , sharpness , and contrast if I do n't  set it to something other than native resolution ( 1366x768 ) . I have to set it to 1920x1080 or 1280x720 and adjust for overscan . <p> All TVs are n't created equal , trust me I know how to setup my TV and KODI . This is n't just with a Raspberry , my PS3 and Odroids are the same way except the PS3 automatically sets the correct overscan . <p> My TV reports a lot of available resolutions and hz , such as 1920x1080@24hz ... etc . When in any mode other than native resolution all display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display as a PC monitor where you do n't want dynamic contrast and such since the PC will have it 's own adjustments . Most video sources ( PS3 , BluRay players ... etc ) will automatically select 720p and not 768p which is the native resolution and what a PC would select , but Pi 's and such are like PC 's and by default select the native 768p but have no extra display control features like real PC 's ( other than size adjustment ) . <p> I understand why my TV behaves this way , I do n't agree with it but I understand it . Obviously something is screwy with most display sources such as the Pi because I need no adjustment with the PS3 . I select 1080p on the PS3 and I have a perfectly aligned display , I select 1080p on the Pi in KODI and I have to ' shrink ' the picture in KODI because it does n't display properly . This is some type of issue with cheap HDMI sources such as the Raspberry Pi , like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do like you Richard and disable overscan in the TV menu and all resolutions will display correctly , but what the TV is doing when I disable overscan is essentially kicking the resolution to native 768p ( 1366x768 PC mode ) and disabling dynamic contrast , sharpness , and contrast adjustment . Stupid but true . <p> I will go a bit further and explain PC mode , PC mode disables all extra video processing to give you the fastest possible display , no video processing on the TV gives lower latencies which affect how you perceive mouse movement and doing things such as playing games where low latencies are necessary .

You should be able to write to USB via network let 's say at sustained 6-7MB ( if RPI is not otherwise busy ) - at beginning you can peak at 10 until buffers fill up . USB - USB never tested but do n't expect much higher from this as RPI 's USB implementation is not the perfect one and is quite CPU consuming . <p> I am having similar problems .

@@44048354 @4048354/ <p> H.265 ca n't be hardware decoded , but support for it will be in Helix ( XBMC/Kodi v14 ) . You still wo n't be able to play any actual movie as the CPU is not up to it . Low low low quality ones , the ones you 'll never watch , will work fine though : - ) <p> Well , technically " low quality " is much subjective . I 'm sure for me it wo n't really work , but it 's possible that it works for you ... I have my doubts , but we 'll see if the CuBox-i is any better for this ( still software decoding for H.265 ) . <p> @syco as @menakite mentioned , if you do n't have HW decoding , do n't  expect much from ARM CPUs , what ever kind on this micro computers . If you really want something like this than you are on wrong address , and you should get a decent HTPC for few hundred --- <p> -alsa version of xbmc " should " be able to play such files . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no idea what the poor Broadcom SOC can handle to decode in realtime . <p> the " RPI native " XBMC ( playing via OMXPLAYER ) can play only formats whose GPU can HW decode. it does n't contain any code to handle SW decoding . despite -alsa version where XBMC 's native players are able to use OMX lib hw decoding but they also natively fallback to SW ( via FFMPEG ) . <p> ( -alsa is also the only possibility how to play old divx3 content and probably others - sometimes the RPI SOC is enough for low-res videos - for instance my Red Dwarf collection in divx3 with resolution not higher than 320x200 - but hi res or not , it 's still funny ) ) just tried some x265 demos in xbmc ( macosx ) and it looks like 13.2 does n't support 265 at all . <p> Helix supports software decoding of H.265 . There was not much to do in XBMC/Kodi itself , it was just that FFMpeg did n't support H.265 - it 's now upgraded to 2.4.3 . <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the upcoming v14 . <p> In Helix DVDPlayer and OMXPlayer were merged : there 's only one player now , DVDPlayer . In settings " DVDPlayer " refers to " software decoding " while " OMXPlayer " refers to " hardware decoding " ( the name " OMXPlayer " was kept to avoid confusing people who otherwise would think that OMXPlayer was removed - but there 's only one player ) . <p> DVDPlayer ( i.e. software decoding ) is also MMAL accelerated ( it 's configurable ) . So , in Helix you enable " MMAL acceleration " ( accelerates software decoding via MMAL API ) and " OMXPlayer acceleration " ( GPU decoding ) . These are the optimal settings : it first checks if the video can be decoded by the GPU , if it ca n't it will then transparently fall back to software decoding , either MMAL accelerated ( if the setting is enabled ) or plain software decoding . Previously you had to manually select the player via " Play with ... " otherwise OMXPlayer silently exited , or you only got audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty acceptable , it can play ( *low* ) bit rate 1080p videos pretty fine . ( Of course GPU decoding gives the best experience . ) <p> Side note : E-AC3 passthrough on the Pi was n't working at all and that 's also fixed in Helix . <p> Edit : couple things I forgot . Audio can now be resampled on the GPU - this gives perfect audio quality - and ALSA support was pushed upstream .

Unfortunately my Linux skills are very limited . What is the " command line " ? I did a quick Google but it seems to be a complex subject ... is it something in " config.txt " ? <p> I ca n't remember all of fstab ( and I ca n't see it now that it is not booting ) , but the line I added ( to the 4 or 5 lines of the fstab file that already existed ) was : <p> I think I saw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at /RILHAS-SRV did n't seem to cause any issues , so I 've been using it like this for a long time now .

I 'll come back after that and after completing your instructions . <p> I did n't find any reference to " switch root " in there , so I was unable to place the init=/bin/bash immediately after it . I added it to the end of the file , together with " debug " . Here is the resulting file : <p> Then I tried editting the command line to remove the shell , but /boot was empty ( is this normal ? ? ) . So I editted it back on my laptop ( by removing the bash and leaving the debug ) and tried again ( without any USB peripherals except for the keyboard and mouse ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically , and a login prompt appeared instead . I logged in and confirmed " xbmc.bin " was not running . <p> I removed the " debug " in the command line and tried again , but the result was the same and XBMC did not start . I started it manually and it started without any problems . <p> Then I added " debug " to the command line again ( just in case ) and tried adding all the USB peripherals , and the system booted . And , surprisingly , so did XBMC . <p> So I guess it was the " nobootwait " thing in fstab ( and maybe XBMC was not booting because I have added media sources from the external USB disk ) . This solution works well for me because I already had a script waiting for the USB disk to get mounted before starting all the applications in it ( legacy from another embedded computer I used before the Pi came along ) , so it is working just fine . <p> As for the reason why it worked so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as for the reason why it always worked without the USB disk and then , after encountering the problem once , it did n't boot even if the disk was n't there ? Also , no idea . <p> ... anyway , I think I remember having to do something else to disable the periodic disk checks , I would not be surprised if all of this was being caused by something related to that . I seem to remember that one component of it was the fstab " trailing zero " , but I think there were other components related to the number of days or the number of mounts or something like that . I 'll check my notes , I 'm sure I 've written it down somewhere . <p> the xbmc not starting will be part of the " freeze " , attached / non-attached this particular disk ( being written in fstab ) and whether it was or was n't mounted during boot . <p> if I remember correctly , /etc/init/xbmc.conf holds dependency for " local-filesystems " . <p> as the usb will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe better would be " noauto " instead of " nobootwait " . <p> with noauto the disk wo n't be counted to as needed for " local-filesystems " condition to be fulfilled so the xbmc should start regardless of it . try . <p> I want to use the " nobootwait " option , because if the USB disk fails I can then still fallback to running critical applications from the SD card ( the domotics has rsync'ed folders on the card ) , which is way better than the system hanging forever . <p> Can the " nobootwait " be used at the same time as " noauto " ? I think this would be ideal for me.

I am running the Pi of an iphone charger . At the moment I do n't have any other charger I can test it with . <p> but when you first install the XBian and boot 1st time , does it boot into XBMC GUI ?

The problem is that if I open the port 22 I get a lot of script kid poking my ssh and I 'd rather not . I want to change the default port for ssh from 22 to a higher unused one . But I noticed that changing /etc/ssh/sshdconfig has no effect .

Chromium ? ) in XBian to launch for sites that ca n't be browsed from within XBMC ? Maybe have an " application " in XBMC that will quit XBMC and launch such a browser and once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaunches XBMC . <p> Would that be a feasable idea and would others also be interested to look into it ? <p> Even if you could get it running with a script ( That has also been discussed somewhere ) it 's doubtful if the little Pi could handle XBMC and a X server very well .

I 'm just some random Windows user , so please be patient <p> You mean to transfer it inside your local network right ? And you have your Raspberry Pi connected to it either via ethernet cable or Wifi dongle ? If that 's so , all you need to configure now is Samba sharing .

The same problem happens , but as the sound is adequate I don-t need to move the amplifier - it-s only with YIFY that it-s an issue . <p> You mentioned that it-s possible that it-s the RPi2 . Do you think that the device is defective or this is a common flaw with all Raspberries ? Just in case I need to return it and get a new one . <p> as I mentioned , my device is okay , no issues at all I have RPi2 as well please , try different OS , like Raspbian or Openelec. if you find it there too than your problem rely in hardware , otherwise we may investigate further

@@44048426 @4048426/ <p> First post and already a stupid question : Is there a chance to install and use a **36;4521;TOOLONG emulator on Xbian ? <p> I really love Xbian for the fact that it is a " real " Linux that made it possible to install and use MPD for my stereo and XBMC for my TV at the same time on the same Pi . But now i would love to go one step further . I want to install and use emulators in Xbian . Anyone got some experience with that , had success with anything similar or could give me some pointers where to get information ? <p> Seeing that over 200 people read this post i assume there is some interest in this topic . <p> I want the Pi to be an all-in-one Solution as HTPC ( XBMC for Videos on my TV via HDMI , audio player on my stereo via MPD on the 3,5 mm jack ) , fileserver via samba on my external usb harddrive , as well as a simple gaming console ( Gameboy , GBC , GBA , NES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few to run except the gaming part ( " managed to get to run " is a bit much to say because most is already included in XBIAN and the rest is very simple to install ) . <p> The one feature i want to achieve is the gaming console and i really can not imagine that would take such a big part of CPU power ( MPD runs below 1% in idle and up to 8-10% on full use . XBMC runs at 20-29% in idle and 60-70% playing a 720p movie . listening to music via MPD at the same time a movie runs is possible but absurd ( even using using the stereo speakers within XBMC is possible ) . <p> Secondly - XBMC on the RPi does not run an X server , so anything that needs an X server will not run on the RPi . ( This includes all distros , openelc , raspbmc and Xbian ) <p> You CAN install Raspbian ( Which has an X server ) and then XBMC but as mentioned in my previous post , the RPi is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , the system runs like an arthritic three legged dog with asthma and a very sore nose . <p> Thirdly there is an " Add-on " in Programs - " Rom collection Browser " Rom Collection . I 've not tried it , so ca n't say if it even works , but give it a try and let us know how you get on . <p> Depending on the hardware of your TV and the decoding , as you have noticed , with " all " you want , you will be pushing 100% most of the time , even if you up to " turbo " which is not really recommended but it is your RPi and you can do what you like with it . Yet , that is just CPU , you have n't factored in disk i/o , network speeds , usb limitations . <p> Bottom line : I like you enthusiasm , but I think you have to fully understand the limitations of the RPi . <p> Research and find out who if anyone is working on a hardware accelerated emulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The GPU in the RPi is quite powerful , more so than the GPU inside last generation Android devices ( SII , Galaxy Nexus .. etc ) so with GPU acceleration the RPi would be able to emulate most if not all the older gaming systems .

Just would like to warn you that sooner or later something is going to break as most of the devices you use are not designed to operate this way . <p> So back to your thing . My suggestion would be to use separate feed for your router/modem and best remotely operated option so you can turn these ON before rest of setup

Also , because of the rebooting , i have a strong suspicion that your adapter drains to much power from the RPi when reconnected . Most of the time , when altering WLAN settings , a replugging is need to make the changes take effect . So when the adapter is plugged in and does n't work , it does n't matter .

@@44048443 @4048443/ <p> Hi , I am running xbian on my model b raspberry , which is working fine . However I installed owncloud 6 on the same machine , using nginx and MySQL . The webinterface is awfully slow , much slower than what I see others are experiencing from youtube videos that show it running on a raspberry using raspbian . The setup process from tutorials worked on xbian too . The only thing I could n't acchieve was increasing the swap file to the recommended size of 1024MB which supposedly increases performance . <p> I do n't have access to my pi right now , but i fiddled around a bit before I read your post , as I did n't want to accidentally screw everything up by changing the swap size . I think the whole problem really is due to high cpu load . I connected to the pi via ssh and monitored via " top " what is happening while i connected to owncloud in the browser . <p> top showed me that even before accessing onwcloud the cpu load was high . xmbc was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xmbc this droped to 20% , but still a bit high , is n't it ? When i kill xmbc via ssh ( stop xmbc ) , owncloud responds much quicker , even without resizing swap . And top tells me that most of the swap space is n't even used at all , even if I upload and download large files . <p> So I guess the best thing will be to dynamically enable and disable xbmc whenever I need it . I just need to find a comfortable way to do that . I am looking at reading cec signals from my tv to initiate startup and stop of the xbmc process . But I guess that 's another thread by itself <p> You could play around with the " nice " levels and see if that helps , or look at Xbian dynamic priority in XBMC Xbian-config . <p> Personally I do n't think you 'll have much success - Xbian is a media centre at the end of the day , and if owncloud uses that much CPU you 'll have difficulties playing movies with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just buy another RPi - Problem solved : - ) <p> Yeah you 're right , that would probably not work well . But since I am the only person using both owncloud and xbmc , I will never use the two at the same time . When I watch movies I am usually not at work accessing my files via owncloud . And pi number two and three are busy in other projects

It has an interesting note about how to configure the compile ... ie : static libraries , or ... building with external libraries enabled . <p> Quote : === Configure === <p> Code : <p> $ cd xbmc $ . /bootstrap $ . /configure <p> If you wish to use supported system libraries do this instead . <p> Code : <p> $ . /configure **27;4819;TOOLONG <p> In either case , with the above installed packages this should go smoothly <p> I 'm not a programmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use whatever codecs and libraries you install to the system running Kodi in the first place . <p> I got ta try it . I spent 2 weeks learning to remaster Knoppix once . I just enjoy these types of projects . Let 's me believe I actually know what i 'm doing . <p> Well .. it was n't actually " **27;4848;TOOLONG " . It was " --with-ffmpeg pathtoffmpeg=/usr/bin/ " . I wound up installing the dev packages for the codecs I wanted , then enabled them in **35;4877;TOOLONG autobuild.sh . It was that easy . <p> I used the " Kodi15.txt " guide , with my first build being Isengard . Jarvis test is next . the guide worked perfect .. but I needed to change a few things . Mainly , I did n't need to mess with gcc and g++ .. the ones installed were newer than the 4.8 it tells you to use instead . I needed to select 2 or 3 different packages than what the guide tells you to .. I just apt-cache searched the files it said it could n't find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . I ca n't remember the packages .. I accidentally closed the text file I was saving them to before actually saving the file . I also needed to " apt-get build-dep xbmc " . That fixed the final dependency issues . It was n't enough by itself though .. I needed to packages in the guide as well . <p> I built it on Ubuntu Mate , right on the pi . I used my external drive to do the build though ... faster , and it did n't freeze the system up . Not that you should be using the pi while compiling anyway . It 'll definitely save the microsd card from extended wear and tear though . Kodi 's a lot more responsive .. I guess because it was built directly on the pi , rather than cross-compiled , or emulated in Qemu . I have n't tried it in Qemu .. yet , but I found a guide . Mate 's fine , but either I need to add a script to Kodi to enter desktop mode after exiting Kodi , or there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ran into that a few times with XBian , black screen with no command prompt . I think I messed XBian up though for that to happen . Next ... is to try using Raspian . Raspian 's the fastest os for the pi .. boots almost instantly . <p> But I just realized something else ... I should be able to build my own Kodi , right in XBian itself . It would be a simple modification . 
@@44048455 @4048455/ <p> As the title suggests , I 'm trying to install drivers for my Linksys AE6000 5g wireless usb ( mt7610u driver ) . I 've followed a few guides for the mt7601u , substituting my mt7610u source for the build . It builds without issues , then installs without issues ... but I do n't think it installed properly , as I ca n't find it with modprobe , and lsusb just shows " Linksys " .. no model number or driver number . <p> I guess I should give more information on my steps .. lol . Sorry about that . <p> First I needed to get the Vendor and Device I 'd , needed to modify rtusbdevid.c file . I 'd missed that step the first time , so I hoped that was my fix . Not so . I found a modified version of the same driver on gethub , that already had the Vendor and Device I 'd 's . Same story .. it builds , and it installs ... it just does n't load or show the full device name with lsusb . Still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reading the modified source from github , and it was modified for Ubuntu .. even though it compiled and installed . I was then reading in the source downloaded from Mediatek themselves , and it seems I missed a step at the end .. actually loading the module . <p> It gives a fatal panic saying it ca n't find it . I think it 's supposed to be sudo modprobe mt7610Usta , as that 's what 's needed for the mt7601u chip . Neither work . <p> I 'm coming from openelec , basically because it 's so damn hard to add anything to the root system unless you compile it into the entire image . Not as easy as a knoppix remaster though . And osmc 's too buggy for me . So .. I came upon xbian . So far I like it .. I can install things . It also looks like it has perl , or at least I can install it . I need that for zap2xml . <p> I went through this last night .. many times . I just ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read-me 's in my folder . <p> You 're right .. I do n't think it loaded . rt2870 should be listed after lsmod .. I 'm guessing . I have n't compiled a kernal in years , but I remember a few more steps than what I just tried . Specifically loading the module after building it . That 's what I thought " $/sbin/insmod rt2870sta.o " or " $/sbin/insmod rt2870sta.ko " would do . I just ca n't get back to where I can test it . Do I need anything else installed library-wise ? Google tells me I might need to install linux headers . <p> I figured i needed the 7610u , not the 7650u . Tried compiling the source from Mediatek 's own site .. still gave the error about " recipe for target ' LINUX ' failed " . So I decided to google about linux-headers for the pi , and came across a thread saying to just " sudo apt-get install linux-headers " .. lol . But that command will ask you to specify which linux-headers .. bcm2838 or arm(something) . Luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install .. <p> The build with the source from the main site still crashed .. lol . So I went back to the mt7650u source . The first thing I see .. is it 's using the " linux-headers-4.1.13+ " directory . It compiles , then installs . I then made sure to load the damn thing this time .. lol . <p> Code : <p> /sbin/insmod **43;4914;TOOLONG <p> Rebooted .. the little blue light started blinking .. I have connection . <p> I have 2.4g connection ... adding the 5g SSD to the **37;4959;TOOLONG results in Xbian showing the device is " Dormant " , but after hitting the SSID tab to search and fill the list .. it closes instantly . No list to be had . So either I compiled wrong , or I need to change some settings somewhere . <p> Yes , the source in your 2nd post builds 7650 module , which should support 7610 , 7630 and 7650 chiipset . Now you are at a point I ca n't help you - no wlan dongle and no 5G AP available <p> Googling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prior to 4.0 they had dual-band with this unit , but 4.1 they do n't . There 's a mt7612u available , but I ran into the same " recipe for target ' LINUX ' failed " issue . <p> Oh well .. even at 2.4g , this is still faster than the other 2.4g Tenda unit I just replaced . <p> Yep .. came across that a few times , and yes , I changed it . Not so easy to find in a terminal .. lol .. no line addresses . I needed to open with gedit in ubuntu just to see what lines preceded and followed , just to make sure I had the right instance of 2860 to change . <p> I liked the tip about commenting out all but the driver version you want . I might try that . <p> Code : <p> ifeq ( $ ( CHIPSET ) , ) CHIPSET = mt7610u endif <p> I 'm also thinking of trying that source uploaded by the ubuntu user , the x64 source that built the mt7610u.ko , but said invalid format . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headers available for the build .

It may cause more harm than good as we/you are not sure what was the root of your problem . This may require a bit of time to set all again but you be sure to have fully working and stable system . <p> If you bring your old files etc your system may get corrupt again and become unstable <p> This can be done be xbian-config menu selection 7 ( backup home ) . It builds a zipped archive from /home and put this file into folder /xbmc-backup . This folder can be accessed by Samba ( make sure that Samba is enabled and running ) . <p> To restore your /home folder , simply put this archive file into folder **29;5550;TOOLONG , it will be extracted and installed automatically . <p> But I agree with @rikardo1979 , maybe it is not good idea to do this ( backup of new /home folder may be good idea ) <p> I tried the xbian-config menu selection 7 ( backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I copied to **29;5581;TOOLONG in the other SD card where I had made the fresh install , but when I rebooted it failed to restore the settings .

What happens is that the . gz file disappears from **29;5612;TOOLONG after the next reboot , but nothing is being copied . If you tell me where to look , I can provide the log file . <p> As I have two SD cards I can test things , so I made a tar archive of . kodi in the current setup , I renamed . kodi to something else in the new setup , I replaced it with the content of the tar file . The result is that I got everything back , but the System/Settings/XBian menu failed to load , which indicates , as Rikardo1979 said , that the problem is somewhere inside the . kodi folder . And which might explain why the above mentioned restore did not work . <p> So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XBian menu works now , but I have to reconfigure everything . I will possibly try to backup selected things from the . kodi folder . <p> I think I must had misunderstood : I thought I had to put the file in **29;5643;TOOLONG and reboot in order to trigger the restore . If I am understanding now , I should instead put it there and wait for something automatic to happen . I will try to keep it in mind for the future . <p> Anyway , regarding the initial issue : the newest XBian works like a charm , including its Kodi menu in the Settings ; I gave up the idea of migrating the . kodi folder and I am now reconfiguring it manually . <p> On a side note : I see that the /boot/config.txt has been changed ( it also include comments now ) ; usbmaxcurrent=1 is there already , but I had to add hdmiignorececinit=1 , so that the RPi would not automatically wake up the TV or switch to it when it switches on . <p> The thing is that those settings refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire system before Kodi is loaded . So , if hdmiignorececinit=1 is absent , the RPi will send a HDMI CEC signal to the TV when it starts up , and the TV will change input source to it .

It also happens when the video stops and the display goes back to 60hz for the menu to display . <p> I have tried setting 50Hz from within Kodi from **37;5803;TOOLONG preferences , but when I select 50Hz it changes the refresh rate from 60Hz to 50Hz , then flashes the menu page briefly and then reverts back to 60Hz ! - It just wo n't stick on 50Hz no matter what I do . <p> Is there a config or hack to achieve this please ?

I never had this issue before so something has changed ! <p> S.

@@44048537 @4048537/ <p> Hey all , Looking for some help on a screen I have , with Xbian . I love the xbian image , it 's fast and clean and runs great ! However the screen I have attached is not going well . I had it attached to raspian ( with built in drivers for this screen ) and it works good , but any other image requires drivers to be installed manually . Notro drivers seem to work fine on newer versions of raspian , and I 've had success before with an overlay - however an overlay does n't provide the touch screen function . <p> So here 's the deal on this screen : It 's a 7 " ( or 5 depending who you ask ) HDMI LCD screen with GPIO pins for touch capability . I purchased it from " sainsmart " who sold it to me as a 7 " HDMI LCD screen ( 800x480 ) They provide an old raspbian image with an outdated kernel . It works , I suppose , for what it is . The pi shows this device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to a group of screens ( from 3.2 " to 10.1 " ) so that gave me nothing . Searching the driver package on the pre-built image ( 5HDMILCD.tar.gz ) leads me to waveshare 's 5 " screen ..... I have tried their drivers , and they work exactly the same as the ones provided by sainsmart . I 'm assuming one of those manufactures is copying the other . In any case ! I can not get it to function in Xbian . When turned on right out of the box ( freshly burned SD card with Xbian rpi3 ) the screen is all lines and colours , but then turns into the first one quarter of the xbian OS screen . Touch does not respond . I 've tried installing manufacturer drivers , but that seems to break Xbian , because after reboot , nothing loads . It stops at a kernel panic . <p> Can confirm that this method How to set up a touch screen in kodi Does NOT work on my installed Xbian . Half the steps fail - can not find xinputcalibrator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to install . No user named kodi in system . <p> This likely has to do with using Xbian which has Kodi built in and probably based on openelec or something similar .

BartOtten your a legend =O <p> Soon there will be a download counter which I hope to improve with a little modification to the download system of XBMC . It will result in a top downloads list ( so most popular addons can be found easily ) . Guess they will have their own subrepo so you can add only one small repo but still have all popular addons

@@44048555 @4048555/ <p> So What 's The Problem I ca n't find the scrapers ... my system folder does n't have anything in it and googling says that 's where they are meant to be . I see some directories and xml files for what look like the scrapers under addons but those xml files have no " CreateSearchUrl " tags in them . <p> Confused - probably just me being dumb but if you could point me the right way it would be appreciated . <p> Have you actually used cleandatetime in this way ? I understand from other posts that everything after the date will be dropped ( which in my case is the name of the film ) . Would have been a blumin obvious setting to add to enable a regexp to pull the title from the filename ! <p> Will also post back the suggestion on xbmc to add an advanced setting for a rexpexp to simply grab the filename ! What is there currently is a overly complex way to address a small subset of the possible scenarios , or is it just me that thinks that ?

In the past when I used RaspBMC , I encountered this issue , and I solved it with this settings . Now , on my Xbian powered Rpi , I set this settings too and It works too . <p> It 's a Hisense , not at home so ca n't check the model . It does n't make sense but I indeed lose dynamic contrast , sharpness , and contrast if I do n't  set it to something other than native resolution ( 1366x768 ) . I have to set it to 1920x1080 or 1280x720 and adjust for overscan . <p> All TVs are n't created equal , trust me I know how to setup my TV and KODI . This is n't just with a Raspberry , my PS3 and Odroids are the same way except the PS3 automatically sets the correct overscan . <p> My TV reports a lot of available resolutions and hz , such as 1920x1080@24hz ... etc . When in any mode other than native resolution all display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display as a PC monitor where you do n't want dynamic contrast and such since the PC will have it 's own adjustments . Most video sources ( PS3 , BluRay players ... etc ) will automatically select 720p and not 768p which is the native resolution and what a PC would select , but Pi 's and such are like PC 's and by default select the native 768p but have no extra display control features like real PC 's ( other than size adjustment ) . <p> I understand why my TV behaves this way , I do n't agree with it but I understand it . Obviously something is screwy with most display sources such as the Pi because I need no adjustment with the PS3 . I select 1080p on the PS3 and I have a perfectly aligned display , I select 1080p on the Pi in KODI and I have to ' shrink ' the picture in KODI because it does n't display properly . This is some type of issue with cheap HDMI sources such as the Raspberry Pi , like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do like you Richard and disable overscan in the TV menu and all resolutions will display correctly , but what the TV is doing when I disable overscan is essentially kicking the resolution to native 768p ( 1366x768 PC mode ) and disabling dynamic contrast , sharpness , and contrast adjustment . Stupid but true . <p> I will go a bit further and explain PC mode , PC mode disables all extra video processing to give you the fastest possible display , no video processing on the TV gives lower latencies which affect how you perceive mouse movement and doing things such as playing games where low latencies are necessary .

The swap value is automatically generated when it detects the situation . <p> If you need to change the xoffset/yoffset values . The values are large integers , the software divides by the scaler constant of 65536 .

@@44048567 @4048567/ <p> So far i found that from 3 power sockets i get internet connection with homeplug , with static or dhcp . And all the other - no connection at all , even though i do not see any problem in logs and printouts . Can it be some power problem ? I checked this plug at problematic location with my laptop , and it gets connection with no problem . <p> Maybe you have more than one power circuit in your house . The homeplug connection probably wo n't jump across different circuits . Have a look inside your breaker box - do you have two or more GPO ( general purpose outlet ) breakers ? If you switch off one of them does it only affect the circuits that do/do n't work with homeplug ? <p> Is it possible the network signal is being weakened or corrupted in the mains wiring ? <p> As the homeplug relies on filtering the network signal from the mains , perhaps there are appliances on the offending power circuits which are causing interference . You could try turning off as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problematic outlets may have too much wiring between them and the source , thus a weak signal . <p> The laptop may work as it may be able to resolve the signal from the noise more effectively .
