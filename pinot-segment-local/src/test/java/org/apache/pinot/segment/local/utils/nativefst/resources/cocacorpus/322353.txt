First and foremost , having a repair service company in close proximity means repairs can be completed faster and the maximum possible uptime maintained . Today , most manufacturing plants need replacement parts quickly . <p> Proximity means faster service and reductions in shipping costs . <p> For plant maintenance departments , the savings achieved by being close to a reputable repair service company impacts the balance sheet by extending the life of plant assets and keeping them in production . <p> To minimize manufacturing downtime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems and services , uses nearby K+S Services for some of its repair services . The fact that they are located within miles of each other helps the repairs get done quickly . <p> From a logistics standpoint , turnaround time is minimized by the close proximity .

UTC Supplier Gold is a program that facilitates and accelerates supplier performance improvements which recognizes suppliers who have achieved exceptional performance . <p> If physical proximity in terms of location has its benefits , there is no relationship closer than having a repair service representative stationed within the plant itself . <p> Proof of the success of this business model rests with the number of corporations ascribing to it . Major companies such as , Continental , GM , Fire Stone , Ford , Goodyear , GE Air , Chrysler , and UTC are current customers . <p> This success points to a very good reason why the local repair-service model should see even greater adoption by more aerospace manufacturers in the immediate future .

The premise of lighter materials strong enough to be used in the manufacture of aircraft means that not only could jets be designed to be larger and fit more passengers , but they could also run on much less fuel . Rising fuel costs and the risk of emissions trading schemes have both been targeted as key threats to the aviation market , and graphene proposes to address them both in one fell swoop . <h> Carbon electronics <p> Graphene 's almost unique properties make it ideal for use in electronics . Aside from the obvious use of making individual aircraft components lighter , graphene 's flexibility could see the creation of flexible and lightweight electronic displays . Thinner and lighter in-flight entertainment suites could feasibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , graphene could be used to replace the tangle of conventional wiring that is used within an aircraft due to its electrical conductivity . Conventional commercial aircraft can use anything up to 60 miles of copper wiring to transmit power and communication ; a substantial load for any aircraft to bear . <p> The potential to replace that with relatively simple nano-enhanced wiring could prove to be too difficult to resist , despite further technological understanding of the material being necessary . <h> Thwarting ice with a graphene jacket <p> Outside of its much vaunted manufacturing potential , SAAB has proposed a significantly more novel way in which graphene could be used within the aerospace industry . Ice has long been a thorn in the side of commercial airliners , particularly those forced to reside at airports in frigid temperatures , causing delays and cancellations to flights . Current de-icing techniques either add unnecessary weight to the aircraft , in the form of heating wires fixed inside the aircraft 's structure , or hamper green performance due to de-icing chemicals ' notoriously harmful effect on the environment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milligrams . " <p> Using graphene 's conductive properties and thinking outside the box , SAAB filed a patent application in February 2013 detailing a de-icing process with graphene at its core . Nanoplatelets of graphene are mixed into a polymer resin , with the resin applied to the aircraft body and its components to form a tight jacket around it . An electrical current can then be passed through this conductive jacket - either across the entire body of the aircraft or to specific components , such as the wings - providing heat , which would in turn melt the ice . <p> Given the physical properties of the graphene-soaked resin , it provides no detrimental effect on aerodynamics and little weight , despite being applied liberally to all of the aircraft 's fixtures and components . The high conductivity of the resin also requires little electricity to be effective , resulting in extremely low power consumption for its capabilities . The strength of the resin also makes SAAB 's de-icing technique more robust than current integrated methods due to the nanostructure 's strength . <h> Not just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pave the way for a much stronger post-recession aerospace industry . " <p> The graphene jacket also lends itself to uses other than de-icing aircraft , tapping into the full spectrum of properties the material possesses . The strength of any component coated in the resin is increased , a valuable proposition given the cost of downtime associated with broken parts , and the layered nature of the resin means that it also acts as an insulator for any heat produced . <p> It is thought the outer surface could also provide lightning protection , protecting the aircraft and de-icing system from lightning strikes and erosion related to other freak weather events , such as driving rain , hailstones and sandstorms . In essence , the resin could be tailored with separate layers designed to provide differing characteristics , providing a multipurpose coat that does far more than what it says on the tin . <p> The excitement surrounding graphene and its potential to revolutionise various elements of the aviation industry is palpable , but expectation of any carbon revolution may have to wait . Further technological developments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be used in industrial processes . <p> While always quick to embrace technological advancements , the aerospace industry has been known to stick with what is familiar , probably best typified by the way in which Boeing 's 737 aircraft - introduced in 1968 - is still in production and used almost religiously by airliners the world over . The lure of graphene and its miracle-like properties could , however , be the material to change that dependence .

The swept-wing aircraft can carry more cargo to long distances than any other aircraft of its class thanks to its 12 internal wing tanks that can store 51,150 gallons ( 194,370L ) of fuel . <p> The C-5 was inducted into service in 1970 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wings . The C-5B , an improved variant with redesigned aluminium alloy wings , fixed the problem . The current fleet of C-5 is undergoing an extensive modernisation programme to transform the C-5 Galaxy into an advanced C-5M Super Galaxy . <p> The Boeing 777-200LR , 777-300ER and 777 Freighter aircraft boast a wingspan of 64.8m . The advanced wing design allows the aircraft to ascend rapidly and fly at higher altitudes and speeds than any other aircraft in its class . It also allows the aircraft to carry a full passenger load to/from high-altitude , high-temperature airports . <p> The aerodynamic efficiency of the wings of 777-200LR and 777-300ER has been improved by incorporating raked wingtips , which reduce balanced field length and increase climb performance while minimising fuel consumption . <p> The A350 XWB from Airbus is a new family of wide-body aircraft featuring a wingspan of 64.75m . The high-tech wing on the A350 XWB improves aerodynamic performance ensuring efficiency at low speeds as well as an optimum cruise speed of Mach 0.85 . The A350 XWB includes A350-800 , A350-900 and A350-1000 versions accommodating 276 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained from the A380 design , the wing design of the A350 XWB has been optimised with aerodynamic features such as droop-nose high-lift devices and Advanced Dropped Hinge Flaps ( ADHF ) . The wing flaps can be deflected in a symmetrical and asymmetrical manner to achieve better load control and improve efficiency at higher speeds . <h> Douglas XB-19 - 64.6m ( 212ft ) <p> The Douglas XB-19 with a wingspan of 64.6m was the world 's biggest bomber aircraft when built in 1938 . The aircraft was produced as an experimental bomber for the US Army and was originally designated XBLR-2 ( Experimental Bomber - Long Range ) . <p> The XB-19 took into the skies for the first time in June 1941 . It was re-designated as the XB-19A after its engines were replaced by four Allison V-3420 24-cylinder engines . The aircraft was operational until 1949.
