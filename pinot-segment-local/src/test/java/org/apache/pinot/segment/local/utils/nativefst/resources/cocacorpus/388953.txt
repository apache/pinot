Your penalty would be $5 ( the 0.5% late-payment penalty applied to $1,000 ) , plus another dollar or so for the interest . <p> Scenario 2 : - You did n't file an extension , and you file your return on April 28 ( 10 days late ) along with your $1,000 payment .

@@45713864 @5713864/ <h> Why Tax Extensions Make Sense in a Bad Economy <p> This is a financially difficult time for many Americans , and it 's understandable that most taxpayers want to submit their tax returns as quickly as possible in order to receive their tax refund . But remember that patience is a virtue , and filing a tax extension can be useful in many situations . <p> Here are five reasons why a tax extension may be good for you , particularly in a weak economy . <p> Reason #1 A tax extension gives you more time to find every tax credit and tax deduction that you are eligible for . In these uncertain times , you want to hold onto as much of your income as you can .

It really does n't hurt to request a tax extension and wait to file until the fall season and it could end up saving you more money . <p> Reason #4 In times of financial uncertainty , you may have more immediate problems to deal with than your Federal income tax return . Take some of the burden off your shoulders by filing for a tax extension . <p> Reason #5 If you are like many Americans and the economy has forced you to change jobs , sell investments , move , or tap into your retirement account , you could probably use more time to handle your ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business owners who have gone through considerable infrastructure changes or must report greater losses .
