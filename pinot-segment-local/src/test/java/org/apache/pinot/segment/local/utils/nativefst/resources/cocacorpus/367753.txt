Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland , the central securities depository , and EMXCo , the UKs leading provider of fund order routing , are combining forces to deliver the benefits of processing automation and standardisation to those who invest in funds domiciled in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . <p> In addition to gaining substantial cost savings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to shift from the norm of cheque-in-the-post payment to fully secure book-entry settlement of fund units and cash . Moreover , full settlement of unit trust and OEIC transactions will be able to occur on T+4 , i.e. four days after order placement , which is significantly shorter than current industry practice . <p> Lengthy paper trails Today , investors typically send their orders via phone or fax to their financial advisors , who in turn add more paper to the chain when instructing the fund distributor to subscribe to or redeem a holding in a fund . Further downstream , the fund management company accepts and confirms these orders via a mix of proprietary electronic channels and/or fax , email or post , and will only settle the order upon receipt of a cheque for the right cash amount . Then the legal register has to be changed by the third-party administrator using physical forms to reflect the actual movement in or out of a fund . <p> This administrative nightmare will disappear with the introduction of automated fund-transaction processing . <p> Following work done by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , a change in UK law has eliminated the need for paper-based procedures in transferring title in UK authorised funds by third-party administrators . In essence , product providers will no longer need to maintain paper records , such as renunciation of title or stock transfer forms . <p> Reduced risks Settlement risk is greatly decreased because there is no manual intervention from the moment a fund order is placed by IFAs or fund supermarkets using the EMX Message System for order routing , to the moment settlement of the redemption/subscription order occurs at Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland . <p> Furthermore , reporting and exception management is handled in a fully electronic way via the central processing hub . The fact that fund units can be sold and cash recouped within four business days makes for a very attractive proposition for investors that may not have considered buying into a fund due to the cumbersome and timely exit periods , should they need to change their investment strategy quickly . Multi-faceted benefits of automation The investment fund industry has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Fund and Asset Management Association , for the first quarter of 2009 , positive net inflows into UCITS funds totalled 19 billion , compared with net outflows of 124 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 . <p> While the green shoots of recovery are welcome , cost and risk reductions are still top priorities for asset managers and distributors alike . Previously relegated as a back-office issue , fund unit processing is now highly topical and influential in gaining distributor support . Many have turned to neutral , third-party processing solutions to achieve greater operational efficiency at the lowest possible price . <p> Commission solution One of the biggest headaches that distributors face in not being automated is correctly calculating and receiving commissions . When done manually , this is a painstaking process , as at any point in time distributors , fund promoters and others involved in the transaction need to know exactly who has bought what and held it for how long . Parameters like these dictate the commissions due . Furthermore , as investment strategies increasingly go beyond domestic market funds , distributors often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time zones for commission calculation . <p> In electing to use an automated processing hub , all of these commission-based challenges can become a great deal easier . The central hub automatically collects and routes orders from the fund distributor to the relevant fund promoters third-party administrator ( TPA ) . Some processing hubs enable TPAs that are linked into the hub to precisely see the portion of activity that has emanated from individual distributors for each and every fund for which the TPA runs the books . Much improved reconciliation capabilities are part of Euroclear UK &amp; Irelands new service . Position tracking will not only be more accurate , but more timely as well , improving the overall process and removing expensive errors . <p> Efficiency gains Via the use of an automated infrastructure , TPAs can accurately calculate commissions due and payments can be credited electronically and expeditiously to distributors and others in a matter of days . This is in contrast to delays of weeks , or sometimes months , in cases where the TPA has to collect a stream of different reports from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate commissions on a spread sheet . <p> Promoters are growing impatient , and rightly so . They are applying pressure , particularly given current financial market conditions , on distribution partners to embrace automation which will reduce errors and speed up commission calculations . Fortunately , many distributors are listening and making processing automation a top priority . <p> Already , more than 50% of the European fund industry that links the sell and the buy side have accepted the age of automation . They have been convinced of the tremendous value and cost savings to be gained through economies of scale and automated transaction processing . <p> While cost savings are an economic necessity , an equally important driver is the ability to process unit trust transactions in the safest and most efficient environment possible a definite win-win situation for all . <p> Pressure for change Heightened regulatory focus is expected both in the UK and mainland Europe , which will also have an impact on how firms manage operational risks . Calls for better risk management in our industry have become impossible to ignore , partly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seeing wider recognition that our industry would be better protected through automation . Infrastructure processing hubs are proven solutions ; they are cheap and address many of the areas of concern . <p> The financial crisis has shown that the unthinkable is conceivable . How much more of a warning do we need to change the way we work ? It is clear that automated infrastructure processing hubs have passed the test .

@@76946792 @5646792/ <h> Technical briefing : Making sense of tax breaks <p> There will be winners and losers as a new -5,000 dividend allowance is introduced from April and advisers should review wrappers and seek fresh solutions to ensure investors make most of the new tax break . <p> From April there will be major reforms to UK dividend taxation . UK-resident investors will have a tax-free allowance to offset against the dividend income . But what impact will this have on their choice of investment wrapper ? And does it tilt the balance in the offshore bond versus mutual funds argument ? <p> There will be both winners and losers when the 5,000 ( $7,234 , 6,440 ) annual dividend allowance is introduced in the 2016-17 tax year . Higher-rate taxpayers could be better off by up to 1,250 a year ( 1,530 for additional-rate taxpayers ) but some basic-rate taxpayers could be worse off by as much as 2,025 . Personal circumstances will ultimately determine the most appropriate investment solution for UK investors . <h> Winners and losers <p> So what is changing ? From 6 April 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 10% tax credit will disappear . Instead , the first 5,000 of dividend income will always be tax-free for everyone ( see table below ) . <p> And the rates of tax are changing too for dividends exceeding this allowance . What this means is that most basic-rate taxpayers will be no worse off than this , unless they have dividends in excess of 5,000 . While 5,000 should be sufficient to cover the dividends for most basic-rate taxpayers , they will have to pay 7.5% on amounts over the allowance from next April . <p> The real winners are higher-rate taxpayers and additional-rate taxpayers with dividends of less than 5,000 each year . On dividends up to the allowance , the former would be 1,250 and the latter 1,530 better off each year . <h> Tipping point <p> But what about when the dividend is greater than the allowance ? There is a tipping point where the tax savings on the first 5,000 are outweighed by the higher rates of tax imposed on dividends in excess of the allowance . <p> That point arrives when dividends hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional-rate taxpayers . <p> Where dividends are below this figure , clients are still better off . Above it , clients will be paying more tax on their dividends than in previous years . <p> It is important to note that the full amount of dividend received , even if covered by the 5,000 allowance , will still count towards total income when determining income and capital gains tax rates . <p> What does it mean ? The abolition of the 10% credit will not affect the amount of dividend that is distributed . <p> The tax credit was only ever a notional credit 10% tax is not deducted on distribution . The credit merely reflects the fact that the dividend was paid out of a companys profits after corporation tax , so investors will receive exactly the same amount . <p> But how dividends are taxed will change . No tax credit means no more grossing up is required . The amount received is the amount subject to tax , with the first 5,000 of dividends tax-free ( see case study below ) . <p> It is worth noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used against this first so these individuals could receive even more than 5,000 of dividends tax-free . <h> Where to save ? <p> There are many non-tax factors that will need to be considered but putting these to one side and just focusing on the tax-planning aspects , it is the availability of reliefs and allowances that will generally determine the best place to save . <h> Fund taxation <p> Investment returns across all tax wrappers will be unchanged equity investments will still pay out the same amount of dividend and funds have for many years been unable to reclaim the notional tax credit . <h> Mutual funds and offshore bonds <p> The new dividend allowance makes a compelling argument for building a collective portfolio where income and gains can be managed within the respective allowances . This can be achieved by keeping dividend income to below 5,000 per annum , and realising capital gains annually from their portfolio within the annual capital gains tax ( CGT ) exemption ( 11,100 for 2015/16 ) . <p> The portfolio value at which no tax will be due will depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if allowances are fully used ( see table opposite ) . <p> Of course , any re-allocation of assets to achieve income and gains at these levels would also have to be appropriate to the risk profile of the investor . <h> Excess dividends <p> Where fund values produce a dividend in excess of the allowance , and capital growth can not be managed out annually using the annual CGT exemption , the choice becomes more difficult . And this can often be the case where funds are being actively managed and portfolios being regularly rebalanced . <p> Offshore bonds can protect the excess dividends from an immediate tax charge as they arise , because they defer the tax charge until surrenders are taken . Bonds roll up dividend income within the fund that will eventually be taxed under the chargeable event legislation and converted from dividend income to savings income . <p> Bond holders are taxed at their highest marginal rates of income tax ( 20% , 40% or 45% ) on the bond gain . <p> But if they can take their bond profits at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oeics . <p> Oeics will have suffered a tax drag on income during the investment period , and capital gains in excess of allowances on withdrawal could be hit with an 18% or 28% tax charge . <p> A gain from offshore bonds is savings income that , of course , has its own 5,000 tax-free band , although this is withdrawn when earned income begins to exceed the personal allowance . <p> And , in addition , from April the personal savings allowance ( 1,000 for basic-rate taxpayers/500 for higher-rate taxpayers ) . <p> As a result , to maximise the benefits of a bond , the trick is to extract at 0% tax , for example by surrendering while non-UK resident , using as a bridging pension by deferring taking benefits from pension plans , or assigning to non-taxpayers such as grandchildren at university who can cash in to finance their studies . <p> If this can not be achieved , top-slice relief may be available to avoid or reduce higher-rate tax on any gains . <h> Existing investments <p> The changes may trigger a review of clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrappers must be balanced against any immediate tax charges as a result of disinvestment . <p> A phased strategy of disinvestment across a number of tax years may also be considered to maximise the use of available allowances and reduce the tax payable . <p> The most suitable wrapper will always come down to individual circumstances . This has not changed . But with fresh tax allowances available it makes sense to ensure these are not wasted and this could see a continued place for both investment wrappers as part of diversified portfolio . LW

By the end of 2015 it had seen average annual growth in regular savings new business of 43% . One of the main drivers behind this growth appears to have been the introduction of the Quantum savings plan , aided by its entry into new territories such as Latin America . <p> The following product review aims to discover why many advisers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain markets . <p> Quantum is a regular premium offshore savings policy offered by RL360 in the Isle of Man . With initial premium levels as low as 200 per month for a 10 year term , Quantum provides an investment option for even the modest investor . Some features of the product are : <p> Both life assurance and capital redemption options are available <p> Available in seven currencies <p> Free online fund switching and no limit on the number of funds due to a low minimum fund holding <p> Investors can take premium holidays for up to two years <p> Policy segmentation of up to 100 policies <p> Subject to the premium size , Quantum offers up to 102% allocation throughout the lifetime of the policy , which differs to other products that only offer increased allocation rates for an initial periods . By offering the increased allocation on all premiums paid after the initial period , this is giving clients increased value to their " accumulation " units , which are n't  subject to early surrender penalties . <p> There is also the option of up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the term and premium value chosen , although this additional allocation will not count towards the surrender value of the policy if it is surrendered in the first five years . <p> The charges applicable on the product are typical of those in the market : <p> Initial unit charge of 0.5% per month of the " initial " unit value <p> 5 ( or currency equivalent ) per month policy fee <p> Annual charge of 1.5% of fund value , taken monthly <p> The majority of the products on the market have similar charges to this , so it is in the features and benefits of products where companies are trying to win a client base . <p> One feature that allows Quantum to stand out from its competitors are the investment options available .

And in a time when a lot of products are charging clients for making their premium payments by credit card , RL360 have waived these fees on Quantum . <p> Loyalty bonuses are a popular feature on life products , but are often entwined with numerous caveats which mean that the client will often never see their bonus . This can be a ploy by some life companies to ensure their maturity projections look favourable against the competition . Quantum has a loyalty bonus that is applied at maturity .

There has also been a tightening and refocusing of regulatory frameworks in particular jurisdictions across the globe , such as Singapore . <p> These regulatory changes fundamentally alter how companies operate , the attractiveness of markets , the shape of products , the distribution avenues available and the capital required in the short , medium and long term to fund businesses . <p> Many companies that may have thrived in past decades are unable to exist in their previous format in the evolving regulatory landscape .

This risk comes from not being part of a logical , articulable story in a de-risked and generally risk-averse world since 2008/9 . <h> Example 2 : Royal london changes tack <p> A good example of this change has been the development of RL360 . <p> In 2013 , Royal London entered into an agreement with funds advised by independent private equity firm Vitruvian Partners to support a management-led buyout of RL360 Insurance Company and its subsidiaries . This followed a change in focus and market appetite by the UK mutual parent . <p> Royal London 360 was rebranded as RL360 following the transaction , with senior management remaining in place and co-investing alongside the private equity fund . <p> In November 2015 , the RL360 Group acquired the closed offshore life company CMI Insurance Company from Lloyds Banking Group , adding around 4bn in funds under management and significant synergies .

Some say financial literacy has improved with a willingness for DIY , while others suggest people with assets and appreciated needs are more time poor and increasingly dependent . There is some truth in each of these theories and also some behaviours in between . <p> But one of the common characteristics is that customers have higher digital expectations and are more mobile . Customer experience has rarely been led by the digital capability of financial services providers and advisory distribution . Rather their expectations are met after a time lag . <h> Adoption of technology <p> Customers that have been exposed to digital capability through other commercial interactions for some time have exerted a digital pull as a result on the offshore/international financial services industry , which has in general been slow to respond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology and digital solutions in order to meet client needs and aspirations is a perfect marriage between this pull and the cost/margin pressures organisations find themselves under . <p> Technology solutions may finally be delivering what customers have been asking for but in fact they are as much a requirement for financial services providers , distributors and advisers to deliver effectively at scale and reduce cost . <p> The holy grail of granting the customer more digital self-service may have taken time to realise but is now a firm characteristic of market development . <p> Alongside a range of own capability being put in place by life companies and advisers , with tools and portals etc , a key development of this is the growing presence in the international financial services arena of platforms . <p> Some platforms have operated in the offshore/international arena for some time , Praemium , Arden and Platform One , but others are entering from other markets , Novia from the UK , for example . <h> Example 3 : Novia offshoot <p> Novia developed an international proposition in 2014 , leveraging off its successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novia Globalis a response to Novia recognising there was significant opportunity due to due to increased appetite from from international advisers for technological solutions in meeting client investment needs and growing scalable cost efficient businesses . <p> The Novia platform offers access to features and functionality such as a broad range of funds and investment assets through a general investment account and cash facility , and mulitple tax wrappers . Online financial planning , portfolio construction and investment tools are available , together with management information reports and rebalancing/switching options . <h> Capital attitude <p> Just as many groups have found the international arena or their offshore subsidiaries falling off the core business agenda , other sources of capital and strategic focus have seen the potential opportunities and appraised the risks as manageable . <p> While some bank and insurer capital has moved away from these markets , which are often seen as subscale and disproportionately risky , private equity sources with a sometimes closer focus on risk and return potential have seized the opportunity . <p> They have been able to apply more singular focus to the regulatory landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital backing international product providers is starting to change . <p> Private equity investment in international life companies is becoming increasingly common and competitive .

Alongside the 2,500 stocks in this index , Zhou considers a further 3,000 securities , moving his potential universe down the cap scale . <p> " We start with data . We are guided by theory and market intuition , we form expected returns for all those assets and then we put together a portfolio given our clients constraints , " he says . <h> Portfolio building <p> Admittedly , 5,500 companies is a pretty big universe but there are plenty of other fund groups that have far larger universes from which to design highly concentrated portfolios . <p> But for these fund groups , visiting the companies they are considering invest in is an integral part of the investment process .

We do not know if a chief executive officer is going through a divorce , whether the product is a flop or if the customers are dissatisfied . But even though we do n't  know those things , some people in the market do and their information will be revealed one way or another , " he says . <p> His logic is that analysts , venture capitalists and other investors are already following these companies ; and their knowledge , both quantitative and qualitative , will be reflected in publicly available information .

Given the topic under discussion , he is quick to say that he finds no need to separate growth from value , adding that nobody wants to buy anything that has neither value nor the opportunity to grow . <p> " If you think about modern financial theory , what is really driving abnormal returns is not growth itself but unexpected growth . If a company grows just slightly better than people expect , the return to the company can be very good . <p> " If growth is slower than people expect the return could be negative .

" He adds : " A central principle in accounting is conservatism . You want to record potential losses but not potential gains that is conservatism . <p> " To quote Warren Buffet : There are two important rules : rule number one , do not lose money ; rule number two , do not forget rule number one. <p> " History shows long-term success in investing depends on making fewer catastrophic mistakes than more heroic wins .

He also owns a couple of airlines ( specifically referencing the unexpected growth argument he made earlier ) , automobile manufacturers and technology companies in the US . All in , Apple is the largest single holding but this still represents just 3% of the total . <p> Apple contributes 1% to his strategys active share , the difference between the 3% of the fund that is in Apple and 2% in the benchmark . <p> " Many investors , " he says , " claim to be benchmark-agnostic until they start underperforming the benchmark ; then they become very benchmark aware so we want to prevent this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much you deviate from the benchmark and where you take the active risks .

This is something they have done on behalf of institutional investors since 2010 , before launching a UCITs version at the end of last year . <p> " We start with data .

" I have not moved job in the 16 years since I joined Matheson in 1997 . The names may have changed but the number of people that have been around for the entire period is quite high and the investment process has been relatively consistent albeit with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more technical . " <p> Oliver , investment director at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management , started his career in 1994 with Kleinwort Benson in Guernsey , and then after a brief six-month stint at Generali , he joined Collins Stewart in December 2000 where he has been ever since . <p> Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management now includes a client-facing UK office in London , as well as an offshore-focused operation of some 168 people including front office staff as well as those who oversee corporate functions such as compliance , IT and legal matters . Client-facing , internationally focused offices are located in Guernsey , Jersey , the Isle of Man and Geneva , and form part of the parent groups assets under management and administration of around 16.8bn . <h> Sticking to principles <p> Cuming says he believes one of the reasons that Canaccord purchased Collins Stewart was that it liked its wealth management offering and the way the investment process was organised . <p> " In terms of changes to our investment process there has been none whatsoever , there has been total continuity . Rather than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been purchased , it would seem more likely that Canaccord will start using some of our practices in their domestic market and indeed elsewhere around the world . " <p> One example of this is Canaccords interest in seeing how it can utilise the Quest system , a proprietary stock research tool , to analyse Canadian equities . <p> " Quest gives a defined methodology in terms of equity selection they very much like the way it operates and they are looking to use Quest to put together lists of approved and recommended Canadian stocks . " <p> Cuming emphasises that the investment philosophy focuses on capital preservation and points to this years approach of maintaining a modest bond and equity underweight position . <p> " The rally from the March 2009 lows had got ahead of itself . We were feeling a little bit uncomfortable until quite recently , looking at the UK market approaching 16% up on the year . But because we fundamentally did n't  trust the rally we werent going to abandon our principles . " <h> Theory of evolution <p> Another key feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its constant evolution . <p> " Like a lot of investment managers , we found our participation in the market setback in 2008 humbling and we 've been working extremely hard ever since to embed risk and risk analysis more centrally into our investment processes . <p> " This translates into managing portfolios very efficiently in line with clients stated risk profiles in order to maximise risk-adjusted returns . <p> " So our mindset is that it is better to avoid the bad periods in markets rather than trying to chase bull markets . We would aim to capture a decent percentage of the rising market , but because of our inherent conservatism , we think well offer a much better prospect of capital preservation when times get slightly harder . " <p> Cuming is worried about the lack of a significant sizeable setback in the US . " Ive been worried all year about markets going higher on relatively low volume . The technical space of the market has worried me hence our cautious stance . " <p> Although underweight in equities , Cuming likes the US market , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth and has proved resilient in the face of budget sequestration and other tightening measures . <p> By contrast , he has found it easy to underweight Europe though he says one of the next big asset calls is whether to increase exposure there . <p> While also underweight in Asia for a while , this year he has used a market setback as an opportunity to increase exposure to Asia and the US . <p> Having missed the rally in Japan , he says the balance of probabilities is that it will make " good progress and owning Japanese equities on a hedged basis is something we might introduce if we can find a decent entry point in the next month or so , " says Cuming . <p> " We were finding last year that during a two hour asset allocation meeting , we were spending an hour and a half of it discussing Japan for our benchmark which is all of 3% . " <p> Having a positive long-term view of equities , his mindset is more to be buying on dips than perhaps it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at emerging market stocks they are now trading at substantial discounts to developed equity markets and if we can again finess a position into China at some stage , I think that will be on the agenda . " <h> Opportunity knocks <p> In the search for strategies to reduce risk in portfolios , government bonds have been used by Canaccord " quite successfully " as a diversifier of equity market risk . <p> " There are opportunities in credit but we are keeping duration quite short . Were quite conservative in the market . In my working career , bond yields have come down in the UK from in excess of 20% to 1.6% . There is an end of the game feeling in the government bond markets , the 30-year bond market , but the bull bond market is now more or less history . " <p> An example of a US dollar portfolio with a medium-risk mandate is shown in the chart ( below ) , which Oliver says has a high weighting to dollar bonds and US equities " as much to control currency risk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on particular sectors or themes within markets , and Oliver gives two specific examples . <p> " We were early to spot the potential in healthcare stocks , for example . We gave exposure to Polar Capital Healthcare funds 18 months ago and have done extremely well out of that . Equity markets have been driven by these defensive areas which almost come about from investors trying to find bond proxies in the stock market . <p> He adds that healthcare weighting was reduced recently in order to take profits and reinvest in other more cyclical areas which were becoming more attractive . The core funds listed represent some of the themes . <p> Also within the sector specific weighting there is exposure to technology . " We are trying to focus on areas of relative value . Our analysis has shown that technology stocks are trading at multi-year relative lows at a time when many of these sub-sectors have been performing well . In the US , most of the sub-sectors of technology have outpaced the market in terms of their sales and earnings growth , " Oliver says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Canaccord Genuity Global Opportunity Fund , which is constructed of conviction positions around five to seven key themes . The ideas are driven by top-down asset allocation , bottom-up fund selection , sector/thematic opportunities and contrarian thinking . <p> This fund has always had a thematic bias , which Oliver says sits well with the world of expats , who " by definition tend to have a higher risk tolerance " . <p> " Often they have a narrower timescale to maximise their savings and investments . We found this portfolio resonates well with the expat community . As an investment house it is good when you can explain a story rather than just being able to say we bought that because the PE is 12 against the long-term average of 15 . " <p> Oliver adds : " We like to have an unfettered approach to our investments . This portfolio is our best ideas for making money . " <p> Cuming argues that historically expats made the mistake of being too UK-centric in their positioning . <p> " We had the classic example years ago of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK gilts and trying to fund a Spanish lifestyle from a UK-based investment . What we like about the global opportunity fund is that it is global . <p> " At the back of investment managers minds should be the measured decline of the West relative to emerging markets in Asia . And I think portfolios do have to become genuinely more global and try and get into general themes that are going to make you big money over the longer term . The balance of probability is that sterling and other western currencies will lose value over the longer term to the rest of the world . "

And the market is covered by a lot fewer analysts too : according to FE Analytics data , there are about five times more large cap than small cap funds in the European equity space . <p> Because there are so many stocks to choose from and no single stock has a benchmark weighting of more than 0.5% , small cap managers are naturally less focused on a benchmark than their large cap counterparts , explains Nicholas Williams , head of small cap equities at Barings . 69857 @qwx689857 <p> Tjibbe joined Expert Investor as a senior reporter in March 2014 .

Regulatory risk and its overall consideration has therefore risen towards the top of the business critical ' list . <p> Put simply , there is a raft of legislative and regulatory change that has impacted on the way in which international life companies , asset managers and intermediaries operate . <p> These include large pan-European regulatory frameworks such as Solvency II ( and its equivalent ) for insurers , through to Mifid , Fatca and many more . There has also been a tightening and refocusing of regulatory frameworks in particular jurisdictions across the globe , such as Singapore . <p> These regulatory changes fundamentally alter how companies operate , the attractiveness of markets , the shape of products , the distribution avenues available and the capital required in the short , medium and long term to fund businesses . <p> Many companies that may have thrived in past decades are unable to exist in their previous format in the evolving regulatory landscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure continued success ( see box 1 ) . <h> Example 1 : SLI remodels <p> Standard Life International has adjusted its business model , withdrawing from fledgling distribution operations in Dubai and Singapore due in part to regulatory and structural market changes , which affected its opportunities . Focusing on its more mature and valuable UK market activity , SLI should see a reduced requirement for capital as the business moves towards a capital generative position . <h> Initiatives and re-evaluations <p> In recent years , financial services groups , including banks and insurance companies , have overwhelmingly pursued a strategy of focusing on core competencies . <p> In part driven by regulatory pressures , the old mantra of targeting growth across the waterfront ' , both within sectors in terms of product range or in terms of multi-sectors ( insurers establishing or owning banks and banks establishing or owning insurers , for example ) , has now fallen away . <p> Instead , they have reviewed their core- business purpose and re-established what they do well and at scale .

UK-resident investors will have a tax-free allowance to offset against the dividend income . But what impact will this have on their choice of investment wrapper ? And does it tilt the balance in the offshore bond versus mutual funds argument ? <p> There will be both winners and losers when the -5,000 ( $7,234 , G6,440 ) annual dividend allowance is introduced in the 2016-17 tax year . Higher-rate taxpayers could be better off by up to -1,250 a year ( -1,530 for additional-rate taxpayers ) but some basic-rate taxpayers could be worse off by as much as -2,025 . Personal circumstances will ultimately determine the most appropriate investment solution for UK investors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From 6 April 2016 , the method for taxing dividends received by individuals will change . The 10% tax credit will disappear . Instead , the first -5,000 of dividend income will always be tax-free for everyone ( see table below ) . <p> And the rates of tax are changing too for dividends exceeding this allowance . What this means is that most basic-rate taxpayers will be no worse off than this , unless they have dividends in excess of -5,000 . While -5,000 should be sufficient to cover the dividends for most basic-rate taxpayers , they will have to pay 7.5% on amounts over the allowance from next April . <p> The real winners are higher-rate taxpayers and additional-rate taxpayers with dividends of less than -5,000 each year . On dividends up to the allowance , the former would be -1,250 and the latter -1,530 better off each year . <h> Tipping point <p> But what about when the dividend is greater than the allowance ? There is a tipping point where the tax savings on the first -5,000 are outweighed by the higher rates of tax imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point arrives when dividends hit : <p> -21,660 for higher-rate taxpayers ; <p> -25,400 for additional-rate taxpayers . <p> Where dividends are below this figure , clients are still better off . Above it , clients will be paying more tax on their dividends than in previous years . <p> It is important to note that the full amount of dividend received , even if covered by the -5,000 allowance , will still count towards total income when determining income and capital gains tax rates . <p> What does it mean ? The abolition of the 10% credit will not affect the amount of dividend that is distributed . <p> The tax credit was only ever a notional credit " 10% tax is not deducted on distribution . The credit merely reflects the fact that the dividend was paid out of a company 's profits after corporation tax , so investors will receive exactly the same amount . <p> But how dividends are taxed will change . No tax credit means no more grossing up is required . The amount received is the amount subject to tax , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> It is worth noting that if an investor has unused personal allowance , dividends would be used against this first " so these individuals could receive even more than -5,000 of dividends tax-free . <h> Multimedia <h> Features 69861 @qwx689861 69860 @qwx689860

@@76947104 @5647104/ <p> Curve balls are swinging in from all directions , as goalposts move faster around the pitch than an Olympic sprinter . <p> While all of this is going on , it is worth giving a thought- to a key but sometimes overlooked element of- UK pensions that is starting to crop up with increasing regularity in discussions about pensions management : liquidity . <p> The matter of liquidity ought to come into play early on in the pension-building process , since the starting point for anyone advising on a personal pension arrangement involves determining what , exactly , constitutes a suitable investment . <p> Certainly- many Self Invested Personal Pension ( SIPP ) trustees are examining the liquidity question with fresh eyes now , as as they contemplate the new SIPP rules . <p> That 's because , should these rules be implemented " as proposed by the FSA 's consulation paper on SIPPs , published last November " then the capital adequacy requirements of SIPPs could increase 10-fold . <p> The FSA consultation paper includes a list of " standard " assets , while others , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , will be subject to a surcharge . The FSA reasons that this is needed because these assets would take longer to transfer , in the event that a SIPP firm were to have to be wound down . <p> Firms would be required to hold core capital , to meet the standard capital requirement , in a form that could be realised within a year . Capital held against the surcharge , to cover the risks of more complex investments , would have to be kept in a form that could be converted to cash within 30 days . <p> To some extent , some of these considerations should also be taken into account by advisers who are recommending Qualifying Recognised Overseas ' Pensions ( QROPS ) to their clients . <h> What a pension is for <p> At this point , it is also worth reminding ourselves what a pension is for : that is , what it is supposed to provide to the pension holder and his or her beneficiaries . <p> Income in retirement for the member and/or spouse , or death benefits for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Therefore , is it important that the investments within the pension fund are capable of providing income or death benefits , as and when the situation dictates . <p> So in the event of the death of the pension holder , assuming he or she has never purchased an annuity : <p> If the individual who owns the pension dies during his or her retirement : the funds should be able to continue to provide an income in drawdown , be available as a lump sum to buy an annuity , or to make a lump sum payment to his or her dependant(s) . <p> ( With respect to the latter , should a surviving spouse not wish to continue with income drawdown in a SIPP , then HM Revenue &amp; Customs will want 55% of the fund in tax ; QROPS , however , for long-term non-UK residents , will not suffer this tax charge . ) <p> If the individual who owns the pension dies before he or she retires : the fund should be available as a lump sum for his or her dependants/beneficiaries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should consider the liquidity of the funds their schemes invest in , with a keen awareness at all times of the need , ultimately , for the schemes to pay benefits " ( which , we have established above , is the purpose of the pension in the first place ) . <p> In other words , they must think about the ease with which the component investments might be sold , and be keenly aware of any cost or early encashment penalties that might exist or accrue . <h> Lump Sum Death Benefit- SIPPs <p> It is very important that the trustees be able to distribute the fund to the dependants and/or beneficiaries within a reasonable timescale , when the time comes . For one thing , these funds may well be urgently needed by those family members who were financially dependent on the deceased . <p> Secondly , the investments must be able to be sold , surrendered ( without huge penalties ) , or assigned within two years of death . Failure to do so will , as mentioned , incur a 55% unauthorised payment charge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beneficiaries . <p> The option to hold on until an investment matures , or a building is completed or sold , therefore , may well be a luxury that can not be exercised . <h> Pension transfers to SIPPs and QROPS <p> There are a multitude of well-trodden issues to consider before transferring a pension to either a SIPP or a QROPS , one of them being the death benefits . <p> It is clear , from some of the advertising that we have all seen , that often it appears that the only reason for the transfer is to provide better death benefits than the ceding scheme . <p> Without going into the rights of wrongs of this being an acceptable sole reason for a transfer , the adviser must take into account the liquidity of the investments if death benefits are deemed to be important to the client . This is particularly important if there will be no other capital available for the beneficiaries . <p> New classes of assets for pensions have been surfacing for some time , and are becoming more and more popular for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structured notes ; land banking , forestry , and biofuels-based funds ; traded life settlements , and off-plan properties in exotic locations . <p> While many of these investments will hold attractions for some investors , a pension adviser considering one or more of them for a client 's pension must keep liquidity at the forefront of his considerations . If such investments are deemed to meet the client 's needs and objectives , an adviser might recommend a term assurance product as a back-up , to cover any potential loss of death benefits during the relevant investment period , just in case . <h> Questioning the wisdom <p> Meanwhile , the FSA and leading pension commentators have recently begun to question the wisdom of some of these investments forming a large part , or indeed all , of anyone 's pension fund . <p> Liquidity , they are pointing out , needs to be sufficient to allow the payment of benefits and , importantly , sufficient to cover the running costs of the SIPP. - A SIPP can not go overdrawn , and should not expose itself to possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting the buffers , and the situation is likely to get a lot worse soon , if recent press reports are to be believed . <h> Food for thought <p> If , as an adviser , one of the reasons you are recommending a client transfer a pension is the death benefits , then the ability to redeem , sell or assign the investments has got to be an overriding consideration . No one wants to get hit by that curve ball , and miss the goal . <p> And there is no question that if you get the levels of liquidity wrong in the pensions you advise on , the consequences for your clients , and their families , could be severe . <p> To see and download the FSA 's consultation paper , A new capital regime for Self-Invested Personal Pension ( SIPP ) operators , click here .

@@76947106 @5647106/ <p> We start 2015 with a stark reminder of how terrorist activity can disrupt communities and shock nations . Paris was the unfortunate location for both incidents and our thoughts are with the victims and families following these terrible events . <p> How do the financial markets react to major terrorist attacks ? A 2005 study by Ohio State University identified 75 terrorist-related attacks on specific companies and found that the average loss per firm ( per attack ) was $401m of its market capitalisation . <p> Over recent years the focus of terrorism has shifted increasingly from small scale military to major civilian targets , and from individuals to business activities . Given the intertwined nature of today 's global economy , the aftermath of terrorist attacks often spills over to a country 's immediate trading partners and then beyond . <p> It is the indirect costs of terrorism which can be significant and hinder the economy in the medium term by undermining consumer and investor confidence ; causing a tendency to save rather than spend . <p> This also has the potential to trigger a generalised drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of borrowing , slow demand for emerging market output and raise global commodity prices . <p> An interesting 2005 IMF Working Paper specifically looked at the reaction of the financial markets to the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York ; and 11 March 2004 attacks in Madrid . Encouragingly , its conclusion was that well-functioning financial markets , bolstered by prompt and effective reaction from relevant authorities , were generally efficient in absorbing the shocks stemming from terrorist attacks . <h> A coordinated response <p> Following their short term operational disruption , the financial markets demonstrated some resilience together with a capacity to quickly return to normalcy . <p> The effectiveness of the possible rapid and co-ordinated response by the authorities should n't be underestimated . <p> Immediately after 9/11 , the Federal Reserve made available its discount window to meet short term liquidity needs as well as deploying a wide range of instruments needed to ensure sufficient liquidity , ensure payments systems were operational and keep markets open . <p> A $100bn unprecedented liquidity injection together with highly accommodative policy also helped calm and stabilise the broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equity markets felt the biggest impact from the 11 September attacks and experienced sharp and major declines on a global basis . <p> Between 17 and 21 September , the S&amp;P 500 index fell by 11.6% and the NASDAQ technology index declined by over 16% . Spill-over was experienced globally , with the European equity markets falling even further than the US " the DJ Euro Stoxx lost over 17% between the 11 and 21 September ; possibly because it re-opened more quickly after the attack . <p> By way of contrast , while the human loss of life was equally tragic the terrorist attacks on Spain were felt much less by the capital markets . <p> In the euro area , the DJ Euro Stoxx index fell by around 3% on 11 March and continued to fall over the following days but had almost completely recovered by the end of the month as had the S&amp;P 500 . <p> Investor confidence deteriorated beyond national boundaries in the aftermath of both attacks due to contagion effects . However while the New York attack raised fears regarding the stability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having a mostly regional effect . <p> 9/11 occurred in the midst of a global economic downturn but the terrorist attacks in Madrid happened when the world economy was growing strongly . Broad fiscal stimulus and other economic support measures were deemed unnecessary ; and the European Central Bank felt comfortable leaving its refinancing and interest rates unchanged . <p> Our conclusion might be that the impact of terrorist attacks on the financial markets varies but the after-effects of even a large scale attack can be dampened by a co-ordinated policy response , open liquidity provision and effective disaster recovery plans . <p> Global economies are interlinked and asset prices highly correlated across different markets but markets generally fulfil their function of rapidly assimilating news and absorbing shocks . <p> Those parts of our equity portfolio exposed to sensitive sectors including financials and oil-related industries , such as airlines and car manufacturers , could well experience sharp sell-offs but we rely on safety net ' stocks including IT/physical security and defense to provide some support . <p> Tom Richards is head of private investment management ( Offshore ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx689860
