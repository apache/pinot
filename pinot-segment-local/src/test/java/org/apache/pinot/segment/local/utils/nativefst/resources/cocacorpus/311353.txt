@@24982352 @4982352/ <h> New Ways to Pay for Low-Priority Drug Trials <p> The last decade has seen many pharmaceutical companies successfully expand their research and development operations , resulting in robust pipelines of promising new therapies in the early stages . However , with the cost of the clinical trial process for a drug today as high as $115m , drug makers must deal with the reality that they do not have the resources to develop every asset in their overflowing pipelines in a timely manner . <p> Without the capital to invest , many promising but lower-priority therapies are sitting on a shelf , potentially losing companies billions each year in lost revenues . Delayed clinical trials result in delayed registration and patient access , plus shortened patent lives . <p> While the impact and scale of this problem varies from company to company and across geographies and therapeutic areas , companies are employing a variety of strategies and approaches to limit their losses . Trial acceleration ( for example , by moving sites or using simplifying trial design ) , limited operationalization and co-development deals with third parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a profitable timeline . <p> A new way forwardFor many forward-thinking companies , the answer to the conundrum of funding clinical trials for lower-priority drugs , is simple " partnerships . <p> Working with clinical research organizations , universities and patient advocacy organizations , drug makers can find investors who can provide the capital and share the risk in getting promising new therapies through development and regulatory to market . <p> One company has done just that , reducing its risk and investment by seeking partners for a series of new respiratory therapies . A thorough review of its portfolio identified 33 dormant clinical trials across six therapeutic areas ; yet , the cost of conducting these trials was estimated at $480 million . Without the resources to invest , the company selected three promising compounds in different indications and developed a clinical trial roadmap , which was also translated into a high-level financial model to help potential investors understand the value of the therapies if brought to market . <p> With a price tag of $120 million to run the trials , the drug maker used financial modelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the new compounds and indications , and the probability of the trial 's success . The outcome was an estimated increase in value of $500 million over three years , a valuation that was effective in attracting investors . <p> The opportunity was especially attractive for investors familiar with the industry , as it compared very favorably to the return on investment in big biopharma , although with a different risk profile . Armed with such an attractive proposition , the drug maker secured investment for a series of trials soon to be underway . <p> Below are five steps that other drug makers can follow to fund low-priority drug trials : <p> 1 . Identify clinical trials <p> When reviewing their portfolio of de-prioritized new therapies , drug makers must make tough choices about which clinical trials will attract external investors and be profitable once in market . <p> Trials need to be relevant and complementary . The relevance of a trial is influenced by its potential impact on market demand , which will predict the value of the development asset if trials are successful . Trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial duration , patients , etc. " to realize operational advantages , even if they in the same therapy area . One attractive offer for investors is packaging ' several trials in the same therapy area together to reduce upfront costs . <p> Remember , a real transfer of risk from biopharma company to other parties is required to help the drug maker develop its assets without adding development costs to its bottom line . A clinical trial with a 95 percent probability of success would not satisfy this requirement , as it would just be a financing arrangement camouflaged as an investment . <p> 2 . Find partners for funding and execution <p> A successful partnership will bring together the biopharma 's science and data , the CRO 's trial operation capability and capacity , and the investors ' funds , along with their knowledge of structuring and exiting these types of transactions . <p> Finding the right CRO will depend on location , track record and expertise in the relevant therapy area .

The risk assessment must include thorough due diligence and a clear exit strategy that ensures all partners are clear of the outcomes and their role in delivering the final goals . <p> 4 .

@@24982354 @4982354/ <h> The Great Wall of China " Top 5 Barriers to Market Access <p> Pharma expansion into emerging markets is not just desirable , but necessary to ensure continued growth , however both cultural and economic difference can often pose problems , here is our list of the top 5 barriers to entry into the Chinese marketplace . <p> Accenture estimates that emerging economies will account for more than 60 percent of global GDP growth between 2010 and 2016 , and market intelligence firm IMS Health predicts China will become the third largest pharma market in the world by next year . Added to this , China 's growing middle class and an ageing population mean new opportunities for companies to widen their portfolio in this area . However , entrants into the Chinese market find several challenges to doing business effectively . Below , I 'll run through five important barriers to entry for Western firms seeking a foothold in the market , and suggest possible solutions to these problems . <p> 1 . Accessing China 's untapped potential <p> One difficulty companies may face when doing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's most populous with over 1.3 billion inhabitants . So far , pharma companies have focussed mainly on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities , those with a population of over 2 million , targeting physicians in large hospitals in those cities and pursuing the tried and tested method of face-to-face visits from reps . There is potential , if companies can find a way to cover the distance , in China 's Tier 3 and 4 cities , several hundred of which have over 250,000 inhabitants and are growing rapidly . One way forward for foreign firms is to pursue mergers or joint ventures with established Chinese firms who have built up knowledge and a profile in these areas , although for firms wishing to go it alone this recent Accenture study- puts forward alternatives ; suggesting how initial face-to-face meetings with a physician about a new product could be followed up by group meetings , e-channels , seminars or even something as straightforward as text-messaging to deliver non-urgent information . <p> 2 . China " not one country , but many <p> The same Accenture report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese markets : understanding that China is made up of many overlapping demographics , each needing their own tailored approach . Inadequate knowledge of geographical and cultural differences in Chinese markets could pose a significant barrier to entry for firms wishing to do business here . Dr Andree K. Bates , president of Eularis , gives the example of Guangzhou and Shenzen , two cities in close proximity that actually speak different languages and represent very different social clusters . - Marketing in these two cities , or indeed in the city and the rural interior of the country , would necessarily require two separate approaches . A Tier 1 city physician in a large hospital will usually have a university degree but suffer from time constraints , while a smaller city or rural physician may have more time to spare but less up-to-date knowledge . A successful targeted sales strategy could be to cut down on educational support to the busy city physician and instead provide access to time-saving ePharma resources , while developing a productive relationship with the rural doctor through the provision of opportunities for learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price restrictions <p> There have been indications from the Chinese government recently that it intends to review its drug pricing scheme , planning to dramatically increase the number of drugs covered by its essential drug list . Drugs appearing here are listed by their generic name , and subject to a politicized price-cutting drive which saw prices cut 18 times between 1998 and 2005 , according to an ISPOR report . China 's indigenous pharma industry is heavily weighted towards producing generics which are better placed to compete under such criteria , posing a problem for foreign pharmaceutical companies wishing to profit from more expensive branded drugs . One way foreign firms can increase their profit margin is by targeting the consumer directly . Many Chinese self-medicate , making for a lucrative OTC market which pharma giants such as Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have already begun moving into . A further way of making an impact in the Chinese landscape is through an astute use of the marketing experience available to established foreign firms . As we 've discussed previously , companies with a better infrastructure and a first-wave launch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective marketing strategy than a cost-cutting generic drug maker . <p> 4 . China 's reimbursement headache <p> Reaching out to Chinese consumers directly is a worthwhile goal for pharma companies . However , an NY Times article- estimates that the number of Chinese with access to basic healthcare insurance is now around 95% , meaning that dealing with government reimbursement schemes is something foreign firms will have to get used to if they want to increase sales . Before a company can even think about getting its drug onto the National Drug Reimbursement List ( NDRL ) , it must first go through a lengthy process of drug registration , which can take years . Once the drug is registered , it can compete via a tendering process to be included on regional drug reimbursement lists , although according to a Deloitte study , provincial governments often discriminate in favour of locally produced medicines . Yet the situation is not completely hopeless , as the reimbursement scheme has two categories ; Category A contains the cheaper , more basic drugs , and Category B deals with higher priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents of Category B can be decided by local authorities according to their needs , giving pharma companies some scope to make the case for inclusion of their drug for reimbursement on factors other than price . Alternatively , IMS Health- suggests that being on the NDRL is not the only route to market for a drug in China " other considerations such as the targeted disease area , the product 's clinical efficacy , and an efficient marketing campaign can positively affect product uptake , regardless of whether a drug will be reimbursed or not . <p> 5 . Untangling China 's supply chain <p> Lastly , we return to the problem of market access , this time not from the demand side but from the supply side . Once your drug has made its way through the registration process , it will still need to be distributed , and the fragmentation of the supply chain makes this a much more complicated process in China than elsewhere . Statistics published by management consultancy ATKearney- show that China has over 13,000 distributors , with the three largest players having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top three distributors claim more than 95 per cent of the market between them . There are often several layers of distributors to get through before reaching the customer in Chinese markets , which make for high distribution costs and can diminish supply chain visibility , leaving it difficult to monitor your product once it has left the factory . Running in contrast to this is a growing tendency towards consolidation in the Chinese distribution market " one of China 's biggest distribution firms , Sinopharm , made over 30 acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 alone . Acquiring distribution capabilities through acquisitions or joint ventures is a possibility for Western firms , as is bypassing some levels of the supply chain and going directly to suppliers at a provincial level , increasingly the path taken by large firms like GlaxoSmithKline . <p> *** <p> Wherever there 's a will , there 's a way . China 's army of generics firms , its vast size , and its layers of bureaucracy may seem intimidating to firms wishing to start up here , but the country has made strides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign pharmaceutical trade . <p> As part of an agreement in 2004 with the WTO , there has been an improvement in patent protection , and combined with the growing affluence of the Chinese population and the government 's ambition to improve healthcare nationwide , this represents the perfect moment for western pharma companies to expand into Chinese markets . Experience gained in the highly competitive western pharma environment , and the commitment to robust R&amp;D-driven growth , should assist any firm looking to scale the great walls of China . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982357 @4982357/ <h> With Value Added Services , to Whom Are We Adding Value ? <p> I think we can all agree that providing medications alone is no longer enough . Customers are looking for more , and so value added services are becoming an ever more important part of pharma 's value proposition . <p> There is another strategic imperative that is growing alongside services that will have significant impact on the types of services pharma will offer - Patient Centricity . <p> If pharma is to expand into value added services , these services should centre on the patient . But it is critical to be clear about why pharma wants to expand into service provision in the first place . Here 's my take on why the industry is taking a very serious look at services . <p> The environment is changing : as healthcare becomes increasingly unsustainable in its current form , economics grows in importance . Payers need to make critical choices about which treatments deliver the most value . Most importantly from pharma 's perspective , payers are becoming much more influential and are replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimes and choices . <p> While payers have always been on pharma 's radar as an important stakeholder , most in the industry are directing a greater level of attention to this group today , with more resources and in a myriad of different ways . <p> The issue then , is what is pharma going to offer ? And how will it engage with this customer , what is the value they bring ? <p> Typically pharma has focused on improving patient outcomes through innovative medicines and provides data that demonstrates patient outcomes supported by clinical trials as well as some economic data that typically focuses on the longer term - the size of the prize - in terms of numbers of patients , those not at goal together with the potential benefits and outcomes . <p> The big risk in this approach is that it allows payers to focus on cost , meaning pharma runs the risk of being evaluated primarily on cost " the benefit to patient at what cost equation ( one example of which would be Quality-Adjusted Life Years ) . As we are seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the price you can demand for your product is driven down . <p> And one of the ways to avoid this catastrophic danger is to add value . <p> For me , this is at the heart of the value added services approach . The unresolved challenge is this : Can pharma continue to provide value add for free , having seen the ROI come from increased product sales , or should they charge for these services ? <p> We will discuss this in detail at another time , but for now let 's stick with the fact that this is primarily a major play directed at payers . <p> So why would pharma want to provide services to payers ? <p> To ensure access for our medicines - help get product approved/on formulary ? <p> To differentiate us ' - the company or the product , from other pharma companies and their competitor product in the eyes of the customer . <p> To build new sources of revenue . <p> To be known for service as an integral part of the product offering " provide additional benefits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage physicians to prescribe your product . <p> To encourage patients to use the product or continue to use the product . <p> To enable pharma to have more/broader discussions with payers and thereby better engage them . <p> Clearly this is a critical strategic choice and will determine how the company should develop and focus its ' services with each choice demanding a different approach . <p> So what is value add for payers , what are they looking for ? Without doubt , they are looking for solutions that address their specific problems . They are not looking for more information or more clinical data " customers everywhere , in every industry , you and me , do n't need more data , we want solutions to our problems . <p> For me , when pharma is looking at what problems to address and what solutions or services to deliver there are three criteria that need to be met at the same time : <p> Improved patient outcomes <p> Cost effectiveness " no increase in the cost of healthcare delivery and preferably a reduction in cost over current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient outcomes do not have to come with a higher price tag . More money thrown at healthcare does not always result in better patient outcomes . The US healthcare system is a great example of that . <p> If one takes a system view of healthcare then it is possible to deliver better health at lower cost while providing a better experience to patients and the general public , but it requires a broader view than typically the industry is used to . <p> Cost effectiveness needs to be demonstrated in the real world " providing data around a new treatment in isolation " in a clinical trial for example , is no longer enough . Pharma needs to compare its innovation with what is happening today , understanding what this therapy will replace , how it is more effective then other treatments and how its use will drive down costs . <p> Finally , patient and community satisfaction are important to payers as they need to demonstrate to their constituents that they are caretaking the healthcare system , ensuring its sustainability while engaging patients in living a healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient experience . <p> By providing services and delivering value beyond the pill , pharma can certainly develop additional revenue streams and extend their engagement with the healthcare system , but it is unlikely be as profitable or as big as the traditional pharma blockbuster-based model . <p> Where then , does this leave the traditional model - focussing on the pill , and what role will the pill play in the future value proposition of pharma ? <p> Do value added services come in addition to what pharma does today , or do they actually replace some current activities and behaviours ? What is pharma going to stop doing if it wants to focus on services ? 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

@@24982374 @4982374/ <h> Pharma 's Road to Redemption <p> Big Pharma as Good Guys ... The very idea that the pharmaceutical industry should make money from sick and vulnerable people will always be anathema to a section of society . At the heart of the dynamic tension between generating profit and improving the lives of patients is an understanding of the concept of a license to operate and the social contract that validates such a license . At its most basic , the social contract that exists between society and the pharma industry allows the industry monopoly rights to sell ( ie a patent ) new products in exchange for a commitment to develop new products that are affordable to those that need it . When the needs of patients and industry become misaligned is when difficulties arise . There seems little doubt that the desire to maintain strong profits growth in the 1990s drove a set of corporate behaviours that led to a fracture of the social contract . We all remember the dependence on " me-toos " , the price increases ( in the US ) , the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial data , the massive growth in primary care field forces , all of which were designed to meet growth targets that suited shareholders during a bull market for equities .

These factors include market dynamics , shifts in the power of who makes decisions , and the cost-benefit basis for those decisions . <p> With the ongoing transformation in the global pharmaceutical and medical device industry , new approaches to understanding markets , market niches , and strategic marketing are essential for companies that are focused on creating real competitive advantage . In particular , economic and clinical value ( ECV ) , or cost combined with efficacy , is rising to the forefront in the industry , fueled by the recent changes in healthcare in the US reflected in The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . <p> Pharmaceutical and medical device products have been geared to large target markets , in part reflecting economies of scale , firms ' interest in recouping R&amp;D costs , and few challenges to the blockbuster model. - Increasing interest in more personalized medicine combined with pressures to demonstrate better outcomes for targeted patient populations presents companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more narrow groups , develop products to meet those needs , and focus marketing efforts to drive successful commercialization . Thus , successful companies will need to focus on markets and their various segments as competitive marketplace environments that operate under varying norms . <p> Market nuances <p> One reason marketplaces have changed is the trend in decision-making to shift authority away from individual physicians to payers and healthcare administrators . Although this has often led to public criticism of insurance providers , decisions of these payers to curtail or block expensive treatments have become more common as a measure to control the rapid growth in healthcare costs. - <p> So , how do successful companies approach market segmentation ? This assumes that they have already recognized the changing environment , implemented new strategic marketing capabilities , and established consensus around the role and responsibility of strategic marketing . <p> Unfortunately , some companies overlook nuance among markets and submarkets and miss out on opportunities to create competitive advantage . These companies continue to list product features and then seek a fit with an appropriate population . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that match the US in terms of demographics , related morbidity rates , and/or disposable income will overlook opportunities for real product and service innovation . <p> Similarly , companies that rely on legacy procedures , bureaucratic inertia , or the we have always done it this way ' mentality are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past . Strategic marketing necessitates taking a fresh look at market segmentation and re-establishing the basis for product development efforts . <p> Focus on health outcomes <p> We typically recommend that companies set aside segmentation that has been based on the features of a given product or device . For example , that a device that is 10% smaller or a drug has fewer side effects are important facts to know , but should not be the starting point for a solid strategy . <p> Successful companies should focus more on the health outcome to be achieved . Then work from that point to identify the portfolio of products that would achieve that outcome , then narrow that list to products they can/should develop . <p> Tighter focus and more narrowly defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus is typically achieved only when the company understands its customers , end users , and distribution channels more deeply . <p> From this deeper understanding , trend analysis and forecasting should be an essential component of market segmentation .

This is another indication of CMS ' commitment to alternative payment models that make delivery organizations financially accountable for the cost and quality of care they provide . As healthcare delivery organizations prepare to operate in this environment , we expect to see continued erosion of individual physician influence on product decisions . In its place , committees that include physicians and administrators will exert more influence that reflects institutional priorities . This has important implications for pharmaceutical manufacturers . <p> In this environment , delivery organizations are trying to make more structured and scientific attempts to look objectively at the value offered by products .

Manufacturers must develop and utilize new capabilities to target an evolving customer base that includes healthcare delivery administrators as well as physicians . This will require a greater emphasis on delivering value that extends beyond the acute care environment . Here are three core ideas pharmaceutical manufacturers should consider in modifying their commercial approach and addressing the changing needs of customers . <p> 1 ) Strategic Account Management : As delivery organizations move toward value-based payment models , manufacturers will need to understand where their clients are in this transition . Some organizations have grown extensively by acquisition or affiliation , and others less so .

Finally , each organization has its own strategic and operational priorities that flow from its history , competitive environment , financial and reputational situation . In commercialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables into account in their deployment and product positioning . Accounts themselves can be segmented on these key variables , simplifying the challenge of customizing messaging and positioning . <p> 2 ) - Complex sales skills : - Product decision-making is shifting away from individual physicians to committees including hospital administrators and supply chain managers , and relying more on GPOs . Consolidation also means that the impact of committee decisions will increase . In light of these changes , manufacturers need to ensure sales teams have the core competencies and flexibility to engage with a more diverse set of key decision makers that has interests that go beyond the product . Sales representatives will need sophisticated scientific understanding of their products and the economic and clinical benefits they offer . Given these changing dynamics , manufacturers will need to develop new performance metrics that measure the quality of account management rather than just the volume of sales . <p> 3 ) Stakeholder value : In a value-based environment , delivery organizations need to be able to manage variation in cost and quality. - One method being used is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardize treatment . Another common approach , especially where there are lots of product choices that perform similarly , is to narrow the list of suppliers . Selling in this environment requires demonstrating differentiated economic and clinical value to ensure product adoption . Understanding market needs and customer goals will help to identify what customers value and the data needed to tell an effective value story . To the extent the commercial organization determines it does not have the necessary data to support its messaging , a feedback loop must be developed to provide R&amp;D with insight into how the market is evolving and the types of data that will resonate . <p> Manufacturers must move quickly to adapt to this changing delivery landscape and develop the new commercial approaches and capabilities required to engage with these stakeholders effectively and successfully .

@@24982403 @4982403/ <h> Using market research to capitalize on brand equity <p> To a certain extent , O'sConnor says , all of her company 's brands talk to the same groups of doctors and use similar marketing programs . So Lilly has created a structure to help coordinate marketing activities to avoid its teams from stepping all over each other and to help them measure the impact of their programs . <p> One approach O'sConnor is using to coordinate direct mail programs for about 15 Lilly brands is something the company calls zero-based budgeting . During the planning process , she says , each brand team establishes key objectives and then brings in channel experts , like O'sConnor , to help them achieve those goals . <p> We examine things like how much it will cost and how many times we need to hit a physician to achieve the goal , she says . And I may have to tell a team that for a really complex message direct mail just won'st work , while the peer-to-peer people may identify it as a great opportunity and come up with estimates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying how many hits we want to have and how much that 's going to cost . <p> Then it is rolled up to a portfolio platform , O'sConnor says , where portfolio directors look across brands and make sure it 's all coordinated and makes sense , considering overlap and other factors . <p> We'sve only tried this approach over the past year , so we'sre not sure yet how it will ultimately go , she says . But I think we'sre doing a good job so far . <p> Analyzing return on investment ( ROI ) can help you determine what works and what doesn'st , O'sConnor says , but is a lagging indicator , she warns . So she also advocates the use of market research , which can help teams understand why something works or does not work . <p> And market research allows teams to focus on brand equity , which can help them determine future directions to pursue , she says . But at Lilly , although they measure brand equity and determine which elements drive sales , O'sConnor says it 's difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What interventions can you use to drive those specific benefits ? she asks . <p> To better understand how to impact brand value , Lilly worked with a market research agency to develop a model structure for one of its brands . The study , which took about six months to complete , involved quantitative market research with about 300 physicians from each of the brand 's main segments . But it also included linking prescribing data back to the physicians 's stated intentions and beliefs . <p> We know certain areas of satisfaction , loyalty and value drive our patient share and we have some emotional benefits that we'sre trying to drive , O'sConnor says . People generally make decisions , at least initially , on very functional kinds of attributes looking at the specific qualities of a car or whatever but then you get to that higher order emotional kind of feeling of BMW makes me feel cool 's or whatever the case may be . <p> We know that first , we have to drive functional elements , such as this brand works on these specific symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then we'sre looking to see which specific types of activities drive each of those functional benefits the chain of events to drive us from all these individual interventions to drive the functional benefits , the higher order benefits , the outcomes and then the patient share . <p> O'sConnor says initially with the market research they ascertained the extent to which physicians believed Lilly 's brand stood for certain qualities for example , in the instance of the brand tested , mood efficacy or eliminating aggressiveness . And they determined which higher order benefits could be moved by an impact on functional benefits . <p> For example , it will point out when utilizing an exhibit booth isn'st going to do you any good and you would be better off doing something with your sales reps , O'sConnor explains . So we use this model to determine which specific types of interventions can lead to the specific types of impacts on our benefits that we would like to have . If you have the time , money and market research company that 's good at analytics , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really learn what 's driving specific pieces of your brand equity . <p> On a more basic level , however , O'sConnor says is always amazing the opportunities we miss to gather information from our customers about what 's working and what 's not . <p> With direct mail , we'sve focused a lot on ROI and it is a strong candidate for that , she says . You can tell who was sent what , who responded and link it back to individual prescribing . We also tend to look at response rates , which are not a very good measure although intuitively it seems like they would be . But in reality , it 's all related to what kind of medical or practice-related item you'sre offering . <p> O'sConnor says that if you offer something cool , like a USB connection kit or some kind of cell phone accessory , you will get great responses no matter what your product materials are . But she says if you offer something educational like a book or CD of a speaker program , physicians don'st respond . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market research study where instead of a pen or whatever , we offered to make a two dollar donation to the advocacy program of their choice and we got a less than 2% response rate . <p> Typically , however , with direct mail , O'sConnor says , it doesn'st pay to do a lot of market research . <p> We might be sending something out to 20,000 people and it costs $50,000-$60,000 , she says . So to spend time and money to do a $15,000-$20,000 market research study on that probably doesn'st make sense . <p> But she says sometimes they do market research on the look and feel of a whole campaign and they are doing more follow-up surveys . In the previous example , where they got only a 2% response rate , she says they wanted to determine how response rate related to open rate . <p> If you get a 2% response rate , does that mean no one really opened it ; they threw it in the trash ? she asks . <p> So Lilly surveyed 100 people who received the mailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it , if they read it and then a lot of questions about what they remembered , liked and why . O'sConnor says 41% of those receiving it recalled seeing it , 26% said they opened and read it and about 20% remembered the brand , although fewer remembered the message . <p> So while they do focus on ROI , O'sConnor says it 's not the be-all and end-all because it 's retrospective and only gives broad clues on general direction . When we need more specific information , we use primary market research to fill in the gaps . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

A multitude of explanatory- theories and methodologies of implementation- were devised . Skilled physicians , surgeons , and barbers , aided by cleverly designed mechanical devices and leeches ( biological machines ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the process could not be shown to result in positive outcomes in the overwhelming majority of cases was explained away or ignored , as was the scientific evidence that the process was therapeutically ineffective in given disorders , perhaps in the belief that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all . <p> Treatment adherence is a model dating back to Hippocrates which continues to be the standard of care throughout the civilized world . A multitude of explanatory theories and methodologies of implementation have been devised . Skilled physicians , other clinicians , and researchers , aided by cleverly designed mechanical devices , have become ever more efficient in performing a set of compliance enhancement procedures ( such as reminding the patient to take a pill , educating the patient , packaging all of a patients medication in dose packs , etc . ) . That the process has not been shown to result in significant improvements in the overwhelming majority of cases has been explained away or ignored , as has the scientific evidence that certain specific procedures are ineffective , perhaps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means available than do nothing at all . <p> On the other hand , I can find no evidence that anyone has suggested that patient compliance can be enhanced by the use of leeches . <p> The Damage Done By Bloodletting And Patient Compliance <p> The danger of bloodletting was not , except in a small number of cases , death by exsanguination . Instead , the harm done to centuries of patients was in the form of what economists call opportunity cost . If , for example , one purchases a car for $30,000 , the opportunity to invest that $30,000 in ones next best choice , say starting ones own business , is lost . <p> During the time that bloodletting was in favor , it was the dominant investment target for available intellectual , financial , and medical professional capital . Consequently , the opportunity to use those resources to develop and implement other , perhaps more effective , therapies was lost . Every day that the practice of bloodletting slowed the development of more effective therapies was a day treatment outcomes were worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered incapacities , recovered more slowly , and , at best , endured the pain and cost of treatment needlessly . <p> Similarly , as long as intellectual , financial , and medical professional capital are devoted to the current patient compliance paradigm , developing and implementing other , perhaps more effective , alternatives is unlikely . And , every day that the current patient compliance paradigm slows the development of more effective enhancement of treatment implementation is a day treatment outcomes are worse than they could have been that means some patients die , suffer incapacities , recover more slowly , and , at best , endure the discomfort , inconvenience , and cost of treatment needlessly . <p> Incorrect , ineffective patient compliance theory is not trivial it is literally a matter of life and death . <p> Next : Alternatives To the Current Patient Compliance Model <p> The posts in this sequence have thus far focused on the why the treatment adherence paradigm is ineffective and the danger of its continued use. - The next entry will begin a discussion of possible alternatives to the current model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explication of the need to dismantle and replace the patient compliance system of thought is available on my AlignMap blog at <p> *For those unfamiliar with the procedure , bloodletting is described in the well done Wikipedia article on the subjectWikipedia article as the withdrawal of often considerable quantities of blood from a patient in the belief that this would cure or prevent a great many illnesses and diseases . It was a tremendously popular medical practice from antiquity up to the late 19th century , a time span of almost 2,000 years . The practice has been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions . It is conceivable that historically , in the absence of other treatments for hypertension , bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by a reduction in blood volume . However , since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods , this effect was unintentional . In the overwhelming majority of cases , the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

Its easy to see why . <p> The traditional pharma sales and marketing model is one in which the payor and prescriber are seen as primary decision-makers and wield the power . <p> As a marketing manager explained , Most product marketing managers start their careers as sales representatives .

And the driving force for that process is ultimately cost . The misuse , including under-use , of prescribed drugs is a waste of money . <p> Not only that , but the adverse reactions and sub-optimal treatment outcomes associated with non-adherence create extra costs for healthcare systems , such as ( re ) -hospitalization . Ultimately , this rebounds on the supplier . <p> Any wasted or additive costs arising from non-adherence reduce the available drug budget and the window of opportunity for new medicines that may save healthcare systems money in the long term , including through better adherence . <p> The role of pharmacists <p> The PGEU , the European association for community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not only experts on medicines but among the most accessible and most consulted health professionals , according to the PGEU . A number of countries have launched medication review or adherence programs as part of a wider trend towards expanding the pharmacists role in pharmaceutical care . <p> A number of factors contribute to poor patient adherence , including the challenges of managing a long-term condition , intolerable side-effects , the impact of adverse media coverage , the costs of treatment , asymptomatic conditions , and cutting short treatment as soon as the patient feels better ( e.g. , with antibiotics ) . <p> According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , between 33% and 50% of patients in England do not use medicines prescribed for long-term conditions as recommended , while the estimated cost of unused or unwanted drugs to the NHS is more than 100 million a year . <p> This is also an international phenomenon . According to the PGEU , an estimated 194,500 deaths per year in the EU are down to mis-dosing of , or non-adherence to , prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the US , the non-adherence tally is about $177 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs . <p> Clinical medication reviews <p> According to the PGEU , clinical medication review is proven effective at optimizing therapy , improving health outcomes , cutting waste and reducing the likelihood of drug-related problems . In one Swedish study , medication reviews brought the average number of medicines taken by elderly patients down from 12.4 to 10.7 , while the average drug cost per patient fell by around 160 per patient per year . <p> In the UK , the Medicines Use Review ( MUR ) scheme was introduced in April 2005 as the first advanced service offered under a new contractual framework between community pharmacies and the NHS . <p> Patients are selected for a consultation to ensure they understand why they are taking a particular medicine and how they should be taking it . Any problems identified in the review can be relayed to the prescriber via an NHS MUR form . <p> Medicines Use Reviews <p> MURs are not without their difficulties , though , particularly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes . The scheme was slow to take off , although more recent figures indicate uptake has improved significantly . <p> Some pharmacists see MURs as a natural and welcome extension of moves to raise their profile in front-line patient management . But others are cynical about the motivations behind a service that involves hitting annual targets to bump up pharmacy revenues . The financial pressure to reach the annual ceiling of 400 reviews per pharmacy per year is detracting from other services , they warn . <p> A nationwide audit to gauge the effectiveness of MURs was launched in mid-2009 and the first results are imminent . The audit , a partnership between the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain ( RPSGB ) , the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Clinical Audit Support Centre , sought feedback from community pharmacy , general practice , primary care organizations and patients who have undergone an MUR . <p> The pharmacy skills mix <p> On the resource issue , the RPSGB suggests boosting the skill mix in pharmacy for example , by developing or employing accuracy-checking technicians can help by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get the most out of their medicines . <p> Another step forward , the Society says , would be original pack dispensing . Pharmacists feel that cutting up packs of pills to match prescriptions can lead to a loss of confidence in the medicine on the part of the patient , which in turn affects compliance . <p> It can also be confusing for some patients , who then do not take the medicine as intended , the RPSGB adds . And the pharmacist has to spend time sourcing and/or copying additional patient information leaflets ( PILs ) . - <p> The role of pharma <p> Clearly there is an opportunity not to mention a strong incentive for pharmaceutical companies to step up their support for medicines adherence , be it through the supply of information and guidance to pharmacists involved in MURs ( e.g. , helping them target patients most likely to stray from the recommended regimen ) or through other channels such as the GP or Web/text-based contact with patients . <p> Some companies already provide support in kind as resource packs and training materials for pharmacists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a particular emphasis on ensuring patients are as informed about their medicines as possible , through channels such as PILs and the electronic Medicines Compendium , notes the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ( ABPI ) . <p> Zeroing in on pharmacists also helps build a relationship that will be all the more valuable to industry as responsibility for drug management/monitoring and some aspects of prescribing shifts increasingly from the GPs surgery to community pharmacies . <p> All the same , industry has to be careful not to let any of this activity cross the line into explicit inducements .

But today , its often used in ways that dilute its power . Used at the wrong times , in the wrong ways , with the wrong strategy , DTC can fail to deliver , resulting in our status quo : skyrocketing spend and stagnant prescriptions . <p> How can DTC be used in your marketing plans for brand success ? In this article we pinpoint the problems of todays DTC , examine the single most important way to improve your DTC campaign , and describe the essential steps towards creating your killer DTC push . <p> Down , But Not Out <p> The pharma industry is a great believer in doing what 's worked in the past , even when evidence shows it no longer works . Take the glut of sales reps in the field . Companies found success for years with direct sales , and so continued to send reps to physicians , even as physicians restricted access , reduced prescriptions , and generally soured on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DTC advertising . What was once a sure way to boost prescriptions and reputation has become less and less effective . A crowded market , the evolution of technology , and a public souring on the pharma industry has resulted in stagnant response . <p> While spending has grown and continues to grow , prescriptions are staying flat . <p> But does this mean that pharma should eliminate DTC advertising ? In a time of economic freefall , when dollars are increasingly scrutinized and reduced , should pharma push DTC aside and focus on other means of advertising ? No , and here 's why . While DTC has reduced its impact , it still retains power . The key is for pharma to discover how to enhance that power , how to wisely invest decreasing funds into the appropriate places and with the best messages in order to capture an audience and their needs . <p> Timing The Crucial Consideration <p> The most important way to capitalize on DTC is through timing . DTC advertising is a powerful force when used for new product launches , particularly in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for developing awareness and recognition for new drugs , and as such the spend should be used as a short-term measure to help drive market penetration . This type of promotion is extremely useful in accomplishing what we all need during launch : the communication of key product attributes to the patients in the target disease area . DTC also works best in disease areas where patient awareness and choice is a critical factor in prescribing . <p> A few case studies will illustrate . Crestor was introduced into a crowded U.S. dislipidemia market in 2003 and used DTC advertising to help deliver its message as being a more efficacious product compared with the leading statins currently in use . DTC spend was high at launch to drive initial sales and market share , and did just that . Over time , DTC spend was reduced : as a proportion of sales DTC spend peaked at 23.3% in year two , before falling to 12.5% in year three . <p> In another example , Cialis was the third entrant into the U.S. erectile dysfunction market , dominated by Pfizers Viagra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unique 36-hour action . The drug achieved sales of $552 million in its fist full year on the market ( 2004 ) , on the strength of DTC but also an innovative marketing campaign tool . Lilly utilized a voucher for a free trial of Cialis , followed by a second trial of Cialis or a competitor if not satisfied , under the Cialis Promise . In addition , training and support materials were included alongside regulatory labeling . Cialis generated global sales of $971m in 2006 , a year-on-year increase of 30% , even in the face of quickly increasing competition in the erectile dysfunction market . <p> These are cases when the power of DTC was harnessed at launch for impressive results . But then there are the notable cases where companies go wrong . Rozerem was approved by the FDA in July 2005 as an anti-insomnia pill with a different working mechanism than other sleeping aids . Upon launch , Takeda marketed to doctors so they were familiar with its differences from Ambien and Lunesta . In 2007 they launched a DTC campaign that garnered much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe Lincoln and a talking beaver , with the tagline Your dreams miss you . Despite high levels of awareness of the drug and high likeability of the ads ( 12% of adults surveyed by Ad Track , USA TODAY 's weekly consumer poll , said they like the Rozerem ads " a lot " ) , Rozerem had less than 3 percent of the $3.6 billion U.S. market , according to industry sales figures reported by IMS Health . Takeda has spent $100 million on the direct mail and TV campaign , more than the drug has generated in revenue according to figures released by TNS Media Intelligence figures . <p> One of the problems ? Rozerem represented a new offering in the sleeping aid market , one that could potentially eradicate dangerous side effects of Ambien and Lunesta and provide more normal sleep . But the DTC campaign began years after launch , years in which Ambien and Lunesta gained further hold of the market , and did not fully explain the differentiation of the drug . As such , consumers have stayed away . <p> Steps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crestor , Cialis , and Rozerem demonstrate . But there is so much more to consider as well . What are the other ways in which companies can better plan their DTC campaigns to create product wins ? <p> Be Realistic . Marketers need to understand their consumer marketing strengths and weaknesses , as well as where the brand fits within the company portfolio . Doing this will reveal realistic expectations for marketing and DTC , along with return on investment . <p> Be Prepared . Know how consumers think and act when it comes to your disease area . A thorough and upfront assessment of the disease and brand can help identify knowledge gaps , opportunities and potential areas of trouble . Doing this will help better understand targeting opportunities and priorities to make DTC push the brand forward . <p> Plan , and Do it Right . A comprehensive and tough planning process can help prioritize target opportunities , and identify the best bangs for the buck . Planning is n't complete or effective without continually checking to make sure objectives , strategies and tactics are on track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including DTC ) are relevant and meaningful . <p> Measure . Set up useful and significant metrics to track performance . The best metrics will allow companies to best manage their campaigns , as well as to continually improve . And DTC advertising planned and conducted with effective measurement will be far more effective . <p> Redefine Your Terms . While many pharma companies view DTC as focused strictly on television and direct mail , these traditional means are waning in their influence . The best DTC today is about creating value-added relationships through a wide spectrum of media , all based on the unique wants and needs of each segment . Its about speaking to targets in their language in traditional and new media , exploring new ways to get consumers involved and speaking to other consumers on the brands behalf . By casting a wider net , DTC can be extremely useful and powerful . <p> Pay Attention to Detail . To make sure your strategies actually deliver , marketers must stay focused . Ensuring the elements of the DTC campaign are well coordinated , and every detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pay Attention to Time . As mentioned before , perhaps the most critical key for DTC success is timing . To ensure this complex and time-sensitive initiative will work , do n't  underestimate how time-consuming the planning process will be , and how many rounds of creative back and forth will be needed . Starting at least two years before launch is a great way to cover all the bases . <p> Select Resources Wisely . If you 're using an advertising agency , the organizational and cultural differences between companies could work to your advantage or detriment . Take the time to get to know your partners and how they collaborate , and select only those that will enable each of you to do your best work . <p> Build in Time to Adapt . No matter how long you plan , and how comprehensive that plan is , you 'll need to hone and improve your DTC campaign . Plan for this by allowing time to review what 's working and what 's not . <p> Conclusion <p> Spend on DTC advertising is at an all-time high , but prescriptions are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of DTC is getting squandered with poor timing , a lack of planning , and an inability to see past traditional media . With this shortsightedness , companies are paying more , but getting squashed by competition and a skeptical public . But DTC can still power a brand forward . Brand launch can be a rousing success with the help of DTC . And a campaign that is realistic , prepared , planned and measured , that builds in time for adaptation , and uses all the resources available to pharma marketers , can push past stagnant sales and boost prescriptions . <p> - <p> For help in understanding when and where to implement DTC advertising to be effective , please contact the author Dr Andree K Bates at Eularis www.eularis.com 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

@@24982484 @4982484/ <h> iPad and Tablet Use in Detailing : Where Pharma is Going Wrong <p> The hardware is an important factor , but is your sales force utilizing these to gain a strategic advantage or are they using it more as a glorified PDF viewer ? If the latter , what is missing is the ability to tailor interactive content to the explicit needs of the individual physicians at the time of the detail . Another aspect that seems to be missing is the capability for the rep to know , out of all content , which precise content is right to address a specific physician 's current concerns in that specific sales call . <p> Deliver the right personalized sales messages for individual physicians <p> 24% of a sales rep 's time is spent searching for data . They 're expected to be more knowledgeable now than ever before in order to earn face-time with their physicians . Teams need sales reps to know exactly what messages are needed for individual physicians when visiting them to convert them to their brand . They also want to avoid physicians switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid pages to show that are optimal for this purpose . <p> Would n't it be more advantageous to the rep , and the company results , if the tablet/iPad could deliver more targeted suggestions to the sales rep on the optimal topic to be discussed with that specific physician , at that specific time , to address their needs around the condition and your brand at the time of the call ? <p> The good news is you can . Eularis are now delivering this right now for our clientele by applying Artificial Intelligence algorithms to individual physician data . <p> By using the power of Artificial Intelligence , one can create stronger and more personal relationships between reps and their customers , influencing their prescribing by addressing the concerns they are having at that point in time . The sales rep would get valuable insight on exactly what topics will move that physician at that point in time based on superior data and advanced intelligence . <p> Would n't it also be helpful to the rep to have an actual customized detail aid , bespoke for that specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tablet/iPad ? <p> The majority of Pharma companies leave it to the individual sales rep to select what detail aid pages/interactive content to use with individual physicians . However , this is n't chosen in any structured way . It might be that what the sales rep feels is best is used , or there could be biases towards what the rep is most comfortable discussing , or what the sales rep feels is most important . These could differ vastly from the messages that would sway that physician the most . <p> On the other hand , if one uses Artificial Intelligence from physician data to mathematically extract the attributes of physicians that would react positively to specific messaging , we could ensure that when a specific physician is selected in the CRM system , it will not only pull out vital information on that individual physician- but will also create a customized combination of pages/interactive content from the detail aids that would most likely engage and influence that specific physician . <p> By intensifying physician engagement with Artificial Intelligence , one can ensure that the right content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee stronger sales results with physicians . <p> By arming your sales force with a tailor-made Artificial Intelligence powered engine that will deliver content that is needed for that specific physician right to their tablet/iPad , they will naturally deliver stronger sales results . <p> Reps that have used this system typically have created 10-30% increases in sales . A pilot program done with a Eularis client found that reps using this gained 43% higher sales above baseline than the reps not using this . <p> At times of launch or with market changes , an even stronger impact on sales has been found from this alone . Your sales results will be far superior with Artificial Intelligence than leaving it up to the sales rep , and will enable you to gain a reliable boost in your sales results . <p> The devil is in the data <p> As you would imagine , this system excels in the US , with the availability of big data . The good news for other markets with significantly reduced data availability ( e.g. Japan , APAC , Europe , Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be achieved in those markets as well . We have found data sources enabling us to do this in all markets now . <p> Conclusion <p> Pharma teams who are embracing iPads and tablets for their detailing have made great strides forward with their hardware selection . It is now time for the digital teams to step up and reconsider their approach to the content contained in these for the reps . By creating custom content on-the-fly for individual physicians within the hardware so that the rep also has great personalized content - powered by Artificial intelligence , which delivers insight , intelligence and tools " this will serve to ensure greater engagement , conversion and retention of individual physicians to the reps brands at the time of the sales call . <p> For more information on this topic , or related topics and questions , please contact the author- at Eularis. 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

If you like , the last 10 years were the warm up " now that continual change is really going to pick up the pace . A number of factors and trends are driving this process , which are worth considering in turn : <p> 1 . Going beyond the pill <p> The first is a switch from products to services . This beyond the pill ' world is rapidly coming into being , driven partly by the increased focus on patient outcomes . Consequently companies have to now consider total treatment " ensuring not only effective medication but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also often a necessity , as medical professionals have to deal with increasingly complex treatments and need additional support .

Decreasing customer engagement <p> There is , unfortunately , a parallel trend that is the decreasing effectiveness of traditional customer engagement . Counter-intuitively , increasing advertising spends and scaling up sales forces appear to result in less time to communicate and less engaged customers . So while companies need to engage more closely with their customers , they are finding that the more that they try to reach out , the farther away customers seem to get ! <p> 3 . The rising price of brain real estate <p> This brings us to the next trend , one that I call the rising price of brain real estate .

The introduction of digital technology in our everyday media landscape means that we expect things to be on demand ' , available everywhere ' , and just for us ' . We expect companies to remember our preference whether we 're ordering a pizza , checking into a hotel , or choosing an online film .

With traditional marketing there is an underlying problem : relevance .

Successful decision making ultimately depends on our ability to predict the future outcomes of today 's actions .

Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from predictive modelling , machine learning and data mining that analyze current and historical facts to spot emerging trends .

@@24982516 @4982516/ <h> What to Consider When Conducting Patient Research in Saudi Arabia <p> Conducting market research with patients in any market can be a challenge , requiring sensitivity and consideration for language , culture , religion , as well as for other emotional , behavioral and environmental factors that might impact patients ' behavior . <p> In The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) , where religion and culture are central to society and there are strict laws governing behavior , patient research can be uniquely challenging . However , as the fastest growing pharma market in the Middle East , it is critical that those who want to leverage opportunities in this Arab state understand patient needs and behavior. - In this article , we will outline the factors to consider when designing a patient research program , based on our experience and knowledge of the region . <p> Culture , religion and family <p> Cultural and religious factors must be considered when conducting patient research in Saudi Arabia , where Islam is a way of life . Illness and suffering can be seen as a test from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for patients . Religion and culture have considerable influence on the patient 's view of disease management , creating a unique context for the pharmaceutical industry. - - <p> The family plays a key role in patient care and the opinion of senior family members , such as the father or the eldest person in the family , is highly valued . It is considered the obligation of the family to enquire about the patient 's health and family members may act as intermediaries during the patient-doctor interaction . They will often participate in decisions regarding treatment options . Physicians may even discuss major decisions with the family without the patient 's involvement . For example , a patient may be in pain , but if the patient 's family have a religious belief about the endurance of pain , they might ask the physician not to give the patient strong pain medication . The family may demand more procedures than the physician considers appropriate for critically-ill patients , which can create tension and anxiety . Therefore , physician communication with caregivers is regarded as important as with the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be observed through the lens of Islamic culture and religion , in which family and gender play important roles . <p> One also needs to be sensitive to the part that gender roles play in healthcare decision-making in Saudi Arabia , which are highly influenced by Islamic culture . Although nowadays women in Saudi Arabia are granted full rights in making healthcare decisions , many women and even doctors will still seek permission from males who act as the female 's legal guardian ( father , husband or son ) before initiating certain surgical procedures . This situation may lead to compliance issues and delay in treatment . However , these healthcare decisions can not be dismissed as being due to a lack of awareness or education. - Patient behaviors in Saudi Arabia should be observed through the lens of Islamic culture and religion , in which family and gender play important roles . <p> Patient/caregiver-HCP interaction <p> Communication issues between patients and doctors are universal , but they can be amplified in Saudi Arabia where a large proportion of HCPs originate from another country . Seventy percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and some of them do not speak fluent Arabic . Nurses may speak English with different accents , and interact with patients who speak Arabic in different accents ( Egyptian , Lebanese , Moroccan , etc . ) . Language barriers can often cause tension between nurses and their patients , as both sides experience frustration during communication . For example , nurses may find it difficult to convey doctor 's instructions to patients on how to take a certain medication , while patients and caregivers may complain that nurses are not being responsive to their questions . Pharma companies need to be aware of the language barrier in the patient-HCP interaction . Training HCPs can result in better care and better compliance , especially for chronic conditions. - <p> Cultural and religious diversity can also impact the overall quality of communication and overall care . For example , expatriate nurses or doctors who are non-Muslim might underestimate the discomfort a female Muslim patient is likely to experience during physical examinations . Patients might behave in a way that is alien to an expatriate , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them from harm . Without intending to , HCPs may not pick up on subtle communication cues and consequently provide inadequate moral support . In certain circumstances , HCPs may even unintentionally offend the patient . For example , doctors and nurses may attempt to comfort patients by touching them , without realizing that touching the opposite sex is considered offensive . The ability of the healthcare workforce to deliver culturally sensitive care can affect patients ' satisfaction of the treatment ( which can include certain drugs/medical devices ) . Ensuring that products can be used in a culturally sensitive way is an important consideration for pharmaceutical companies marketing in Saudi Arabia , as important as conventional factors such as efficacy and safety . <p> Furthermore , pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that their communication speaks to the correct audience . For example , although it might be usual in other markets for a female health product to speak just to a female audience , in Saudi Arabia , it might also be appropriate to include messaging for the male guardian as well . <p> Effective communication between patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality healthcare . Good communication can lead to improved patient satisfaction , adherence to medical recommendations , and better healthcare outcomes . Despite the government providing programs for expatriate healthcare workers , there is a need to further improve educational and orientation programs regarding the culture and language in Saudi Arabia . <p> Conclusion <p> Saudi Arabia , as the biggest market of the six Gulf Co-operation Council Countries , offers considerable opportunities to pharma . However , the strong influence of religion on culture and the way healthcare provision is perceived in Saudi Arabia , can be challenging . Understanding the patient is critical . We recommend pharmaceutical clients work with trusted and experienced market research partners who have a deep understanding of the country 's cultural , religious and social context , in order to harness the opportunity . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

In such a world , economists could communicate with politicians ; politicians could communicate with voters ; voters could even discuss Minecraft with their children . Whether or not you consider this prospect attractive , it 's not a scenario that seems likely to come about any time soon . The world is now too complex , and our lives too short , for any one individual to master it all . Even Einstein , despite his extraordinary grasp of physics , still needed help with his maths . <p> In fact , too much knowledge ' can be problematic even within a single field , including medicine .

Here , Digitize ' can mean the creation of unstructured , electronic text ( an email or PDF , for example ) or the creation of more organized , structured databases ( more like an Excel file ) . While the former have greatly facilitated communication between healthcare professionals , the latter can also be read by machines . Machines are far better suited to handling large volumes of data , but far more reliant on everyone using the same syntax and vocabulary . Computers , it seems , need a common language of medicine . They need interoperable ' data. - <p> There is now so much healthcare information being exchanged that a shift toward greater healthcare interoperability is as inexorable and as necessary as was specialization within the medical profession during the 20th century . And while , in one sense , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in another , it is likely to be the force that shapes it. - <p> Pharma 's grand opening <p> The pharmaceutical industry 's experience with interoperability centers on making the clinical trial data associated with any given product more accessible and interpretable to regulators ( conspicuously , the CDISC standard ) . Currently , however , we 're now seeing the roll-out of initiatives directed toward standardizing information across products/manufacturers and making that information much more widely available , most notably : <p> Transparency initiatives that require the results of clinical trials ( or even their clinical study reports in the case of EMA 's Policy 70 ) to be made available to the public ; The Identification of Medicinal Products ( IDMP ) standard , designed to provide rigid descriptions of drug composition , manufacture , licensing and clinical characteristics ; Serialization ( also known as Track-and-Trace ' ) programs requiring that unique identifiers be assigned to individual packets of medicines ( i.e. a number for each box , not just each batch ) <p> While the stated purpose of these initiatives ( chiefly , to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) have unanimous support in principle , the huge cost associated with their implementation has led some to question whether they can ever deliver on their investment . In reply , it 's necessary to consider some of the other , unintended consequences of their introduction . Given the myriad stakeholders among whom our health data must now flow ( see thedatamap.org for a dizzying perspective ) , there are many opportunities to do so . <p> Being more choosy <p> Earlier this year , Australian regulators censured the makers of the over-the-counter painkiller , Nurofen , describing the practice of targeting identical formulations toward different ailments ( Nurofen for migraine , for back-pain , for period-pain etc. ) as misleading . Of course , the amount of ibuprofen contained in Nurofen is detailed within the packaging and labeling , as are the ingredients of all pharmaceuticals , but in this unstructured , non-digitized format the information is not readily available for analysis or comparison . However , given an exhaustive and interoperable dataset of product compositions , it would take mere hours to create an app that identifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - Would interoperability in prescribing data promote the use of generics ? It seems highly likely that cash-strapped- payers- would seek to exploit the possibility . <p> If this possibility seems unlikely to be too impactful , it probably wo n't be . As evidenced by the continued market-diversification of toasted flakes of corn , few of us are likely to monitor what goes into our shopping-baskets so assiduously . However , high-cost prescription medicines may be a different story . While it 's true that national health policy rules play a significant role in determining whether prescribers or dispensers can substitute ' innovator products for generics or biosimilars , lack of awareness of these alternatives may be just as influential . Would interoperability in prescribing data promote the use of generics ? It seems highly likely that cash-strapped payers would seek to exploit the possibility. - <p> As it happens , it 's prescribing and dispensing , and being able to automate and monitor this process with a high degree of precision , where some of the greatest disruptions is likely to be observed . Once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what , who shipped that medicines and where , and who dispensed that medicine and to whom , all sorts of possibilities present themselves . <p> At the very beginning of this chain , the increasingly complex and time-consuming nature of the prescribing process makes greater usage of ' automation ' seem inevitable . Multiple factors need to be taken into account when devising a prescription " diagnosis , comorbidity , age , sex , weight , ethnicity , metabolizer genotypes , disease genotypes , lab results , and concomitant medications " thus requiring considerable time to resolve and raising the possibility of errors . The process would be immeasurably easier if a machine could automatically compare a patient 's clinical particulars against the prescribing rules for various medicines and thereby generate a recommendation . <p> This idea of tailoring treatments to individuals ( personalized medicine ' ) has become a hot topic in its own right , but it is important to note that it will not be possible on a large-scale without greater data interoperability . The FDA has made some headway into this territory , albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeling ( SPL ) . Likewise , the EMA previously initiated- but did not progress , its own project to create an electronic summary of product characteristics ( SPC ) . With the coming of the IDMP in Europe and beyond , we can expect to see the resurgence and advancement of such initiatives . Certainly , e-prescribing is one of the use cases identified for IDMP ( even it this is more orientated toward the physician-dispenser interaction , rather than the process of selecting an appropriate treatment ) . <p> Watching the watchers <p> The issue of prescribing raises another way in which interoperability may prove disruptive : off-label tracking . Irrespective of the indication that a medicine is actually approved to treat , physicians are free to prescribe that medicine off-label ' for whatever condition they choose . There are qualifications to this , most significantly the influence of what various payers are prepared to reimburse , but the central tenet remains true . Furthermore , tracking of this off-label use , although varying between countries and depending on whether the care is public or private ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is far from complete . What are the consequences if such information could be gathered globally , accurately and cheaply ? <p> One such consequence- could well be the sporting community coming under closer scrutiny . It is well known that some medications are used more widely off-label than they are on-label , including growth hormone and the blood-doping ' agent erythropoietin . Unless organized crime is involved ( e.g. smuggling and betting-related activity ) , the use of banned substances by athletes is a professional misdemeanour , dealt with by sports governing bodies , rather than a legal one . But given the recent scandals and the apparent impotence of these agencies , there is growing pressure to criminalize drug use in sport . Germany did exactly that earlier this year , with others likely to follow suit . Under this circumstance , the case to give law-enforcement agencies access to the data would be compelling . <p> And if law enforcement agencies are making use of this information , regulators and health policy architects must surely do so too . Usage is a vitally important component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not authorization can be granted at all . Adaptive licensing " the proposal that a narrow indication might be approved earlier in a drug 's development and then expanded and/or reassessed as new evidence becomes available " has two principle obstacles . The first is that payers may not accept the reduced evidential weight ; the second is that even if the risk-benefit is acceptable in the initial , narrow indication , unsupported use off-label might be extensive . Were regulators to have instant , reliable oversight over who was prescribing such medicines and for what , at least one of these obstacles could be ameliorated. - <p> The big issue <p> Of course , adaptive licensing is positioned to focus on rarer diseases . Are there any conceivable benefits for more widely used medications ? Likely enough , yes , and one of these - the rise of anti-microbial resistance ( AMR ) " is considered by some to pose as great a threat to humanity as global warming . The gravity of the situation has been perhaps best conveyed by the director of the WHO , Margaret Chan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described AMR as a ' slow-moving tsunami ' and highlighted only the most recent of the many ' alarm-bells ' sounding within the medical and research communities : the emergence of a new resistance-mechanism to colistin . <p> Colistin has been around for more than half a century- but fell out of use in the 1970s due to documented nephrotoxicity . The development of multidrug-resistance to other antibiotics has since necessitated its resurgence , despite these ill-effects , as the ' antibiotic of last resort ' for a number of life-threatening infections . The implications of research observing AMR to such drugs are stark : if we lose colistin , even minor operations could result in fatalities . A sobering review commissioned by the British Government projects that AMR will account for more deaths than cancer by 2050 . <p> Attempts to address AMR , however , including incentivizing pharma companies with legislation ( such as the US 's 2012 GAIN Act ) and even paying doctors not to prescribe them ( as has been seen in the UK ) have not been successful . Faced with such intractable risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrot is ineffective and that only the stick can bring about change . If so , regulators will need a reliable way of tracking how these drugs are being used in order to devise and enforce appropriate action . This would be an immensely difficult task requiring international cooperation , but the groundwork is being laid : IDMP is an international standard and one which can be applied to both medicinal and veterinary products , both of which are implicated in AMR . <p> HCPs unite ! <p> As noted earlier , it 's not only pharmaceutical regulators who are pushing for greater interoperability ; so too are healthcare providers ( HCPs ) and those who orchestrate them . <p> In the early 1990s , a technical standard called HL7 Version 2 began to permeate hospital IT systems , providing the format by which blood results are transferred from laboratory to Emergency Room , for example . Despite being a milestone on the road to full interoperability , Version 2 is actually quite a loose standard ' since it must accommodate some vastly differentiated IT systems globally . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperless and interconnected healthcare system , and so a more rigid but expandable successor was developed . <p> This successor , HL7 Version 3 , is in the very early stages of adoption by HCPs , most significantly via the roll-out of V3-based electronic healthcare records ( EHR ) in the US . And yet , despite the US government 's good intentions , many physicians say that administering their newly installed EHR systems is so time-consuming that it is preventing them from actually spending time with patients . A 2013 study by Hill et al found doctors in a busy emergency department to be spending 44% of their time on data entry . <p> If echoed across other departments and hospitals , such figures are indefensible . Healthcare is facing an increasingly challenging business model and for clinical expertise to be wasted on data entry is not sustainable . It seems it is HCPs who are in greatest need of interoperability and their cause would certainly be aided if the pharmaceutical industry , with all its might and the ( comparative ) ease with which it may implement new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HL7 V3 is indeed already in use in pharma . It supports multiple regulatory process in the US , such as SPL and drug establishment listings , and underpins the individual case safety report ( ICSR ) used around the world . The standard will now " via IDMP " come into processes as diverse as clinical trial authorizations , marketing applications , GMP inspections , serialization and of course electronic prescribing . Thus , by implementing IDMP and serialization , the pharmaceutical industry is facilitating interoperability projects aimed at driving efficiency and freeing up capital within their own client-base . <p> A web of health data <p> But why stop there ? Everyone recognizes the growing importance of real world evidence ' " data collected from patients outside structured clinical trials - and that information from HCPs , pharma , payers and patients must , therefore , coalesce . Can our efforts to further interoperability encompass all four of these stakeholders and not just the first two ? <p> In answer to this question , EHR records will , of course , be utilized by insurance companies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare apps market continues to bloom , with more than 150,000 available at last count ( IMS Health ) . Stitching everything together will not be an easy task , but HL7 has been working on FHIR ( Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ) , a framework that will allow health IT developers to readily develop products which can understand one another . While the normative edition of FHIR will not be formally released until early next year , manufacturers are already begun incorporating it into their wares , meaning the market may feel its impact sooner than expected . <p> What major obstacles or threats ought we to consider before we enter a new era of digitized , interconnected health ? Well , while the ecosystem must be open enough for us to realize the expected benefits in efficiency , costs , treatment outcomes and research ; the availability and use of patient-level data must be closely monitored . This is not merely a question of personal privacy , but an issue with the potential to impact the very viability of our healthcare model . This is because health data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , which translates to an increasing potential to undermine the health insurance market . A 2016 study by Blenner et al. , for example , found that , of 211 diabetes apps studied , 81% had no privacy policy whatever . <p> It seems unlikely that the market could reach an acceptable and sustainable equilibrium on its own , but a vigilant government could legislate to overcome such problems , just the US ' GINA Act and similar ( less focused ) European laws have almost totally outlawed the use of genetic information in the calculation of health-cover premiums . <p> Whatever the solution to the insurance question turns out to be , we in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries should not delay our interoperability objectives awaiting its creation .

@@24982526 @4982526/ <h> Designing to Succeed <p> The finalists for this year 's Most Valuable Patient Initiative or Service at the 2016 eyeforpharma Barcelona Awards showcase the potential for impact when patients become collaborators in design . <p> Understanding the human aspects of living with a condition is in many ways less straightforward than drug development . Everyone experiences their health challenges differently , and it 's clear this ca n't be designed for in a lab . <p> That 's why collaborating with the patient brings benefits . Here are three lessons we learned from this year 's crop of patient innovators : - <p> 1 . Ongoing engagement with the patient makes iterative design possible , - ideal for mHealth projects , where it is relatively easy to deploy updates through app store and Google Play . Merck deployed this strategy to great effect in the product development of their app Second Voice ' , an inspiring use of tech to help patients with difficulty speaking . <p> Patients can use the app to quickly draw on over 130 pre-programmed messages , including dedicated messages to communicate pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By listening to patient needs and designing a tool that helps in both a clinical and home setting , Merck have created a tool that really resonates with patients ; it has hit 2,500 downloads in just two months. - <p> In a similar vein , the team behind Roche 's diabetes app , Gluci-Chek , which quickly analyses the carbohydrate intake of meals , paneled patients online to ask them which features would best help them manage their condition . The team attributes the app 's success to engaging patients directly , and allowing them anonymously submit feedback ; which eliminates the bias from researchers in perceived patient needs . - <p> 2 . Novartis showed you do n't always need a shiny new technology to be innovative , with their program to improve access to employment for young professionals with Multiple Sclerosis . Younger people are disproportionately affected by MS , and diagnosis can make it doubly challenging to start building a career . <p> Beyond just co-founding their Believe &amp; Achieve ' work placement program in partnership with the European Multiple Scleroris Platform , they took leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . It is an inspiring example of the potential for pharma to help patients beyond just product-focused services , while building on one of pharma 's unique strengths . After all , is there anyone else better placed to create employment opportunities that take into account the challenges of ill-health ? <p> Teva also responded to the demographic challenges of MS and designed an mHealth app for patients being treated with Copaxone . Patients are expected to self-administer with a complicated injection process that can be painful if performed incorrectly . This delivery method was driving non-adherence , accounting for over 50% of patients who failed to take the medicine as prescribed . Teva worked closely with 15 patients to pilot an app that was tailored to each patient 's medical history , to help them take the drug correctly and avoid skin irritations . <p> 3 .

@@24982534 @4982534/ <h> Forecasting to be proactive , rather than reactive <p> By Anonymous ( not verified ) on Jun 22 , 2009 <p> According to Greg Fazzaro , Director of Finance for Novartis , the challenge in todays environment , where there always seems to be some kind of bad news coming out , is that we need to have up-to-date insight on the pharma marketplace and what that actually means for our sales forecast . <p> - Fazzaro told attendees at a recent eyeforpharma forecasting event that we also need to have a clear view of the risks and opportunities above and beyond that forecast . <p> Its one thing to know what you 're predicting sales will come in at , but what are your risks and opportunities so that you can make an informed decision ? he says . - We also need to understand things like inventory levels , stock outs and write offs . These are things that of course , in the end , impact sales . <p> From a supply chain standpoint , Fazzaro says , we also must manage our production plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a very large pharma company as well as generics maker and our products have very different lead times , he says . Some are very short and others are very long and you need to take that into account when doing forecasts . <p> Here a forecast , there a forecast <p> Historically , Novartis has had two different forecasts , Fazzaro says . The demand forecast is generated using the Futurecast system to produce a 72-month forecast by skew . And while he says it sounds like a lot , Fazzaro stresses its actually needed from a production standpoint . <p> It takes three to five years to build a plant , so we have to have some insight into the future and its much easier to forecast at a consistent granularity , he says . <p> Fazzaro says the forecasts are also built with different assumptions , events and trends and although you may have a demand manager and finance manager sitting no more than 10 meters apart , often they do n't  know that the other exists . So you would have two different forecasts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its not that we want to go to one number , but clearly you want some commonality in how those forecasts are built , he says . There was very little , to no cross-functional effort between the different customer groups of marketing , finance , supply chain . Everybody was coming up with their own numbers . There were different timelines , different granularities . The demand plan was at SKU , the finance plan was at brand . <p> With two or more forecasts , Fazzaro says , the trouble is knowing where the truth lies . Although some argue the benefit of having a couple of different views , he says , there are some key issues to consider . <p> As he explains , the demand plan is used for production plans to determine capacity increases , to understand where investments should be made as well as to facilitate long-term supply agreements . And from the financial forecast perspective , its used for resource allocation things like where scarce marketing dollars should be invested and how much should be spent on research and development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment community , he says . If any of these are misaligned , wrong decisions are made in terms of investments or funding , he says . <p> You can have excess inventory , which equals increased write-offs , which is just a hit right off the bottom line , Fazzaro says . And that 's actually how we were able to get the marketing folk to see why they need to pay attention to this . If you have to keep profitability at a certain level and you 're basically throwing money away with write offs , the easiest way to get profitability back is to start to cut marketing spend and that hits home for the marketing people . <p> And he says if you have stock-outs , not only is it lost sales , but it starts to have negative impacts on patients , especially if its a lifesaving drug . <p> The typical sales forecast , Fazzaro says , was two distinct processes with no alignment the demand and financial forecasts are made in isolation using different assumptions , events and trends . <p> Everybody tends to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a launch is going to happen , he says . But based upon the different needs of the plans , there are sometimes different dates . <p> Within Novartis , Fazzaro says , the financial forecast was always perceived as conservative , due in part to the incentive process , while the demand forecast was always seen as optimistic , unconstrained . <p> So you have these large , unclear differences , he says . At the country level , the local forecast was done in the two areas finance and demand . Demand was submitted all the way up to global with no interference . But the financial forecast would go through a couple layers of review , so by the time you went from the country all the way up to global it started to skew either higher or lower , depending upon needs . <p> An integrated sales forecasting process <p> But in 2008 , the group rolled out an integrated sales forecasting process a single process with better alignment , Fazzaro says . <p> What we want to do with this process is have mid-point forecasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using common assumptions , events and trends through a cross-functional effort involving all the parties that have the relevant information colleagues from supply chain , finance , marketing , trade , QA , DRA , etc. , he explains . We also want to try for monthly alignment of the financial and demand forecast at least at the country level , with smaller and clearer differences . <p> One key point , Fazzaro says , is that they wanted to make sure there were no safety stock buffers in the forecast . <p> As we talked to many of the countries , we found out that as they were building the forecast , they would say well we really think its going to be 100 but just in case were going to put in 110 so that we have extra , he says . Well that safety stock is actually separately managed through the MRP2 process , so you 're actually double counting safety stock . We really had to educate people to put in what they really thought because there 's a separate process when its going to the production chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , Fazzaro says , Novartis wants to get to one process producing two forecasts . <p> A basic tenet of the companys approach for integrating sales forecasting , he says , includes making a monthly demand forecast the basis for the short to long-term financial sales forecast . Although every month they generated a 72-month sales forecast by SKU , Fazzaro says it was n't leveraged as much as it needed to be . <p> We showed the finance people and the market people that we already had a forecast going out into the future and encouraged them to use it , he says . The financial forecast can then be derived from that forecast using management adjustments . There 's always going to be the need to tweak it a little bit , but in the end you 're reducing parallel work because its a single , cross-functional effort . You 're aligning everything up front as much as possible , rather than waiting to the end and seeing this large divergence and trying to figure out how to get- it back to somewhere in the middle . <p> Novartis also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities for everyone in the sales forecasting process , Fazzaro says . In Novartis Pharma , finance plays the lead role , he explains . <p> The CRO in the country actually owns the sales forecasting process , he says . That may be somewhat unique , but our thinking behind is that finance , and specifically the CFO , sit in a unique position to bridge between marketing and demand . And the CFO also has a certain level of power in the sense that if there are differences between the forecasts , he or she can negotiate as to where it should go . And when you have a sales forecasting meeting , if the CFO is leading that process , you can be sure that the brand manager will attend . <p> - Novartis also has an escalation route , Fazzaro says , for forecast misalignments . There are going to be times when you cant agree , he says , and in the end the CFO has to be aware of that and sign off on it because it will impact profitability , the sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate operational efficiency , he says . By doing this process and putting everybody together , we can optimize inventory levels , reduce stock outs and minimize write-offs and waste . <p> Its a monthly process , Fazzaro stresses , driven and owned by the CFO , with the key inputs being actual sales and prior forecast submissions and trends , as well as updated assumptions , events , market information and pricing . <p> Forecasting in a changing world <p> You need to say , OK here is what happened . What does it mean going forward as well as what 's changed in the market since our last forecast and in todays world ? he explains . Every day the world is changing , so we need to try to take that into account and at least take a snapshot and based upon our best information and knowledge , say here 's what 's going to happen . <p> Fazzaro stresses that companies need to understand their inventory , stock-out and write-off positions. - <p> You do n't  want to keep producing if you have a lot of inventory , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock because your product is taking off faster than expected , he says . <p> Globally , Fazzaro says Novartis brand managers own the launch forecast , because the countries do n't  always know all the details , but locally the marketing side needs to own the SKU forecast what is actually sold in the country and they need to own the local forecast assumptions . <p> And the supply chain organization needs to globally manage capacity to ensure supply that we have enough plants , that the production schedules are set , that we can produce what we need in a timely and cost efficient manner , he says . They own inventories and manage customer service levels so that if you place an order , its delivered and you get what you expected . The supply chain organization needs to own the local parameters and local customer service making sure that products are delivered to wholesalers , for instance , and they need to manage supply and demand , while also analyzing and challenging forecasts . <p> Finance , Fazzaro explains , sits in the middle . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and overall forecast validation , collection and analysis . They communicate the aligned assumptions between the different parties , he says , and also own the consensus forecast . <p> The financial forecast is built off of the demand plan and of course at the financial level you need to assess and optimize the inventory levels , he says . - <p> Measuring the results <p> Fazzaro says that its one thing to roll something out , but if you do n't  measure the success in implementation it easily dies off . <p> So Novartis put in place two sets of KPIs process and business . From a process perspective , they 're measuring process compliance . Is it truly a cross functional effort ? Is the CFO driving it ? Are financial forecasts based off of the demand forecast ? <p> We needed to be sure to put the pressure on people that this is a process that 's been approved by senior management and its what we need to implement , Fazzaro says . - As we rolled this out in the countries , we saw many times we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would simply drop to zero . We would explain that they did n't  have to have the same level of accuracy as in the first 18 months , but at least we need to know what the future looks like through their best estimate . If you have a forecast that 's going to deviate significantly from the trend , you want to explain that by an event is there a generic entrant , is there a competitor , etc. ? You need to understand that and it needs to be transparent and documented . <p> Fazzaro said as they rolled out last year , they saw a variety of feelings about the process . <p> Some said it was a must that they could n't live with large differences between the forecasts , it drives the necessary behaviors for integrating across the different functions , and brings in place a discipline to how we plan , he says . On the negative side , we heard there are good reasons why you should have two different forecasts , that we need a clear policy on how to handle things like safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we really needed to show people the benefits of the process and bring naysayers along by showing what you can get out of it . <p> Fazzaro says the benefits Novartis has seen include lower stock outs and write offs across the organization , much higher transparency in forecasts , and an uptick in forecast accuracy . <p> This all yields increased visibility into the direction of the company , he says . We can make better decisions about where we should invest money and so we have more funds for reinvestment because were not wasting it on write offs or stock outs . We 've increased our overall customer service levels internally and externally , and upfront alignment and communication results in reduced workloads because there 's - less time spent bridging between forecasts and sending out ad hoc requests . <p> Fazzaro says the approach allows everyone to better understand the business and the challenges and to start to formulate things they can do to be proactive rather than reactive . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982537 @4982537/ <h> The Real Emotional Sell <p> What do you think when you hear the phrase emotional selling ' ? Do you think about what is being sold or the way it is being sold ? <p> Over the years and countless interviews with HCPs , it has become very clear to me that the role a product plays in the selling story is just that " a role . Even when it has a lead role , what wins the audience over is something much less tangible . Nuances around the story , the angle , the personality of the sales rep and how the product is made uniquely pertinent to each HCP are far more powerful than the product itself . <p> Certainly , bringing the product to life in an emotive and compelling way is the foot-in-the-door . The last thing a sales rep wants is for an HCP to switch off before the conversation gets going . No matter how wonderful the product is , to make it stick , the story needs to be directly relevant to the customer . <p> Of course , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystical art . I have heard tales from the coalface of how reps have engaged even the trickiest of customers by slowly bringing them along the journey to brand loyalty , largely via the building of personal trust and a friendly , positive relationship . Looking a little deeper , however , a more scientific framework is evident . <p> Certainly , personality is important , but there are three key elements that any rep can leverage for a more compelling sell . These elements are deeply rooted in behavioral science . They focus on the nature of the connection a rep has with a customer , how the product is framed with that customer , and how risk is reduced or mitigated . These three elements , when better understood , enable a plan to be formulated , current technique to be tweaked , and greater sales achieved . <p> Connect <p> Do n't underestimate the importance of the connection . Know who you are talking to and tailor your story to build a personal , and therefore , emotional link between you and your customer . Value and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave them in no doubt why this product is relevant to them specifically and to their patients . A one-size-fits-all story will not achieve this level of personal engagement . <p> Simple , to-the-point clips in patients ' ( and carers ' ) own words can be powerful and help contextualize the product . Note to marketers : detailing kit needs to support the dynamic conversation and the relationship the rep is working to develop . Think customer , not product . <p> Understandably many of my clients over the years have opted for a uni-voice sales story for their products . In reality , sales reps then tailor it on the spot using a combination of skill and instinct . The trouble with this approach is that it can be rather hit or miss . It certainly does n't arm sales teams with options or angles that could more consistently and effectively hook in a customer and maximize sales . <p> Frame the content <p> Contextualize your communication using the specific interests and needs of your customer . Plan for this ahead of time . Stay on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reps are using interactive tablets and are able to move the conversation along with a whole host of stimuli at their fingertips . These stimuli , however , need to be very clear and easy to use , thinkelevator pitch ' scenario . <p> Time and time again I have heard HCPs saying how they wished schematics of modes of action were more simple ; how the presentation of data is too complex for them to convey the actual benefits of a drug to their patient . How data is presented needs to be both visual and intuitive . The so what ' must be obvious without detailed discussion . <p> Bringing patient perspectives and outcomes to life within the sales call is also very effective to demonstrate the true benefits of a product . Simple , to-the-point clips in patients ' ( and carers ' ) own words can be powerful and help contextualize the product . Note to marketers : detailing kit needs to support the dynamic conversation and the relationship the rep is working to develop . Think customer , not product . <p> Reduce the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Risk seems less risky the more we know . Obviously , this is n't always possible especially if sales territories are disparate and there are many HCPs to see . Multiple visits are ideal , but a lot can be achieved in a single conversation. - If you know you have a more conservative customer , you may want to build your story for them , crafting it carefully and providing reassurance throughout . For the time-poor customers , start with the key point that matters to them and aim for an emotional response : surprise and shock can work well in this context . Be considerate . Demanding lots of time all at once is rarely effective with this cohort ; a series of short and snappy visits will build respect and trust . <p> Building long-term brand loyalty does not happen overnight . Sales conversations need to be deliberate , but patient . With every meaningful conversation , a deeper emotional connection is built , between the sales rep and the customer , between the customer and the brand . <p> Optimizing customer insight <p> Where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market research with HCPs is the ideal source . Effective segmentation and emotional insights hold critical angles that sales teams can work with to sell more effectively . <p> For this to happen , these insights must be cascaded to those on the front line . Sales reps play an integral part in brand success , and insights that can dramatically improve selling content and strategy need to be activated with their input . A strategy that embraces insight , marketing and sales personnel offers the best opportunity to maximize both execution and sales . 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

( For more on Brazil , see Breaking into the Brazilian pharma market ' . ) <p> Access for all <p> However , it is worth noting that this announcement is an extension of policies , such as Farmacia Popular , which are already being implemented . <p> Since 2004 , 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily subsidized by the government through this network of pharmacies , with a 90% discount in price .

All the ingredients for a great love-match are there : compatibility , opportunity , support from those around you ... but something 's missing . So it seems for mHealth and clinical trials . <p> They are compatible : patients are demonstrating an increasing desire to be involved and informed about their care ; doctors are increasingly turning to tools that enable them to work more efficiently . There is opportunity : over 70% of mobiles sold in the UK are smartphones , while one in five doctors in Europe use tablets professionally . And there is support : although a bit slow on the uptake , pharma has now shown its enthusiasm for mHealth . <p> But despite all these positive signs , we 've just witnessed the recent abandonment of Pfizer 's online trial . And now Blue Chip Patient Recruitment has released a white paper detailing the results of their three month mHealth survey , which is n't exactly bursting with enthusiasm for the potential to recruit participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose we should look on the bright side : at least we have n't got to wait a whole year before we try again , unlike these poor Scottish panda enthusiasts . <p> And we should try again , because the ingredients for a great relationship are there : it 's just going to take a bit of time to get the measurements right . <p> So BCRP has a bit of a po-face on at the moment because apparently more than 75 per cent of surveyed patients prefer to use their smartphones and tablets for communication " that is , texting , emailing and calling " rather than downloading apps and going online . So , this perhaps does n't look that good for recruiting patients online " although , as BCRP themselves note , early adopters ' , aged around 35-54 , are in fact likely to get digitally involved in a clinical trial .

It also found that 75% of doctors would use apps to identify patients to participate in studies . <p> So despite teething issues , it does look like pharma 's on the right track with digital .

Switching a product from the prescription marketplace to that of OTC is a strategy adopted to maximize the product lifecycle , and mitigate against patent expiry . <p> For marketers , the path from prescription to OTC is not easy . In addition to regulatory challenges , it requires a creative strategy to effectively navigate the transition . Successful marketing in an OTC arena requires a different strategy and tactics to that of the prescription market . A fundamental shift in approach is needed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirectly communicating with patients , to taking a more rounded approach with consumers at its heart . <p> Critical to the success of the product in an OTC setting is the appreciation that the needs of a consumer are distinguished and separate to that of the patient. - <p> Consumers as self-managers <p> Improved health literacy within the general population , supported by the huge amount of information available online means that individuals are increasingly able to manage common health conditions independently , with minimal input from healthcare professionals . Of course , the extent to which this is true depends on the therapeutic area.Where symptoms are clearly differentiated , treatment guidance is freely available , and products and tools easy to access , consumers are often able to make decisions about how best to manage their condition , and only seek advice when needed . <p> Self-management of everyday health conditions is well-established " most individuals are comfortable self-selecting a medicine for a headache , cough , or cold . The boundaries , however , are being pushed , with individuals becoming increasingly confident : taking responsibility for managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies . <p> For some , the availability of OTC medicines is a huge relief . In areas such as erectile dysfunction , where sufferers are embarrassed to speak with a healthcare professional , relatively easy access to drugs such as Viagra has opened up treatment possibilities where none previously existed . <p> Clearly , it is important to support consumers to self-manage their condition effectively . In order to draw new people into a category , and attract them to your brand , tactics that empower the consumer are needed. - This may include generating tools to help consumers to diagnose the relevant condition that also walk them through the different treatment options so that they arrive at the best choice for them . <p> A range of influencing channels <p> Consumers are exposed to a range of different influences that shape product choice including : social media and online resources , word of mouth from family and friends , direct to consumer advertising , merchandising , and intervention from pharmacy workers and other healthcare professionals . The journey that a consumer embarks upon and the weight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country and the category . To give an example of the former , in Germany , you can only buy medicines from the pharmacy ; whereas in the UK , you can buy a range of medicines from mass channels such as supermarkets and other general stores . Take , for example , sore throat consumers ; they are likely to depend on well-known brands that are easily available , and rarely consult a pharmacist . On the other hand , consumers suffering from conditions such as IBS are likely to present to a GP for diagnosis and initial recommendations about treatment . It is only over time that they come to rely on their own experience and expertise without the need for healthcare professional input . <p> Key to success is an influencer strategy that draws upon the right touchpoints for the consumer " depending on their location and condition. - - - <p> The power of social media and online resources <p> As we know , consumers are increasingly referring to social media and online resources for information . Many consumers are engaging with online forums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms to aid their own decision-making . The power of word-of-mouth is well sung ; in condition areas where consumers are less likely to know others who have tried products within the appropriate category , social media can only become more prominent . <p> For pharma professionals , this is a clear top tip that we absolutely need to be finely tuned into social media output in relation to key brands . Monitoring this channel is critical , and campaigns that leverage this media can be pertinent . <p> The importance of pharmacy <p> Pharmacy workers are a likely first port of call for self-managing consumers that discern a need to talk to an HCP . They also have the power to intervene during a transaction with a consumer and make a recommendation . <p> In the context of an Rx to OTC switch , the pharmacist may need education and support to feel comfortable recommending and supporting use of a product that was previously prescription only . They will need to feel reassured about safety , confident that they understand when the product should be used versus alternatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require guidance about information and advice that they should give to patients alongside . <p> This makes it extremely beneficial to brands to get pharmacy workers on board . There are a range of strategies that can be adopted to do so . From developing initiatives to support and partner with pharmacies , to building flexible and responsive distribution and purchasing models , to relying on product-centric activities . <p> And above all do n't estimate the power of brand image <p> Contrary to what we often think about selling to healthcare professionals , when it comes to consumers , the look and feel of the brand is one of the most compelling drivers of purchase . To sell a product to a consumer , it is important to go beyond proving efficacy , and reassuring about safety . In fact , in many cases consumers will take this for granted if the product is available OTC . <p> An OTC brand needs to appeal to a broad range of needs " beyond efficacy and safety , and connect at an emotional level . - Thinking like a consumer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key and we must constantly ask ourselves : is this a brand for me ? <p> Questions or comments ?

@@24982578 @4982578/ <h> Trimming out the oma : how to avoid the too-clever forecast <p> In medical terms , the suffix oma is used to denote a morbid condition of a part , usually some kind of growth . According to Gary Johnson , managing director of Inpharmation , a forecast can suffer from various oma conditions as well , when a forecast becomes too large and complex . <p> At the Pharma Forecasting Excellence USA conference sponsored by eyeforpharma , Johnson addressed the question , Can a forecast be too clever for its own good ? Too often , in a fervor to craft a truly thorough , comprehensive model , forecasters instead create a model that is simply too complex , one that is subject to error and one that contains factors which may have little or no genuine impact on accuracy . So , what are the potential consequences of making forecasts that are too complicated ? <p> Two types of forecast quality Says Johnson , there are really two quality issues at work here . Quality type one is simply a measure of error how many mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugely complicated code and formulae are wide open to error . Between one and five per cent of cells in a spreadsheet will contain an error that 's the nature of human limitation and the more complicated the spreadsheet , the higher the likelihood and number of errors . Additionally , the more complicated the code or formula of a cell in a spreadsheet , the harder that spreadsheet becomes to audit . Prewritten codes which can be debugged and then used over and over provide a solution . Proven codes and formulae which can be dropped into a spreadsheet easily and without fear of mistakes produce forecasts of high type one quality . <p> Quality type two has to do with building a model that works . The problem , according to Johnson , is that many models which look like models are in fact nothing more than highly sophisticated calculators . A close look at the numbers reveals that nearly all the most important information is based on guesswork . Numbers like projected market share , for example , are pulled out of the air , says Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model . As Johnson points out , A complex spreadsheet which is populated largely by guesses is not a quality forecast . <p> Zooming in on a spreadsheet until the elemental level is reached reveals the somewhat apocryphal nature of the numbers . I assert that itll take X years for product Y to reach peak share . The problem with this , Johnson says , is that people are notoriously poor guessers on issues like peak share . <p> A far better approach is a simpler one . What predictors of behavior are already known ? For example , product uptake curves : will it be fast or slow ? We know that uptake differs from country to country , and that these differences tend to be consistent . Product uptake is slower in the UK and faster in Italy , for example . If the new therapy fills a hole in the market , then uptake is generally much swifter . And if the new therapy fits with existing practices ( switching from a tablet to a tablet ) , the uptake is quicker than if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sensitive to sunlight and will have to come to your office after hours ) . Simple , evidence-based models which exploit known behaviors are far better than ones based on guesswork . <p> Even the experts do n't  guess as well as we might imagine they will . As Paul Meehl posited in his book Clinical vs . Statistical Prediction , simple statistical models did as well or better than the experts in accurately predicting future behaviors . Says Johnson , if you 're forecasting something that happens over and over again , look for the simple patterns that are already out there , and use them as the basis for the forecast . <p> Keep it simple In virtually every study done comparing the accuracy of complex models versus simple ones , the simple models are always at least as good and often better . Yet , if you ask forecasting experts if complexity generates a better , more accurate model , the overwhelming majority would say yes . <p> However , in studies of econometric models , evidence points to little difference between the two in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler models ( like exponential smoothing ) contained far fewer errors than more complex models ( like Box-Jenkins ) . And this same phenomenon has shown up everywhere in conjoint analysis , extrapolation , econometrics , even in expert judgment . Simplicity yields clarity ; complexity fogs it . <p> Best of all is a combination of several methods . Viewing a problem from many angles provides the most complete view . The average of the numbers from several different forecasts is always more accurate than the numbers from any single model . Do n't  have a favorite , Johnson says ; combining techniques answers more questions and eliminates more errors . <p> Model-oma : creating a model that 's too complex Several bad practices feed into the phenomenon Johnson terms model-oma . Word-oma is the tendency of people to sit around and brainstorm ideas , then throw them all into a spreadsheet before they 've tested the validity of those ideas . This rush to the spreadsheet results in complex models full of untested ideas . Words , according to Johnson , must always be tested . It does n't  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is important , what matters are those actions that have genuine impact . <p> Event-oma causes forecasts full of non-events . Johnson gave as an example an occurrence in the UK . Doctors werent generally paid much and werent really performing all that well . The government came to the conclusion that the reason some very basic health care practices werent being done was because those practices were terribly difficult . To counter this , a system of rewards was put in place , and targets were set . One target had to do with statin use . Statin prescriptions did increase , and doctors claimed that the reward system had a great deal to do with their prescribing decision . However , a look at the trajectory reveals that statin use was already rising , and extrapolating the curve showed that the target and reward had little or no actual impact . And , of course , everyone accounted for the non-event of targets and rewards in their forecasts . <p> Segment-oma the drive to include all possible segments in a forecast should be subject to serious quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forecasters need to be certain that the segment is of appreciable size to merit inclusion and that there are measurable differences in behavior between the segments . Trying to include all the potential segments overcomplicates the forecast and risks including those with little or no discernible impact . <p> One example of segment-oma is the tendency of forecasters to assign too much importance to FDA labels . If a label says that this new drug can be used on people whove already tried that drug , for example , there 's an assumption that the people described necessarily become a target segment for the new therapy . However , studies of physician compliance demonstrate a certain lack of adherence to these labels doctors are , generally , perfectly comfortable disregarding the label when making prescribing decisions . The label information is therefore useless in designating segments . Inclusion in a forecast should be reserved for genuine segments , Johnson says , based on proven facts about behaviors , not assumptions . <p> Technique-oma refers to the tendency among forecasters to use heroic , sophisticated techniques to produce forecast models . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnson says , or ridiculously simple . The technique of conjoint analysis sets out to build a computer model of the different elements of a drug that are important to doctors when they 're making prescription decisions . Each therapy has a set of attributes ( speed of onset , for example ) , and these attributes contribute to its likeability . A drug that has fast onset and is easily administered is more inherently likeable than one that 's slow and burdensome to administer . Determining a drugs likeability profile can be a complicated , arduous process ( conjoint analysis ) , or it can be relatively simple . The simple , self explicated technique involves taking a drug , rating how good all its different attributes are and weighing the factors appropriately . This system works at least as well and often better than a more complex analysis . And the fancier version has the added disadvantage of fooling people into thinking that the conjoint analysis on its own is sufficient to build a forecast . Its not . <p> There 's a great deal more to a drugs success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how important is it to add the impact of drivers other than the profile ? Order of entry to the market is extremely important and should not be overlooked ; likewise the efforts and resources allocated to a drugs promotion have marked effects on the therapys success . Adding just these simple drivers lends a level of accuracy comparable to all the conjoint analysis . <p> The all-in-one model ( conjoint plus drivers ) provides a highly accurate prediction of therapy class shares . The more drivers and models that are added to the mix , the more accurate the results . <p> Common-sense models for the win Studies bear out the notion that common sense and simplicity in forecasting are best , even in such a complex marketplace . As Johnson says , both quality types one and two are improved by not trying to be too clever . In fact , models that are too overthought can actually introduce complications that do n't  actually exist in the market . Says Johnson , simple forecasting techniques can estimate all the key numbers in a market model . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

@@24982581 @4982581/ <h> From dinosaur to digital <p> 2014 represents a tipping point for the traditionally conservative healthcare sector : from now on , the majority of healthcare professionals ( HCPs ) will be digital natives . At the same time , technology has dramatically empowered stakeholders " physicians , patients and payers " by delivering access to multiple sources of information , compelling pharma companies to rethink the way they connect with these groups . <p> Today 's commercial landscape is all about engagement across the customer spectrum and creating genuine value , as opposed to simply supplying a product . Accordingly , pharma strategists recognize that the old-school approach of pushing information at stakeholders is no longer effective ; the days of giant sales organizations slugging it out to achieve revenue , reach and frequency seem positively prehistoric . Pharma has woken up to find itself in the digital age . <p> Naturally , technology has the potential to empower pharma itself . A recent study by consultants Arthur D. Little indicates that executives understand that digital health will have transformed pharma 's business model by 2020 : 84% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health strategy in 2020 , compared with just 13% who believed it was already crucial today . <p> Digital is already making a big impact everywhere in pharma , from new product concepts to clinical trials and on into the commercial stages of the brand cycle : it 's starting to shape pharma 's customer-facing organizations including the sales force , although many companies are still at the stage of coming to terms with the implications . Interviews with pharma executives conducted during research foreyeforpharma'sthe new white paperconfirm that the digital revolution is not only influencing the size of sales organizations in terms of absolute numbers but also shaping the roles that salespeople perform , the techniques and channels they use to engage , and the skills they require . <p> Like almost everything in pharma , digital innovation has been relatively slow to make inroads . Nevertheless , because of the changes it heralds , digital requires people to make adjustments ; inevitably , technology is seen as a threat by those who prefer the status quo . <p> Enlightened pharma executives argue that digital per se is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the sales organization who choose to embrace it . Technology helps the best salespeople do what they have always done , only better " bring value to customers through effective communication . The real threat lies in failing to respond to the changes in the commercial landscape that technology is ushering in . <p> Evolution of the rep <p> In response , new and updated skills will be needed , not only in terms of handling the technology itself but also in relation to tailoring content for individual customers . Salespeople will require the capability to interact via various channels , both face-to-face and online , so we are likely to see more hybrid reps in future . In general , reps will need to be increasingly agile and flexible : could it be that Tyrannosaurus rep is starting to evolve into Velocireptor ? <p> Other changes are afoot , too : because customers have huge demands on their time and are able to find routine product information online , engagements between physicians and salespeople will be reserved for occasions where specific interaction is required . While reps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will frequently also require greater depth and breadth of knowledge . In general , reps will move higher up the food chain as they become more knowledgeable and skilful , both in terms of domain knowledge and business know-how . <p> At the same time , there is likely to be a new focus on customer satisfaction , listening skills and communications ability , rather than traditional selling skills ( in common with other industries ) . <p> So what of the opportunities that technology brings ? Digital offers massively expanded choice for physicians in terms of the channels they have available to obtain information ; today 's customers expect to find the information they are seeking through whichever channel they prefer at the time they need it . Meanwhile , pharma is attempting to fulfil this demand through a variety of multichannel marketing ( MCM ) initiatives . <p> Benefits for pharma <p> For pharma , technology offers the opportunity to transform the customer experience , but only if digital is viewed as an enabler rather than an end in itself . The geek contingent aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What technology does achieve for pharma is to lower the cost per contact while simultaneously providing the opportunity to analyse important metrics such as customer engagement . Digital and a multichannel approach offer potential for greater engagement of physicians , patients and payers as well as the opportunity for in-depth analysis of customer behavior . <p> Going forward , digital innovations such as the provision of rich content , interactivity and real-time analysis will undoubtedly be significant , albeit that their contribution may only be evolutionary " part of the process of continuous improvement . In contrast , the four potentially revolutionary game-changers are predicted to be : virtual events , social media , social media monitoring and big data in general . <p> Each provides new opportunities for pharma and its sales and marketing organizations either to engage more effectively or to gain greater insight into their customers . <p> New skills <p> What does this mean for the salespeople involved ?

In the digital world , the role of the rep is likened by many to the conductor of an orchestra " the maestro who brings together the many channels of communication at his or her disposal into a harmonious whole designed to please the audience . <p> Of course , that audience is our customers , and research confirms that companies capable of providing customers with a better experience consistently perform better financially . With the help of digital , the sales force is in the perfect position to deliver that enhanced customer experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Its a lofty goal that is potentially fraught with many obstacles , but , in my opinion , its a win-win for everyone involved . <p> Katrina S.

@@24982595 @4982595/ <p> ANDREAS : Thank you very much . Can you hear me in the back ? There 's actually not very much left to say , because Dr. Kramer 's said it all , so I thank you for your attention and .......... <p> Essentially , there are three distinctive features that indeed distinguish Boehringer Ingelheim from Novartis , from Pfizer , from SmithKline and even from Roche . You heard about the remark of Dr. Kramer that companies are shutting down Basic Research Institutes that they tend to sponsor . Boehringer Ingelheim does not so , and I'sm in P &amp; D and its one of the best examples where industry funded basic research is performed at a real centre of excellence . Argument number two is Boehringer Ingelheim is a privately held company . You can'st buy shares and argument number three is we'sre not talking about big Pharma here , because frankly spoken being number 19 , you will not be really able to talk about big Pharma . <p> To give you an overview anyway about Boehringer Ingelheim and its research and development OPU 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are an internationally based research organisation with a number of research OPU 's . There 's essentially seven all over the world with different indications . I apologies for the German names . That will not continue to be the case . Boehringer Ingelheim is involved in human pharmaceuticals and animal health . 95% constitutes the human pharmaceuticals and about 5% animal health . The revenues in 2000 have been USD6 billion , which really places us in the range of the upper 20 pharmaceutical companies , but indeed being at position number 19 exactly and I think there 's quite some gap between number 18 and number 19 and we'sll not be able to halt to come to number 18 unless there is another big merger going on in the upper ranges . The total R &amp; D budget is roughly 16% of the total revenues , so that 's quite a lot . Boehringer Ingelheim is a research based company . There is about 27 000 employees working in 130 affiliated companies , so again , despite this somewhat smaller size Boehringer Ingelheim is an internationally working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on today very briefly is the drug discovery pipeline , as obviously all of you know , with its various different steps from very early target identification via the step through high throughput screening , lead identification and the preclinical and clinical phases . The question simply is , where does genomics assist us , where does it support us and the answer is , there may be three major areas where genomics indeed can give support . One in the very early phases in target discovery and target validation described as functional genomics , essentially , in the sense of the word , as Dr. Kramer 's described . A second discipline would be the toxicogenomics part which I may be able to elucidate for one or two minutes at the end of my talk , that would talk about the drug safety feature and pharmacogenomics would be in the latter part of the drug discovery pipeline . <p> Now the interest of Boehringer Ingelheim in functional genomics is , for target discovery , for target validation and for the identification of early end point markers , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in developing diagnostics . Prognostic markers would be interesting though in the therapeutic regimen once there is a target identified . In toxicogenomics , particular interest is in drug safety and in pharmacogenomics , where we frankly are spoken in very early pilot phases there is recruitment of patients in one patient collection so far in clinical phase two for a pilot study where drug metabolism , pharmacodynamics , clinical testing and patient profiling would be of interest . <p> Now , the four issues that I would like to present to you today , essentially , it 's the first three and the fourth may be obsolete for time reasons , but I think the three interesting ones that I would like to communicate to you are , first the genomic infrastructure at a company as small as Boehringer Ingelheim , the question , how do we identify targets with those facilities that we'sve set up and how do we prioritise and validate those potential targets that are identified through those functional genomic studies ? I'sd like to begin with the description of how we set up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three major points that we have used to set up those genomics infrastructures . One is that there should be an integral concept that works over all the research OPU 's and the second one is that those genomics facilities should be integrated into the biological research intimately embedded into the therapeutic areas , with the aim to work on a process oriented basis , which means that were intimately involved in the genomics group intimately involved in the projects going on in the therapeutic areas and those therapeutic areas at the four major research OPU 's are first of all in Germany , in Austria , then thirdly in Connecticut here in the US and in Lavalle Forte in Montreal in Canada . The therapeutic areas are indicated here , the yellow bubbles , there 's C &amp; S research going on , cardiovascular research , metabolic research and respiratory in Germany , there 's an oncology therapeutic department in Vienna , inflamation and auto immune diseases going on in the US and virology in Canada , and as you can see , each of the research OPU 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very closely interact with the therapeutic areas on site , which would guarantee that there is the possibility for interactive research in each of the therapeutic areas , which would then , because is this decentralised organisation , which will be co-ordinated centrally through a genomics working team , where each and every group leader within the four different genomics groups will actually work together and define strategic goals . <p> Now looking particularly , of course , at the German OPU , the structure is explained such that the therapeutic area and the genomics group for certain projects will share both expertise and manpower and that expertise and manpower will work together in a team for a given amount of time until that particular project has come to a point that the results go back into the therapeutic area . This is what we designate our genomics loop and this genomics loop presently we have a number of projects with different therapeutic areas that swallows about 5% of our total research effort , both using FTE 's and budget . <p> Now , as to the more interesting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects , the key technology that we'sre presently using in about 80% of all our research efforts is the use of DNA chips or DNA microrays and this may not be new to you , therefore I'sll be going through very quickly . We'sre using the athymetrics chip system . There is also an Insight based system on site , but we have distinctly noticed that there is so much more reproducibility and sensitivity in the Athymetrics system that we'sre almost exclusively using the Athymetrics system , but you all know , the athymetics chip based system contains a facility to test 260 000 independent oligos on one chip , which essentially , if you use a number of different genes where there are multiple spots on this chip for testing genes , you can test up to 7 or 8 or 12 000 different genes on a single chip and this actually is the technological basis that we use for a number of expression profiling experiments as we call them . <p> Now , what is the work flow in those expression profiling experiments ? Both the therapeutic area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint project idea , which means that the expertise both from pharmacology and from molecular biology get into that one project idea and then an expression profiling experiment where the acquisition of samples is clear , there may be normal diseased pairs , there may be treated , non treated pairs , both in vivo or in vitro or in animal models , is being carried through either using proteomics analysis or as I said , in 80% of the cases , using the Athymetrics DNA chip analysis and then data are acquired through the expression profiling . The result will be a list of deregulated genes and whoever does these analyses will know that these lists may be of different complexities , some may be very ease to achieve , some may contain hundreds of different genes , so the question is , how do you prioritise those lists that come out of those experimental approaches ? And there is a number of parameters that you can apply in order to prioritise those and I will go through these when it comes to target validation . We would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chips by complimentary technologies . We would like to determine activity patterns , we would like to use EST 's which actually constitute a very important part of our research and then CDNA cloning and sequencing are the next steps that we need to perform . Before actually target validation is performed of the high priority genes , we can not go for all the genes that come up as deregulated genes , so we take those where priority is given first and then go in to target validation which will then be actually the basis for assay development and high throughput screening . <p> Q : What do I mean by deregulated gene ? I'sll tell you in a second of this one example . <p> ANDREAS : A deregulated gene is a gene that behaves differently than the normal versus the diseased as measured by the abundance of RNA on a DNA or an RNA chip . Okay . <p> So this simple example of a metabolic disease that we'sre working on simply tries to find the different between a morbidly obese person and a lean person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same diet , the same caloric intake , but the morbidly obese person actually having a totally different energy expenditure and the question simply is , what is the genetic basis of that different energy expenditure ? Which genes are regulated different in this status of this person than in this status and the idea simply is that you take biopsies , isolate cells , isolate RNA from those cells , label it and put it on the DNA chips in order to find then a list of genes which have different activities in this status than they have in this status , simply by Insilco comparison between the gene intensities on those chips . As simple as that , and the result may be in this particular case , in the obesity patients , if you look at different numbers of comparisons **31;174;TOOLONG to certain patients that show differences , four out of seven , three out of seven , there is a number of genes that then show up as differentially regulated and you see the more comparisons you'sre trying to make that means the more stringent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really being deregulated , but it often happens that contrary to expectations that you have , that indeed there is not that many genes which are indeed deregulated and therefore our interest in expressed sequence times has been increasing all the time and in different projects and therefore , we'sre focussing on expressed sequence times because they seem to be more significantly found as deregulated than the number of full length genes that we know . Admittedly , there is a fourfold number of EST 's actually that we can fall back on as compared to the full length genes and mind you there is only about 14 000 genes which are presently as full length and as fully annotated of those 35 000 human genes , so the EST 's indeed bear a large potential of identifying the whole genes . <p> A proof of concept for this particular experiment would , for instance , be the question of those known literature target genes , which are known to be deregulated , than obese status , do they appear to be regulated on those DNA chips when we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known genes which are regulated in the process of altered energy expenditure , they indeed seem to be regulated the way that you expect them and that they are described in the literature . So this indeed seems to be proof of concept that the microray analysis indeed works and it works as expected . <p> A second example would be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where you simply compare cells from a healthy individual with cells from a bronchitis individual and you do just the same as I'sve just described for the obesity case and again , here , a nice example that indeed the system works reproducibly and works well . Here 's a candidate gene where the corresponding part of the chip has been taken out for five different COPD individuals and compared to non COPD individuals and , if the computer shows you how different the expression actually is , you can see here that there is a sevenfold increase over normal expression here , two point six-fold here , fifty fivefold here , fifteen point seven here , twofold here , but in the non COPD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which indeed means there is a significant up-regulation of this candidate gene here in this COPD patient and a third example and last example for target identification is indeed an experiment that we do together with the group from BIMP in Vienna , the basic research institute supported by Boehringer Ingelheim , which is focussing on epithelium mazencomal transition , where mazencomal cells have an oncogenic potential when converted from epithelium cells and the question simply was , if you compare those cells , that either are epithelial and benign or mazencomal and malignant , whether they express genes at different levels and whether a microray analysis can indeed find that out and indeed it seems so , that if you take the cells either from the benign or the malignant state , that one and the same gene , indeed in the malignant state seems to be utterly up-regulated in this case and we can look at all the literature targets and we find them all , we find it exclusively all of them and a number of interesting genes in addition . Those obviously are the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous normal analysis and indeed find out that those genes like , for instance , this one here which corresponds to this , can all be found on the classical case of normal comparisons and this is a particularly interesting example , just as a brief side remark , because we used polysome bound RNA and that indeed refers to the every so often upcoming question , what is the difference between proteomics and genomics . Genomics will never be able to measure abundance of proteins . This is simply not true because if we use polysome bound RNA where we use exclusively that RNA which is in the process of being translated into polypeptide chains , which means that there is a clear relation and ratio between the protein abundance and the RNA abundance . We'sre not looking at the RNA that floats around in the nucleus and the cytoplasm , we are looking exactly at that RNA which is in the process of being translated , so there is a storteometry between the RNA that we'sre looking at and the protein that we'sre looking at and transcript and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than looking at messenger RNA or total RNA . <p> Q : Do you know how much better ? <p> ANDREAS : Yes , we have numbers and normally , when we do see in this particular case , a 40% correlation between a total RNA and protein abundance , we do see a 70 to 80% correlation when we look at polysome bound RNA . <p> Now , to summarise , in the therapeutic areas I was talking about , there is a number of different expression profiling experiments that we'sre performing at Boehringer Ingelheim . In respiratory there is diseases we'sre looking at chronic bronchitis and asthma , metabolic diseases and obesity , type 2 diabetes , in inflammatory diseases its auto immune diseases and inflammation , in C &amp; S its Alzheimer 's , chronic pain , in oncology there is a number of cell title inhibition projects that we'sre looking at , cellular differentiation as you have just seen , some leukaemia 's and colon cancer and in viral diseases , it 's a number of hepatitis that we'sre interested in . <p> Now obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that we find a number of regulated genes , the question simply is , how do we prioritise them , because we will not be able to take , for instance , those eighty five full length genes that we have discovered out of the six thousand and take all those eighty five through an assay development and high throughput screening . Simply impossible . The same holds true for all the other experiments that we'sre doing in the other cases , so how do we prioritise them and again I'sd like to come back to the genomics work flow that I have drawn in one of the first slides . Once we have the deregulated genes , our priority list is actually supported by a number of additional experimental approaches that we can fall back on .. First of all the deregulation can be confirmed by complimentary technologies like Northern analysis or , in most cases , by real time RTPCR tachman analysis . Also if we would like to prioritise the gene , we would like to know what its activity pattern is , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would certainly be a better candidate than in a ubiquitously expressed gene , therefore , we'sre doing in CQ analysis , on certain tissues in order to find out is the gene really expressed in the target cell or also in other cells . Again , focussing on gene activity patterns , we can do something in bioinformatics . We can try and identify whether the gene of interest is co-regulated in time and amongst different groups , the same way that some other interesting targets from the same pathway are regulated and if so , then they constitute interesting targets . We can do electronic Northerns because we have licensed a large expression data base from a company called Gene Logic over here in Goethesburg . <p> That company stores athymetrics expression profiles from more that 5000 different tissues presently , so its very ease by electronic means to define the expression pattern of genes which are contained on athymetrics chips and obviously it is more than lucky coincidence that we'sre using the same platform , Gene Logic , in Boehringer . We can do very fast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line Biosciences Bioscout in order to have this as our main bioinformatics platform . We can also do it a little bit more sophisticated by clustering expressed sequence tags and then create consensus sequences which are longer than the simple original EST , in order to try and find out whether we can possibly define sequences motifs in there . By means of hidden mark off models , we could try and take that elongated DNA sequence and try and find out whether that long sequence may constitute an interesting target . In this case , it may contain seven transmembrane domains and therefore constitute a very interesting target that we may try to follow . Also , as Dr. Kramer already said , there are interesting a very useful cloning technologies that allow you , by simply shuttling inserts between different vector types to assay gene function in different systems . This system is provided by Lang technologies . Also of course , in vitro knock down technologies like antisense or morphorenal technology is very interesting in order to see what happens to a cell and to a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to use as targets , if you knock them out in vitro and also in vivo knock outs are very interesting . We are explicitly trying to fall back on mouse and not rely on lower eucarriats and on lower animals . We have licensed a lexicon Omnibank and we are entitled to have a number of knock out mice from them because Boehringer Ingelheim indeed is not big enough to employ its own mouse knock out facilities . <p> Then of course protein-protein interaction also is an interesting topic and finally , very , very importantly , the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology experiments that come out of the therapeutic area and the disease associated assays are very important in order to validate those targets , like for instance shown here in this COPD case , the question whether , upon stimulation of certain cells , some of our target genes are co-regulated with the known inflammatory mediators and , as you can see here , there is a number of target genes that indeed become up-regulated together with the inflammatory mediators which indeed give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional pathway as the T &amp; F are for instance . <p> Now , as I said , there may be only a few minutes left , maybe three or four or five to describe the activities outside of the functional genomics part in the drug discovery in the target discovery and target validation part and I'sd briefly like to focus on the toxicogenomics description and leave out the pharmacogenomics because I think we heard extensively about pharmacogenomics from certainly more expert persons than I am . The toxicogenomics part , the vision in this case actually aims at a justification of toxicology assays that make things much easier , much faster and much more reliable and the vision is that in classical toxicology , the animal pathology should be replaced by transcript home expression signatures , which means that the use of animals which sometimes is an imprecise sciences because its intuitive to look at phenotypes , it may be much better to look at those expression profiles of a large number of genes , because its fast , its high throughput , its highly predictive , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal resources if we can do everything in vitro . Its is bioinformatics supported and the idea indeed is to have the pathology at the click of a button of the mouse . That means a digital pathology . <p> Now , Boehringer Ingelheim has a number of collaborations that we are involved in , in order to make use of the toxicology part and see whether this vision can really be reached . One is a collaboration in a phase one molecular tox consortium where there are CDNA microrays of the Insight type used with about 700 toxicity relevant genes , but also the athymetrics platform with the entire and full length and entire wrapped chips are used and in complementation to the phase one , which is very focussed . Also the collaboration with Gene Logic does not only focus on generation on electronic Northerns , but also on the generation of those transcript home signatures on the athymetrics chips and there is a collaboration in two partnering consortia , one is the Ilsian and the other is the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences where similar questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'sd like to give you only one example from the toxicology part , how indeed expression profiling ........

@@24982597 @4982597/ <p> After nearly 20 years in the Pharmaceutical Industry and undertaking various sales , management , training and coaching roles , I ventured out into the scary world of self-employment in 2001 . Now eight years later , I can look back at- my recent business experiences and outline what- I- would do differently if he were to go back to being a sales executive in the industry. - <p> I started out at a sales executive in January 1982 and repped for seven years before entering into regional sales management and sales coaching before finally leaving the industry in 2001 . I can look back now at those early years as a sales executive and see what mistakes I made in attempting to run my territory. - If I was to go back tomorrow ( and there are times when I have been tempted ! ) then I would do some things a bit differently than perhaps I did all those years ago. - <p> - <p> In this- blog piece- I would like to outline a few areas that I believe Pharmaceutical sales people should take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hit their business targets . <p> Mindset. - It is very easy to start to think that once you are in a company then the company will support you in every facet of your role . It wont ! - You are accountable for your territory and although you will get support with materials , training and ongoing coaching support from your line manager , the vast majority of the time you will be on your own and left to deliver the business against set targets . Do not get complacent . Just because you have a regular salary coming in it does n't  mean that you can afford to sit back and hope the sales flow in . As someone who is self-employed then if I do n't  get out of bed every morning and are motivated to build the business then I would simply not last any length of time and would be bankrupt within a very short time . I must attempt to make money at every opportunity , whilst at the same time deliver excellence for my customers . You should at every opportunity think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the front of your mind that it is your business driven by you for the benefit of your customers . Ultimately you and your customers will benefit . <p> Relationship with Manager . When I first started out I very much looked up to my manager . I was old school , and as such started calling my manager , Mr such and such . He quickly put me at ease and it was soon first name terms which is the norm nowadays. - However , I then had a series of managers who werent as approachable as my first manager and as I am a bit of a rebel and usually stand up for myself , I soon found my relationship with some managers deteriorating. - Part of this was own inexperience in managing stakeholders and as a coach I have learned to manage business relationships more carefully through effective contracting . If I were to go back one of the first things I would do is sit down with my manager and have an open discussion about how we were going to work effectively with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would hope they would reciprocate and ask me what my expectations were of them . Good managers will always do this . The manager:rep relationship should be a strong and motivational partnership . <p> Activity and Customers . I used to run about seeing virtually everybody I could in order to keep high activity levels . I knew some customers would never deliver business but they were a contact and another name to put down on a report . I can not afford to do that now . I refuse to waste time and money on people who are not important to my business and whereas I used to be indifferent to targeting and segmentation , I very carefully now look at my customers and ensure I am targeting the decision makers . I now also keep pretty good reports on my customer activity so that I can review recent calls and ensure that I have specific objectives for each call that I make. - It is a lot different from when I used to record simplistic notes such Good Call or Difficult Customer ! Also the rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased dramatically since my repping days so careful analysis of who the key customer contacts are and what impact they will have on my business would have to happen . The days of simply calling on GPs , Hospital Physicians , Hospital &amp; Retail pharmacists alone is over ! <p> Skills and Knowledge . I certainly have to keep abreast of new ideas , techniques and skills as well as keeping up to date with the marketplaces that I work in . I need to be seen as an expert in the fields that I work or else I become one of crowd and business will then dry up . As a sales executive I used to struggle to keep up with own and competitor product knowledge and as for keeping up with clinical trial papers , then I really did struggle . Maybe that was why on occasion I was found wanting in front of challenging hospital consultants . Now , I keep ahead of the game , not merely playing catch up ! The same goes for skills and although I always looked to develop my selling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were back in the Pharma sales role . The Pharmaceutical salesperson should be seen by their customers as an expert in their own products and should be able to converse on the same level with their customers in relation to the therapeutic areas they are selling in . <p> Planning &amp; Performance Review . I am not the greatest planner being more comfortable with a cigarette packet approach as opposed to detailed plans . However , nowadays , if I do n't  have a fairly detailed plan , stakeholders such as the bank ( not to mention my business associates ) would not give me a second look ! - The old adage , fail to plan , plan to fail certainly is true in my business and if you are managing a multi-million pounds product territory then you will have to plan effectively . In terms of reviewing performance , I now look critically at the plan and how we are doing against the plan , and I do this virtually weekly as opposed to quarterly and in some cases half yearly when I was a rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in order to review objectives and performance and better doing this than chasing after another deadbeat customer contact . <p> Team-working . As a sales rep , I can not remember ever working effectively within an effective sales team . It was certainly never all for one , one for all ! It was more everyman for himself and in the early days , with league tables , then there was very little sharing of learning or mutual support from colleagues . However , I would now never consider operating without a support network of associates , and at present I am building up a team in order that the business grows as intended . If I were to return to Pharma sales I would certainly ensure that the sales team I was a member of was pulling together and that there was a spirit of co-operation and support and within which I fully played my part . Although I see the manager as the catalyst to this , I would now never wait for a manager to make it happen and I would certainly play a pro-active role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan . <p> Networking . This is vital for the self-employed . If you do n't  network , then you will never be known . It should be the same for Pharmaceutical Salespeople and you should to attend as many networking events as you can , making sure that there is a relevance to your role and industry . Although some organisations like the local Chamber of Commerce or the various sales institutes are composed of people from different industries it is amazing what you can learn from some of the networking events . <p> - <p> These are just some key areas in which I would look to change my previous habits and- focus and- if a sales person can get these right and have a self-employed attitude then they will go a long way to improving results and decreasing the pressure on themselves . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

@@24982604 @4982604/ <p> What motivates our customers ? What inspires their behaviors ? How can we seek to change them ? - Understanding behavioral change when defining opportunities for the brand is an important part of developing a clear and compelling brand . After all , much of the role of marketing and that of brands are to encourage customer behavior change . <p> Here at Strategic North , we have been thinking about how we can best support our clients that are deliberating these same questions and its lead us to explore our approach with the brands we work on . - We all know that perspective is crucial and talking to stakeholders allows us to slip into their shoes and look out at the world around them , the treatments they come into contact with and the behaviors that wrap around the choices they make . But once we have heard their opinions , then what ? How do we take these conversations and turn them into something meaningful so that brand teams can work out their next move ? <p> This model is about uncovering attitudes that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what might attract them to it . <p> To get to this , we have recently been using the Push and Pull technique . This is very distinct from push &amp; pull promotional strategies on how to create demand . Instead it is the Push and Pull Model of Behavior Change . <p> In order for customers to change their behavior ( e.g. prescribe differently , refer differently , follow-up differently ) there must be a drive , belief , or a reason , to do this . There are a number of factors that will be weighed up ( whether sub-consciously or consciously ) in favor or against changing behavior . This model is about uncovering attitudes that might draw customers away from connecting with your brand as well as what might attract them to it . <p> Firstly , the PUSH is about understanding how to get into the physician 's mind and promote a change to new behavior ' . To get to this , you first need to ask what 's missing in management or treatment ( i.e. the unmet need ) . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are dissatisfied with in their jobs to be done that may encourage a different mind-set should the right product ( yours ! ) appear ? It 's also about outlining how your product could make the customer 's future better and most importantly , how valuable would this behavior change be for them . Will they feel differently if they choose to alter their routine and prescribe it ? <p> Secondly , the PULL is about getting to the blocks that prevent a change of behavior ' so , what 's pulling the physician back or blocking the new situation . This could be that they are happy with what they are doing today and they do not have the perception that there is an unmet need driving them to change . It could be current infrastructure that 's supporting their actions or same old ' routine that 's hindering a new way of thinking . Perhaps guidelines are reinforcing the prescriber 's decisions so there is no motivation to assess other options . On a deeper level , it could that there is fear and anxiety associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new treatment or lack of courage to take a step that 's different from peers . <p> So , how does this work in practice ? As an example , we have been working with a client recently on an brand that had been on the market for a few years that they found to be underperforming despite its strong data . Our first step was to define the current world and on talking to physicians , what we found was that they had a narrow view of success in terms of their treatment goals and on that basis their perception was that between all the treatments available to them there was no real clinical differentiation . <p> Physicians were , therefore , driven by different decision-making criteria and pulled towards another available treatment as a habit ( first on the market ) and since it was more convenient , cheaper , and there was no ( perceived ) evidence to suggest that an alternative option would provide a superior way to meet their treatment goals , there was no reason to change their behavior . From the physician 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the brand , and the company , and they trusted it to deliver against their goals . We also found that they had a very niche patient profile in their memory for our client 's brand and only in that space did the push factors trump the pull towards the incumbent brand . <p> However , when physicians reviewed the brand 's data during the research phase , they were surprised by what they saw , particularly around a far more beneficial long-term tolerability and risk profile , over that of their first treatment choice . Once this was clearly understood , this started to shift attitudes on treatment success from a narrow , more acute definition to a wider and long-term way of thinking where the impact that treatments may be having on secondary conditions became a far greater consideration . Once that was established , it became clear not only that physicians would be trying to achieve something very different and hence their prescribing triggers , which we call choice clues ' , changed then the balance between push and pull also shifted dramatically . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a more actionable endpoint rather than ending up with a list of needs that would n't necessarily differentiate the brand . Instead , it gave a clear description of the drivers that pulled the customer away from the client 's brand within the context of the lens their customers were looking through and the environment in which they were working . It also helped us to define what a shift in mind-set could do for the brand , adding significantly to the push factors towards the brand . This provided a platform to tailor brand and market activities which could help shift attitudes to patient 's outcomes and therefore the solutions which could achieve these new goals which very much included our clients ' brand . In this case , the concept of jeopardy i.e. if they do n't change something now , they could be faced with a significant longer-term issue impacting their patients ' health played a role . This helped the team us to develop a brand plan weaved around this message , so that communications could help break the barriers that prevented a push towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view markets , which actively encourages you to look through the eyes of your customer and in turn to understand the barriers and drivers for your brand . Facing these head on can liberate thinking and in turn your brand . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982609 @4982609/ <h> Using multi-channel approaches to connect with customers <p> And in the midst of the industry tug of war , one company has just taken a stand to put its bet on generics . <p> Yesterday , PLIVA , a global specialty pharmaceutical company based in Central and Eastern Europe , with operations in more than 30 countries , announced it will exit the proprietary segment of its business and focus operations exclusively on its generics business , pending approval from its supervisory board . The company says the decision follows an in-depth strategic review and evaluation of its core activities . <p> PLIVA says it will sign an agreement to divest SANCTURA of Odyssey Pharmaceuticals , PLIVA 's US branded subsidiary , to a privately held company . <p> We have assessed our core strengths against available resources and demands of our generics and proprietary businesses , and believe that exiting the proprietary segment will allow us to refocus our efforts on a model which we believe will deliver greater long term value for shareholders , says eljko ovi , Chief Executive Officer and President of PLIVA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where returns on past investments in development are now beginning to show through and where our specific competencies in R&amp;D have been globally recognized . By reinvesting all resources and efforts into generics , we believe that we can further enhance PLIVA 's overall competitiveness and market position . <p> PLIVA clearly believes the generics market offers the company a greater chance at continued success . And the news likely comes as no surprise to industry watchers . <p> The generics market now accounts for more than 50% of US prescriptions and more than 13% of the $427 billion prescription drug market worldwide ( 2002 figures ) . And double-digit growth is expected to continue in the generics market , while the proprietary market in the US is logging its second straight year of single-digit growth in drug sales , something that side of the industry has not seen since 1994 . <p> Igor Haralovic , corporate e-business and CRM director at PLIVA , recently shared some of the company 's latest strategies on customer relationship management with delegates at eyeforpharma 's European generics conference in Amsterdam . <p> Haralovic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than increasing the number of reps and visits they make to doctors . He says new approaches to customer relationship management through multi-channel marketing are the key to long-term success for both sides generic or proprietary of the marketplace . <p> CRM , Haralovic stresses , is about having a single view of the customer across all touchpoints , knowing their preferences and fulfilling them for mutual benefit . And although , he says , it is a definition agreed upon by most in the industry , he points out it is a state achieved by few , if any . <p> PLIVA , he acknowledges , is still working toward achieving the dream of true CRM , but it is making progress toward that goal with a step-by-step strategy that relies on multi-channel approaches to connect with its customers . <p> The approach he says was intentionally measured , because as PLIVA quickly grew , much of the company 's focus was on financial considerations , leaving Harolovic and his colleagues to work slowly and prove their progress as time passed . <p> His group 's goals , Haralovic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to share those competencies throughout the company , following the completion of a series of pilot projects and the introduction of new processes to the sales and marketing organization . <p> His team has established leading medical portals in its domestic markets in southeast Europe . The portals , whose content is created in conjunction with a network of doctors , have brought a lot of publicity to PLIVA and the company , Haralovic says , is now commonly seen as a household brand and a reliable Web resource in the region . <p> More than 80% of the physicians that use the Internet in the region are members of PLIVA 's portal and allow the company to send newsletters and other promotional messages to them on a regular basis . But the portal is just the beginning of a more widespread multi-channel approach to marketing for the company , Haralovic says . <p> He says his group is partnering with independent Web sites and building competencies and networks . To compliment the portals and more traditional marketing channels , like reps , key accounts , PR and mailings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as product sites , email campaigns , call centers , GSM ( patient compliance ) services , and direct to patient contact through the media . <p> In just three years since the program was started , the new channels have been spread throughout the 15 countries in which PLIVA operates . <p> Haralovic says his team has proven the value of the approach using a product that was experience a steady decline of 10% of its value a quarter before multi-channel marketing was employed . After an e-marketing campaign was begun , the product gained 4% the first quarter , 14% the second and 10% the third . <p> The results , Haralovic says , were enough to convince the company 's management of the potential impact of the program . <p> Moving to multi-channel marketing approaches requires integrating the many databases traditionally used throughout pharma companies into one and often implementing a new CRM system , Haralovic says . This kind of structuring will eventually allow PLIVA to achieve the single view of the customer it is striving to achieve , he says . <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including reps , call centers , web site , e-mailing , mailing and key accounts , he reports is proceeding with promise . The project , which is being coordinated by a single project manager , has a goal of 30% market share in terms of value in 6 months . Haralovic says that in the first few days after its inception , the strategy already boasted 15% in terms of orders from wholesalers and , he predicts , is well on its way to more than 40% market share in 6 months . <p> When you'sre trying to change something , your success is directly proportional to the quantity and quality of communication that make with your partners , employees and customers , Harolovic stresses . <p> If you would like to learn more about generic sales and marketing strategies or upcoming eyeforpharma conferences on generics , visit www.eyeforpharma.com or call the eyeforpharma team on +44 20 7375 7500. 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

@@24982626 @4982626/ <h> Medical scientific liaisons : Sales reps in disguise ? <p> Medical scientific liaisons ( MSLs ) " the people physicians talk to when they have scientific questions " have traditionally been separated from the marketing and commercial functions . Should the boundaries between the two functions be broken down ? <p> For a number of years it has been suggested that MSL numbers are on the rise . Is that a true trend ? If so , what is driving it ? Pete Sandford , executive vice president , NXLevel Solutions : Yes . More and more doctors are seeking information on their own via the Internet and other self-educational means . To supplement what they discover as well as answer questions , they use MSLs as a sounding board . In addition , clinicians expect a higher level of knowledge and clinical understanding with conversations focusing on science rather than presenting a pitch ' , and the MSL is the person who is required to have that dialogue . <p> Jane Chin , managing partner at 9Pillars and founder of the MSL Institute : Compared to 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ago , I 'm not so sure , given the number of laid-off MSLs who remain unemployed , those displaced by new MSLs with doctorate degrees , and the number of MSL programmes with less than five years ' tenure . Trend drivers for this growth , or appearance of growth , could include the fantasy that MSLs could replace reps as the sales force of the future ' , companies testing ' the MSL program concept for educational and awareness efforts during product development ( Phase II , for example ) , and for established programs that have decided to expand their existing MSL teams as part of balancing the workload of current MSLs so that they may have more manageable territories . <p> Sean McCrae , - senior vice president of PharmaForce International : Yes , numbers seem to be rising as companies recognize the value-added services MSLs provide and the role they can play in healthcare systems , integrated delivery networks ( IDNs ) , physician offices etc . <p> How has the role of the MSL evolved over the last few years , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its customers and other stakeholders ? Sean McCrae : Several years ago , companies would have one MSL who would do everything . Now , a number of companies have broken out MSL into various and separate roles . One area is thought leader development " carrying out activities such as encouraging participation in advisory boards " while others include managing and supporting investigator-initiated trials and liaising with managed care organizations , for example by providing pharmacoeconomics data to support inclusion of products in formularies. - This trend is helping to increase the numbers . <p> Jane Chin : MSLs are becoming overly-specialized . You have MSLs concentrating only on managed care or education ' or research . This reminds me of the concept of multiple reps of the past where the companies attempt to get additional share of voice ' with a physician by throwing three reps at the same office and have each carry one product . Of course , you can also argue that because MSLs deal with more specialized knowledge , it makes sense to have an MSL who knows about the research process and focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fail to appreciate the merit of having a company deploy one team of MSL whose function is to deal with only research and another team to deal with only education ' because these are so closely related that I need concrete proof to be convinced that one competent MSL is unable to carry out both tasks . Managed care for those of us in the US may be a persuasive issue , for example , to hire as MSL a person who is trained in pharmacoeconomics . But when it comes to presentation of clinical data used in making managed care decisions , again , I am biased to expect one competent MSL to fulfil this clinical presentation role . The growth of IIT/ISS ( investigator-initiated **29;238;TOOLONG studies ) here in the US has been an outcome of MSL engagement . <p> Pete Sandford : The entire life science industry is much more business driven . The era of managing ' healthcare is upon us . As much as MSLs want to focus on the science , they can not totally avoid the business side of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within pharma . Should the firewall between the two functions be broken down to improve internal **26;269;TOOLONG ? Jane Chin : - Yes and no . Yes , if company has n't defined boundaries and rules of engagement . No , if company has done so . Firewalls are meant to safeguard controls that are inappropriate , for example , sales controlling MSL activities for sales objectives . But today firewalls have come to mean MSLs and reps should n't talk to each other at all . ' These rigid firewalls speak more of a desire to eliminate risk outright and sometimes at the expense of sustainable best practice for company . One such best practice is for company personnel who interface with a common physician stakeholder to know about any prior or existing interactions originating from the company without necessarily having to know the details of those interactions . <p> Pete Sandford : No . I think the firewall provides a level of confidence that the MSL role is not being tainted by marketing messages and goals . At this point , I do n't believe government agencies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remain an independent scientific voice . Likewise , I imagine there is a certain amount of distrust that would exist in the medical community should the function return to the commercial arm of the organization . What should change/improve are the pathways of communication between the two functions . I think people understand the need for a close relationship between the two , but there is a certain amount of fear in letting that relationship get too close again . In other aspects of the commercial interaction with healthcare practitioners there have been great strides in defining ethical interactions as well as providing transparency into the financial aspect of that relationship . Ideally , one would want to see those same ideas applied to the commercial/MSL relationship within the company to improve the collaboration between the two units . <p> Sean McCrae : In the US , industry guidelines laid out by the PhRMA in 2009 plus the earlier publication of the compliance guide by the Office of Inspector General in 2008 had a significant impact on companies , and encouraged clear lines to be drawn between MSL and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some companies will not allow MSLs and reps to be in a room with a doctor at the same time , and many of those that allow it have very specific policies on how the two functions can co-exist . Policy may dictate that should an off-label question come up , the rep must leave the room immediately , for example . Certain companies are more stringent than others , but we see the industry as a whole enforcing those policies . <p> How do you see the two functions operating side-by-side in an ideal scenario ? Jane Chin : In an ideal scenario , both the sales reps and the MSLs would have in-depth understanding of the rationale and selective pressures of the other function , such that sales reps know where MSLs object to participating in certain activities and MSLs know why sales reps behave the way they do . As a result of this understanding , each function has the discernment to operate well within the same corporation . If we do n't have this ideal , and from what I 've seen , many organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt their own philosophies of what their sales function and MSL function should accomplish for these companies . Upon delineation of these philosophies , company executives would now hire the right people in leadership positions who are capable of creating cultures upholding the company 's philosophy about MSLs . A component may be creation of standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) describing specific situations where sales and MSL functions are likely to meet and the guidelines for navigating these situations . <p> What is the risk that pharma companies may be tempted to instruct MSL teams out in the field to operate as ' sales reps in disguise ' ? Jane Chin : - These companies will find out very quickly that a model that does n't work in the long run wo n't work whether you have reps behind the wheel or MSLs . It has n't worked for sales reps for a long time , so how can pharma executives justify taking a fallible model , put new players behind it , and cross their fingers hoping for the best ? We 're in the business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually mystified by how our industry 's executives seem to keep making the same decisions and hope they get a different outcome from what they had gotten before. - Physicians have reduced and even eliminated access to pharma not because of sales reps ' per se , but what those sales reps are instructed to do and taught to say . If you change the players and put MSLs in the same position , you will see the same result . <p> Pete Sandford : I find it hard to believe that in today 's climate any company would instruct their MSL 's to operate as sales reps . That said , I think there is a risk there . If the access you are getting is through the MSL team , there is temptation to deliver your marketing messages through them . In essence , that is why MSLs are no longer part of the commercial team . The key is in creating clear policy on the interaction between these two business units , and creating an environment where concerns can be raised without fear of retaliation should there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most doctors will catch on pretty quickly to the MSL who is acting more like a sales rep and shut down access for that MSL . <p> Do the activities of the MSL function align well at present with pharma 's current market access strategies ? Jane Chin : Based on the appearance of increased visibility of the MSL function , pharma must perceive that the activities of MSLs align with market access strategies or companies would not invest in the function . I 've always viewed MSL functions as a more long-term competitive strategy , but executives who fund programs are n't always interested in long term , only short term , and market access is part of that myopia . In reality , do MSL programs really improve companies ' access ? I do n't know . There are so many variables that confound a true yes ' or no ' answer . How do we know that market access could n't be improved by altering pharma 's approach to the sales force model , if pharma has enough patience to give their model shifts time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we know that using MSLs primarily for market access is n't creating higher hurdles for pharma companies to win back physicians ' trust , should this tactic fail in the long term ? <p> Pete Sandford : Yes . Pharma companies want prescribers to trust and believe in their products . MSLs allow the conversations to take place at the level that allow that trust to happen . 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

The regions that do the best are ones that are led by STAR frontline sales managers . Studies show that : The No. 1 performance factor for salespeople is the quality of their manager .

Do you know what STAR sales managers do differently ? What do STAR sales managers have in common ? What are the factors that make them more successful than their competitive peers ? For me the short answer is focus . STAR sales managers focus more on key activities that drive sales performance . STAR sales managers that are strong coaches and spend more time coaching their reps to improve performance . STAR coaches focus on one key area at a time , e.g. skill , competency or behaviour , for each of their salespeople . They maintain that focus on a specific skill until there is a marked improvement . Not until the sales rep demonstrates an 8 or 9 out of 10 in that specific competency will the sales manager shift the coaching focus to a new area .

Sales managers who are STAR coaches and enjoy seeing their reps develop will naturally spend more time coaching .

Managers who want to be STARS should understand that the quantity and quality of coaching will have a major impact on their sales results . You can be the driver of your own success . With so many competing responsibilities for managers , it is critical that more time is spent on activities/tasks that drive sales . STAR managers spend a greater portion of their time interacting with customers .

@@24982641 @4982641/ <h> Breaking patient compliance down to simplest terms <p> By Anonymous ( not verified ) on Dec 17 , 2008 <p> It may seem simple and perhaps obvious , but Mike Pucci , vice president external advocacy at GSK , says to ensure patient adherence programs drive behavior changes , its important to first understand what drives adherence . Simple but true . <p> Pucci told attendees at eyeforpharmas recent Patient Adherence and Persistence USA Summit that despite ongoing cries to the contrary , prescription medicines account for only about 10% of total healthcare expenditures in the US just , he says , as they have for the past 40 years or so . Hospital care ranks as the top expenditure at 31% of the $2.1 trillion total spent on healthcare in the US in 2006 , while diagnostics and other procedures accounted for 25% of the total spend . <p> Pharmaceutical products , as Pucci points out , have the unique ability , however , to help actually reduce spending on hospital stays , diagnostics and physician costs . The key in reducing healthcare cost , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One or more of five chronic diseases cardiovascular disease , diabetes , smoking-related respiratory conditions ( COPD , allergies and asthma ) , cancer , and mental illness/depression affect 49% of all Americans , Pucci says . At least one of these conditions is seen in 85% of the elderly , 45% of working age adults and 23% of children . And 75% of all healthcare spending goes to treat these chronic diseases , Pucci reports . <p> Were not investing to keep people healthy , were treating them instead , he says . Were not offering the necessary incentives to keep people out of the healthcare system in the first place . <p> The obesity rate , which drives two of the top three chronic disease states , more than doubled from 1995 to 2005 in the US , Pucci says , and the incidence of diabetes is following the same trend . More than 64% of US adults are overweight or obese and the rate of Type 2 diabetes in children has increased as much as 10 times over the past two decades . <p> The numbers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those numbers , perhaps more worrisome is a conclusion from the World Health Organization that adherence to long-term therapy for chronic diseases in developed countries averages 50% . The consequences , the group stresses are poor healthcare outcomes and increased healthcare costs . <p> So why do n't  we link the two together and pay attention to this ? Pucci asks . <p> GSK 's own research , he says , demonstrates that the two biggest deterents to patient compliance with prescription therapies are side effects and out of pocket cost . <p> Although a patient that is less than 20% compliant spends less on prescription medication , his overall healthcare costs are higher than a patient who is 80% or more compliant , even though his prescription medications cost more . As simple as it may seem , improving medication compliance is a key driver in decreasing medical costs , Pucci says . And although its a simple and seemingly obvious conclusion , its largely overlooked or ignored , he says . <p> He points to several case study examples . The Asheville project is an increasingly popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 172 diabetes patients were driving the lions share of healthcare costs for the city . In response , Asheville changed its benefits design to address peoples lack of understanding of their condition and compliance , as evidenced by an average 15% refill rate of their diabetes medications . <p> Pucci says the town brought people in and set up disease management and compliance programs that and agreed to make their medications free if they complied with the programs , which included one-on-one interventions with pharmacists and physicians . And although the citys spend on medications increased , over time their overall spend on healthcare was dramatically reduced . Today , refill rates for diabetes patients in Asheville are 95% , Pucci says , and sick days away from work are dramatically reduced . <p> The program was so successful that the town took a similar approach with asthma patients and saw similar results . <p> The program has been recreated with hypertension and cholesterol patients in Minnesota , using medication therapy management approaches , with equally impressive results .

Overall medical costs for its employees with diabetes dropped 12% , while costs for asthma patients dropped 15% . Much of the savings could be attributed to declines in the cost of emergency room visits , down 35% for diabetes patients and 20% for asthma patients . <p> Its time we started thinking differently about the value of medicines and stop apologizing about the cost of prescription drugs , Pucci says .

@@24982651 @4982651/ <h> Building the Future : 7 Keys to Pharma Training <p> Earlier this year , our organization delivered a conference in Madrid on the 7 keys to the crisis , considering which factors firms should consider in planning their training efforts . <p> Many pharmas have started to look forward now and these 7 points serve as a good start point for those involved in training and development as we emerge into a new world , closely scrutinized for cost and value . . <p> The 1st key to survival then relates to ensuring training initiatives are value-oriented . In the majority of organizations , value is created by increasing sales , reducing costs , or improving efficiency . The first key is to decide what the drivers of these 3 elements are in our specific medical setting . In a hospital environment for example , sales are typically linked closely to the credibility and communicative ability of the medical rep . What in turn drives this ? Is it pure ability or specific knowledge ? If we carry out this kind of value-tree analysis , we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that a specific kind of disease area knowledge is vital for reps to be taken seriously by their clients . . <p> As well as completing a value tree analysis , it helps to have the right pedagogical model ( 2nd Key ) for training . What are the best ways to manage this knowledge ? Which learning pathways ? Is a controlled linear sequence appropriate or is a more user-customisable model appropriate ? Creativity can help us here . Especially if we consider the 3rd key , informal learning . Given the high cost of top-down driven learning models , this represents a great opportunity . Chances are someone somewhere in the organization knows the answer or has competencies better than we can design into a training programme . Therefore , if we look for existent or emergent best practices and amplify those signals through facilitated peer to peer sharing of knowledge , we can reduce training costs significantly . There is no better example of this , than when a new drug is launched and reps learn how to sell it . Setting up rapid diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales learning curve . . <p> However informal social learning is not something that sits easily with most pharma decision makers : what about regulatory issues ? Surely we can not allow loose chat about products on-line ? . It is important therefore to set up forums with clear objectives , audiences and active facilitation . By active facilitation , we mean that it is normal for the forums to be continually monitored every day and an SLA for response times to be set at 24 hours . . <p> The 4th key relates to a quite different focus on content management . By performing a gap analysis , and segmenting training needs by group , we can decide on which content is most likely to add value . It could be for example , that by providing a short e-learning programme on how to use a new computer system/ process , that substantial time saving can be achieved . . <p> . Ironically , it is only with these analyses in place that it makes sense to address technology . As an L&amp;D professional today , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there and assume that unless you have the latest web application tools , then your organization is headed to Jurassic Park on a one-way ticket . This is a good example of the tail wagging the dog : technology is there to support the pedagogical model , not the other way around . Consequently , we can select those technologies , and only those technologies that add value to the learning strategies . It may be for example , that webcasting alone is sufficient to provide managers with information they need . Thus choosing the right technology is key to survival , resisting the urge to go with the flow . . <p> Building the right business case , the 5th key , is going to help us with the budget holder meeting . If we can not identify concisely how our solution adds value , then why we are taking a walk upstairs to ask for investment anyhow ? Would we say yes to this project if it was our own cash ? Using on-line technologies genuinely has the potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , other models can not deliver training in time , to enough people and with such flexibility . . <p> Clearly one of the implications of this approach is that it requires flexibility in the ways in which training can be delivered , and this is reflected in the 6th key , choosing a flexible learning management platform that can evolve with the learning model . Without this , uncompetitive fixed costs are likely to accrue . . <p> Finally , a proactive attitude is vital . We can not wait for someone else to find the answer . There exists in some parts of the pharmaceutical industry uncertainty of how to move forward following sustained criticisms : being in L&amp;D implies providing leadership in knowledge management of our organization .. What are we waiting for ? Its up to us to work out how to add value to our organization and then campaign hard for it . . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982654 @4982654/ <p> On the face of it , marketing oncology drugs is a highly lucrative business for the pharmaceutical industry . Patients with cancer are increasing at higher levels than many conditions . In fact , cancer is the leading cause of death in people under 85 . <p> Cancer is a priority for many governments and much investment has been made in improving screening procedures . With a few exceptions , cancer has no certain cure , so there are still many unmet needs . We have seen important developments in genomics and proteomics that have allowed more oncology drugs to be developed . High prices can be charged for innovative cancer drugs , and oncology has been one of the few growth drivers in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years . <p> So , the opportunities are obvious . But the reality is that not many companies with oncology portfolios will enjoy success in line with what they are hoping for . This is due to several factors . <p> Oncology is not one condition but many conditions that all have uncontrolled cell growth . However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big market ( e.g. , all the main suspects " BC , CRC , LC ) , the niche market ( e.g. , renal , leukemia ) , the complex niche market ( e.g. , pancreatic , stomach , oesophagus ) . Many companies are focusing on oncology , leading to many options for treatment and to a crowded market . <p> The financial crisis is taking its toll on payers , which means that cost containment pressures will no doubt have their effect on oncology drugs prices because of four main factors : growing cancer population means increased drug expenditure , more products means more competition , generics eroding sales , more combination therapies means more costs to the treatment protocol . <p> So , what do you need to do ? These factors have implications for your activities in several ways , including : <p> Clinical trial approach and indication sequence <p> Should you pursue a switch ' or add on ' strategy or a do everything you can ' strategy or a sequential strategy in your clinical trials ? An add on approach is essentially adding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a switch strategy is switching your drug with another one in an existing treatment cocktail because you have proven your drug in the cocktail provides enhanced efficacy . <p> The strategy is sound and a proven route to success , as was shown by Eloxatin coming in to switch from Camptosar . However , keep in mind that your trials would need to go head to head and show an advantage . They may not show that in efficacy ; that would be the one you want ( overall survival time and progression-free survival , typically ) . <p> It is possible that an advantageous safety or convenience profile may also be a winner , depending on the cancer type and physician type and market . If you succeed , however , you are quickly in the treatment guidelines and have the added benefit of being in additional clinical trials that you are not paying for . However , if you go down the route of the do everything you can ' strategy , which is to trial the drug in every possible indication in parallel , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications . Avastin is a good example of this approach . However , it can not ethically be employed if the drug is highly toxic . In addition , another drawback of this approach is the high cost of multiple indication trials as well as the need for high numbers of patients for trials , which is becoming increasingly tough to get . <p> The sequential approach is testing in one indication and patient segment and gaining approval and then extending to other indications or lines of treatment . This approach is a more cautious one but confers the advantages of being able to test in a more niche market with high demand and you have lower trial costs . In this case , you need to be careful which indication you go for first . <p> Market access <p> Due to the increasing incidence of cancer , the increasing competition amongst players as well as the increased cost pressures faced by payers , market access is a critical component of planning . This is becoming more and more critical because of these factors . You must be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in order to secure approval , registration , as well as command premium pricing and gain reimbursement . <p> Oncology is a less promotionally sensitive market than most markets , and there are typically only a few strong message drivers and sales and marketing driver channels compared with , say , a primary care drug or even a less complex secondary care drug , such as a cardiology drug . These drivers even differ ( and sometimes quite strongly ) depending on the therapy segment or public versus private hospital segment or physician segment , given that different geographic markets have different physicians as the target audience . For example in Germany BC may be treated by an Ob/Gyn instead of an oncologist , while in the UK it may be treated by a breast surgeon and an oncologist . <p> If you are looking at markets in which the treatment is not done by a pure oncologist , then you will see differences in some of the positioning drivers required . Pure oncologists are more used to using highly toxic drugs with none-too-pleasant side effects . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those attributes . The weighing of your messages should be according to what is driving that segment of physicians in this therapeutic area . <p> Analytics is a powerful tool in the oncology marketing arsenal in terms of knowing which therapy segments will yield the most lucrative source of growth as well as being able to see what the drivers are for each segment and line of therapy . In addition , seeing which physician segment will yield more growth for your brand and which sales and marketing aspects are drivers for that segment can all be uncovered . Being able to war game budget allocation across segments enables you to see which budget allocation will give which revenue . <p> The global strategy must be localized , given there are very different local issues in terms of market access , reimbursement and even which physicians treat that patient pool . Sometimes , affiliates need to have approval to develop their own clinical studies for their local patient pool , as we see is often the case in Japan . ( For more on Japan , see How pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically employ a centralized or regional approach , with more companies adopting a centralized approach given the need for larger patient pools , complex trial management and a constant increase in number of trials . <p> Biotech has provided some innovative treatments in oncology and the majority of treatments on the market today were originally discovered by biotech companies . In-licensing can allow larger companies to secure the most promising compounds and accelerate the development process . Of course , partnering is competitive but no doubt there will be continued activity in this area . This way you can develop a stronger oncology portfolio , which provides synergy with your existing drugs . ( For more on in-licensing , see New models for drug discovery and marketingand Will big pharma become a collection of marketing and distribution firms ? ) <p> Supportive care ( the second largest segment after oncology ) and diagnostics ( e.g. , for tumor markers ) are heavily related to the oncology market and provide strong synergistic opportunities .

There is so much equipment and systems investigator sites have to use within clinical trials : eDiaries , iPads , large and small screen laptops , trial tablets and of course , most of us have our own office computer . Sometimes I tell my assistants it 's never an issue of using the device , but of using the right device , because we have multiple eDiaries for multiple ongoing trials . It can get very complex . <p> For this article , I contacted several sites to ask about their experiences using technology for clinical research . I was quite surprised they were so eager to share their information and even more surprised but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Sites like eClinical technologies for collecting patient data because they improve compliance and hence data quality , and reduce monitoring time . Giving patients eDiaries can have a profound increase on privacy , ease of collection , while diminishing cheating and prevention of dropouts . Everybody knows patients write unclear , inaccurate data or even make data up and there is always the risk of losing paper diaries . There are less inaccuracies , no data transfer mistakes or lost data with eDiaries . The data are in the diary and are transferred directly to the EDC so we get real-time data uploaded every night . Patients are over 80% compliant with eDiaries no matter where the trial takes place or what age group is participating . Patients become adept at using the eDiary ; it becomes part of their daily life . <p> The industry likes to think there is an integration of all the different tools and devices . Sponsors think they know best which technologies to use and when . Sites have had some different experiences . We offer sponsors the following suggestions : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The majority of trials can have electronic tools , but there are still some trials that are not suitable .

In one trial , we worked with a tablet . Patients had to answer questions on the tablet and there was a physician interview . I could have two patients come in at the same time " one doing the trial questionnaire while I interviewed the other . But the sponsor would not allow us to do so because the date had to be entered real time . If we perform the interview within the time limits but entered it as soon as the tablet was available , we were generating many queries because the date and time in the trial slate were outside the permitted window . We had to choose , and we limited the number of patients eventually . - <p> 3 ) - - - - Use Modern Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be great to have the option to use them in research . Patients are familiar and comfortable with their own technology . And if they take a trip they do n't have to take multiple cords or chargers .

In order to get more money dedicated to programs that will improve patient education and adherence , teams must demonstrate a likely return on investment . <p> By Anonymous ( not verified ) on Aug 7 , 2008 <p> The issue of patient compliance is largely unaddressed and chronically underfunded . In order to get more money dedicated to programs that will improve patient education and adherence , teams must demonstrate a likely return on investment . <p> How can companies wishing to increase compliance show sufficient success on limited budgets and with few tools to merit greater investment ? <p> Morna Butler , Executive Director , Innovex Global Operations , Quintiles Transnational and Jacco Keja , Vice President , Quintiles Consulting , Quintiles Transnational believe that with some innovative approaches to the question of compliance , companies can do a lot with a little . <p> Why comply ? Patient compliance , while it has dramatic effects on the patients involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year die from not following their prescriptions correctly . From 33-69% of hospital admissions and 23% of nursing home admissions are the direct result of patient non-compliance . Hospitalization costs come to around $13 billion , and the amount of lost productivity tops off at more than $50 billion . <p> The effect on pharma , says Butler , is n't simply in lost revenue , though those estimates run anywhere from $30 billion to $70 billion . The true impact on pharma comes when patients non-adherence results in a real-world perception of a lack of efficacy and a lack of safety . <p> Why does n't  pharma do more ? Pharma companies have numerous reasons for engaging the problem less aggressively than they should . Compliance programs generally represent a significant , long-term investment , and the returns are slow in coming . Most companies , with investors to consider , are interested primarily in the short term . <p> Equally , compliance programs tend to be burdensomely complicated . They may require contributions from throughout a company , with cross-functional teams and numerous players . Regulations are also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compliance . Butler says that within pharma there exists a perception that a maze of regulations are difficult to navigate too difficult for efforts to be worthwhile . <p> Finally , says Butler , there is the question of ROI . Asks Butler , how can we extrapolate compliance programs within the marketing mix and demonstrate achievement ? Just identifying the metrics can be a complicated enough process to dissuade many companies from taking on the compliance issue . <p> So what 's the big idea ? Innovation and implementation , according to Butler , can achieve big results on limited budgets . One approach she suggests is to create maximum value with programs that deliver multiple objectives . There are programs existing already within pharma companies that could be tweaked or expanded to allow for a patient education and compliance element . While compliance may not be that programs primary aim , it can still be one of the programs results . <p> One example of including compliance goals under a different program , says Jacco Keja , is to look at how companies gather data on market access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . Rather than agree on a set reimbursement price for a therapy , payers prefer to set temporary prices , with the understanding that that price may change when the results on the therapys efficacy start coming in . It is in the pharma companys interest , in that case , to generate robust , real-life outcomes data , says Keja . <p> Payers , says Keja , are demanding price justification for the costs of therapies and real world evidence of efficacy . The increasing popularity of risk-management plans means that pharma had better be able to generate promising results and demonstrate product safety in its real-life studies . Those robust results , as Keja calls them , can only be improved when the patients taking the medications during probationary periods are compliant . If elements of patient education and compliance are rolled into the programs primarily intended to gather market access data , then all objectives can be more successfully supported . Not only does this approach achieve multiple objectives , it does so in a highly cost-effective way . <p> Implementation by design According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by planning strategic implementation . Actually putting plans into action is where many good ideas fall by the wayside . One way to ensure implementation is to have a process that reaps multiple , diverse benefits . <p> Using the results from educated , adherent patients to demonstrate safety and efficacy are certainly admirable goals and can generate good ROI ; designing the implementation program with an aim to long-term objectives can increase the value of that program . Says Butler , consider tailoring your program with an aim towards publishing your results . Strategic publication to tell about what you 've done generates extra revenue , publicity and value . <p> Therefore , the design of a program prior to implementation is critical , Butler says . This is the point at which companies need to be willing to make some investment . Before you begin , advises Butler , determine the objectives you are trying to achieve . If you 're looking at outcomesbe they clinical , economic , utility or humanisticdesign your program to have that baseline . Decide in advance what the final measurements will be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on that basis . If a program is n't carefully and thoughtfully designed , chances of success are dramatically reduced . <p> Author : Shannon Perry , journalist , eyeforpharma 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982674 @4982674/ <h> How to increase forecasting effectiveness <p> Bob Draper , head of global forecasting at Eli Lilly , outlines four key ways to turn data into insight <p> By Anonymous ( not verified ) on Nov 10 , 2009 <p> Bob Draper , head of global forecasting at Eli Lilly , outlines four key ways to turn data into insight <p> Pharma needs effective - and accurate forecasts , but those often are two different and sometimes cyclical requirements , says Bob Draper , head of global forecasting at Eli Lilly . <p> Accuracy is about whether the forecast is right , Draper says , while effectiveness is the influence the forecast has on decisions the right decisions . Accuracy is driven by rigid processes and a reliance on models , but complexity often compromises response time . In contrast , the effectiveness that earns forecasting a seat at the table where key decisions are made comes from flexible processes , simple models and quick response times . As an industry , were awash in data from lots of sources , most of which do n't  agree , Draper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogged down in trying to determine what the right source of data is , rather than the insight the data could bring . <p> In addition , the forecasting processes most pharmas have in place tend to be a function of the tools they 're using , rather than what meets the organizations needs . And the only way to move past the politics of decisions is to be truly transparent about the information used and where it comes from . Good forecasting gets the right information to people in the right format , Draper says . Out of every forecast , there 's data and then there 's insight that makes that data useful . You need both to make a forecast effective within the organization . <p> Good governance and processes that lead to data-driven opinions enable forecasters to be much more credible . You must exude trust , Draper stresses . That gives you leeway . Once you 've established that credibility , people are willing to listen to you . But documentation is critical to back the specific assumptions and rationale you use , so that when changes happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasters should strive to spend more time thinking about and communicating insights . A good story is always more effective than data , so you need good insight , Draper explains . Rather than saying you have a 9.7% share of market , for instance , talk about having the same share of market as the leading brand . You need to link themes across products and therapeutic areas , not just across geographies and product indications . <p> Then those insights must be communicated quickly and effectively . You need a single point of contact that 's capable of rapid information retrieval , Draper advises . And you need standard formats of communication . Most companies have a PowerPoint culture , where the insights only become real once they are on a slide or one-page document . So , we need to provide information in those kinds of formats . <p> Finally , strong forecasts can help remove the politics from decision making by reducing the amount of opinion that creeps in , Draper says : The key is to minimize information hoarding and increase transparency . <p> That can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that includes widely agreed assumptions on key data points <p> Up to date information that minimizes version control and creates confidence that the data is live and trustworthy <p> Multiple data formats , including PowerPoint , Excel and Word <p> 24/7 online access that establishes complete transparency by providing access to and inviting comments on assumptions behind the data <p> Consistency that enables decision makers to draw parallels across products <p> According to Draper , Lilly has found that although positioning the organization to increase the effectiveness of forecasts is a long process , forecasting credibility is elevated when forecasters can increase the time they spend thinking and deriving real insight for use in decision making . By improving data access and automating many of the data-driven aspects of the process , we 've reduced errors and increased the credibility and effectiveness of our forecasts , he says . Communication also has increased significantly , helping to flatten the workload for our forecasters and improve response times . 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475 
@@24982675 @4982675/ <h> 7 Account Management Best Practices That Will Make a Difference <p> Account Management has been around forever ' in many industries but remains relatively new in pharma . Perhaps because , historically , pharma has focused its marketing and sales efforts on individual physicians . <p> Of course , times have changed , and account management is being taken up but pharma is still in the learning phase of implementation and it remains a relatively small part of the business with a relatively small number of folks , full time , engaged in account management . Perhaps also the tactic is devoted to hospitals , or in the US , payer groups and integrated health systems , or large group practices . However , it is an approach that can , and perhaps should be adopted right across all customer types dependent only upon the suitability of the approach to customer needs . <p> In my work with numerous pharma clients , I have noticed the differences between what account management could be and how it is actually implemented , and based on this experience here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are often missing from an implementation plan . <p> 1 . Customer Identification <p> a . Not all accounts are equal " new approaches to identifying which customers to focus onb . Develop unique small set of key accountsc . Refusing to work with a customer <p> 2 . Implementation <p> a . Co-creating an Account Plan and agreeing it with the customerb. - The Account Plan takes precedence over brand plans <p> 3 . Measure and Reward <p> a . The Account becomes the unit of measureb . Use Customer Account Plan as basis for end of year personal performance reviews <p> Customer Identification <p> The term in general use across pharma , is Key Account Management , although technically that is not a good description of the tactic currently in use . Most companies confuse Key Accounts with other less important accounts , and typically offer a very similar service across all managed accounts . <p> Many industries are much more sophisticated in this regard . IBM , for example , does account management really well . Their account managers are customer experts and typically know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the client 's employees . But , they have a very clear picture of who their Key Accounts are , and it is a very small number . They have recognized their Global Key Accounts , those accounts that they really need to win , keep and grow and they dedicate significant resources to these accounts . The number is very small indeed . <p> The second tier accounts are managed very differently from these Key Accounts but still using account management fundamentals . <p> Has pharma identified Key Accounts and do they interact differently with these accounts than others ? <p> How to identify accounts is an important issue , typically the size " read revenue generated or potential future revenue , has been the most important criteria but really effective account management should consider more than revenue above all else . <p> In my experience , there are at least five key criteria that should be used when identifying accounts and of course revenue is one of them . <p> 1 . Their level of innovation readiness and patient orientation . <p> 2 . Technological savvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outside their traditional comfort zone . <p> 3 . Their ambitions and objectives , are they aligned with your own ? <p> 4 . Their level of comfort working with pharma and their openness to partnership with the industry . <p> 5 . Their value to the business in terms of current and future revenue potential and/or their level of leadership in healthcare . <p> These various attributes should be weighted to produce a score that would indicate the most relevant and important customers to focus key account management activity with . It will also highlight those organizations that pharma should work with in an account management approach and those customer where they should not . <p> Identifying the right accounts is critical if account management is to generate the sorts of results pharma is expecting . If you and the customer are not aligned , it is much better to defer working with them in this way . Pharma is typically reluctant to say no ' to any customer , but in this area in particular , refusing to work with an account and to dedicate significant resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Implementation <p> One of the issues with marketers everywhere , in every industry but particularly in pharma , is that they typically want more . More messages , more details , more impacts , more value , more new customers , more promotional materials , more conference attendees , more followers . I think you get the picture . <p> In account management terms , the account manager needs to actively manage the brand teams to avoid overloading customers , and for that they need the political power to override the marketing folks . <p> In pharma , this is particularly relevant and it is usually exactly the opposite of what customers want . And important as that may be , less can actually be better for business . <p> In account management terms , the account manager needs to actively manage the brand teams to avoid overloading customers , and for that they need the political power to override the marketing folks . Not an easy ask in pharma even today . <p> That is where a great Customer Account Plan really delivers value to both company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the company to engage with this customer then making these types of difficult trade offs becomes much easier . And the marketers need to work even harder and smarter to deliver more value to customers in line with the agreed Plan . <p> I have written before about these Customer Plans so I wo n't repeat myself again other than to say these are not your typical account plans used by most companies . These are developed in collaboration with the customer , which is a pretty common approach , but these Plans are shared openly with customers and details what both parties will work on together over the coming 12 months . <p> The objectives and outcomes of the Plan are obvious to both parties as is how together success will be measured . Complete transparency is required . <p> They can significantly change a pharma company 's relationship with its client . <p> Measure &amp; Reward <p> If it really is about Account Management then the Account Plan forms the basis for both measurement of success and for rewarding the account team . That means sales by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may well be included if indeed that is an objective that both parties agree to upfront and could well be the result of some improvement to processes or technology that , in turn , leads to better patient outcomes and increased product sales . <p> It is absolutely critical that the account team is rewarded according to the execution of the Customer Plan . 100% . <p> It is easy to implement an account management approach without really changing much . Build an account team to work with the senior management of a group practice or hospital , all the while the brand teams continue to send in teams of representatives to talk about the brands to individual HCPs . Try and develop value added offerings to the customer and continue to deliver brand messages . <p> These are the most common approaches seen in big pharma today , still . But if you want to really deliver value to customers and get the most out of a new approach to customers then significant change is required . <p> Account Management is a proven , sophisticated tactic to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is all about selling more stuff then it is not really account management rather just another sales tactic .

adherence rates <p> We live in an era in which chronic health issues are commonplace and increasingly dominate our healthcare attention and resources , with an estimated economic burden of over $80 billion each year . <p> To turn the tide , layered and coordinated initiatives at the population level are needed that educate , motivate , and support individuals to embrace healthy living . <p> Low adherence to medical regimens is very common , with estimates that between 20% to 50 percent of patients do not take their medication as prescribed . <p> For example , adherence to pharmacotherapy for high blood pressure has been estimated by the World Health Organization to be between 50 and 70 percent , suggesting that poor adherence is a primary cause for failure to control hypertension . <p> The issue of non adherence is particularly relevant for persons living with chronic conditions compared to patients with more acute illnesses ; adherence rates tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even earlier . <p> Identifying new interventions is critical to curbing low adherence rates , including the use of incentives and interactive computer-based health communication applications that combine health information with behavioural strategies . <p> The science of behaviour change <p> Despite an initial reluctance to give money or rewards to motivate change or enhance complianceshould we reward people for doing things they should be doing anyway ? early investigations found financial and other incentives to be effective in increasing adherence . <p> A 2004 review of 23 studies seeking to change behaviours related to exercise , smoking , and/or body weight observed a short-term positive effect from the use of incentives 72 percent of the time . <p> The review also found minimal evidence to support a dose response ; the higher the value of the incentive , the higher the behavioural response to the incentive . <p> The science of behaviour change has found success with the use of technology , including Web-based health education , counselling , and online self-monitoring and support groups for improved practices in diet , physical activity , smoking , and chronic diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online environment for its ease of access , convenience , anonymity , and non-stigmatized environment related to seeking health information rather than engaging in face-to-face clinical visits . <p> One review of the literature identified three primary types of interventions for improving adherence to prescribed medicine : behavioural approaches , education or information giving , and healthcare professional involvement . <p> Behaviour change recommendations suggest that in order to improve adherence , changing the situation or context may be more promising than changing the patient . <p> Research investigating the effects of financial and economically-related rewards for improving physical activity levels provides support for the use of such incentives . <p> Indeed , a recent review of computer-tailored interventions to enhance physical activity levels found that those studies providing incentives demonstrated a participant retention rate of 80 percent or higher . <p> One study of obese African-American women found that offering a free gym membership was likely a key ingredient in the success of the recruitment , intervention delivery , and retention of this high-risk , underserved , and understudied population . <p> The study found that the intervention produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive of a free one-year gym membership was a more potent intervention than the education and social support condition tested . <p> The power of incentives <p> Research in 2007 indicated the potential of financial incentives ( in the form of registration reimbursement ) on attendance and adherence to a weight-loss program . <p> While the studys program participants did not demonstrate significant weight loss compared to a control group , there was a strong association between attendance and weight loss for those in the intervention group promised reimbursements based on reaching weight loss goals . <p> In a randomized controlled trial offering a free prepared meal and weekly counselling intervention , greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance was demonstrated at two years in 407 overweight or obese women compared to usual care . <p> For smoking cessation , a randomized trial in a general sample of Dutch smokers examined the effects of full financial reimbursement for purchasing a pharmacological treatment ( chewing gum , patch , tablet , sublingual tablet and inhaler ) , behavioural counselling ( written advice , telephone or face-to-face counselling ) , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study participants were required to send their receipt and two statements of personal contact with a healthcare professional to the health insurance company . <p> Results showed that participants from the intervention group had a 2.9 times higher chance of using smoking cessation treatment during the six-month study period compared with participants from the control group and were 1.4 times more likely to have quit smoking . <p> Evaluating the impact of financial rewards for smoking cessation , 179 smokers were randomized into incentive and non-incentive groups . <p> While both groups were provided free instruction in the management of smoking triggers , relapse prevention , and stress management techniques as well as counselling , the incentive group was also offered $20 for each class attended and $100 if they quit smoking 30 days following the program . <p> The incentive group had significantly higher rates of program enrolment and quit rates at 75 days . <p> At six months , however , quit rates in the incentive group were not significantly higher than in the control group . <p> The researchers concluded that modest financial incentives can produce significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term quit rates , while incentives for longer-term cessation need to be explored . <p> Incentives and the long term <p> Indeed , a review examining the impact of competitions and incentives on long-term smoking cessation , as well as the relationship between incentives and participation rates , found that early success tended to dissipate when rewards were no longer offered . <p> However , rewarding participation and compliance in contests and cessation programs may have more potential to deliver higher absolute numbers of quitters . <p> In another recent US trial , the largest to date , employees were offered up to $750 for completion of a smoking cessation program as well as abstinence at six and 12 months , with the largest sum ( $400 ) deliverable for 12 months abstinence . <p> This is the first trial to show that personal financial incentives can lead to significantly higher sustained quitting at one year . <p> Other incentive-based employee programs have also proved effective . <p> Detailed retrospective analyses of employer-based disease management programs found that use of gift cards/certificates , cash , and reductions in out-of-pocket health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employee participation/completion and the amount of the incentive . <p> Cash incentives greater than $50 were observed to be the most efficient . <p> A systematic review of 38 studies on the effectiveness of adherence interventions between 1990 and 2005 found that behavioural interventions that offered patients cash , gifts , or vouchers significantly improved their medical adherence in 10 of 11 studies . <p> Adding a twist to the reward structure , another study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of daily lottery incentives on Warfarin adherence in a cohort study of patients at risk of thromboembolism . <p> The researchers found that the lottery-based financial incentive coupled with a simple reminder ( a chime that was sent to patients Med-eMonitors ) substantially improved the rate of non-adherence to Warfarin . <p> The researchers went on to say that daily lotteries may be more effective than one-time payouts . <p> Drawing on the behavioural economics literature on incentives , this study showed that small rewards can have great incentive value , people are motivated by past rewards and the prospect of future rewards , and that people are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life <p> In their comprehensive review of the literature on incentives and behaviour change , Sutherland and colleagues concludes that incentives , even rather small ones , can influence health behaviours , including both improving patients adherence and facilitating voluntary behaviour change . <p> This is especially true when studies for behaviour are incentivized over the longer term rather than for shorter timelines . <p> For the behaviour to persist , the incentives either need to be continued or reinforced through intermittent rewards . <p> Offering rewards or incentives as extrinsic motivators may bridge the time needed to internalize the values and benefits of healthy living . <p> The best application of incentives is to use them to attract and engage people through sustained extrinsic rewards , so that they can connect , realize , and appreciate their intrinsic motivators to help them sustain lifelong health practices . <p> The BestLifeRewarded ( BLR ) loyalty

They can try role-playing , an underused sales tool ( only an estimated 21% of sales teams employ it ) that is the easiest and most effective way to practice and build confidence . It gives salespeople the opportunity to learn new product information , test their selling skills , and try new approaches. - <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing pharmaceutical environment . As an added benefit , role-playing sessions help your team build an esprit de corps as they learn together . The more successful they are in the office , the more likely their success in the field .

Never make role-playing easy Salespeople must learn to be able to handle pressure ( and stress ) in the form of questions from prospects about value , price , competitive positioning and feature/function offers . Tough role-playing sessions prepare them for any situation . <p> 2 . Make it safe <p> Role-playing can feel threatening and embarrassing . To raise the safety level , keep groups to three people who alternate roles as salesperson , customer and observer . Have the first role-play be an experiment . After the debrief , conduct the same role-play so the salesperson can use the feedback to improve . <p> 3 . Add some fun <p> Ask each group to vote on its own best role-play and award prizes . Or give prizes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Role-play by title of buyers <p> The conversation that a rep may have with a general practitioner is very different from the one they may have with a KOL . During the role-playing exercises , switch around the client titles . <p> 5 . Split role-playing between sales peers and sales management <p> Role-playing groups should contain both salespeople and sales management so they reflect different levels of approach and experience . Management and team members can take turns being the buyer . <p> 6 . Make a list of your top ten sales objections and use them <p> Note , and make use of , your toughest sales objections during role-playing sessions .

I have upgraded to the last 3 or 4 iPhones without even reviewing any alternative products .

We recognize that pharma requires a unique approach to building brands .

Then here are a couple of quick case studies from recent projects we have worked on that might act as a reminder that this is not the case . <p> But we have the best data ' was the exclamation we heard many times .

The aim of the process is to provide optimal support for the individual markets in their planning , management and tracking of tenders and contracts . While markets may appear to vary across the world , on closer inspection , we find that they are more similarities than differences in the tender environment and the needed capabilities to be successful . <p> When putting together a response to a tender , it 's important to ensure that you can supply the agreed volumes and to meet all the client 's needs . It is also important to clearly articulate the benefits of your product and offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's impossible for a single person to win a big tender alone . It requires liaison and close coordination with many different functions to optimize the bid . For example , with manufacturing you need to confirm capacity and cost early on .

To be able to manage this , we created this cross-functional process that involves people from a wide range of areas at the right point in time . <p> The key success factor for all markets is to be proactive in tender planning . This includes making a concerted effort to anticipate what opportunities are coming up in the near future and in the longer term , and planning as much as possible in advance , country by country and product by product . Only if we have early visibility of what is coming , we can optimally support the markets in their bidding and negotiations . <p> Suzanne Elvidge : What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other companies ? <p> Nico Bacharidis : - Over 80 countries plan , manage and track their tenders in the same way using a global web-based tool .

This global overview informs our strategies and tactics and how tenders can be better put together and managed in the future to increase our probabilities to win . <p> Suzanne Elvidge : How did you develop your global tender process ?

@@24982722 @4982722/ <h> The Answer to Patient Adherence is Not One Solution , But Many ... <p> Non-adherence to treatment is a growing , multi-faceted problem meaning that a long-term , collaborative healthcare industry effort to develop a variety of rather than singular compliance solutions is the best way forward . <p> Earlier this month , a study published in the Annals of Medicine- which reviewed several US studies on an individual 's ability to adhere to their prescriptions , showed that lowering drug costs should improve a patient 's compliance to their medication . However , most of these studies have not monitored the effectiveness of cost for patient adherence in the long-term meaning that other patient education or behavioural solutions for compliance could also be viable options . Therefore , the question of how to improve patient adherence in the real world still exists . <p> As stated in my previous articles , building and sustaining relationships with patients and other health stakeholders is essential for the pharmaceutical industry and this would be my ideal , continuing solution for improving adherence levels . Recent findings from a Cap Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moderate success and no single intervention strategy has been effective . This research has shown that the rarely used approaches like nurse educator schemes and pharmacist programmes are most popular but the report states that the costs related to personal interaction has prohibited adoption . Additionally , interviewees who included pharma executives , payers , pharmacists and patient associations from US and Europe , stated that the lack of a long-term strategy or continuity , poor understanding of a patient 's needs and several programmes by different stakeholders running in isolation meant that adherence success was hindered . <p> An evolution of the healthcare industry means that it is not just providers but also pharmacists- and nurses- who can collaborate together to shape patient behaviour . If patients do not trust the treatment prescribed or are not motivated to stay on course in the long-term , nurses can use patient or motivational interviewing techniques , to move past these barriers . Nurses could coach the patient to change their non-adherent behaviour gradually and then discover a better understanding of their needs which would be very useful for the pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints . Once an initial understanding of needs is discovered earlier in the drug treatment process , healthcare stakeholders could determine other sources of secondary data to improve the patient journey . Pharma could develop communication strategies for nurses while working with other stakeholders like pharmacists to develop plans for medication therapy management and home visits , which would also offer a helping hand to doctors . <p> Furthermore , pharmaceutical companies could develop a better partnership with patients by empowering them through the social media space to manage their own healthcare . The pharmaceutical industry have a duty to ensure that accurate health information is part of the online conversation- and so could provide resources to help doctors and other healthcare stakeholders to interact with patients who are unsure about complying or adhering to a particular treatment . This initial sharing of information by companies could encourage patients to share their personal adherence problems which are real world data- that could be used to develop more patient-centred treatment programmes . Moreover , the industry could use this space to initiate holistic treatment ideas- to help patients live a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies can collaborate further with payers to ensure a lower cost for drugs as well as work with governments and employers to increase the uptake and the development of adherence initiatives . <p> All in all , there is no single adherence solution that will meet every patient 's individual needs . A selection of collaborative solutions to adherence must be developed by all in the healthcare industry and then applied depending on the type of patients . It goes without saying that healthcare stakeholders who are currently implementing adherence standalone solutions could ensure better outcomes if all players were equally engaged in ensuring its success . The pharmaceutical industry needs to start facilitating this cohesive approach so that one day , the current $30 billion lost in non-adherence annually can be used to develop a thoroughly innovative , patient-centred service that is open to change and growth . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

The average time taken by developed countries for the percentage of the population above 65 years old to increase from 7% to 17% was 60 years , but China is expected to take only 30 years to reach the same level. - By 2050 , the proportion of the population over 65 in China is projected to reach 34% , which is comparable with Denmark , and much higher than the US ( 26% ) . <p> Increased longevity and lower fertility rate are typically the two main factors that contribute to an aging population . In the case of China , the strict family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a key role in the country 's rapid shift in population structure . As each family is only allowed to have one child , China 's fertility rate has dropped sharply in the wake of the policy , resulting in a declining percentage of young population . This is a key factor that we need to bear in mind when looking at China 's unique healthcare challenges . <p> The Challenges <p> Rapid aging poses challenges to healthcare , among which the most common are a surging healthcare expenditure , and a rising difficulty in managing the iron triangle ' - access , cost and quality , the three core aspects of healthcare that need to be balanced by any healthcare regulator . <p> So what are the unique constraints that China faces because of aging ? <p> Financial constraints - Getting old before getting rich ' <p> China is the only developing country with aging at a level comparable to many developed countries . This means the amount of public resources for elderly care are limited . In the past ten years , China 's government has channelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% of the population . However , such wide coverage could only be achieved by providing a very low benefit level to each citizen . The financial stability of this public investment is also questionable , as China 's healthcare expenditure is expected to increase by five times from 2000 to 2020 , as people above 65 years of age typically spend three to five times more on healthcare than those below 65 . As the demand for public funding increases , the trade-off between access and quality will intensify . In addition , China 's public health insurance is structured such that the healthcare of the elderly population is funded by paid contributions from the employed workforce . Since China also faces a declining labour force after three decades of the one-child policy , the current system is likely to meet great challenges as incoming funding from salaried contributions falls short of outgoing healthcare expenditure . <p> There are an increasing number of 4-2-1 ' families , which stands for two adults supporting four elderly parents and their own child . This structure considerably hampers many families ' ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new need for social elderly care , such as care centers . <p> On a micro level , family support for elderly healthcare also faces constraints as a result of rapid aging . Traditionally , the majority of elderly care in China has been provided by families . However , the long-term impact of the one-child policy has been not only to alter the population structure , but also to change the family structure . There are an increasing number of 4-2-1 ' families , which stands for two adults supporting four elderly parents and their own child . This structure considerably hampers many families ' ability to provide elderly care , which in turn creates a new need for social elderly care , such as care centers . This is even more critical in rural areas , which account for two thirds of the aging population and have significantly lower family income levels than urban areas . Moreover , China 's urbanization and industrialization has resulted in thousands of millions of the rural population migrating to cities for work , leaving the elderly behind in villages where healthcare access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply ' <p> A significant proportion of China 's elderly suffer from health problems . According to a recent survey , there are 62 million elderly experiencing body pain and 100 million having hypertension . Not only are the Chinese elderly experiencing a rising chronic disease burden , cognition decline and depression are also becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly . An aging population with suboptimal health is inevitably going to put significant pressure on its healthcare system , therefore we expect China to encounter a critical shortage of medical services supplied for the elderly , including lack of community care centers , palliative care and long-term care facilities . China is also set to experience a shortage of nurses , physiotherapists , and social workers as the burden of elderly care is being transmitted from family to society . <p> Implications for the healthcare industry <p> A hint of this trend is suggested by the ongoing campaign to reduce unnecessary and profit-driven prescriptions , as well as the recent anti-corruption investigations against multinational pharmaceutical companies . <p> The Chinese government has started to implement major reforms in pharmaceutical policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the Essential Drug List , a preferred list of drugs for public hospitals at an affordable price . In response to the increasing burden on the state and families to pay for healthcare due to aging , we expect the government to devise additional measures to further curb healthcare costs . A hint of this trend is suggested by the ongoing campaign to reduce unnecessary and profit-driven prescriptions , as well as the recent anti-corruption investigations against multinational pharmaceutical companies . <p> For years , patients have complained about hospitals in China being overcrowded . This is due to the shortage of medical services supplied , as well as the lack of a gate-keeping system for primary care . China is planning to build a primary healthcare system that aims to increase access and relieve the burden of general hospitals . In the context of aging , primary care such as community clinics is likely to be prioritized by the government given that it could provide more efficient healthcare at a lower cost , and would be a more convenient route for the elderly to seek medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure may limit the capacity of children to offer elderly care to their parents . However that may not be the only reason for a rising demand for social elderly care . The future elderly middle class " who has contributed to and enjoyed the fruit of China 's economic reform " may have a strong need for quality social healthcare services . For example , In addition , in order to meet rising demand , growth in the long term care facilities sector ( including nursing homes and day care centres ) is expected . Other healthcare services , including mental health support to the elderly , may also be an increasing need . <p> As China 's healthcare needs grow and the relative proportion of contributing labour force declines , public funding will no longer be sufficient to provide the care required . Private funding , including funding from families themselves as well as investment from both within China and from abroad , will increasingly be needed to close the gap and supplement public funding if China 's healthcare system is to avoid a crisis . <p> Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 30 years ' experience of market research , specialising in healthcare research since 1996 .

@@24982732 @4982732/ <h> Q&amp;A : How to engage with KOLs <p> We 're still using the term KOL , but we 're approaching the relationship with them differently . The good news is , we 've seen a maturation of both the expectations and outputs of alliances between pharma and physicians . Thankfully , we have moved past the profligacy and politics of yesteryear , the food frolics and friendship extravaganzas that failed to achieve scientific equanimity and fuelled the reactive media hyperbole where a relative handful of puritanical crusaders tried to impose a draconian code and pharma was hounded for attempting to work with KOLs . As with any polarized battle , a healthy middle ground has been reached and the value and importance of industry-physician interactions has been re-established with better working parameters . So it is n't so much that the terminology or definition of a KOL has changed , but the understanding that pharma are KOLs , too , and that the value of a physician KOL is better authenticated through strong scientific collaborations ( not pens , pads , or pizza ) defines the modern-day relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include different HCPs , influencers , and advocates . We are experiencing the gestation of a new categorization of real world experts ' who are a heterogeneous population of these influencers and advocates . We might call then POLs ; we might call them healthcare ambassadors . Whatever the term , they are a collective tour-de-force to campaign for better real-world treatments and outcomes of treatments in complement to the KOLs who have traditionally emerged from the clinical trial world . We are looking at a future of participatory medicine with a multiplicity of experts from different backgrounds . <p> What are the biggest hurdles for pharma to overcome when engaging with KOLs ? <p> I think pharma still hides behind a **26;421;TOOLONG or an apologetic approach to relationships with KOLs . They have spent too much time being quiet in response to their critics . It is great to see pharma standing up for itself and communicating the commendable projects and products they develop and deliver . Accordingly , it is good to see the KOLs within pharma itself starting to be more visible around the work they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medics , and healthcare experts in pharma . It is highly reassuring to know that these scientists are working away on our collective behalf . The popularity of pharma company blogs exemplifies this . Pfizer 's Think Science Now ' blog , for instance , demonstrates how overcoming a hurdle about telling your own story ' serves to enhance transparency and ultimately trust and belief in what pharma does . <p> The same approach needs to keep building with regard to how pharma can and should engage with all physicians , not just HCPs . The Manhattan Research Group studies showed that more than two-thirds of EU physicians want to direct their patient to pharma product sites , which shows that physicians trust the info from pharma . Furthermore , physicians on social network sites like doctors.net and doctodoc very clearly seek information and relationships with pharma . When I launched the medpharmaconnect site last year , there were physicians from 17 therapeutic areas stating they wanted greater relationships with pharma , whereas pharma participation was less confident . Engage more , engage equally ' is a sensible mantra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern day KOL-stick with what we know works or consider social media and digital channels ? <p> Like the rest of the population , doctors are increasingly using the Internet for personal use : 77% watch online videos , 75% shop online , 49% visit social networks , and 46% instant message . Online activities are having a significant impact on their professional lives , too , and there 's been a double-digit percentage growth in the consultation of online educational resources ( rather than offline ones ) since 2007 . A few illuminating figures to show the importance of getting online activities right : In 2007 , the average physician spent 9.5 hours per week online ; in 2010 , this figure had risen to 14 hours . Of those physicians who use the Internet for professional purposes , 83% said this was essential to their practice . <p> Therefore , I think the defense of digital channels , or the persuasion to use them for strong industry-physician interactions , has been resolved , especially around provision of information . What is more interesting is considering how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . A controversial point of view is that pharma should consider how to help the physician who needs to think like a salesman ' , in that the physician has to sell ' a lifestyle change or responsibility to a patient . If a smoker sees their doctor about chest pain , for example , then the physician has to sell ' the notion of quitting tobacco and there are great examples of digital tools to help manage that and social media campaigns to support that . Pharma should consider the wrap-around digital services that they provide to physicians and patients as part of their communication and relationship strategy . We have seen Janssen do this faultlessly with their psoriasis360 multi-channeled approach . <p> Regulations are always of top concern with any form of engagement . Given the grey areas around social media , is it best to stick with what 's safe when beginning with KOL engagement ? <p> Innovation has never been driven by regulation .

What is clear is that companies will need a deep understanding of the digital world and improved internal skills if they are to succeed . <p> To better understand how ready companies were for the digital tidal wave , a year ago , we looked at the digital intensity of pharma companies , and highlighted J&amp;J 's strength and the slower response of others , such as AstraZeneca and Pfizer . To measure digital intensity , we looked at the number of employees who referred to digital ' in their LinkedIn title . <p> In February , we repeated the analysis for a third year ; the big news is that Bayer has joined J&amp;J/Janssen at the top of the table , with 4.8 digital employees per thousand , an increase of 150% since 2015 when it went public with its digital transformation project . <p> Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice on social media and the grant4apps program that encourages external innovation , while , internally , it has run hackathons and worked to change its culture .

It recently announced the launch of a connected inhaler with Propeller Health , which now has five partnerships with pharma companies .

Roche has invested in capabilities to improve clinical trial efficiency as well as its digital marketing and multichannel capabilities . <p> Pfizer also saw strong growth , moving it out of the bottom three .

Under this agreement , West is responsible for developing the manufacturing and commercial production processes of the product on Janssen 's behalf . <p> Developing a medical device that patients can use themselves is not a new concept although the self-injection facility is . Last month , Genetech , a biotechnology firm , reformulated their cancer drug so that it could be delivered through injection rather than intravenous drip . Janssen could make this delivery even easier by offering Genetech a self-administered solution for their drug which the team saw the potential for . Patients could take any injection-based treatment at home without the cost of having doctors or nurses to deliver the drug . Necessary care would not be delayed or ignored because there is a lesser need to make frequent or overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before patients are encouraged to use this device , they need to be taught how to use it . Non-adherence to treatment often occurs as a 10 to 15 minute consultation with a doctor is never enough to help the patient fully understand how to treat their disease . In the above instance , West Pharmaceutical Services and Janssen could work together to develop educational programmes that could be delivered by various health professionals to patients who want to use this injection device . This self- injection education could be delivered in a patient group environment at a later stage . <p> Patients can not only learn from the speakers as well as from each other as they will all share similar obstacles and successes of the treatment . West and Janssen could create these educational talks to complement any sessions with doctors or nurses and could reduce fears about a patient 's ability to manage treatment on their own . <p> Furthermore , a patient monitoring device can also be fitted to this device for an initial period to ensure safety although the above education programme , currently used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a better long-term solution . It will show patients that health professionals do value their ability to take charge of their treatment without the need to be monitored constantly . In addition , a plan for convincing health insurers and other health bodies to compensate patients for using this device , needs to be drafted . <p> All in all , the rest of the pharmaceutical industry can start discussions on how their existing drugs could fit this self-administered solution . Talks could take place on whether this self healthcare solution could work for any disease , especially conditions that require more than one dose of drugs . This solution also encourages the industry to remain innovative in manufacturing even if a solution for a condition already exists . More money for R&amp;D would exist as doctors or nurses would not have to administer these doses .

At the end of the day , the regulatory authorities are going to make a benefit/risk assessment on a drug vis-+ -vis a patient population and health technology assessors are going to be looking at the value of the drug based on the treatment of the patient . So a lot of this revolves around how best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , industry or regulators , to facilitate this whole process . It 's not looking to co-opt anyone , it is about how best we can all work together to foster treatment advances in areas of unmet medical need . Patient centricity is the key to making that happen . <p> At the end of the day , all of us are patients . It 's in our best interests to ensure that clinical trials and drug development works well because we are all going to be dependent on those medications if not now , then in the future . <p> Certainly we are seeing more and more mention of patient centricity as it relates to drug development and clinical trials . I am involved with the Drug Information Association ( DIA ) as a former board member , past President , and inaugural fellow. - I am also involved with the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation ( CISCRP ) as an advisory board member . <p> One of the initiatives that these organizations have been involved in is the FDA Clinical Trial Transformation Initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up clinical trials as part of drug development . These groups have really embraced the concept of patient centricity and have started to look at best practices as it relates to patients , academia , and industry interactions . What you are going to see is more and more of a coalescence and roadmap of how best to interact and engage with patients , because at the end of the day , all of us are patients . It 's in our best interests to ensure that clinical trials and drug development works well because we are all going to be dependent on those medications if not now , then in the future . <p> How do you make sure that your concept is implemented internally ? <p> When I joined Horizon Pharma in 2009 as the Chief Medical Officer , we were privately held and did not have a product approved . I was the eleventh employee . Now we have seven products on the market , are publically traded , have a five billion dollar market cap and are growing and evolving . <p> We focus in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rare diseases . Certainly as you look at the spectrum we are operating in , rare diseases is an area where there is a marked need for close interaction with patient groups because the number of individuals with these disorders are very small . So we work with patient groups to find out how best to move a product forward as a potential treatment . But we are also involved in working in other areas such as osteoarthritis , which is a widely prevalent disease , which requires a different type of engagement . <p> Instead of companies looking at patients as individuals on the outside of the process or as simply a contractual relationship , it is about changing that to a long-term relationship and asking how can we best collaborate together to make this potential treatment happen . <p> We know we need to engage with patient groups early and often " so it is really about starting off a relationship , and you have to look at this relationship being long term . - Many companies may engage patient groups late in Phase III or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study for example , but the best way to engage is at the start of a program to get a better understanding of the disease , the natural history of the disease , and what are the challenges that patients face . You want to focus on what can get done to make this product as patient friendly and healthcare professional friendly as possible . We want to know what information we can provide to the healthcare community and patients so that they can make the most informed decision on whether this treatment may be right for them or not . <p> As a company , we are looking at what we can do to make the patient 's life easier " we treat individuals how we would want to be treated . We think like the individuals with the condition " if I were the patient involved in this study , what would I do to make my involvement as easy as possible . <p> Instead of companies looking at patients as individuals on the outside of the process or as simply a contractual relationship , it is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we best collaborate together to make this potential treatment happen .

We always try to look at things by putting ourselves in the shoes of the person " say if I was the health technology assessor or the regulator or the healthcare provider at the trial site . <p> Tell us more about collaboration mechanisms that can be used to cross organizational barriers ? <p> We need to make the product or treatment as accessible as possible for patients because otherwise it could be a great product , but if there are accessibility issues then it is difficult for a company to make it sustainable . <p> The way we try to approach things is with the end in mind , and since that end is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at what is needed to make that happen " it goes beyond just getting it approved . Particularly in Europe where health technology assessment is key , we have to anticipate the questions they will ask . <p> It is about showing a true value proposition for the product and trying to remove as many barriers as possible in terms of access to the product or treatment . Then you can work backwards from that goal , and it makes it a much more streamlined product development approach . It is about gathering the information and the networking to try and make it as easy as possible for the regulators to make their benefit/risk assessment and for the health technology assessors to make their value assessment . <p> Jeff Sherman , Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President at Horizon Pharma will be speaking at eyeforpharma 's Patient Centered Clinical Trials , Philadelphia , October , 19th-20th 2015 .

@@24982753 @4982753/ <h> Market access : How to meet both marketing authorisation and HTA needs <p> Leela Barham looks at the costs and benefits of taking a more collaborative approach towards marketing authorisation and Health Technology Assessments . <p> During the lifecycle of a new pharmaceutical , there are considerable hurdles to overcome before the product successfully reaches market. - <p> Traditionally , there has been a distinction between the first three hurdlessafety , efficacy , and quality , which lead to marketing authorisation ( MA ) and the fourth , a formal or informal Health Technology Assessment ( HTA ) conducted by payers when making reimbursement decisions . <p> Now , efforts are under way to take a more collaborative approach across MA and HTA decisions . <p> Comparing MA and HTA <p> There are some good reasons for making the link between MA and HTA . <p> The decisions are , in fact , very similar : Should a new product be available ? <p> However , the perspectives behind the decisions are different. - <p> MA is about whether the product is safe , whether it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether it can be produced to a high quality. - <p> The MA agencies are concerned with whether trials are rigorous enough . HTA is increasingly about looking at the added value of a new product . Does it meet a previously unmet need ? Can it show benefit over and above existing treatments ? And just how good is it in real-life use ? And that can never be considered at the time of authorisation . <p> According to Dr. Chris Henshall , pro vice chancellor at the University of York and founding chair of the HTAi Policy Forum , there is scope to increase co-ordination even though MA and HTA are different decisions . <p> Not least so that these agencies can understand the implications of their respective requirements , he says , and explore ways of minimizing the burdens for industry , consistent with the agencies differing roles and remits . <p> Meeting regulators needs <p> There is more certainty in the approach to getting regulatory approval , Henshall suggests , reflecting the longer evolution of regulatory standards compared to the relatively young HTA. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those underpinning HTA , so companies have a clearer understanding of the expectations of MA agencies compared to the many and varied HTAs/payers. - <p> These factors help explain why many companies are geared up to focus on meeting regulators needs . <p> Plus , of course , if you cant get past the MA hurdles , you wont have the luxury of worrying about reimbursement at all . <p> In terms of process , there are commonalities . Both the MA and HTA decisions are , for example , concerned with health outcomes. - <p> Dealing with differences <p> Key differences include what outcomes are acceptable ; in some cases , the MA agencies will accept a surrogate outcome marker , which may not be accepted by the HTA agency. - <p> This may not be clear at the outset though and , according to Henshall , the scope for more coordination in these types of factors could be one of the key drivers for bringing MA and HTA closer together . <p> There are efforts in some countries to provide earlier access to genuinely innovative new medicines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HTA fields , he says . <p> There could be scope to bring together the current interest in coverage with evidence development ( CED ) schemes , where outcomes are monitored over time to help understand real-life cost effectiveness , with traditional post-MA surveillance to inform the risk-benefit profile of new products . <p> The power of registries <p> Registries are an obvious approach , since they can collect information on side effects and hospitalizations , including whether patients are able to work . <p> Registries are powerful , but perhaps do n't  link up the post-MA surveillance needs with cost-effectiveness needs as well as they could , Johnson says . And some lack a comparator , so do n't  give the full picture . <p> The key question then becomes : How can companies optimize their approach to commercial research to best meet both MA and HTA needs ? - <p> That 's not an easy question to answer , as Ansgar Hebborn , head of the Global Payer &amp; HTA Program Policy at Roche , notes : There are potentially different views from different agencies/payers . Companies need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of markets . <p> The way forward is for companies to look at value-based arguments much earlier in development and invest in comparative trials , according to Johnson . <p> They need to be confident in their product .

And despite the flurry of mergers and deals either underway or being contemplated right now , the model does not look like changing much anytime soon . Indeed , from past experience , we have seen that megamergers derail business model innovation as the company intensifies its focus on integrating the two organisations and eking out the efficiency gains that are required to justify the merger in the first place . <p> Sure , there have been advances and the industry is much leaner than it was , but the core of the business , it 's underlying thinking , many of the processes , the structures , sales and marketing tactics , approaches to customers , many of these things remain virtually unchanged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one would suggest a big bang approach to organizational change in this industry , but there are things that should and could be changed today that would both positively impact short-term financial performance while better positioning the company for the future . <p> Over the coming months , I will look at some aspects of the traditional model that would benefit from some new and , of course , patient centric , remodeling . <p> If you would like to contribute to this discussion or you have a particular point of view you would like to explore , please let me know .

@@24982777 @4982777/ <h> Will Physicians Become Obsolete ? <p> Maybe not entirely , but from the work we are doing using AI to create data-driven patient treatment decisions for specialist physicians , it is now becoming clear that at least 80% of physician work , if not more , will become obsolete in the future , and potentially the near future , with the advent of the tricorder already in trials this month . <p> Current approaches to diagnosis <p> Currently , a large amount of patient diagnosis is done by Dr Google ' . Although it is far from perfect , given most conditions have a large variety of symptoms in common , other work in the area of accurate diagnosis is rapidly increasing . <p> Let 's consider how specialists diagnose at present . Firstly , they get patient history , then the physicians may order some tests based on their memory of what they learned as well as a large amount of drug advertising and PR . The impact is that the treatment is inferior to what it could be , as humans are fallible , and patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US ( by Johns Hopkins ) found that 40,500 patients die each year in ICU as a result of misdiagnosis . To put this in perspective , this is equivalent to the number of deaths from breast cancer . However , this is not to place blame on the physicians as they are in a difficult situation with hundreds of thousands of different conditions that have similar symptoms , at least 8 , 000 ultra rare conditions that most doctors would never be exposed to , plus thousands of updates in each medical area every week . It is physically impossible for physicians to stay up-to-date in most areas , but especially in rapidly progressing ones such as oncology . <p> A study in Oncology pitted AI diagnosis against a panel of four leading oncologists wherein both sides examined patient scans and made a diagnosis around tumor progression . The AI outperformed the human diagnoses by a significant margin . <p> Just to clarify , given some people have been calling some things AI ' and they are not . This study was , of course , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clinical pathway and expert clinical support systems which occasionally erroneously label themselves as artificial intelligence ' because it is a buzz word . The expert clinical support systems are very rule-based and simplistic and can not take in the complexity that is required in today 's oncology work with complex patient profiles , in comparison to what a real Artificial Intelligence ( a combination of machine learning , deep learning and evolutionary computation ) can do . <p> A lot of what physicians currently do - including testing , diagnosis and treatment decisions - can actually be done better by active data collection and collation , sensors , and AI analytics . Physicians are meant to consume all those data points and consider it in the context of the latest medical literature and the patient history , and make decisions in the best interest of the patients ' health outcome . <p> It actually is physically impossible for physicians to consume all the latest information and integrate it constantly . For example , how many cardiologists can digest all of the latest 5000+ articles and research updates on oncology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an impossible task . <p> Is Artificial Intelligence the future of diagnosis ? <p> So , is Artificial Intelligence the future of diagnosis ? Artificial Intelligence can pull data from trillions of data points in a second , analyze all relevant factors and come up with a far more accurate conclusion than a human brain is capable of , as the studies in this area have already shown . Now that we are in the era of personalized medicine , utilizing far more complex models with thousands of baseline and multi-omic data points , up-to-date data and data capture are critical to make the most advanced treatment decisions . <p> Of note is that Eularis are currently working on an Artificial Intelligence driven clinical platform for oncologists to do the following : <p> Review all relevant , authoritative medical literature in oncology and collate it , Review all clinical trial data in the space and collate it with results , biomarkers and more Add in local country and hospital treatment protocols , Link this to the electronic patient records ( longitudinal data ) to examine scan images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) along with treatment and patient outcomes , Collate all that constantly updated data to allow the Artificial Intelligence to identify what treatment will have the best possible outcome for a specific unique combination of factors for a specific patient <p> We are doing this in oncology currently but could equally take this wider into other spaces in the future . <p> New technologies will allow physicians to work faster and improve their work as all the data can be taken into account " something that is simply not possible currently with all the constant increases in data .

@@24982797 @4982797/ <h> An Integrated Patient Journey <p> Major pharma companies tend to adopt vision and mission statements which put the patient at the center , for example : <p> GSK : We want to help people to do more , feel better , live longer . <p> AstraZeneca : Delivering great medicines to patients through innovative science and excellence in development and commercialization . <p> Pfizer : At Pfizer , we 're inspired by a single goal : your health . <p> Novartis : To prevent and cure diseases , to ease suffering and to enhance the quality of life . <p> In the work we do at Strategic North , we find that patient centricity can be more fully achieved by considering how patients can be supported from diagnosis onwards , by understanding their needs along their personal journey with their condition . Exploring the holistic patient journey offers an important perspective , allowing us to understand how and when to offer tools and support that enable the patient to engage more proactively with their condition and treatment. - The right interventions at these touch points ' can enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track with their treatment . <p> Clearly , it is neither possible nor appropriate for pharma to provide all the support a patient may require during their illness . In order to understand and prioritize which support tools will have the biggest impact on patient engagement , first we must map out the integrated patient journey . <p> Mapping an Integrated Patient Journey <p> An integrated patient journey map includes both the clinical journey and how this impacts on the patient emotionally , functionally and socially over time. - There are several insightful techniques that we use to clearly map out the patient journey " this creates an integrated , longitudinal view of the patient experience , rather than a snap shot at any one point in time " and to prioritize the most important touch points during which to intervene . <p> First and foremost , patient research should be ethical with full consideration of patient needs and perspectives . For many pharma companies , patient research can represent a minefield of red tape and compliance checks which unfortunately often leads to patient research being omitted from research methodologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their patients experience , which whilst valuable , can never reflect the true reality of the patient journey. - Whilst the approval process can often be a high hurdle , we believe that the richness of insights captured from patient research far outweigh the potential pains of an approval process . <p> Our own approach to patient research is full immersion in the patient 's history and present day life . We have a tool box of techniques to get beyond the rational , and to elicit the more emotive , hard to articulate , often unknown , thoughts feelings and perceptions of patients throughout their journey . Whether it be mood boards , blob trees , good day/bad day , creating collages , drawing timelines with peaks and troughs , all can lead to deep and rich ( and in some case therapeutic ) conversations with patients . In addition to traditional in-depth interviews , where appropriate , we can also utilize smart phones to capture in-the-moment thoughts and feelings . For example , patients could be asked to film themselves immediately after they have had a consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . By using technology in this way we can gain a real window to the patient experience at key points in their disease journey and capture unedited thoughts and feelings . <p> Eliciting such insights from patients is all well and good ; however , this is a wasted effort unless we can truly immerse pharma clients in the patients ' lives and experiences . To achieve this we typically use a professional production company to video a small sample of patient ( and HCP ) interviews in their home ( or office ) setting and create a video montage that tells the patient story . This way client teams can truly understand the patient journey . <p> Designing Touch Point Interventions <p> Having identified the most important touch points , we look at the most effective ways to intervene and provide patient support , which we classify into 4 groups : <p> By getting to the heart of what matters most to the patient and truly understanding their journey , it enables us to translate what we 've learned into actionable outcomes for brands teams that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your business more patient-centric , we can offer some tips : <p> Start from a solid foundation of a clearly understood , integrated patient journey to enable identification and prioritization of potential touch points . <p> Be clear which interventions are going to have the greatest impact on patient engagement . <p> Co-create solutions with customers to ensure they really are serving the customers ' interest . <p> Pilot tools before full launch because an iterative approach will surely improve the final intervention . <p> This is the approach we find helpful to explore and address the patient 's real needs , thereby getting to the heart of what patent centricity really is. - We hope you find it useful too and if you can build on this perspective or have your own thoughts and experiences to share , we 'd really like to hear from you .

@@24982800 @4982800/ <h> Back to the Future ( of Pharma Sales ) <p> Our last column saw us surveying the smoking ruins of the pharma sales model , poppies beginning to grow over the remnants of jobs long gone . We examined how we got there ( something to do with archdukes and Ottomans ... or perhaps that was a different conflict ) but we did n't dare look towards the future . It 's much easier to examine the foibles of the past than to predict those of the future , after all . <p> But the time has come to stick my neck out above the parapet . <p> Before we start to consider visions of tomorrow , how about checking yesterday 's visions of today ? As I sat down to write this column , I remembered that I had already written an article about the " sales force of tomorrow " ... in 2004 . I thought I 'd dig it up and see just how wrong I was . <p> Turns out I was pretty wrong , but I 'm going to comfort myself by thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The article was published in " Visite Actuelle " , a French pharma sales journal . In it , I predicted the following for 2014 : <p> There would be far fewer reps . <p> In most countries , physician accessibility problems would get worse . <p> CRM would become more complete and more dynamic , providing automatic analysis of customers and microsegmentation , with customized approaches . <p> Reps would become " Customer Relationship Managers " , using not only face to face visits , but web technology , distance detailing , etc . <p> These empowered customer relationship managers would in some cases be supplemented by more basic , communication-oriented or service-oriented reps . <p> On one hand , I do n't see anyone with a customer relationship manager title , and most reps do n't sit at the center of a network of telecommunications , choosing the channels with which to approach customers . On the other hand , I actually think I was right about a few things : there are certainly fewer reps and greater accessibility problems ( see last month 's column for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while we were n't talking about CLM back then , the article 's description of " interactive CRM " is , effectively , CLM . What 's more , some companies are moving toward different rep specializations ... AstraZeneca , for example , has been experimenting with full reps and " service reps " . <p> So I 'm going to be boring and make the same predictions , just extending the deadline by a few years . I still think we 'll change the entire approach with respect to reps , assessing them on their ability to engage with customers more than their ability to push a message , and we may well see the emergence of rep specialization according to role . <p> Consider reps as CRMs ... note that this is not a system , but a title : " Customer Relationship Manager " , or Key Account Manager if you will . In the old sales force , a rep 's job was essentially to deliver a message that had been designed centrally . He or she was assessed on sales alone , or sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case , the rep is like a walking billboard , saying the same thing to everyone and relatively impervious to any feedback from the customer . <p> Of course , the rep is supposed to engage in a conversation , but this is only in the context of getting the message across ... " objection handling " if you will . The contact is largely scripted and the rep has relatively little leeway . Sometimes the rep is asked to gather information from the physician , but this too is tightly scripted . In the future , the " CRM " is going to have to master the messages , but he or she is ultimately responsible for creating a relationship , managing that relationship , and most of all , encouraging customer engagement . The CRM will be assessed on sales , but also on customer satisfaction and on the level of customer engagement , and all this within strict compliance boundaries . <p> This sounds warm and fuzzy , and probably scary . If you let reps chase after customer satisfaction then wo n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales ? Well yes , if you do it wrong . However , we 're not talking about getting customers to like you ; we 're talking about getting them to engage with the company . This can be measured , as can satisfaction . It used to be very difficult to measure it , but now as the industry moves toward iPad detailing , suddenly the tools are in our hands to measure these things . <p> Pharma is not alone in this . Just about every industry out there is being transformed by customer engagement . It used to be that you could pretty much dictate to your customers . They might take their business elsewhere , but for the most part , you make something , put it on the market , shout your message and the customers either come and you are successful or they do n't and you do something else . These days , though , customers want to be engaged . They want to participate in the creation of value . You used to have encyclopedia salesmen pushing big heavy books door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around participation . <p> So how does pharma encourage and measure customer engagement ? Largely through technology . To what degree are customers interacting with your promotional technology ? Are they touching the iPads ? Are they using your interactive content during the detail ? How about the follow-up presentations you 're sending , do they open them ? Do they proactively follow your customized links to their personalized websites ? Are they using your portals to get in touch with other contact personnel ( medical , etc . ) ? Are they making suggestions to you about products and services ? Are they asking questions via your system ? <p> All of this means customer engagement and I 'll guarantee that the more your customers are engaged , the more they 'll use your products , and use them effectively . The role of the rep of the future will be first to encourage engagement , then to get across messages , because if a customer is engaged you do n't need to rely only on the rep to get your messages across . <p> I 'm sure some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer-oriented , we had an initiative about it , trained them , and included a customer orientation measure in our coaching form " . <p> I 'm going to challenge you on that , though . I 've seen so many pharma companies who talk up a great story , but they still do n't measure any of the things I 've mentioned and when you actually talk to the reps , they 'll explain that their job is to get across a specific canned message to their target list . <p> When I wrote the original article , in 2004 , I did n't know that the iPad was coming , and I did n't know the impact it would have .

@@24982810 @4982810/ <h> Segmentation is Key to LEO Maximizing Marketing Success <p> " A successful segmentation plan let 's you get the return you expect . You have to do your homework , you have to prepare carefully , know what you 're aiming at , who your customer base is , what your strategy is , what your goal is . " <p> Helena Bargiel , Head of Engagement Excellence at LEO Pharma , said in an interview about how to prepare a market segmentation strategies even when you do n't have all the information . <p> Market segmentation requires a project management approach that considers geographical , demographic , and behavioral aspects . For example , size of a country and associated logistics are factors to be considered " where should you be based ? How many branches you need ? Can you reach remote areas ? - But to successfully divide your market into manageable chunks you need an in-depth understanding of the where , as well as the what , and the who . <p> " First of all , you have to know what kind of product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ? If not , you 'll have to be satisfied with the share of the market that you can take . " <p> Once you 've decided what part of the market you want to conquer , you need to find out what kind of customers would benefit from your product , and whether they can afford it . If you know that what you want to sell will meet with demand , and will be affordable , you can think of how to make your product stand out . Price can be what sets you apart from the competition , but if the price difference is small , you need to look beyond that and consider factors specific to a given area . " It will be an educated guess , but you 'll get more and more experience , and with experience you 'll get a more precise plan . " <p> Creating an effective strategy requires research into your target population " e.g. males and females 30-45 years old " but also involvement of internal customers , i.e. people who work across different departments within your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product . " It 's important to make use of the broader and deeper understanding of internal knowledge . For example , if you know that sales are going to execute it , involve them early in the plan . You have to get as a complete a picture as possible . " <p> Getting all the information <p> As you develop your strategy , you need to have clearly defined milestones that you have to reach , but you must be flexible along the way , tweaking your strategy to increase accuracy . To start with , you need to test your strategy with a pilot to verify whether your message is being carried across , and whether your product is as good as you claim it is . " Listen to your internal and external customers , and ensure that you listen to what they are telling you , and not what you want them to say . As a pharma company , you have sales reps that are communicating your message , and can come back saying that this does n't work , people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often feed that information right back to you , especially when something goes wrong , less so when things are going fine , but no news is n't never good news , as it might mean that the message does n't reach anyone . The use of social media allows to follow-up on a large number of customers who , from the moment of the product launch , continuously evaluate it , sharing information on their individual experiences . " It 's tricky when you work with pharma because in most countries you 're not allowed to have direct consumer marketing . But that 's how the pharma has worked for years . They talk to the doctors and they feedback that information about uptake . " <p> Sometimes all the information is n't available . " People go in without information all the time , there 's always factors that you ca n't get in some way . Some people say that in the US , where you have prescription data , devising sales strategies should be easy , but it 's not true , because then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's usually information you do n't have and you need to estimate . Another question is whether the data is robust , trustworthy or relevant , something you can only assess with a clear strategy in mind . " <p> The ones who got it right <p> Coca-Cola and IKEA excel at market segmentation . " Imagine having an old product , its brown " drink something brown ! " it 's sticky , it 's not something you want to drink . Yet , Coca-Cola are not only maintaining old customers , they 're getting new ones . They listen to their customers . They have identified their needs and drivers : Why should I drink Coca-Cola when it 's warm , when it 's cold , in the morning , in the evening . They have done their homework very , very well . " <p> Similarly , IKEA is pulling off something just as unlikely . " You are buying very simple furniture in a box that you need to drag home by yourself and put together by yourself . The lines are not sophisticated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ikea furniture in the US in Japan , in all different cultures with different perceptions of what 's beautiful . " <p> Those success stories can translate to pharmaceuticals . " We need to think what our customers desire from the pharmaceuticals , and before going into any lab testing , try to identify what the customers would really like to have and what they 're prepared to pay for .

@@24982871 @4982871/ <h> Patient Associations are not customers ! <p> With all of the hype and attention around patient centricity and the need to engage patients ( customers ) in their health , many folks in pharma are rushing to engage with patient associations like never before . <p> Pharma now knows that it needs to better understand its customers and be better attuned to what they perceive as value and one of the best ways to do this is to pay close attention to the voice of the customer . <p> Associations are not one of pharmas ' customers . - By almost any definition of customer ' , associations do not fit that definition . Let me say that again just to be clear . They are not customers ! The reality is that engaging patient associations is no substitute for engaging directly with patients . <p> Sure , it is a step in the right direction but also one that carries with it a risk of going down the wrong path . Maybe they " pharma , think that building relationships with patient associations will help make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> In most cases , pharma works with them and in return either pays them in cash , support , or sponsorship . They may be , at best , stakeholders or at worse merely another supplier to pharma . Associations come in all shapes and sizes , many are substantial businesses in their own right , but they all need to balance carefully how they support their members while meeting the needs of operating as either a for-profit or not-for-profit corporation . <p> There is a huge potential for a conflict of interest . <p> Now do n't get me wrong , working with Patient Associations is better than not working with patients but it is no substitute for actually working directly with individual patients and caregivers . <p> Let me give you an example . <p> I guess most of you are car owners . And most of you belong to one of the many motorist associations around the world for a variety of reasons . These motoring organisations play an important role in advocating on key issues and sometimes speaking as a representative of their membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not , and indeed can not , speak on my behalf on many of the issues that I am concerned about as a motorist . They play an important role but less so actually representing the views of their individual members . <p> OK , I can hear many of you saying'but healthcare is different , it is not about cars ' and that 's true but the principle remains . <p> Patients Associations represent large numbers of patients and caregivers in a particular disease area and their powerful voice is certainly useful in advocacy and awareness , but there are obvious limitations to their ability to represent individual patients and caregivers . <p> One of the keys to working closer with customers , being patient centric if you like , is that the customer segment ' or target group ' is actually made up of individuals , and the only way to better understand customers is to engage them as individuals . Most of the time pharma looks at groups of customers ( often members of these groups or segments are only similar ' when looked at through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the assumption that it is representative of most customers in this segment . It is a pretty blunt way of understanding customers ! <p> Anyway , pharma has used , and continues to use , associations in awareness and advocacy , both directed at patients as well as payers and government , and clearly associations can contribute or even start an active debate on topics of importance to their members and pharma . <p> Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a great recent example of a company that continues to mobilize patient associations in support of many of its products such as those in CF. It has gained very visible support for treatments in CF from the various associations , but there seems a clear sub context here . Certainly the association wants its appropriate patients to have access to breakthrough treatments ( often without any mention of cost and avoiding that discussion altogether ) however , the relevant pharma company sometimes has more invested in the strategy than simply that objective . <p> Using Vertex as an example , and clearly there are many other pharma examples to choose from as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of their treatments cost , in round figures , about A$300,000 per annum . Luckily " in more ways than one , there are not that many patients in Australia , so the burden to the payer while significant is not overwhelming . Vertex realizes and acknowledges that the treatment will only work on around 90 per cent of patients . The government has already agreed to reimburse this important treatment , as it should , but takes the position that if it only works in 90% of patients then it should not be used or reimbursed in all patients , only those that it is relevant for - a straightforward pay for performance approach . <p> Now the CF patient association is active in this debate , but , at least from what I have seen and read , it has stayed out of the pricing/appropriate patient identification/pay for performance side of the discussion and remains focused on access , pushing that all suffers should have access to this government paid treatment . <p> I do n't think there is anything untoward happening in this case , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all the facts , but it certainly looks like conflicting and differing interests between the association and pharma . <p> The association is pushing for access for all , while the pharma company , clearly wanting access to all , is pushing for payment for everyone who uses the drug even though it will not work as advertised in all patients . <p> The negotiations between the government body and Vertex , as I understand it , has been resolved with some pricing agreements based on pay for performance , which seems like a win/win for everyone . The debate though was very public and quite intense , but , in my opinion , not particularly transparent . I did not see any attempt to solicit feedback and comment from patients themselves about the cost/effectiveness discussion and how patients felt about the situation as a whole . How can we deeply understand customers if we do n't genuinely engage with them ? <p> Can we get the insight we need by relying on third party feedback regardless of how well intentioned that third party may be ? <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . They can do a lot of good for their membership and can play an important role in healthcare , but they are clearly in a difficult position much of the time with pharma . <p> So who is a customer ? <p> Pharma for its part needs to respect the role associates can play and tread carefully when they work with this important stakeholder group . But pharma also needs to reach out , out of their comfort zone , and engage patients in real dialogue and not be tempted to rely on a stakeholder that they have the potential to influence . <p> There can be no substitute for using the voice of the customer ' ( read patient , caregiver , healthcare consumer ) to better understand customers and to develop meaningful value propositions in support of their treatments . <p> It is certainly easier to reach out to one association than it is to engage with your customer base , it is also safer in terms of potential med legal risk and is more aligned with pharma 's skill set . - But .... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speaking directly with customers to hear directly from them their hopes , needs , wants and expectations beyond just your product , regardless of what industry you are in . And healthcare and pharmaceuticals are no different . 46478 @qwx246478 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

The idea is that you only roll out the big guns when you definitely need them . <p> The four dimensions of patient flow analysis <p> What , then , are the 20 percent of cases for which patient flow analysis is essential ? <p> Talbot-Watt and her Black Swan team have created a four-dimensional compass to help analysts determine when patient flow analysis is appropriate . <p> Each dimension should be considered in keeping with the others , Talbot-Watt says , so you arrive at a balanced perspective on whether or not you need a patient flow model . <p> The first dimension considers the current level of treatment effectiveness . <p> Are the current treatments out there doing what 's needed for the disease ? <p> The more effective the treatment is , the more static your model probably should be , says Talbot-Watt . Less effective generally means more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so when introducing a new statin to market , a static model will generally suffice . <p> Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimers disease , meanwhile , are not particularly effective . <p> Their rate of uptake , therefore , is closely linked to the diagnosis rate of the patient population . <p> If that diagnosis rate changed and you had a static model , it would lead to a significant error in your forecast . <p> The second dimension is market density . <p> If many products are clustered on the market , patient flow analysis is likely to be unnecessary . <p> If there 's a very sparse market , however , or there 's no cohesion in terms of the classes used to treat the indication , you might be looking at a more dynamic model , says Talbot-Watt . <p> The third dimension is disease knowledge level . <p> The less that 's known about a disease , the more volatility there is likely to be in the treatments that surround it . <p> More volatility , in turn , points to patient flow analysis . <p> The fourth dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease variety . <p> First , the math at the core of patient flow analysis is actually quite simple . <p> All of it derives from the basic equation Prevalence = Incidence x Duration . <p> However , as you begin to wade through logs and logs of data that indicate how long it takes patients to transition from one stage of a disease to another , and all the factors that could influence that transition , your world quickly gets complicated . <p> Stay patient . If numbers are n't  adding upas they often dontlook for simple mistakes you may have made along the way , like multiplying by the wrong figure . <p> Its generally something very simple but it takes a while to track that down , says Talbot-Watt . <p> You have to have a lot of perseverance to go through it and keep going through it until you get to the solution that you need .

We should know this before the thing launches , well before . <p> And that 's where avoiding pitfalls in forecasting comes in . <p> Pitfall no. 1 : Poor analogues <p> One common pitfall that can ruin otherwise sound forecasts is the use of poor analogues , said Gibson . <p> In hunting for insightful corollaries , we sometimes settle for an analogy that 's out-of-date or not relevant enough to the drug at hand . <p> We all use analogies in our forecasting , he said , but is the analogy recent enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drug that were forecasting ? <p> He offered a cautionary tale from his past , when he was launching a diabetes drug in the European market . <p> The forecast used Avandia as an analogue but failed to consider that NICE had recently put a box around Avandia for several concerns . <p> We ended up using an analogy that was n't analogous at all , Gibson said . <p> Thus , when forecasting pre-launch , its very important to make sure that the situation or environment around the analogy is analogous to your compound , and if its not , make allowances for that , Gibson said . <p> Likewise , when brand teams go back and use forecasts in-line , Gibson asks them to look at and refine the rigor around those forecasts . <p> Some forecasts get dusty , Gibson said , and I like to dust off the forecast and challenge the assumptions on them . <p> Pitfall no. 2 : Ignoring payers <p> As the market for pharmaceuticals becomes more challenging , payers are more reluctant to adopt new drugs without clear proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or improve quality of life . <p> Its thus critical to accurately gauge payers interest in your product pre-launch and to integrate that level of interest into your forecast . <p> To the extent that you can , go beyond payer research and involve the payers almost as partners , if you can , in the development of your drug and the development of your forecasts , Gibson said . <p> That prevents a lot of consternation post launch . <p> He pointed to Pfizers famous flameout Exubera , an inhaled diabetes drug that the company walked away from in 2007 , shuttering a manufacturing plant and waving goodbye to , according to some reports , close to $3 billion . <p> Exubera looked on the surface to be a very , very promising and good drug , Gibson said . <p> The problem was that the payers did n't  see it that way , complaining that the manufacturer did n't  have the data or documentation to prove that Exubera would reduce medical costs and improve quality of life for diabetics in the long run . <p> So there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying , Gibson said . <p> Pitfall no. 3 : Missing clinical connections <p> Failing to align with R&amp;D and clinical trials is another pitfall that often trips up forecasts , Gibson said . <p> Specifically , he warned that forecasts must be connected to the clinical development plan . <p> Here he offered yet another example from his own experience . <p> When working on a compound for peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , he asked his forecasting team to add another indicationcritical limb ischaemiainto the forecast . <p> That indication , although a typical progression for PAD , had not been included in the clinical development plan . <p> The resulting snafu led to a discrepancy of about $500 million in peak sales . <p> I 'm no longer working at that company , Gibson said wryly , but I learned a very , very valuable lesson , and that was to get with my brothers and sisters in R&amp;D and get the clinical development plan and the forecast synched up . <p> Likewise , when studying clinical results , be sure to keep in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what your compound experiences in the market . <p> Unless you have rock-solid evidence that compliance and adherence are improved by this technology , do not bake it into the forecast , Gibson said . <p> Weve got to be as ruthless in value add as we are in safety and efficacy when it comes to looking at the forecasts for these compounds , he added . <p> In the end , Gibson urged forecasters to get back to basics . <p> Pipelines are weaker , patent expiries are keeping CEOs up at night , and payers and the FDA are more demanding than ever that your product be better than what 's on the market , he said . <p> If forecasters study past mistakes and work to overcome themby ensuring alignment with R&amp;D and payers and rigor with analoguesitll go a long way toward putting their current drugs in the best-practice bin . 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475 @qwx246475

@@24982911 @4982911/ <p> In early May , the FDA posted a warning letter to Novartis citing two unbranded websites for violating a raft of regulations , including promoting drugs for unapproved uses , failure to disclose associated risks , and making unsubstantiated dosing claims . <p> The warning letter raised a red flag for companies throughout the industry with unbranded websites , many of whom worried their own sites might be next . <p> I keep telling my clients this is not the end of the day for the unbranded website , says Kristin Keller , executive vice president of Compass Healthcare Communications , an interactive marketing agency that specializes in online communication . <p> Do n't  freak out , there 's nothing new here . The only thing that happened was that those guys were sloppy . <p> A study from Manhattan Research released the same week as the Novartis incident suggests that unbranded websites , while operating in accordance with all regulations , can still create a valuable resource for consumers seeking disease-related information and an equally valuable marketing tool for a brand in that disease category . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies varies greatly by disease category and product situation , says Maureen Malloy , lead author of the Manhattan Research report . <p> But under the right circumstances , this type of investment can support lead generation , relationship marketing , and awareness and education initiatives . <p> When to go unbranded <p> One key to getting an unbranded site right is to make sure you actually need it . <p> In an online world saturated with content , redundant material does n't  go far no matter how many marketing dollars a company might funnel towards it . <p> Keller says the first obvious marketing scenario for an unbranded site is when your product is the leader in its class and there 's a need for disease education and driving diagnosis . <p> Information on the site does n't  need to be directly linked to therapy because , as the leader in the class , you 'll naturally benefit from heightened awareness . <p> On the other hand , if you 're a statin that has 15 percent of the market , there 's zero need to develop an unbranded website to educate people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market leaders , the Lipitors and the Crestors , invest in that sort of initiative , says Keller . <p> In the end , they 're the ones who will benefit regardless of who runs the site . <p> A second reason to consider an unbranded site is if you 're in a disease state that struggles with compliance issues . <p> An unbranded site like J&amp;Js Children with Diabetes can offer education , support , and tools around managing therapies . <p> The third scenario is when you 're trying to introduce or increase diagnosis of an overlooked disease . <p> IGF-1 deficiency , for example , is a subset of growth hormone deficiency that rarely gets diagnosed . <p> Compass Healthcare is currently developing an education website for Ipsen that will help increase awareness . <p> Keller : The site will say to parents , Hey , if your kids not responding to traditional growth treatment , make sure you get screened for this enzyme deficiency because its often overlooked and your kid may have it . <p> Devising and implementing an unbranded strategy <p> The first step in devising an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nearly every disease state has an established social media community through Yahoo ! groups or an association website . <p> Keller recommends listening to what these groups have to say and analyzing the community dynamicwhats important to them , what do they lack , what 's their tolerance for a manufacturer entering their community ? <p> Keller says , Some of them are extremely open and say , Yes , do whatever you can . Others say , Stay out of it ; we do n't  want you a part of this . And some are mistrustful but willing to communicate if you do n't  push a brand at them . So its critical to listen . <p> Once you assess the needs of the community and gain its support , its time to build the site , which will vary greatly in content and style depending on its usagepre-launch awareness campaign , ongoing disease information , webinar series , etc . <p> Regardless of its final form , Keller offers two bits of advice once the site is established . <p> First , stick with it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gung-ho one moment and absent the next . <p> Second , take advantage of it . <p> You 're foolish if you do n't  use the community to market branded messages as long as you provide full disclosure and fair balance . <p> Its crazy how many people miss that strategy component , says Keller . <p> They invest in property , they get all this traffic there , they spend money on media and search , and yet they do n't  bother capturing people . Why wouldnt you ? <p> Unbranded success <p> Manhattan Researchs study found that 35 percent of online consumers for pharma info used an unbranded website in 2009 , and that most consumers are interested in ( rather than mistrustful of ) unbranded sites . <p> Keller points to a number of success stories , including the pku.com community site for BioMarin and the Acromegaly Answers blog and webinar series for Ipsen . <p> Acromegaly is a syndrome that causes gigantism and affects everything from body features to heart function . <p> Keller and her team analyzed the Acromegaly social media space and discovered that patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead they needed expert advice as it related to disease management and life coping skills . <p> So Compass Healthcare created an unbranded patient-facing blogone of the first in pharmathat hosted a series of guest authors , from reimbursement specialists to physicians to patient advocates to nurses . <p> The result was increased understanding for patients and exposure for Ipsens drug . <p> If the situation is right , an unbranded site can allow a company to become a truly engaged member of a community , says Keller . <p> It creates a level of intimacy and dialogue that a branded site simply can not . <p> An unbranded approach tends to be more humanizing than a product approach , seconds Malloy . <p> You 're connecting with patients in a less sales-y way . Ultimately its more personal and condition-focused. 46477 @qwx246477 46473 @qwx246473 46476 @qwx246476 46475
