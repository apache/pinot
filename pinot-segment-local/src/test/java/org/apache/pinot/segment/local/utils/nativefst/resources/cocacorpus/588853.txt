Whether you are looking for a new Ultra Lightweight Titanium Wheelchair or a Titanium Sports Wheelchair , Sportaid 's price and selection are rivaled only by our customer service , and we mean to leave you feeling like a winner every time ! <p> Titanium wheelchairs have long been known as the luxury models of the manual wheelchair world . Ultra-light , flexible and comfortable , titanium offers unmatched durability and beauty . <p> The main benefit of titanium as a frame material is its incredibly light weight . Titanium is extremely strong , so very little metal is needed to form the tubes that make up the frame . Using less metal without sacrificing resilience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than half the weight of aluminum . Most titanium chairs weigh under 20lbs , and some ultra-lights weigh as little as 11lbs . <p> The light weight of a titanium chair means it is easier to propel , and that means less user fatigue . If you have limited upper body mobility or strength , or just spend a lot of time on your wheels , titanium is the ideal choice . It will let you go farther without getting tired and will reduce stress and strain on your aching shoulders at the end of the day . In a lighter chair , more energy from each push will be transferred into forward motion instead of being used against the inertia and friction of a heavier chair . Lighter chairs also stop quicker , which adds to improved responsiveness and maneuverability . For many clients this is a definite plus , depending on their lifestyle and needs . Of course , a lighter chair is also much easier to lift and wrangle in and out of a car , if you use both for transport . <p> Another main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the strongest materials available , but it is also resistant to rust or corrosion . Titanium does not get brittle and fatigued with time and use like other metals . So for you , this means less upkeep , less chance of a broken chair needing repairs , and a chair that is easy to keep clean . Years after purchase , a titanium chair will still shine and look brand new . And who has time to wait for repairs or replacement of a broken wheelchair ? When you depend on your wheelchair , titanium offers you unmatched reliability . <p> Finally titanium is slightly more flexible as a material than aluminum and definitely more so than steel . This means the frame will absorb and dampen vibrations from the road during use , leading to a much smoother ride . Users who are sensitive to jarring will find titanium a huge improvement , and any user can benefit from more comfortable use of their wheelchair . Reduced vibrations make your chair more efficient , and that can lower user fatigue as well , making it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort during your day . <p> Titanium chairs are a positive investment for many wheelchair users . If you frequently have to lift your chair for transport , have limited upper body strength , or just want a durable and more comfortable chair , titanium is a great choice .

The competition ca n't hold wheel to the Trionic Veloped Trek Walker in the city , on the hiking trail , the golf course , in the park and around the summer house . The Trionic Veloped Trek Walker 's unique design puts a great deal of focus on walking and promotes activity and quality of life . The Trionic Walker is designed with a great focus on walking .

To make transport easy , the walker can be folded together and also partly dismounted . A hub brake with motion and parking brake functions delivers increased safety and causes minimal tire wear . Trionic Walker has an ergonomic grip bar that offers several grip positions , and while seated it acts as a back support . Walking space can be increased by sliding the seat forward , and in combination with the shape of the grip bar the tendency to walk with a more upright posture increases . Trionic Walker is tested and approved according to ISO 11199-2:2005 . <p> Climbing Wheel <p> Trionic Walker is equipped with Trionic Climbing wheel ( patent pending ) that greatly increases the ability to overcome different kinds of obstacles . By spreading the load over two wheels , slightly displaced lengthwise , the climbing sequence is divided into two steps . The climbing capacity is furthermore enhanced through an angled link arm that uses the pushing force provided by the user . This gives the wheel a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb . When climbing a 1.5 inch high obstacle , the amount of force needed is only 1/8 of the force that a single wheel of an equal diameter requires .

It has allowed me to hike some trails again which I thought were no longer possible and also do things which I thought I would never do again like walking along the beach with my family . While it might be a little expensive the additional freedom which it has given me is invaluable . <p> Advantages : It is very stable , easy to take apart and has great storage . <p> Disadvantages : The only disadvantage which I have found is that it is pretty wide which is needed for the stability but that makes it hard to go on some narrow trails . 154421 @qwx1014421 154420 @qwx1014420

A reputation as the world 's lightest wheelchair wheelset is not lightly awarded , and that is part what makes the Topolino Carbon Core WX2.5 so special . The unbelievable light weight of Topolino 's Carbon Core WX2.5 meshes with impressive durability and strength as inspired by high performance bicycle wheel technology . Put into perspective , the Topolino Carbon Core WX2.5 weighs only 1.3 pounds each . ( not including tire or handrim ) <p> Added Efficiency . WX2.5 wheels roll more easily and are easier to push . Mobility increases and fatigue diminishes with reduced effort . <p> Discover better health . Smooth and easy rolling means less stress on arms and shoulders , which often leads to repetitive motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WX2.5 wheels are easier to transport . Removing or breaking down a wheelchair often involves awkward lifting and arranging . <h> Taking Advantage Of Today 's Materials <p> The hybrid construction of Kevlar and carbon fibers within a thermoplastic resin matrix go toward the spokes .

Topolino 's composite spoke material demonstrates more strength than a 14g stainless steel spoke at only one-fifth the weight . <h> Light Weight Is Only The Beginning <p> The thermoplastic resin and Kevlar/carbon fibers combine well to significantly dampen road vibration , making a difference you can feel . Conventional steel spokes transmit vibration very efficiently , a quality that makes for great guitar strings .

This reduces spoke stress at the hub and allows the continuous unbroken fibers in the spoke to span clear across the wheel . <p> With conventional steel spokes , the spokes are not well matched to the hub flange . As any wheel builder knows , steel spokes must be manually bent near the flange and forced into alignment to direct the spoke toward the rim . <p> This creates a flex point in the spoke and it is this flex and squirm of that is one of the main causes of spoke breakage due to fatigue . <p> In contrast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral unit to fully support each spoke within the hub flange . Even within the hub , each spoke is perfectly aligned with its span to the rim . Thus , the spokes are held in pure tension , with none of the fatigue-inducing movement or flex that is characteristic of conventional steel spokes . <h> Modular Construction <p> In the real world , stuff happens . Crashes can sometimes occur , potholes sometimes ca n't be avoided , and some of us have even been known to back into the garage without taking the bike off the roof . Even though we packed a whole bunch of technology and innovation into these wheels , they were designed to be repairable and to exist in the real world . Topolino 's unique spokes and hub are built as modular " wheel halves " that are laced to the rim in a conventional fashion . This means that , if a wheel does become damaged ( in a crash , for instance ) , the individual parts are all replaceable using conventional tools and the wheel may be easily rebuilt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't use ' em . All of our amazing technology and innovation would be short-lived unless the wheels were built to the most exacting standards . Our skilled wheel-builders have many years of experience in their craft . Each Topolino wheel is fully built by hand and every spoke is tuned an gauged for perfectly balanced tension . We have even developed proprietary processes to insure that all of the spokes are specially pre-stressed and settled . In fact , we have the most exacting standards of final spec in the industry . The net result ? A wheel that is perfectly true and round and built to stay that way . <p> If you need to send us a wheel for repair , please contact Topolino directly .

I have had my 2nd TiLite ZR bought from SportAid , Jimbo helps with detailed tricky stuff , he can be short on patience but he knows his stuff . My ZR is 4 months old now and the new back folding assembly is much better than the old one , the one sided fork is better , its got a rubber bumper ring so you do n't scratch furniture so badly . I drive Vetts and Benz SL 's and the body is the lightest best feeling Ti body I have ever used . If your getting your 1st " non-adjusting chair " You can not do better . The large tubing is great to grab when transferring , feels better than smaller tubing . 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn out . Again , talk to Jimbo if this is your 1st " SET " adjustment TiLite .
