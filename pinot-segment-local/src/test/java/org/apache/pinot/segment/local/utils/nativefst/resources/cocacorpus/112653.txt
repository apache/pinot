@@41806388 @1806388/ 3155 @qwx413155 <p> Bullnose tile is recognizable because of its characteristic rounded edges . It 's viewed as an edge treatment or trim piece , and is often used to cover corners or frame the perimeter of a tile design . This eliminates sharper angles and unfinished tile sides from being visible on your floor or wall . Many tile designs are also available with matching bullnose tiles . Here 's what you need to know in order to add this type of tile to your design . <p> Applications of Bullnose Tile <p> Bullnose tiles have a wide variety of applications . Here are a few examples : <p> Walls : If you 're tiling a backsplash or accent wall , unfinished edges that do n't match up with the wall will be visible . Placing a row of bullnose tiles around the perimeter of your design yields a more finished look . To determine the types of bullnose tiles that are available , check out the trim pieces that match the tile you choose . <p> Floors : A row of bullnose tiles can take the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished look . This added moisture protection will also help to preserve the bottom portion of your walls . <p> Corners : Bullnose tiles can also be used to smooth out sharp edges on tub surrounds or countertops . The outermost edges of shampoo niches can also be finished with bullnose rather than standard tile . And for bathrooms that feature a tiled privacy wall , bullnose tile can be used to soften sharper edges . This will not only streamline the overall design , but will also help to protect anyone who brushes up against the wall . <p> Decorative trim : Bullnose tiles can also be used as decorative trim or on the top of a half-tiled accent wall . <p> Different Types of Bullnose Tile <p> Standard bullnose tiles come with one rounded edge . However , in some cases , you 'll need a bullnose tile that has more than one rounded corner . For example , the corners of a tiled wall may require a rounded edge on the top and side for a finished look . Double bullnose tiles have two rounded edges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . <p> Measuring Bullnose Tile <p> Bullnose tiles are often sold individually , and they must be measured carefully . Sketching your tile design ahead of time may help you visualize where you 'll need to use bullnose tiles . When you 're ready to measure , determine the length of the tiled area , such as a backsplash or tiled accent wall , where unfinished edges will show . Next , check the tile specifications for the design you 've chosen and note the length of the bullnose tiles that match . For example , if the bullnose tiles are available in 12-inch-long sizes , then you would need one for each foot you measure . For a baseboard-type border , you 'll need to measure the open wall space and count on placing one row of bullnose tiles around the room . For instance , a simple 10-by-6-foot room would require 32 bullnose tiles if each tile is 12 inches ( one for each foot of wall space ) . <p> Bullnose tiles are a great option for finishing your tile design and hiding rough edges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well when used as a baseboard or as decorative trim .

Daltile recommends that you refer to our product catalog for a detailed explanation of each test and the industry recommendations for performance given your unique application needs . Coefficient of Friction Coefficient of Friction ( " COF ) is the relative slip resistance of tile . The COF test disclosed by Dal-Tile is a laboratory or field test established by the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of its floor tiles . The measurements disclosed are designed to be one important factor to consider in evaluating slip resistance . Other factors can affect slip resistance , such as the degree of wear on the shoe and flooring material ; presence of foreign material , such as water , oil and dirt ; the length of the human stride at the time of slip ; type of floor finish ; and the physical and mental condition of humans . The higher the COF , the more slip resistant the tile . OSHA requires a 0.50 COF for walkways and the A.D.A . recommends a 0.60 for accessible routes and 0.80 for ramps . Scratch hardness of a tile refers to the exterior surface of the tile and how easily it will mar . It is therefore not a big issue for wall tile but is for floors and countertops . The higher the number the better . A value of 7 or greater is normally recommended for commercial applications . Abrasion Resistance measures the hardness of the glaze and measures the overall durability of the tile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The classes range from Class 0 ( not recommended for floors ) to Class 4 ( heavy commercial floor ) . Water Absorption measures the susceptibility of the body of the tile to absorb water . Tiles range from impervious ( less than 0.5% ) to Non-Vitreous ( more than 7.0% ) . Exterior applications will require an impervious tile . The water absorption may impact the installation method , as well . Although this test is used primarily to evaluate glazed and unglazed product , it is sometimes used as a good indicator to predict the stain resistance of unglazed tiles . Generally , for unpolished , unglazed tile , the lower the water absorption the greater the stain resistance . Breaking Strength measures the expected load bearing capacity of various installations . The higher the breaking strength , the stronger and more durable the tile . Chemical Resistance measures the resistance of the tile to various chemicals .

@@41806403 @1806403/ <p> Contaminants and spills on a glazed ceramic tile are , generally , easier to clean than most other unglazed ceramic and porcelain surfaces . Glazed tile products should be cleaned routinely with an all-purpose , low VOC household or commercial cleaner . The product chosen should also be grout joint cleaning compatible . The type of product may vary depending on the tile application and use . A multipurpose spray cleaner , which removes soap scum , hard water deposits , and mildew designed for every day use , can be used on wall tile areas in residential baths and showers . <p> The entire area should be cleaned and scrubbed with cleaner solution through the use of a cotton mop , cloth , sponge , or non-metallic brush . The entire area should be rinsed with clean water to remove any cleaning solution residue . Remember that you should sweep or vacuum floor areas prior to cleaning to remove any dust or debris . Routine cleaners should never contain hazardous or polluting products including , but not limited to acids or ammonia . Acids can damage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia can discolor the grout . <p> Unglazed tile should be cleaned routinely with concentrated tile cleaners that have a neutral pH for safe regular use .

The product chosen should also be compatible with cleaning the grout joints at the same time . <p> Removal of Sealers/Waxes/Floor Finishes : <p> If you need to remove a topical sealer or floor wax from a ceramic tile you should use a Tile Sealer &amp; Adhesive remover . Always test a small area first . Apply a liberal amount of undiluted sealer &amp; adhesive remover to a manageable area . Allow setting without drying until coating or residue softens . Reapply if necessary until sealer softens and can be removed . If necessary , agitate with white nylon scrub pad . Wipe up the residue with a cotton towel or sponge . Rinse thoroughly with clean water . Do not use on natural stone products . <p> Glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning compound recommended for either glass or tile <p> Always test in small inconspicuous area while using a new cleaner to ensure compatibility . <p> Ceramic Tile - Grout Care <p> Grout is the material used to fill the spaces between the individual tiles . Grout comes in many colors . While color is important to the final finished look of the tile installation , it has little effect on the functionality of the grout . The purpose of grout is , simply , to fill the joint between the tiles and becomes a permanent , integral component of the finished installation . <p> Penetrating/Impregnating Sealer : <p> Most tile installations use cementitious grouts . This type of grout should be sealed after installation to prevent the color from staining . The grout should be sealed with a penetrating/impregnating sealer ( often called grout sealers ) which does not contain silicone , as silicone can shorten the useful life of the sealer . Epoxy grouts , conversely , are chemically cured and acid resistant and , as a result , do not require a sealer . The application of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cementitious grout will not change the natural color of the grout , but will prevent the penetration of moisture , simplify maintenance , and help prevent staining or discoloration . Only the grout needs to be sealed , not glazed floor or wall tiles . Grout can be sealed seventy-two hours after installation . <p> There are different grades of penetrating/impregnating sealers , therefore the useful life and price will differ between a low quality and high quality sealer . You may need to reapply the sealer on an annual basis depending on the sealer quality , traffic patterns , and maintenance routine . Some sealers have multiple year warranties for useful life . Refer to the manufacturer warranty , technical &amp; product information for specific details on product installation , useful life , and product applications ( including any warnings ) before use . <p> Grout Maintenance : <p> Neither sealing the grout nor using a 100% Epoxy Grout will guarantee against surface build-up or discoloration of the grout . Grout needs to be cleaned on a periodic basis to remove any surface build-up . Routine grout cleaning can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the application . When heavy duty grout cleaning is required , you will need to use a professional strength Tile &amp; Grout Cleaner that is capable of removing grease , soap scum , body oil , mildew stains , algae , and synthetic or acrylic waxes from the grout joints . However , such a product should contain non-polluting chemicals and low VOC levels . This type of product can be purchased from most Home Centers , or through your local professional Floor Covering Dealer . <p> Grout Color Restoration : <p> When grout has been stained to the point that it can not be maintained or returned to its natural color , you can return the grout back to its original color or any other color through the use of a " grout stain " . Grout Stains are epoxy-based products that are specifically designed to penetrate into the grout and seal the surface with a permanent color . Once the grout has been stained there is no need to seal it any further with a penetrating/impregnating sealer . Prior to staining , the grout joint should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease or sealers with a professional strength Tile &amp; Grout Cleaner . This can be purchased from most Home Centers or through your local Professional Floor Covering Dealer . <p> Ceramic Tile - New Installations <p> Post-Grout Clean-Up : <p> Grout haze is a film that has been left behind on the surface of the tile as part of the final grouting process . Usually this is buffed off the surface after the grout has achieved its initial 12 to 24 hour cure . The removal of the haze is often difficult when buffing with a clean rag or floor machine . Cementitious grout haze can be successfully removed with " Sulfamic " acid , which is a mild acid that attacks and breaks down cement smears . There are several products on the market called grout haze removers , which usually contain Sulfamic acid . Sulfamic acid can also be purchased in powder form and mixed with water to different strengths by qualified professionals . Similarly , 100% Solids Epoxy Grout haze can be removed with an Epoxy Haze Remover . These removers are formulated to safely and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique formulation will soften most epoxy hazes for easy removal without damaging the grout or tile , usually in one application . Sulfamic acid or grout removers should never be used on Natural Stone products . <p> Natural Stone - Routine Care <p> Natural Stone Care &amp; Maintenance <p> To insure your natural stone products will provide you with a lifetime of aesthetics and utility , a proper maintenance program is crucial . Natural Stone products are porous by nature and require a different maintenance program than traditional ceramic tile . <p> Natural stone requires a different maintenance routine than traditional , man-made ceramic tile . Many of the cleaners acceptable for use on ceramic tile can stain , damage or dull stone . Dirt and dust will scratch the surface of stone . Therefore , stone floors should be vacuumed or dust mopped frequently to remove abrasive agents from the stone surface . Natural stone should be cleaned with neutral cleaners . Stone cleaners should never contain acid or bleach . Acids , even a light solution of vinegar and water , will etch and eventually damage natural stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for cleaning stone . These cleaners contain no acids and are concentrated neutral pH cleaners that will not affect existing sealers or wax-type coatings . The surface of the stone should be dampened with clear water . This will keep the cleaning solution on the surface so it can be effective . A solution of the cleaner and water missed to manufacturer instructions should be applied to the stone surface with a sponge or mop . On walls , kitchen counters or vanity tops , a spray bottle can be used to apply the cleaning solution . Allow sitting for manufacturers specified amount of time ( usually 3 to 5 minutes ) . Agitate with a sponge , synthetic mop , soft bristle brush or through the use of a floor-scrubbing machine . Mop up dirty solution and buff dry . <p> Once the stone has been cleaned , you can periodically apply a Spray-Buff wax-type floor finish to enhance the beauty and luster of polished stone ( including countertops ) .

An optimal heavy-duty cleaner should contain low percentages of volatile organic compounds . These cleaning products are concentrated and designed to deep clean the stone without damaging it . Apply the solution of the cleaner and water mixed to manufacturer instructions to the stone surface with a sponge or mop . Allow setting for manufacturer-specified amount of time . Agitate with a sponge , synthetic mop , and soft bristle brush or through the use of a floor-scrubbing machine . Mop up dirty solution and buff dry .

After cleaning you may apply the Spray-Buff wax-type floor finish to enhance the natural shine . <p> CAUTION : Poultice may dull the shine of the polished stone . If this occurs you will need to use a marble polish to restore the natural shine . <p> Restoration : <p> If a marble finish has become dull , scratched or etched , you can restore the natural shine through the use of a marble polish . Some marble polishes are available in kits . The process can be enhanced with the use of floor buffing machines . The process is generally a re-crystallization process to remove fine scratches and restore the original shine and polish to the stone . This is not an application of a topical sealer or wax to cover-up damaged or worn surfaces . <p> Natural Stone - New Installations <p> Sealing is strongly recommended for newly installed marble and other natural stone to provide maximum below surface stain protection . Consult your Professional Floor Covering Dealer or Home Center Store to ensure that you select a high quality sealer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been installed and grouted , the new installation should be covered with brown paper to protect it from debris during the remaining construction process . The protective brown paper should remain in place until construction is completed and the area is opened to intended ( post-construction ) use . <p> Pre-grout Sealing : <p> A non-sanded grout is strongly recommended for natural stone installations due to the narrow grout joints customarily preferred . This type of grout has very fine particles of cement , polymers and color pigments that can penetrate the microscopic pores of the stone surface where they become trapped and appear as a stain in the stone . Therefore , all travertine , slate , tumbled stone and honed/flamed/unpolished granite should be sealed prior to the grouting process to protect them from staining . The application of a good quality sealer should be used as a grout sealer and applied again as the final sealing process once the installation is finished . <p> Sealing : <p> A premium natural look penetrating/impregnating sealer is the normal choice on polished or honed marble , limestone , granite , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stone enhancer sealer is often used on tumbled , antique stones or on slate where a darker , enriched or highlighted character is desired .

They are , generally , suitable for interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years . <p> Always reference manufacturer 's literature for specific information on the duration of the sealer 's protection and make sure that the sealer is applied in strict accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions . <p> Finishing : <p> A stone floor finish should be applied to a polished natural stone floor only . This type of product will help enhance the shine and provide a protective coating for " soft " or polished marbles . Verify the finish is a wax-type finish designed to add luster and enhance the beauty of sealed and polished natural stone only . A topical finish may change the appearance and performance of your stone , so always test a small area first . Application of topical sealer or wax should never be done as an attempt to add a shine to a honed , scratched or non-polished stone product . This will only create maintenance and/or slip resistance problem . <p> Saltillo Tile - Routine Care <p> Soft clay tiles are categorized as specialty use products , and as such they are generally not governed by the same requirements as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some type of topical sealer protection . These sealers are designed to provide stain resistance and a durable finish to protect clay tile against wear . Pre-sealing the tile prior to grouting will act as a pre-grout sealer , provided it is applied over a clean tile surface . An additional final coat over the grouted floor will complete the sealing process along with providing the final grout stain protection . <p> There are two common types of sealers used today for sealing specialty tiles . The first is a water-based blend of acrylic polymers . This product allows for moisture vapor transmission , and it can be reapplied over itself , without stripping or removing the old sealer when the original application has become worn . The second type is a solvent-based sealer . Solvent-based sealers are not as forgiving after they have become worn , they must be stripped and removed prior to reapplication . Both types should be UV stable , which means the ultra violet rays from the sun should not break them down .

Tile installation mistakes are hard to cover up and fixing them usually means ripping up the floor and starting over . <p> Hiring a professional installer is a great idea , especially if you have a complicated pattern or special edging . But locating the right installer may not be as easy as it seems . Did you know that tile installers can have certifications and be members of a national association ? Clearly some installers are more qualified than others . <p> Here are 10 things you should avoid if you want to find a high-quality tile installer . <h> DO N'T take up offers from your handyman , carpenter , or other non-expert . <p> It 's nice to have someone around who can handle odds and ends of home repair and improvement . But your tile fdoes n't all into this category . Find someone with at least three years of experience installing tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile . <p> Large home centers work with customers like you all day long and may not have their finger on the pulse of current installation methods and those educated in them .. Instead , go to someone who works with contractors , installers , architects , and designers regularly like tile stores or showrooms " they have more experience working directly with qualified installers . <p> Consider talking to a commercial contractor . The vast majority of tile goes into commercial buildings and if you can talk to a commercial contractor , you 'll get advice from some of the most experienced tile professionals . <h> DO N'T assume your installer is licensed , certified , or insured . <p> Always check to see that your prospective installer is certified , licensed , and has current insurance . Membership in the NTCA ( National Tile Contractors Association ) is a necessity for a pro-grade job . Also check out whether your prospective installer has training through the Ceramic Tile Education Foundation ( CTEF ) . The CTEF provides training and assessments for installers and certifies they are equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> DO N'T skip asking the important questions . <p> You know what they say about enquiring minds . A few well-placed questions can help you find out a lot about prospective installers . Do n't forget to ask key questions : <p> How long will the project take ? How much tile is needed ? How many people will be working on the project ? Have you worked on projects like this before ( large format tile , wood look , etc . ) <h> DO N'T move forward without seeing the installer 's work . <p> A picture is worth a thousand words . Ask to see pictures of completed work with an eye for quality . Look closely through the portfolio and you 'll be able to tell the work of a good installer from a great installer . <p> There should be even spacing between tiles and perfectly straight grout lines . Look to see that the layout is balanced and that any cut tiles are the same size even if they are on opposite ends of the room . Pay attention to windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work around and should be a good indication of the skill level of the tile installer . Walk away if you see large gaps , too much grout , or any ill-fitting tile . <h> DO N'T forget to learn from others ' experience . <p> Keep an ear to the ground when checking out a potential installer . Ask for testimonials , search for reviews online . Give special attention to reviews with pictures so you can verify his or her work . Follow up with references and get familiar with the installer 's M.O . <h> DO N'T underestimate the value of organization . <p> Tile installation requires a lot of organization . An installer has to work efficiently because mortars , adhesives , and grout dry quickly and messiness can cause problems . If you can , try to watch your prospective installer at work or at least see his or her work space . <p> An organized work site has tiles prepared and stacked . Cuts have already been made and you might even see a map or plan of the pattern . An excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the dust and mess down inside . Plastic to protect surfaces near the installation or sealing the work area off from the rest of the house indicates a particularly mindful and considerate installer . <h> DO N'T forget to get it in writing . <p> Once you 've found a tile installer that meets your expectations , ask for a bid in writing . You might need to ask an architect to draw up the exact specs of your room and the pattern and layout you want . You 'll get a more accurate estimate and show your installer that you 're serious about a job well done . <p> A good installer is n't afraid to guarantee his or her work . Get a written guarantee that the work will be free from leaks and other issues . You should expect a guarantee that covers you for about two years . <h> DO N'T buy the tile yourself . <p> There are a lot of technicalities and ratings that your installer will understand better than you . You do n't want to end up with tile that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her handle the purchase of the tile . Plus , when you let your installer handle the tile , you wo n't be responsible for any problems with the materials . It will fall under your installer 's guarantee . <h> DO N'T devalue professionalism . <p> Even in this increasingly casual and do-it-yourself world , professionalism is still a hallmark of an excellent business . It is important that a prospective installer delivers that bid on time . A simple thing like whether the installer gets involved in the community can say a lot about how your project will be handled . The way they appear , speak , and interact all hint at the experience ahead for you and your project . <p> Avoid a tile disaster and call in the professionals .

@@41806406 @1806406/ <h> What is Natural Stone ? <p> Natural Stone is not manufactured ; it is a product of nature . Blocks are removed from the quarry , slabs are cut from these blocks , and the slabs are further fabricated into the final stone to be installed . Each block is different ; each slab is different . Skillful blending or matching of the dimension stone blocks , veneer panels , tops , etc. , results in a beautiful blending of nature 's variety and man 's design . In contrast to the uniformity of materials produced by machine or assembly line , stone 's naturally varied appearance has wonderful character . " Uniformity of material , " when applied to natural stone , is a term of relative value that needs to be understood when making a selection . <h> What is Granite ? <p> Granite is the most popular stone type used in countertop applications today . Granites are some of the hardest of the common countertop stones , offering high levels of resistance to abrasion and scratching . Granites are made up of several different minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartz , feldspars , biotite , amphibole , ferrous titanium oxides , and other mineral combinations . Limestone is a sedimentary stone with at least 50% calcite or calcium carbonate content . Almost all limestone is composed of grains or fragments of biologic origin , ranging from fossils to dinosaur bones . Most limestone is marine in origin , composed of micro-sized fossils of marine organisms like the shells found on most beaches . It is very common to find pieces of shells in limestone tiles . <h> What is Marble and Onyx ? <p> Marble is a metamorphic rock predominantly consisting of calcite , dolomite and crystals . Onyx originates from deposits of limestone caverns , where it forms stalactites and stalagmites . Onyx is formed by gentle , dripping water movement and may envelop terrestrial fossil remains . Since onyxes are formed by a process of crystallization , they are considered part of the marble family . Marbles and Onyxes typically have a diverse aesthetic appeal , accentuated by distinct veining and often bold colors . They are relatively softer than granite . Marbles can be scratched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards and other protective measures . Marbles can also be etched by chemical attack . Since these stones are calcium carbonate-based , they can be damaged by exposure to acidic solutions such as lemon juice , tomatoes , vinegar , etc . The use of inappropriate cleaning agents may also trigger acidic attack . Acidic solutions can permanently etch the surface of the material . The application of a sealer will reduce , but not eliminate , the vulnerability to acidic attack . For these reasons , marbles and onyxes are not recommended for use in kitchens , however they can be a good selection for bathroom vanities for example . <h> What is Slate ? <p> Slate is a metamorphic rock exhibiting " slaty " cleavage , which allows it to be split in thin sheets . Slate is formed in the water of rivers and ponds from clay accumulating in thin , flat layers at the bottom of these waterbeds . Slates are softer than granite and therefore vulnerable to scratching and abrasion . Slate has a natural cleft ( not a smooth surface ) . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to slates . <h> What is Travertine ? <p> Travertine is a calcium-based stone . Travertine is generated by the deposit of calcium carbonate resulting from water springs and streams running through the stone . Every time a drop in pressure or change of temperature occurs , the water releases carbon dioxide as gas , much like carbonated beverages . This gas causes holes to form in the travertine . These natural pores are still going to be present once the blocks are cut into tiles . The amount of holes depends by how compact each travertine type is and it varies greatly by the type of travertine . The pores present in the tiles can be filled with a paste made of cement and pigments . However , it is important to note that these void spaces are a distinctive character of travertine tiles and they are always going to be present to a certain extent . <h> What is Polished Finish ? <p> A mirror-like , glossy surface that brings out the color and character of the stone to its fullest , because it optimally reflects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvety smooth surface with little or no gloss . The degree of honing depends on the stone , but may vary from light to heavy . <h> What is Tumbled Finish ? <p> A weathered , aging finish achieved when the stone is tumbled with sand , pebbles , or steel bearings . Tumbled stone may present chipped edges and imperfections created by the tumbling process . These characteristics give the stone more of a worn , old look . <h> What is Antique Brushed Finish ? <p> A finish that replicates rustic or distressed textures . This finish tries to replicate the naturally occurring effects of the aging process . <h> What is Natural Cleft mean ? <p> This term usually refers to slate stones . It means a cleavage face formed when the stone is split into any thickness . <h> What does Gauged mean ? <p> This term usually refers to slate stones . It refers to the process through which slate tiles are all calibrated to a specific thickness . <h> How much material do I need to order for my job ? <p> Before making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make certain there will be enough material to complete the project . An often-forgotten fact is that the material from a quarry today may be different from what was available six months ago . Further , there may be more than one quarry of the material . It is always recommended to order what is typically referred to as " attic stock " , a little amount of material to be kept on the side if future repairs are needed . <h> How do I achieve the best from a Natural Stone installation ? <p> The final look of mixed tiles may fall short of appearance expectations , especially if the stone is variegated and veined . The installer should mix tiles from different boxes during the installation to achieve a more even , visually pleasing result in the finished surface . The homeowner should always look at the natural stone with the installer before the installation takes place . Moreover , it is highly recommended that the homeowner gets involved and discusses the stone layout with the installer in details to prevent misunderstandings from occurring . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use coasters under all glasses , particularly those containing alcohol or citrus juices . Many common foods and drinks contain acids that will etch or dull the surface of many stones . Do not place hot items directly on the stone surface . Use trivets or mats under hot dishes and placemats under china , ceramics , silver or other objects that can scratch the surface . <h> How do I care for my Natural Stone floor ? <p> Dust mop interior floors frequently using a clean non-treated dry dust mop . Sand , dirt and grit do the most damage to natural stone surfaces due to their abrasiveness . Mats or area rugs inside and outside an entrance will help to minimize the sand , dirt and grit that will scratch the stone floor . Be sure that the underside of the mat or rug is a non-slip surface . Normally , it will take a person about eight steps on a floor surface to remove sand or dirt from the bottom of their shoes . Do not use vacuum cleaners that are worn . The metal or plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do I prevent staining on Natural Stone ? <p> Most stones are porous and readily absorb liquids and moisture . Materials like limestone and sandstone are extremely absorbent , whereas granites and serpentine ( green marble ) are denser , but will still absorb liquids that are allowed to remain in contact with them for extended periods of time . The use of a sealer will help prevent staining in most situations . Even a sealed surface can stain if left in contact with a staining agent for a long period of time . Therefore , all spills should be wiped up as soon as possible , and coasters or napkins should be set when serving food or drinks on a stone bar , table , or counter top . Soft drinks , coffee , tea , and fruit juices contain mild acids and can etch the polished surface of a stone and stain quite rapidly . These should be cleaned off immediately with mild soap and warm water . <h> What is a Sealer ? <p> A sealer cures as a film on the stone surface . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stone surface may be altered by the application of this type of product . This material will provide somewhat of a sacrificial layer over the stone , and will absorb most of the wear on the countertop . Since the sealer is softer than the stone , normal use of the countertop will result in abrasion of the sealer surface and dictate reapplication to maintain the original luster of the surface . A properly applied topical sealer will normally reduce , although not eliminate , the vulnerability of calcareous stones to attack from mildly acidic solutions . <p> General Precautions . When any surface protection product is used , care must be taken to read and follow the Manufacturer 's written instructions accurately . This will provide the greatest benefit from the application and will guarantee safe handling of the product . <h> How do I clean my Natural Stone tiles and slabs ? <p> Clean stone surfaces with a few drops of neutral PH stone cleaner available at retail stores or at your local tile and stone dealer , or a mild liquid dishwashing detergent and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft cloth for other surfaces for best results . Too much cleaner or soap may leave a film and cause streaks . Do not use products that contain lemon , vinegar or other acids on marble or limestone . Rinse the surface thoroughly after washing with the soap solution and dry with a soft cloth . Change the rinse water frequently . Do not use scouring powders or creams ; these products contain abrasives that may scratch the surface . <h> How do I care for my Natural Stone in wet areas ? <p> In the bath or other wet areas , soap scum can be minimized by using a squeegee after each use . To remove soap scum , use an approved non-acidic soap scum remover available at retail stores or at your local tile and stone dealer . <h> What should I do if spills occur on my Natural Stone ? <p> Blot the spill with a paper towel immediately . Do n't wipe the area , it will spread the spill . Flush the area with plain water and mild soap and rinse several times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessary . If the stain remains , refer to the question on stain removal . <h> If a stain occurs , how do I remove ? <p> If stains do occur , a stain remover may be required . Whereas , a cleaner will wash off surface dirt , a stain remover such as a poultice will actually act to draw out deep-seated dirt and stains from the stone 's pores . Several applications of a stain remover may be required for difficult stains , and darker marbles should be tested to make sure that the stain remover will not bleach the stone . For recurring problems , and/or a very deep stain , a professional stone fabricator should be contacted . Approved stain removers are available at retail stores or at your local tile and stone dealer . <h> What are DOs and DONTs for Natural Stone ? <p> DO Dust mop floors frequently <p> DO Clean surfaces with mild detergent or stone soap <p> DO Thoroughly rinse and dry the surface after washing <p> DO Blot up spills immediately <p> DO Protect floor surfaces with non-slip mats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or placemats <h> What do I do if fill is coming out of my travertine stone floor ? <p> After installation and throughout the life of the travertine floor , some of the fill may become loose depending on the foot traffic and/or because of sharp objects in constant contact with the floor ( for example , heels , dog toe nails , etc . ) . This is a natural occurrence and can be solved by re-filling the tiles where needed with a non-sanded grout .

DCOF AcuTestSM assesses products suitability for the commercial environment and the specific usability needs of the application . <h> A Measure of Friction <p> Friction is the force that resists the sliding motion of one surface against another . Contaminants , such as liquids , can alter the measurement of friction . There are two types of friction : static ( SCOF ) and dynamic ( DCOF ) .

Visit www.daltile.com/DCOF to learn more . <h> Water Absorption , ASTM C373-88 <p> Water absorption is measured using ASTM C373-88 . Individual tiles are weighed , saturated with water , then weighed again . The percent difference between the two conditions is referred to as the water absorption value . Tiles are classified according to water absorption percentages as follows : <p> Impervious <p> Tiles exhibiting 0.5% or less . <p> Vitreous <p> Tiles exhibiting more than 0.5%but not more than 3.0% . <p> Semi-Vitreous <p> Tiles exhibiting more than 3.0% but not more than 7.0% . <p> Non-Vitreous <p> Tiles exhibiting more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that should be addressed when selecting a tile . The test is performed by scratching the surface of the tile with different minerals and subjectively assigning a " MOH 's Scale Hardness " number to the glaze , the softest mineral used is talc ( " 1 " rating ) , the hardest is a diamond ( " 10 " rating ) . Other minerals of varying hardness provide Moh 's Scale Hardness values of 5 to 7 are suitable for most residential floor applications . A value of 7 or greater is normally recommended for commercial applications . <h> Breaking Strength Ceramic Tile , ASTM C648-04 <p> Ceramic tiles used on floors and walls must be able to withstand the expected load bearing capacity of various installations .

Dal-Tile recommends strict adherence to industry installation guidelines set forth in ANSI A108 , A118 and A136 . <h> Chemical Resistance , ASTM C650-04 <p> Chemical resistance is measured using ASTM C650-04 . A tile sample is placed in continuous contact with a variety of chemicals for 24 hours , rinsing the surface and then examining the surface for visible variation . <h> Abrasion Resistance , ASTM C1027-99 <p> The durability of glazed tile is measured , subjectively , by observing the visible surface abrasion of the tile when subjected to the ASTM C 1027-99 testing procedure . Dal-Tile evaluates glazed tile recommended for floor applications using this test method which includes the following classification system : <p> Medium to Light Traffic - Residential floor coverings in areas subject to soft-soled footwear or normal footwear traffic with small amounts of scratching dirt ( i.e. rooms in the living areas of homes except kitchens , entrances and other areas that may be subjected to high usage ) . <p> Class Three ( 3 ) ( Heavy Residential or Light Commercial ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may withstand normal footwear and regular traffic , with some dirt and/or other abrasives present in limited quantities . Tile in this class may be used in light commercial installations with limited foot traffic and with no direct access to the outside .

This includes outdoor areas . <p> Proper maintenance is critical . Improper maintenance and improper maintenance products can result in a build-up on the surface of the tile causing the tile to be slippery . See maintenance recommendations . <p> Test Methods - there are many different test methods related to slip resistance . The tile industry uses ANSI A137.1 Section 9.6 , also called the AcuTestTM . This method measures the dynamic coefficient of friction ( DCOF ) . Dal-Tile Corporation recommends that customers have tile independently tested to determine if the Dal-Tile Corporation product meets the requirements of the customer 's preferred test method ( if other than the AcuTest ) prior to product selection . Be sure to test competitors products under any preferred alternative method for comparison purposes . Dal-Tile Corporation does not warrant that any of its products will meet any testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ANSI A137.1 requires that tiles suitable for interior level spaces expected to be walked upon when wet have a wet DCOF =0.42 . <p> No floor tile is " slip proof . " <p> Slippery conditions can be reduced by limiting foot traffic in contaminated conditions , use of appropriate footwear , prompt removal of contaminants , effective drainage , and proper maintenance . Installations and end use conditions can vary . The end user must evaluate the tile to be used with their specific end use conditions , maintenance program(s) , and footwear selection to determine compatibility . <p> Tile sizes are a factor for slip resistance in wet areas . Smaller sizes allow for more drainage through an increased number of grout joints and easier sloping . Planar variations on larger formats could result in a higher probability of standing water and increase the risk for hydroplaning . <p> Polished and semi polished surfaces create a very smooth surface . Dal-Tile Corporation does not recommend polished surfaces in any areas subject to water , oil , or grease exposures . <p> Dal-Tile Corporation recommends the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program : <p> Level public areas that are likely to be walked on when WET . Some examples are ( but not limited to ) : Entry foyers of hotels , offices and other public buildings , supermarkets ( entry areas , food preparation , produce , or any area where water may occasionally be present ) , shopping center food courts , and toilet facilities , and production areas not involving oil or fats . <p> In addition to this ANSI category defined above , Dal-Tile Corporation also suggests using the following criteria . These are Dal-Tile Corporation recommendations for the specified floor applications and are not ANSI standards : <p> = 0.42 <p> Exterior Applications <p> Service or recreation areas involving constant water where light or no footwear is used . Some examples are ( but not limited to ) : public showers , steam rooms , swimming pool decks , and locker rooms . <p> = 0.60 <p> Pool Decking &amp; other wet areas with minimal footwear <p> Pedestrian areas that could be exposed to water ( excluding ice ) , but are otherwise reasonably maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not limited to ) : walkways , gazebos , or patio areas . <p> Oils <p> Service or production areas involving oils , greases , and/or fats .

Any damaged , loose or uneven areas must be repaired , patched and leveled . Remove any moldings , trim , appliances , etc. , which could interfere with installation . Door jambs may be undercut for tile to slip under . <h> Step 2 : Layout <p> Begin by marking the center point of all four walls . Snap chalk lines between the center points of opposite walls , which will intersect at the center of room . Make sure they 're perfectly square , and adjust if necessary . Next , lay out a row of loose tiles along the center lines in both directions , leaving spaces for uniform joints ( use tile spacers ) . If this layout leaves cuts smaller than 1/2 tile at walls , adjust the center line by snapping a new line 1/2 tile closer to the wall . Repeat along other center line if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ' x 3 ' ) by snapping additional lines parallel to center lines . <h> Step 3 : Applying Adhesive <p> Select the right adhesive for the substrate you 're using . Carefully read and follow all instructions and precautions on the adhesive or mortar package . Mix only enough to be used within 30 minutes . Using the type trowel recommended on the adhesive package , spread a 1/4 " coat on the surface of one grid area , using the flat side of the trowel . Do not cover guidelines . Next , use the notched side of trowel to comb adhesive into standing ridges by holding trowel at a 45-degree angle . Then remove excess adhesive , leaving a uniform , ridged setting bed . Do n't spread a larger area than can be set in 15 minutes . <h> Step 4 : Cutting Tile <p> Measure tiles to be cut carefully and mark with a pencil or felt-tip pen . Make straight or diagonal cuts with a tile cutter , curved cuts with a nipper ( chipping away small pieces for best results ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be smoothed with a carborundum stone .

See SDS at www.daltile.com for product details and **31;131;TOOLONG for safety information . <h> Step 5 : Setting Tile <p> Variation of shades is an inherent characteristic of ceramic tile -- mix tiles from several cartons as you set , for a blended effect . Begin installing tiles in the center of the room , one grid at a time . Finish each grid before moving to the next . Start with the first tile in the corner of the grid and work outward . Set tiles one at a time using a slight twisting motion . Do n't slide tiles into place . Insert tile spacers as each tile is set , or leave equal joints between tiles . Fit perimeter tiles in each grid last , leaving 1/4 " gap between tile and wall . Any rectangle porcelain should never be set in a running bond pattern , rather no more than a 1/3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use of a large unit porcelain mortar should be employed . When grid is completely installed , tap in all tiles with a rubber mallet or hammer and wood block , to ensure a good bond and level plane . Remove excess adhesive from joints with a putty knife , and from tile with a damp sponge . Do not walk on tiles until they are set ( usually in 24 hours ) . <h> Step 6 : Grouting Joints <p> Generally , you should wait about 24 hours before grouting ( refer to the adhesive package for specifics ) . Carefully read and follow all instructions and precautions on the grout package . Make only enough to use in about 30 minutes .

@@41806448 @1806448/ <h> SELECTING YOUR GROUT COLORDO N'T LET IT BECOME AN AFTERTHOUGHT <p> Grout is often an overlooked design element when tiling floors , walls or backsplashes . There are three general approaches when it comes to selecting grout : match the tile , contrast with the tile , or go neutral . Let the selection of your grout be as important as tile selection and you 'll be able to achieve the perfect design . <p> MATCHING If you 're looking for a less pronounced grout line , select a grout color that " matches " your tile selection . Selecting a grout color that is one shade either lighter or darker helps tie everything together . This is also an advisable choice when your tile has only one color because it helps create a fluid look . This can also be the best option when using more expensive tiles , such as marble tiles or granite tiles . <p> CONTRASTINGIf you 're looking to make the tile stand out , select a contrasting grout color to your tile .

If you want something that will have mass appeal , a neutral matching color is the most widely recommended approach . <p> OTHER GROUT CONSIDERATIONSThe selection of your grout color is important to achieve your desired look ; however , you still need to consider the type of grout being used . Grout functions to bond tiles and stone edges together and prevent chipping so it is important you or your tile contractor understand the types of grout available . <p> You should also consider traffic patterns in the room where your tile and grout will be used when selecting a color .

And while you 're close to the end , do n't  underestimate the value of the grout . Though it may appear to be nothing more than sand and cement , the grout you choose can add color , character and charisma to the project you worked so hard on . <p> STEP 1 : PREPARE AND APPLY YOUR GROUT Before you begin , be sure that you have the proper tools and materials on hand . Be sure to have grout , water , grout sealer and if necessary , caulk . As for tools , you 'll need a grout float , sponge , a small paintbrush to apply grout sealer and a caulking gun , if needed . <p> Next , make sure your tile has had the proper amount of time to set . This is important as grouting too soon may cause your tiles to shift . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but consult the manufacturer 's instructions for exact timing . Also , make sure that all spacers are removed prior to adding grout . <p> Select a grout that is recommended by the tile manufacturer for best results and follow the mixing instructions on the package .

Using the grout float and a sweeping motion , work the grout into the joints keeping the float at a 45 degree angle to help ensure they are completely filled . Once filled , use the float in the same manner to remove any excess grout . Move on to the next small area and repeat the steps until all grout joints have been filled . <p> When the grout begins to harden - it should just take a few minutes - use your sponge to wipe down the tiles and be careful not to remove any grout from the grout joints . Once the grout hardens completely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove any haze that has appeared during the process . <p> STEP 2 : SEAL YOUR GROUT A few days after applying grout to your project , you 'll want to add a grout sealer .

You 'll want to use a sealer specified for the grout used in the project and follow the application instructions that come with the sealer . <p> STEP 3 : KEEP THE SEALER DRY AND ENJOY ! Now that you 've applied the sealer , you 'll want to keep the area traffic-free until the sealer has cured . Consult the manufacturer 's instructions on the sealer for specifics . <p> Once cured , you can test the effectiveness of the sealer by putting a little water on the grout where you applied the sealer .

Whether your tub is set into a three-sided alcove or it commands just one corner of the room , it 's the focal point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to peruse your stone options , including slab and tile materials , and coordinating details , such as edge treatments , complementary medallions , borders , and inside and outside corner trim . These finishing details are the difference between a bathroom that 's simply sufficient and one that is extraordinarily detailed . <p> 2 . Design Neat and TidyCorners <p> You can easily ( and sneakily ) remake a child 's bed to straighten the bedding and correct the corner folds . But when placing tile , it 's best to get it right the first time . The art of getting tile runs straight is lost , however , if they do n't neatly line up where the walls turn . And , depending on your design , there may be numerous corners and edges to consider , such as each angle along a drop-in tub 's stone platform . Bathtub corner tile can help disguise slight imperfections , and the right material can make edges look neater . These details also add definition to your bathtub , making it a focal point of the space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter if your tub is a standalone unit or a two-in-one bathtub and shower fixture ; with smartly planned shelves , the space will be more efficient . For a perfect match , make shelves out of the same tile you 're using to build the surround , and cut and place corner shelves at heights that make sense for your bathing needs . There are also manufactured corner shelves that are available in a variety of materials to match or add contrast to the rest of your design . Another alternative option is to build a properly sloped shelf into the wall . Outside-corner trim , such as bullnose tile with neatly rounded edges , comes in handy here , letting water effortlessly spill from the recessed niche and down to the drain . <p> When designing a natural stone bathtub , consider adding corner tile to complete the design .

These schemes are almost , but not quite , monochromatic . An example of this combination would be to use a dark and light shade of cream , such as two options from the Stratford Place ceramic tile collection .

Some of this prediction is driven by the growing need for multi-generational design . The numbers of households that include several generations is growing at a rapid rate .

A self-stirring pot frees you up for other important duties so you 're not locked into that risotto for an hour . <p> Hate cooking in the summer ? Or maybe you worry about little fingers finding their way to hot surfaces . Induction cooking was featured as a concept in the kitchen of the future .

They are tough and virtually maintenance-free . They come in several colors for excellent design flexibility . <p> Natural quartzite is harder than granite and resists scratching and chipping like a champ . They are more sensitive to etching and regular sealing is recommended to keep countertops looking good . <p> The Panasonic concept kitchen included a countertop feature that provides storage for small appliances beneath the counter with access through the top of the counter .

It opens up the space and makes it feel appropriately used rather than wandering . Be sure to clearly define traffic patterns in the room . <p> Get out of the box with furniture .

Be sure you have three forms of lighting in each room : general , task , and accent . Brighten things up by putting in bulbs with higher wattage and add some white throw pillows and such to capitalize on the light you do have . <p> Make a space seem bigger by continuing colors from one room to the next . Paint the walls the same color as the drapery . Keep furniture , size of tile , and accents in proportion to the size of the room . <p> Vary the height at which you hang things on the wall .

Black floors make a statement no matter what 's going on in the house , but they can be hard to pull off . Here are some dos and don'ts for success . <p> 1 . Do n't be afraid of black . <p> Is black a color ? The debate may never be over . But designers use it as a staple and it makes an appearance in nearly every room of the house .

Using black as your basic room color does n't have to mean vibrant colors are out . In fact , black can ground colors that might not otherwise work in the same space . Use color mapping and strategically use color in your space . Color mapping is like copy and pasting a hue in different places through the room . If you use it well , black will harmonize your room instead of feeling oppressive . <p> 3 . Do n't use it just once . <p> Black tends to be overwhelming by itself .

Then again , too much embellishment renders it uncomfortable . Black loves lime checks just as much as a sophisticated metallic accent . Select accessories based on the style you are trying to achieve . <p> 5 . Do n't shy away from playing with texture and tone . <p> Black looks equally as great in high-gloss as it does in matte . It looks just as wonderful in a dusty sort of tone as it does in pure black . Recent trends are embracing softer blacks . Touchable textures soften the harshness of black and make it friendly when you use it in large amounts . Natural stone in black provides plenty of texture whether it 's polished or tumbled .

Do use it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design taste might change in a year or two when a lime green kitchen will date you ? Black can fix that .
