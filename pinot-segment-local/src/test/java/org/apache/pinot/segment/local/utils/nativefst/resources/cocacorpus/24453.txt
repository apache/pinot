The concept was simple : subsidize green fees for junior golfers . Now , 10 years later , there are 400 participating courses in 12 U.S. regions that have provided 450,000 rounds of golf for no more than $5 per round . Not to mention the addition of caddie programs , internships and college scholarships . <p> Credit goes to the NCGA for not only caring about the development of their junior members , but also for being so connected and supportive of other golf associations willing to adopt the program 's best practices . <p> Matt Ginella with students of the Birdies program in Morocco <p> And although there are similar success stories , such as the Birdies program in Morocco , which is teaching and coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the management and the business of the industry , the idea that municipals matter was never more obvious than in 2016 . <p> The city of Austin continues to rally national and historical support for Lions Municipal , which is where desegregation was happening in golf before it was happening in the country . And it 's where a 7-year-old Ben Crenshaw won his first of many golf tournaments . If the University of Texas turns Lions Muny into more high-rises and real estate profits , they 're going to suffer the public relations blues . <p> Matt Ginella and Ben Crenshaw <p> Meanwhile , Goat Hill Park in Oceanside , California has extended a 30-year lease to John Ashworth and his band of lovable and loyal locals , who just facilitated the conversion from potable to reclaimed water . <p> And in Winter Park , Florida , Keith Rhebb and Riley Johns , two young architects with decorated portfolios , have just completed a $1.2 million restoration of a 100-year-old 9-hole course that navigates roads , train tracks , a church and a graveyard . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gets 84,000 rounds per year and just underwent $25 million in changes by Tom Weiskopf , who kept the focus on playability for the people who pay to play as opposed to those who get paid to play . <p> Again , go figure . <p> And on the heels of golf coming back to the Olympics and Tiger Woods coming back to golf , Golf Advisor published an article using a 2015 graphic and study by the Sports and Fitness Industry which shows youth sports participation up in golf by 60.4% , while baseball , basketball , soccer and football down a combined 37.4% . <p> I hear and see all of the counter arguments , which focus on a decrease in number of courses or the millennials ' lack of interest in the game .

The industry has provided enough competition in various markets in which smarter and more demanding consumers seek out courses or destinations that are more proficient at meeting their needs and wants . Natural selection collides with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually the strongest will not only survive , they will thrive . <p> And as for millennials , twenty-somethings have always struggled to justify the time and expense of golf while chasing careers , significant others and eventually , their offspring . The long-term health of the game orbits around getting kids exposed to the fundamentals and fun of golf at an early age . And , eventually , when they get more time and income , they come back in their mid-30s or early 40s , as they recommit to family golf , buddies trips and couples trips . I 'm willing to bet everything I own , that investments made in 2016 will not only pay dividends in 2017 , but more importantly , in 2027 , and in 2037 . I just hope I 'm around to collect .

Most people kick up their feet at home after a difficult day at the office . Finding time for rest and relaxation is just as important " if not more so " when you 're on the road . Here are five ways to reorganize your next business trip to provide more opportunity for fun and leisure . <p> Here are five ways to reorganize your next business trip to provide more opportunity for fun and leisure . <h> Take a Scenic Detour <p> Business travel provides a vacation from your typical rush hour commute , even if you still have to deal with traffic . Take advantage of a more flexible schedule to turn that drive back to the hotel into a scenic drive . This could be as simple as choosing a different road , perhaps an older state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A slower pace let 's you take in new sights , and it may be less stressful than trying to find the right exit at high speed . Plan a route that goes near an outdoor shopping district where you can stop for dinner . <p> Emerald Club members who book a mid-size rate can choose their own vehicle from National 's Emerald Aisle ( which often results in a free upgrade ) . So look around for sportier options like a convertible and make your time on the road more exciting . <h> Get a Room with a View <p> Have elite status with your favorite hotel chain ? Leverage that for an upgrade if your work takes you somewhere especially scenic . One of the most important tricks is simply asking for a better room at check-in . Know what you want so the hotel staff can better satisfy your request . It can also help to be flexible , perhaps leaving your bag with the bell staff until a better room is available . <p> This is also a good time to redeem some of those rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest in using rewards for vacations because it would mean spending more time away from home . Upgrades are an easy way to redeem your rewards while still letting your employer pay for the original reservation . <h> Do n't Forget to Eat Well <p> Anyone who enjoys visiting restaurants at home should research local food blogs when traveling for work . Do n't rely entirely on hotel room service or fast food just because it 's convenient . If you have to dine out anyway , sites like Eater will list the newest venues . You 'll enjoy fresher food , more varied cuisine and a chance to explore the surrounding neighborhood . <p> If you 're at an extended stay hotel that includes a small kitchen , you might even be able to visit a local farmers market and grab a few things to prepare yourself . Produce , bakery items and some pre-prepped foods can usually be prepared with just a microwave and cutting board . Avoid raw meat and dairy unless you plan to use them the same day , since they may need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with back-to-back meetings , there 's usually some flexibility in your schedule during business travel . Take advantage of the opportunity to break from the routine you normally follow at home . <p> Time changes could make it easier to wake up early for a morning run ( most hotel concierges will provide suggested routes ) or take a leisurely breakfast . Research your destination before arriving to create a list of local attractions , parks and other tourist activities . It may be possible to visit them midweek when crowds are lower . <h> Stay an Extra Day <p> When busy trips do n't allow any time for relaxation , sometimes the best solution is to stay even longer . Your employer is already paying for your flight . Returning on the weekend might actually lower the fare . Just ask your boss first if it 's OK to fly home Sunday instead of Thursday , and then make a second reservation at the hotel ( with your own credit card ) for a few extra days .
