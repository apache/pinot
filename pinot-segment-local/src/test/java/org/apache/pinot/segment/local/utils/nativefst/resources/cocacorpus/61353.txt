There are also other gadgets that need video and you may be wondering what would be the best one to give you the most captivating graphics . <p> With the signaling standards like RCA , HDMI , S-Video , the audio quality is also affected . You will end up using different cables depending on the model of your appliances with the video component . I guess everyone would love to have the most crisp , clear and vivid video ever with a surround sound to match it . <p> Some of the standards have evolved from the RCA to HDMI and to- S-Video , Component for- the DVR , Blu-ray player , console gaming , home theater televisions , personal computer , laptop , projector and other gadgets . You should get to know the various types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different audio and video quality . <h> And What Are The Different Signaling Standards ? <h> 1 . RCA- connector <p> This is the signaling standard that your parents where using with their TVs and other gadgets . It can be considered the oldest one for all the signaling standards . It is analog type and is capable of multiple connections . <p> It is not recommended for digital signals . For our modern digital world today it would be better for you to upgrade instead of using other adaptors to connect with a digital signal . <h> 2 . Component <p> This is the signaling standard that is further divided into more component channels . <h> 3 . S-Video ( Super-Video ) <p> Its also known as Separate Video or Super Video . This is for the standard definition video . <p> It has the capability to separate black-and-white and coloring signals that produces better image quality than the Component type of signaling standard . <p> However , it has a lower color resolution compared to the Component Video . <h> 4 . HDMI- ( High-Definition Multimedia Interface ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should use . Unlike the Component it has the best solution for the audio and video signal . It can deliver the best audio quality with uncompressed audio into the 8 channels . <p> It will deliver a full capacity of 7.1 speaker experience which is popularly known as the Dolby TrueHd and DTS HD . This signaling standard will give your home theater or other gadgets the highest boost for the audio and video quality . <h> RCA To HDMI <p> A common problem for most people is that they still have appliances or gadgets with an RCA signaling standard and they would like to connect with other gadgets with an HDMI signaling standard . <p> It can be remedied with an RCA to HDMI converter but if you are really looking for the highest audio and video quality , I would suggest for you to upgrade your TV or other gadgets . We now live in a digital world and it would be best if you are using HDMI as it is the highly recommended signaling standard as of today . <p> So , you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only output from it is HDMI . However , the only inputs you have available are RCA the round yellow , red and white plugs . The problem that you need to address is how to convert that HDMI signal - to composite video and audio . <p> First , you need to realize that the video signal you 're going to display on the TV is not really going to be all that great . Remember that HDMI is designed for high resolution video generally over 1920+1200 or even better . <p> The best resolution that the composite RCA yellow video " in " can handle is NTSC or PAL which is about 525 lines around 640+480 . That being said , you 're still going to want to plug the XBox in and play Halo while you 're hanging out in grandmas basement even if the resolution is n't all that great , right ? Right . <p> That means you 're going to need some kind of downscaling converter . The HDMI output is designed to be a bi-directional system . Its expecting some kind of negotiation process between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that giant tube TV that you 're trying to use is n't that smart . Its just expecting the video and audio to come into the RCA connectors . <h> Do n't  Get The Wrong Device ! <p> There are two mistakes you can make when buying a converter . The first is buying a converter box that works in the wrong direction . <p> More ... <p> Some converters are designed to take an old RCA device like an old VCR and allow them to be plugged into an HDMI input on a newer TV that does n't  have RCA jacks . That 's probably not what you want . Make sure that the device that you 're buying converts from an HDMI output to an RCA TV input not the other way around . <p> The second mistake is buying an inexpensive cables that go from HDMI to " component " video . Component video is a 5-RCA plug system with two for audio and three for video ( RGB ) . That 's not what you want , either . You want HDMI to " composite " video 1 yellow ( video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right ) . <h> Here are some recommendations for HDMI to RCA converters that you can buy : <p> CVID BG-450- converter- is a nice small converter with the option for either NTSC or PAL output . <p> Etekcity- offers a converter that also outputs NTSC or PAL <p> The Gefen converter is a bit more professional and outputs in composite , s-video or over coax and has a locking HDMI cable input port <p> Question : I have recently purchased a new LED TV but the problem has only one set of RCA connectors and two HDMI ports . I found out that it is possible to convert signals from RCA to HDMI but I have my doubts because HDMI are digital while RCA are analog . Will it really work if I use this converter ? <p> Answer : Well , it is normal for many people to have such questions . But you need to understand that RCA connectors were developed in 1940 by Radio Corporation of America and still remain the most common analog video and audio connectors . <p> However , there are digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern technology that offers great bandwidth and higher quality audio and video than RCA . So , in order for you to be able to pair RCA signals with HDMI you need a powered converter box to make connection . Converter boxes are available to convert RCA signals HDMI . <h> How do I convert RCA audio or visuals ? <p> Normally , RCA video or audio is analog , which means it has varying voltage while HDMI is digital which means it is a stream of 1s and 0s . <p> With a simple passive cable you can not succeed in converting RCA to HDMI . You need to have a converter . Below are some of the best converters that combine analog audio or video into HDMI output : <p> They both have good reviews and are pocket friendly . All the reviewers gave them 5 out of 5 stars while most of them believed it increased quality of both the picture and audio . Therefore , there can be of great help to you . <h> To convert RCA to HDMI you need to <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HDMI connection you require . You can easily determine the connection type via color scheme . In most cases , composite RCA connectors use red , yellow and white while component RCA connectors use red , green and blue . <p> 2 . Connect the converter to HDMI in port on the devices you wish to connect <p> 3 . Connect the other end of RCA cable to RCA converter box and HDMI cable into the converter 's HDMI output . Make sure that the color of the connectors match and also that converter colors match . <p> 5 . Plug in the converter box . In case the converter has separate power , switch it on to complete the conversion . <p> Question : What if am connecting video player to a screen with only RCA jacks with the other device having only HDMI jacks ? <p> Answer : In this case , a converter is the best way to solve this problem to be able to transmit audio and video signals . You simply need a converter box . Converter has female RCA input and female HDMI output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RCA cable to the RCA input to the converter HDMI cable to the HDMI output of the converter . <p> You do not have to worry about converting your audio or visual signals from analog to digital . With RCA to HDMI converter it can surely be done . All you need is to have a good converter and the results will be awesome .

( IDC ) report - " Website Globalization : The Next Imperative for the Internet 2.0 Era " , said the fast adoption of the Internet will continue in coming years , but the percentage of English speaking users will decline . <p> Forrester Research has found that at the moment only 50% of Internet users speak English , and by 2005 it is estimated only a third of Internet businesses will use English for online communication . <p> The changing dynamics of language use on the Net will be most affected by an increase in web participation in Asia . By the end of 2003 , Asian Internet use will climb from 38 million ( 2000 ) to 95.83 million online surfers , which is predicted to be a quarter of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase as a percentage of the whole , with Jupiter reporting that European Internet use will triple in the next three years . <p> The purchasing opportunities of net consumers who only have access to websites with English content will be minimized due to the limited amount of product information they can receive . <p> Consumers who wish to buy products or research information from Europe and Asia will need to have the ability to translate the content into their language . <p> This can be accomplished by browser tool plug-ins that machine translates web content on request . <p> At present a browser tool is available from WorldLingo . The translations are not perfect , but are sufficient enough to provide a surfer with the gist of the site . <p> Placing a browser tool on your Web Browser 's Tool Bar is the pro-active way to ensure you have access to most of the Internet 's content . The other methods of making the web accessible to all countries are in the hands of the Web Master 's who make the Internet sites . <p> There are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to have a two-way relationship with non-English speaking businesses . <p> Area 1 . Do they have a Website Translator ? - Businesses can download a Translation Object from www.worldlingo.com and place it on their website . This allows consumers to view the web pages in any of 8 languages for free . Once again , the translations are automatic machine translations , so they are not 100% accurate , but they are a big step forward for visitors who do not speak the language which is used on the site . <p> Area 2 : Is the Site Localized ? - Localization is similar to translation , except it takes into account the cultural nuances involved for each country , handles the graphics , and localization partners frequently specialize in producing multilingual websites . After being localized , the Website takes on the look and feel of being developed for a particular language or culture . <p> If a site is localized into your language , it is a good indication that the business has considered your purchasing needs . Buying from these sites is as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own country . <p> Step 3 : Do n't forget the email - How many emails do you get as a result of your cyber shopping activities ? You should expect a similar number from non-English speakers once you start purchasing from sites which are written in another language . <p> You may be lucky and have a family of talented multilingual speakers on hand who can handle this foreign language email , or you can afford to hire native speakers . But many people can not , therefore an email translation service is necessary . <p> WorldLingo has an email translation system that provides you with a free machine translation ( MT ) of the email and a quote for human translation ( HT ) . The machine translation gives you the gist of the email and helps you sort the wheat from the chaff . As a consumer , the MT is useful as it may provide you with information such as the features of a product . However , if it is a big money purchase , such as a motor vehicle , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy sensibly . <p> By providing email and creating Websites that let 's businesses speak in their customer 's language , communications with foreign language customers will improve . <p> If consumers can find sites that recognize that the Internet is truly global , it is a win-win situation for both parties . Businesses will make more sales , and consumers will receive more choices . <p> -ends- 63203 @qwx263203 63223 @qwx263223 63225 @qwx263225

So get translating with these great lingo-switching websites <p> Bingo ! After years of searching , you 've stumbled across your online Holy Grail , whether it 's a website giving instructions for building a Chrysler Sebring Coupe from scratch or the world 's most comprehensive online biography of Scottish boxer Dick McTaggart . Trouble is , it 's in a language you do n't speak . <p> At first glance , this may seem like a big problem . But before you run screaming to the nearest evening class in hard-to-master European languages , stop and acquaint yourself with one of the web 's handiest family of freebies online translators . <p> Sites like AltaVista World can turn the worldwide web into your linguistic oyster by succeeding where your ropey classroom French failed . AltaVista uses the Babelfish system developed by French company Systran and named after an animal in Douglas Adam 's novel , The Hitch-Hiker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny Babel fish in their ear they could instantly understand any spoken language , and the sites we review here aim to do much the same for us . <p> When online translators work well , they are a thing of beauty . Just cut and paste the address of your chosen website into a search box and voil+ ! , the whole lot is morphed into simple English or whichever language you choose , provided it 's included in the site 's database . The number of languages is normally limited , so if you fancy figuring out a website in Serbo-Croat , you may be disappointed . You can also have English pages switched to foreign languages , or translate individual words and phrases . Note , though , that text contained within graphics will not be translated . <p> As with all brilliant ideas , however , free online translation does n't work perfectly every time . When we tested five of the best , their lingo-twisting attempts sometimes showed a grasp of English grammar reminiscent of Yoda in Attack of the Clones . But as Dictionary.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an instant online translation can at best convey the general sense of the original .

After pasting the site 's address into the text box on WorldLingo 's homepage we were linked , with Teutonic speed and efficiency , to a mainly-English version that got across the general meaning of each article . <p> We were impressed ( and surprised ) to find that all the links on the translated page took us to translated pages , so we could continue browsing without putting each new link back through the WorldLingo home page . And of all the sites in our test , this one handled from-English and to-English translations in the widest range of languages ( 11 , including two versions of Chinese ) , so if you 've ever wanted to read The Sun in Italian , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake this machine translator for a subtle human hand . Translations do n't give much sense of journalistic nuance , and we found ourselves picking through plenty of gobbledegook ( " Shaking scenes took place " , began the lead story on our Der Spiegel site ) . But we were impressed to be able to find such effective translations so fast , and we liked the site 's added extras , such as links to online language dictionaries and downloadable features that let your computer display Chinese and Korean characters .

" <p> Twentieth-Century rhetorician Kenneth Burke 's suggestion that language selection is the key to persuading a person is sound advice for business marketers who use the WWW as a medium of communication . <p> Many online businesses assume that English is the only language on the net , but an abundance of research and statistics indicate that it is folly to limit communications to the one dialect . <p> An International Data Corp . ( IDC ) report - " Website Globalization : The Next Imperative for the Internet 2.0 Era " , said the fast adoption of the Internet will continue in coming years , but the percentage of American users will decline . <p> Forrester Research has found that at the moment only 50% of Internet users speak English , and by 2005 it is estimated only a third of Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , according to Inktomi and NEC research , 14% of websites are in a language other than English , which leaves 50% of web users only served by less than a sixth of the Internet 's websites . These statistics prove that it is imperative for businesses to prepare for a truly multilingual Internet . <p> The changing dynamics of language use on the Net will be most affected by an increase in web participation in Asia . By the end of 2003 , Asian Internet use will climb from 38 million ( 2000 ) to 95.83 million online surfers , which is predicted to be a quarter of the world total . <p> European Internet use is also expected to increase as a percentage of the whole , with Jupiter reporting that European online households will triple in the next three years . <p> With these increases in non-English speaking Internet users , creating websites only in English substantially reduces a company 's revenue base , according to Forrester Research . <p> " Businesses that present their websites only in English are losing up to $10 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Forrester Research also found that USA businesses turn away almost half the orders coming from outside the US . <p> The IDC Web Globalization report highlighted the financial cost of concentrating solely on US customers . <p> IDC said that by 2003 , Internet spending would reach $1.64 trillion . Two-thirds of this projected amount will come from outside the US , with Japan and Western Europe expected to make up 47% of this on-line spending . <p> Therefore , if companies concentrate on US customers , they will miss out on the 66% of on-line spending conducted by non-English speaking Internet users . <p> American companies are the worse offenders in ignoring potential revenue from non-English speaking customers , with IDC finding that 70% ( of US companies ) draw less than 10 percent of their e-commerce revenue from overseas . <p> Barry Parr , the author of IDC 's Website Globalization Report , said with the rise of non-English speaking Internet users , it is time to gain a competitive advantage by selling to global markets . <p> " With more than half the potential market outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half of their potential revenue on the table . " <p> The IDC report says that a substantial amount of the revenue will come from B2B transactions , with an astonishing 1300% increase in B2B sales from $107.7 billion in 1999 , to $1.1 trillion in 2003 . <p> These statistics raise the question of how many more sales could be made if businesses made their sites multilingual . So how do you turn your website into a multilingual sales machine ? Here are 3 easy steps : <p> Step 1 . Determine which languages will deliver the biggest bang for your buck . Have a look at your existing sales . If you are already starting to make sales into certain non-English speaking countries , it is reasonable to assume that there are many others willing to buy your products/services if only they could understand what you were saying . <p> Have a look at your website statistics . They will usually tell you how many hits or impressions you are getting from different countries . <p> Download a Website Translator from WorldLingo and place it on your website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of 8 languages for free . The translations are automatic machine translations , so they are not 100% accurate , but they are a big step forward for visitors to your site who can not speak English . But more importantly , at the end of each month , WorldLingo will provide you with a report showing you exactly how many times each page was viewed in a specific language . This is hard data you can use to plan your multilingual Internet strategy . <p> Another method to make a Website more accessible to global customers is the use of a browser translation tool . Two of the companies that provide translation tools are WorldLingo and Alta Vista 's Babel Fish . Both provide a tool plug in for Internet Explorer 5 , which allows surfers to choose the language they wish to view a site in ( Babel Fish has five languages and WorldLingo has eight ) . <p> However the use of these browser tools require the surfer to take the initiative in downloading the software , therefore the use of WorldLingo 's Website Translator object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making a site multilingual . <p> Step 2 Select a Localization Partner Localization is similar to translation , except it takes into account the cultural nuances involved for each country , handles the graphics , and localization partners frequently specialize in producing multilingual websites . After being localized , the Website takes on the look and feel of being developed for a particular language or culture . <p> There are a wide variety of potential localization partners . These range from giant multinationals to specialist boutiques . <p> LISA , the Localization Industry Standards Association , has a more comprehensive list of localization partners on their website www.lisa.org . <p> Discuss the data you collected in Step 1 with the localization partners , decide on your initial set of languages , and ask them to provide you with a quote and an explanation of their methodology to localize websites . You will find some specialize in one or two specific languages , while some of the larger ones act as a project manager for many languages and outsource the translation work as required . <p> At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , not necessarily the cheapest . It will be the start of a long-term relationship , because as you update your English site regularly , they will update your foreign language sites . <p> Step 3 : Do n't forget the email Many businesses on the net think the day they launch their multilingual website , they just need to sit back and watch the orders roll in , but really the work has just begun . How many emails do you get as a result of your English web marketing activities ? You should expect a similar number from non-English speakers once you launch your multi-lingual website . <p> You may be lucky and have a team of talented multilingual speakers on staff who can handle this foreign language email , or you can afford to hire native speakers . But many businesses can not , and even those that can find it difficult to manage the peaks and troughs of incoming email . <p> An easy solution is at hand though . It is cheap , fast , and effective - no you do not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> WorldLingo have an email translation system that provides you with a free machine translation of the email and a quote for human translation . The machine translation gives you the gist of the email and helps you sort the wheat from the chaff . If it is junk mail - bin it . If it is an everyday inquiry , shoot off a standard pre-translated reply . If it something else , make a value judgment - is it worth the price of the human quote , say $30 , to have it translated . If it mentions orders and lots of $ signs you will probably decide it is valuable - just click on the quote link and WorldLingo will have a professional human quotation back to you in Internet time . <p> Remember , Internet users equate slow response to email to bad service . So do not waste the money you have invested in localizing your website into several different languages by not being able to respond to your customers inquiries in a timely manner . Step three of this process is already important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using multilingual email will become vital in the next couple of years . <p> Forrester Research predicts that the email marketing industry will reach $4.8 million by 2004 . The report says that within the next four years , marketers will send more than 200 billion emails to take advantage of the Internet 's potency . <p> " To remain prominent in what will become a sea of email , marketers are going to need the right people , partners , and structure in place to build successful customer relationships , " Nail from Forrester Research said . <p> Jupiter Communications also expects an explosion in commercial email . It says that the average US consumer will also receive 4000 personal and non-marketing emails this year , up from 1750 last year . <p> Due to this high volume of email , Jupiter predicts that people will discard poorly communicated emails more frequently . <p> The first email must grab the consumer 's attention , and it is highly unlikely that this will occur if it is written in another language . <p> But here comes the best part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site twice as long and according to Forrester Research are three times more likely to buy . Imagine what that will do to your sales figures . <p> If Kenneth Burke was alive today , he would see the persuasive benefits of Internet communications . However , I am sure he would have a localized Website , with multi-lingual email titled : " You persuade someone only in so far as you can talk their language " . <p> -ends- 63203 @qwx263203 63223 @qwx263223 63225 @qwx263225

@@21326841 @1326841/ <h> News <h> WorldLingo 's Email Translation Solution <p> Since there will be more non-English speakers than English speakers on the Internet by the end of 2001 , many companies are translating their marketing material and Websites into a variety of foreign languages . <p> However , this has created an unanticipated problem - the foreign email . <p> Dealing with a daily deluge of email is enough of a headache for most companies without having to scramble to find a translator each time a foreign speaking customer or supplier sends an email . Email translations are a hassle for translators , often viewed as an impediment to larger and more lucrative translation jobs . With many translators setting minimum prices for translations , having an email translated can be expensive and time consuming . <p> For localization vendors the problem is - no matter how great the job you do localizing a website , if the foreign language email does not run smoothly , it will be a problem the client is reminded of day after day after day . This is not the way you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for more business . <p> Australian company WorldLingo has stepped into this gap by developing a free automatic email machine translation service . The free machine translation will allow your client to deal with most emails very quickly . For the rest , a human translation is just a click away , but a small fee applies . <p> And as the localization vendor who integrates WorldLingo 's technology into your client 's website , you earn a commission on these human translations . <p> Since the Localization Industry Standards Association ( LISA ) has laid down the challenge " To eliminate multilingual barriers across a global enterprise " for its LISA Forum 2000 , WorldLingo is using the forum as the official launch for its new service . <p> " Communicating with clients is hard enough if you do not speak their language , but not being able to communicate with others in your organization is really tough , says WorldLingo Director Phil Scanlan . I am sure global enterprises using WorldLingo will notice a big difference in terms of ability to respond quickly as well as cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City from March 8-10 , 2000 in Washington DC , USA ) <p> Experts predict that by the end of next year more than half of all Internet users will speak a language other than English . For companies seeking a share of these lucrative and growing markets the ongoing cost of servicing customers responding to translated marketing materials and Websites can be prohibitive . According to WorldLingo Director , Phil Scanlan , small companies can not afford to have linguists on staff for customer inquiries . " Even large firms find this a significant overhead . " <p> " Engaging contract translators for emails can be difficult , by the time you have found a linguist with the right skills and obtained a quotation , the minimum charge for even a brief email makes this an expensive process , especially if you discover it 's only junk mail . With WorldLingo the email arrives in your inbox with a machine translation and a quote for a quality human translation . " <p> Phil Scanlan says it 's dead easy . " By simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from the machine translation and quickly decide if you need a human translation . Should you need the human translation , click on the WorldLingo link and you will receive a quality translation in Internet time . " <p> To the foreign speaking customer all this is seamless . They do n't know that the translation service has been out sourced . They just get a timely response to their email . WorldLingo is creating new work opportunities for translators , by bundling email translation work . They have established a global network of skilled translators who undertake the email translations . <p> How does it work ? <p> WorldLingo clients set up an email alias for each of their specific national markets . All emails go to WorldLingo and are automatically machine translated and forwarded to the client with a quotation for a human translation . The machine translation allows the recipient to determine if it is junk mail , something that can be answered with a standard pre-translated reply or if it is an important order or contract which must be human translated to ensure the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine or human translated email and run the email reply through WorldLingo for a machine translation . This arrives at the destination with the original reply in English , a free of charge machine translated reply and a quote for a human translation for the recipient to pay if they choose to use the service . If it is a valuable customer and an important communication a company may choose to foot the bill at their end if a human translation is required for the reply . <p> In other words depending on the nature of the business a significant amount of non-critical translation work can be accessed for free . WorldLingo clients only pay for secure and confidential human translation work when and as they need it and at a price which is quoted and known up front . <p> This new service is a boon for companies that have been struggling to get accurate and timely translations for incoming foreign language email . For instance a company targeting the Japanese market recently distributed translated marketing materials in Japan and had their Web-site translated . Only to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not recognize the Japanese characters - this is the case with most computers running Windows 98 outside of Japan . This meant they could not have translated the email even if they had a translator . <p> WorldLingo eliminates all these problems and enables small companies to trade in a global marketplace with all of the aplomb and at a fraction of the overheads carried by a multinational company with offices around the world and multilingual staff . If email has made the world a small place then WorldLingo has just shrunk the boundaries even further . It provides companies of all sizes with a cost and time effective solution to developing and communicating with marketplaces around the world . <p> -ends- 63203 @qwx263203 63223 @qwx263223 63225 @qwx263225

@@21326875 @1326875/ <h> 1 . Introduction <p> Less than 50% of Internet users today speak English ( Source : Global Reach ) , yet 86% of web pages on the internet are in English ( Source : Inktomi and the NEC Research Institute ) . This is a reflection of the Internet 's history and the fact that until recently it was largely an English phenomenon . <p> " Internet Time " is now established folklore . In two words it sums up how fast the Internet has changed and how fast businesses have to evolve if they wish to compete on the Internet . <p> But is " Internet Time " fast enough for the majority of Internet users who do not speak English ? Like a rush , the Internet has caught on throughout Europe and Asia , in countries where English is not widely spoken . But business on the Internet has failed to respond , many of these non-English speaking Internet users are feeling neglected . <p> And this neglect is coming at an enormous cost to business with IDC reporting that people are 4 times more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with them in their native language . <p> For this reason , WorldLingo decided to benchmark the capability of the world 's largest companies to communicate with the majority of Internet users who can not speak English . The first survey , which was released late last year , showed that the world 's top companies need to improve their language skills . The results from this survey indicate that this is still the case . <p> More than just a static benchmark , WorldLingo intends to measure the progress of the ability to communicate with this non-English speaking majority quarterly . To see how fast " Internet Time " really is . <p> WorldLingo anonymously surveyed corporations from several different countries from around the world on their response to foreign language email . Each company was sent an email in one of the following languages : <p> Japanese <p> French <p> Spanish <p> Italian <p> German <p> Portuguese <p> The question sent to the companies was worded in a manner that ensured a returned email would have to be sent for the question to be answered properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For a response to be counted ( or what we refer to as ' correct ' ) it had to answer the actual question and be in the same language as the question was asked . <h> 3 . The Results <p> 91.10% of the world 's largest companies respond incorrectly to foreign language email inquiries . <p> Figure 3.0 <p> The first survey , which was released last November found that only 9.34% of the world 's largest corporations responded correctly to the sender 's request , and in the same language as the original email . With Global Reach statistics indicating a continual trend away from English speaking dominance on the Web , it could be expected that the second survey results would show an improvement in the response rate from the world 's corporates . This was not the case , with the response rate slipping to 8.9% . <p> While many did n't respond at all , there were some very surprising trends amongst those that failed to respond to the question in the sender 's native language . <p> Many did not realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English saying the email was corrupted . <p> Several provided an answer in the appropriate language , but the answer was to a totally different question . <p> Several answered the question , but in a different language to that asked . ( For example , a German response to a Japanese email message. ) <h> 3.1 Some Interesting Responses to the Email Messages <p> State Farm Insurance Cos <p> The reply from State Farm Insurance Cos was ambiguos . They replied to an email written in German in the correct language . However , the message informed the sender that they do not reply to email messages written in German , and could " I " resend the message in English . It is strange that they replied in German to tell the sender that they did not respond to messages written in German . <p> Gehe <p> " I do n't understand spanish ( sic ) but I know italian ( sic ) so it was not very difficult to understand your intention . " <h> 3.2 Country by Country Comparison <p> The table below shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France led the way , which is notable because of their poor response rate to the first survey . The fact that only 6% of US companies ( a drop of 53.84% from Survey 1 ) responded correctly is also a glaring statistic . <p> Table 3.2.0 <p> Country <p> Response ( % ) Survey 2 <p> Response ( % ) Survey 1 <p> Germany <p> 16% <p> 5% <p> France <p> 16% <p> 0% <p> UK <p> 8% <p> 16% <p> USA <p> 6% <p> 13% <p> Japan <p> 2.5% <p> 0% <p> Italy <p> 27.77% <p> NA <p> Australia <p> 0% <p> 12% <p> Average % <p> 8.9% <p> 9.34% <p> Figure 3.2.0 <h> 3.3 Language by Language Comparison <p> The table below shows the responses broken down by language . As with the first survey , Spanish by a wide margin is the foreign language companies are most likely to respond to . This is probably because of the large number of Spanish speakers in the USA and the growing importance of the South American market . <p> Once again , there was no response for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most companies do not realize they are receiving email in Japanese because the email clients they use to read the message do not handle Japanese characters by default . Whatever the reason , it is becoming increasingly important for companies to rectify their poor response to Japanese email because over 20 percent of Japanese homes are online .
