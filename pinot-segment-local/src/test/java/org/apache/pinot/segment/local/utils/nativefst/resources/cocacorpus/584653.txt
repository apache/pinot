@@48746407 @2246407/ <h> Chat Bubbles <p> This mod displays what people say above their head . Useful for crowded servers where the chat lines fly by . This way you can hold a conversation with people near you . <p> This is similar to VoxelChat , but VoxelChat functions best with a server plugin . This has a lot of work on the client side done so that it has a lot better chance of working on servers that do n't  use the server plugin . That said , this can use the server plugin too , and VoxelChat will soon get the better client side parsing. 
@@48746409 @2246409/ <h> Dimensional World <p> You are playing with other mods like Buildcraft and do n't want to have your Overworld ruined by all these Quarry holes ? Or you only want a new World to test stuff in ? This Mod adds a complete new Dimension , especially for Mining , but you can do whatever you want to do in it . Just craft some Stone Bricks together with a Pickaxe and you get a special kind of Bricks . They are a little harder to break than normal Stone Bricks and they open you up the ability to visit a new world , the Mining World . <p> Just build a five blocks high and four blocks wide wall with a three by two hole in the middle ( same shape as a Nether Portal ) . Then you need a new Tool to actually create the Portal . Craft a few Stone Bricks , a Flint and Steel and a Stick together to get the Portal Igniter ( Portal Multitool ) . Then right-click the Portal Frames with it and watch , what happens .

It works with regular redstone levers , buttons , tripwire , pressure plates and redstone wire , as well as redstone pulses from other mods such as Computercrafts Computers and turtles , Buildcrafts logic gates , and any mod that emits redstone signals will trigger these alarm boxes . 
@@48746414 @2246414/ <h> Matmos Sound <p> Having the right sound pack installed into your Minecraft game , can really make it more unique than ever , so that 's why MAtmos Mod is so important . Imagine yourself you are walking through the woods in the middle of the night and you hear some funny song and the joy is at its maximum level . That would be annoying because no joy can happen in the middle of the night in the woods . Or imagine the vice versa , so while you are walking in the desert , suddenly you hear the rain . These examples have nothing to do with the mod , I 'm just explaining you how important the sound is . So , if you ever wanted to have the right sounds into your favorite game ; that is possible with MAtmos Mod , now . <p> But wait , I have something more for you , and because you will wait for the mod to download , here is the usage of the mod .

@@48746424 @2246424/ <h> Progressive Automation <p> Progressive Automation provides low tech automation tools for common tasks . The tools are upgradable as the player progresses . Some of the cool things the mod adds are : <p> - A low tech miner that uses normal fuel . Replacing the the mined area with cobble and infinitely expandable ( with enough resources ) . - A simple tree farm that plants and chop trees . - A simple plant farm that plants and harvests crops . <p> By crafting base materials with a nether star you will get wither materials . Using these materials you can craft tools using the normal crafting recipes . These tools have the advantage of having Unbreaking X on the tools . Perfect for putting into your machines . The RF engine is the core of all RF support for this mod , all generators need at least one in their crafting recipes and any machine you want powered by RF will need one inside . When machines are crafted they do not accept RF , to make them accept it you will need to add one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do then the machine can be connected to generators and other mods cables . The energy that the machine stores will then be stored in the Engine itself so its possible to move the engine from one machine to another without losing the energy stored . By default ( can be changed in the configs ) the engines can store 40,000 RF.
