What kinds of changes will be done is going to dictate if you will be using the parent theme ( the actual theme itself ) or a child theme . If you make changes to any theme files and then later in time an update comes along , you will lose your modifications . If you plan to make such changes , then after installing Morphology Lite , I strongly recommend you follow the WordPress tutorial to create a child theme HERE . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be making is just CSS , then you do n't  need a child theme ; use a plugin like Simple Custom CSS , or , if you are using Jetpack , use its own Custom CSS feature . <h> Start With the Basic Theme Setup Tutorials <p> We 've kept the common tutorials separate under the category of " Basic Theme Setup " because they relate to each theme we offer .

@@105094912 @494912/ <h> Why a Child Theme is Smart <p> Before you install your new WordPress theme , there is one thing you should consider before you activate it and begin setting up your website , because what you decide from this point on will either save you headaches or give you one ( or many ) . <p> If you are 100% sure you will NEVER make any changes to your theme files , whether its editing , deleting , or adding code , then you can probably move on and pass on using a child theme . The only exception I would make to this , is if you plan to ONLY modify CSS . At which point you can simply use a plugin like Simple Custom CSS , or if you use Jetpack , you can use their Edit CSS modul . However , if you think that you might make modifications to theme files , then I recommend using a " Child Theme " for your website , and here is why <p> Scenario 1 <p> You spend - many days or even weeks setting up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , you are happy from the time and effort you just spent putting your website together . Now you find out the theme has an update , so you update the theme and discover your custom changes are lost ! <p> Scenario 2 <p> You installed a child theme and currently using it to make all your theme custom modifications you wanted . When done , you are happy from the time and effort you put into your site . Now you find out there is a theme update , so you update it and you are " still happy " because you did not lose your custom work you spend so much time doing . <h> What Happens When Updating a Theme ? <p> When you update a theme , whether its from the WordPress dashboard when you get an update notice , or if you update a theme manually , every theme file gets updated . This means that any file(s) that you modified will be overwritten and lost ! <p> When you use a child theme , all your modifications will exist in that , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever you update your parent theme , you wo n't lose anything because your custom modifications are in the child theme . <h> Why is it Important to Decide Before Anything ? <p> As I mentioned , any modifications made to the parent theme will be lost whenever there is an update , but if you use a child theme , you wo n't lose them . This is why its important to think ahead when you first install your new theme , especially before you start to build your website . <p> If you were to start off with the parent theme and you 've made a bunch of custom changes to your theme , only later you discover that you will lose everything whenever there is an update , you will find yourself in a bad situation because you 've done all this work , only to risk losing it . So you decide that you will " now " use a child theme . Well , now you have extra work to do now because not only do you have to move your changes over to the child theme , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customizer settings and options ! <h> Why You Lose Customizer Options <p> When you activate the child theme , WordPress will see this it as a new theme activation , therefore , all of your customizer settings will be lost and will fallback to the the default settings . This is not a theme related side-effect , its a WordPress side-effect when you change themes because technically its a new theme being activated . <h> In Summary <p> This is why before you do anything , give some serious thought to the possibility that you might make some custom changes to the theme . It does n't  matter if its today , tomorrow , next month , or next year , if you feel there is a chance that you will want to modify something , I recommend you start off with a child theme .

However , there is a caveat of doing snippets , simply by copy and pasting directly into your page editorshould you change your theme , you will end up losing all your snippets , along with the styling that each one needs , which means you will need to go into the previous theme and copy all the CSS into the new one ( or rather a custom CSS file ) . Not fun at all . <p> Longevity Pro is the my first theme to include " shortcodes " from a plugin .

Using a plugin method , you can later change themes and if all goes well , your shortcodes should still work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said should because there may be other themes or plugins that might override Longevitys shortcode styling . To try and prevent this , we prefixed the name " longevity " to each style like this example : <p> longevity-iconbox <p> If we just named it as iconbox , there could be another theme or plugin that has the same name , so we added longevity to the name to make it unique and less chances of style conflicts . <p> IMPORTANT As of September 28 , 2016 , the Longevity Shortcode plugin has been updated with significant changes that will affect your shortcodes that youve already used .

But let 's take this tutorial and guide you through the process of creating a 3-column Showcase Gallery that is similar to this : <h> Step 1 Create Your Gallery Thumbnails <p> Unfortunately , the Showcase Gallery does not automatically create thumbnails for you , so you will need to make them before uploading . You are free to make each thumbnail the size you want , but to help you with some guidelines , here is a list of recommendations : <p> Make your thumbnails the same size for consistency <p> If you can , try to optimize your thumbnails by keeping quality but minimizing the file size <p> If you want to follow what I did for the live demo site , I made my thumbnails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to 2 columns as you shrink the viewing area , then it changes to a 1 column layout on smaller devices . <h> Step 2 Create 3 Columns <p> This is going to be very similar to how we made Icon Boxes in a previous tutorial .

You can obtain this from your images in the Media Library and clicking on the " Edit " after uploading or by clicking on the image if it already exists in the media library . Look for the " File URL " field and then select and copy the URL . <p> The file URL for the image will look different depending on whether you upload a new image or open an existing one .

Of course , this does n't  mean that the customizer is getting better , it means that its getting more complicated and bloated with so many things many users do n't  want . It adds more confusion , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all within a small side column of nested tabs ( sections ) . <p> How does the team over at wordpress.org describe this new " amazing " feature ? <p> Custom CSS with live previews- " Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin ? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site . CSS can be a powerful tool ; you may find that you wo n't need the theme editor or child themes anymore . <p> In the upcoming WordPress 4.7 , a new customizer section is being added is labeled " Additional CSS " . <p> If you click the tab , you are greeted with a blank window pane with a short description of what users can do . <p> Note When you click inside the pane and begin typing CSS code , or if you paste code , that description disappears . <p> Clicking the help icon ( the question mark ? ) displays a short explanation of what CSS is with a link to a- help document- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like a text area than an editor . <p> WPTavern ( a blog site dedicated to WordPress news ) wrote an articleabout the new Custom CSS editor , which brings up some interesting points that users should be aware of . <p> Unlike Jetpack 's Edit CSS module , the editor in the customizer lacks line numbers , colored text , and other conveniences . <p> Changes are theme specific and are not global although this is acceptable because custom CSS changes usually refers to a theme being used . However , if you add CSS for plugins , guess what , you will lose it if you change the theme ; means installing a CSS plugin . <p> The custom CSS pane area is also too small to manage larger or more complex CSS . It means that you will still need to install a custom CSS plugin This is my addition to make people aware of . <p> Another articleby WPTavern back on October 12 , 2016 was about this very feature and how the days of creating child themes may be over . Attention getting I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child themes is premature at best because they normally are not used just for custom CSS changes , they are used for modifying theme files , or perhaps creating an actual child theme that established a completely different look and style to your website . The article also goes on to describing that before ( and at present ) , to make custom CSS changes , you have to create a child theme . <p> Info The good news of course for anyone familiar with my themes from Shaped Pixels , I include a bonus child theme so that you just simply install it and you are ready to go ! <p> I can understand what they are referring to because many people are usually told to create a child theme to make custom CSS changes to a theme . I would never suggest or recommend that , but rather give them the option to install a very popular plugin called " Simple Custom CSS " into their site and make all their CSS changes with this far better solution than what is being proposed and integrated into the WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin , anyone who uses Jetpack has a built-in Custom CSS feature to do just the same , and in some ways , better ! <p> The article also mentions that this new custom CSS editor could lay the groundwork for possibly removing the Theme file editor from core at some point in the future . All I have to say to this is YIKES ! <h> Getting Ready for the New Theme called Twenty Seventeen <p> One important attribute for WordPress 4.7 is a new default theme called Twenty Seventeen . A much better theme compared to past themes , but with the advent release of WP 4.7 and its new Custom CSS Editor , you will be able to customize Twenty Seventeen and any other theme with this new customizer feature . <h> Let 's Customize Twenty Seventeen with the new Custom CSS Editor <p> Even though Twenty Seventeen is not officially out yet , I have it installed on my local test site . So let 's use this as a demonstration on how the Custom CSS Editor works by changing something . For example , let 's change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; Additional CSS <p> In the field , we will add the code from the theme that styles the site title and then we will change the colour using HEX colour values . In our case , the colour we will use is #c6d5e2 <p> When you make changes in this pane with custom CSS , you will see the preview window change with what you do . <p> Click on the " Save &amp; Publish " button at the top . <p> This is the result of our custom CSS changes : <h> Is the Custom CSS Editor a Bad Feature to Have ? <p> I will be honest that there may be some people who will like the Custom CSS Editor in the customizer and may find it useful for their needs if they only have a few modifications that they would like to do for their theme . <p> However , in my opinion , I believe it will become more of a hassle and simply get in the way of making custom CSS changes easier than what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than what this gives you , for example : <p> For CSS " only " changes , you will have greater flexibility with a plugin like " Simple Custom CSS " , a plugin that has over 300,000 installs , and 117 five-star ratings ! <p> For anyone who uses Jetpack , it has its own Custom CSS capability with great features like colour coding <p> If you are using a Child Theme , not only can you use the child themes own stylesheet , you can modify other theme files . <p> For all my theme users and customers , I always introduce the theme with a list of recommended plugins , one being the Simple Custom CSS solution . I will still continue to recommend that one , Jetpack ( if used ) as the alternative , but if you are using a child theme , then I recommend using the stylesheet that comes with it .

This will make it much easier to follow as you build your very own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will focus on how I made the one for the Influential site demo . <p> When it comes to making your own , I suggest getting yourself comfortable enough with the template and its options and settings so that you can plan out your own , as I am sure not everyone may want to have the same look and style as I have it . <h> Sections <p> The landing page template is premade with three ( 3 ) sections ( the premium version has 6 ) , each one is 100% in width , but each one also contains 4 sidebar positions in each one . This means that you have up to 12 sidebar positions ( 24 with the premium ) available to you , plus the main content area the area where you can put page content into it . By default , each section has a set of predefined colour settings , such as the background colour being white . You can of course change these options in the customizer ( more on this later ) . <p> You do not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can keep them disabled from the customizer which helps to manage what elements are shown in the admin like sidebars . Because there are 12 sidebars and if you only need 4 , why take up space in your widgets admin area with additional sidebars that are not being usedagain , more on this later . <p> If you need some extra styling that this theme does not include in the customizer , you will need to create custom CSS . For example , if you want a background image to a section , Influential does not have that option , but with your own CSS , you can easily achieve that result . <h> Content <p> You can put almost any kind of content into each section , including the main content area that is done from the page editor . Use images , videos , illustrations , widgets , and anything else you can think of . There are many plugins available for WordPress that gives you additional flexibility of what you can add to your website , so this will be up to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections , you can have your content conform to your main content width , or you can have your sections content width as fluid ( 100% ) to stretch it out . <p> Go to your Customizer and then to the Landing Page Options tab , then go into the Landing Page Content tab . Check the box if you want fluid widths for your landing page sections .

As of today , May 8 , 2016 , the Longevity Pro plugin has been updated with significant shortcode changes.the Showcase Gallery being one of them . If you already have this created before this update , you will need to redo your shortcode if you update the plugin . <p> This tutorial now reflects the changes made to the shortcode plugin update and will help you create a showcase gallery like the live demo site shows : <h> Prepare Your Images <p> The first thing we need to do is to create our images for our gallery . Its also important that you make them consistent in size , otherwise you will get a wonky looking gallery that is uneven .

Remember that we had to first create a wrapper container- that we did before ? Same thing for this one , except we will be inserting the " Showcase Row " shortcode . <p> showcaserow /showcaserow <p> This is our shortcode from the first showcase gallery image that I got from the demo site that you can use to modify the attributes , but first let 's show the default shortcode without the changed attributes : <p> columns= " col-lg-12 ?

This is not part of the theme , but rather its part of WordPress . The idea behind this new feature is to allow the end-user to make simple custom CSS changes to their theme with a live preview . There are of course pros and cons to this new feature , but I thought I would give you a bit of a preview . <p> I recently wrote an article about this new feature in WordPress 4.7 , which I titled it as " Using the Custom CSS Editor in WordPress " and takes you through a basic tutorial of how it works , but also gives you some insight on alternative options to using this editor . <h> Getting Started <p> If you plan to use the built-in customizer , this tutorial will guide you through the steps . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; Additional CSS <p> Before you begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cick in that window , the notice disappears so that you can begin adding your own CSS code : <p> If you need Help , you can click on the black icon with the question mark in it : <h> Adding Custom Code <p> Let 's do an example customization to our Prelude Lite theme by changing the Site Title background and font. - <p> When you have the Additional CSS tab open in the customizer , click in this box area to begin adding code : <p> When the notice disappears , we will type in ( or paste in ) code like this : <p> As you write your code and complete your code , you should see the right window pane give you a live preview of your custom changes as they happen . <p> NOTE Please note that the above example is only for demonstration purposes .

But if you need more than what the theme offers , you can use the method above . <h> Alternatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core teams reasoning behind adding this capability to the customizer , but its not for everyone . If you are making small simple changes , then I can see it working out for you . However , if you need to get into anything more complex , or on a larger scale of custom CSS changes , then you should consider using either a plugin or a child theme . <p> Plugin For the plugin method , I recommend checking out " Simple Custom CSS " which is very popular and one I use on some of my theme demo sites. - <p> Jetpack Users If you are a Jetpack user , then you are already set because it has its very own custom CSS feature that you can enable and use . <p> Child Theme If you plan to make a lot of CSS changes and/or perform other types of theme file modifications , then the child theme method is the best solution . 
@@105094994 @494994/ <h> Typography management <p> This is probably one of the most complex things for any website , regardless of the theme you use because within your site pages , there are many typography elements happening . When you consider that there are literally 1000s of font styles available , you can not possible include them all into a theme . Each person has their own preference as to the font and styling they like , so this also creates a challenge in theme development . <p> Consider the following : <p> Font Family This is the name of the font . If you are on Windows or a MAC , each one offers a selection of built-in fonts , but not are all the same on both platforms , so this means whenever you use a font , you need to provide a font for users of Windows and another for users of MAC . If you use a single font for Windows , anyone on a MAC wont see it ; it works the other way around too . <p> Font Size This is the size of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements as well . However , it also depends on the font family you use because each font displays sizes differently . <p> Font Weight This is the thickness of the font letters in a page . Normally you have " Regular " and " Bold " , but some fonts also offer more like " Light " , " Condensed " , " SemiBold " , " Extra Bold " , etc . <p> There are other font attributes like colour , letter spacing , and more that you can apply , but you can start to see why it becomes complicated to put all of this into a theme for every font based element . For example , a theme might have several instances of the H1 heading tag , but each could have a different size , weight , colour , etc. , all applied . <p> Basically there are just too many font based elements in a theme to give you an actual setting for eachif I did this , you would have a customizer that has 100s of typography settings . <h> The Best Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customizing fonts , or to create your own typography CSS overrides of the theme . But to help you out with the basics relating to this theme and to the primary text elements , here are a few snippets of CSS code to help you get started <p> IMPORTANT Never make changes to the theme files unless you are using a child theme . The other option is to use a plugin called Simple Custom CSS or Jetpacks Edit CSS . <h> To Change the Font and Styling to Site Title &amp; Tagline <p> Copy and then apply custom CSS to where it says add your custom font styling here : <h> - Using the Typography Settings in the Customizer <p> The settings for Aberration typography are found in the customizer and mostly deals with sizes only . If you use a plugin , you should be able to still use that for size management , but if you simply want to change sizes for the current theme elements , you can . If you use these settings , be careful of your choices , because remember that this theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile devices , these settings will NOT adjust to fit . If you need that to happen , then you have some work to do by creating Media Queries for the various mobile device resolutions . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; Typography Options <p> Make any size changes to the various elements shown within these sets of options . You can see the results by navigating the " Preview Window " . <p> Click Save &amp; Publish <p> - You may notice that my font sizes uses the " rem " attribute . There are many others such as px , em , and even percent , but for this theme , I use " rem " . To help guide you and to understand what the rem is , or more so how to convert px to rem ( em ) , there is a great online tool that you can bookmark for reference . <p> The online tool is em , but the conversion can work for rem as wellwhich is what I use . <h> Base Font Size <p> With this theme , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website pages when using Aberration . This setting will resize everything using the " em " , " rem " , or " % " size attributes , so be careful when using this . By default , this is set at 100 , which represents 100% as a base font size . If you need to increase or decrease this , you can change the default 100 to your own preference . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; Typography Options <p> Find the Base Font Size setting and make your change 93026 @qwx953026 <h> Cyrillic Fonts <p> This theme uses two Google fonts , Bad Script and also Open Sans .

The same goes for the button styles too . <h> Step 5 Create Our 3 Widgets witih Images <p> The next thing to do is create our 3 front page widgets that contains images , content , and a button . I used text widgets for these and published them to the sidebar positions of Top 1 , Top 2 , and Top 3 . <p> Before we begin with the widgets themselves , we need to upload our three images hopefully you have these prepared . Upload them to your Media Library , and this is where you need to copy the " save " the File URL somewhere because we have to paste these URLs into the text widgets as we make each one . So when you upload one , click the Edit link and copy that File URL just like we did with the banner in Step-3 above . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets , and then drag a text widget into the " Inactive Widgets " area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are ready to drag it into our sidebar position(s) . <p> Title - the widget with a ! right before the title ( so we can hide this from the front-end ) . - <p> Copy the code and content you see below into the text widget . <p> Now we need to set the options of where we want this widget to be published . In our case , we want to publish it to the Front Page only . <p> Click Save <p> Drag the widet into the " Top 1 " sidebar box . <p> Repeat the above for each of the remaining 2 widgets , except for the second one , we will drag that into " Top 2 " and then the third one we drag into " Top 3 " . <p> - Just like before , you will want to change the content to your own . Remember the File URLs you copied and saved from when you uploaded them ? Grab the first one and replace the /your file URL with your File URL . For your button shortcode , replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and then change the button label too . If you want to change the HEX colours ( the #769cd0 ) , you can . <p> You will do this for each additional widget you add to get all three that you see in the front page demo. <h> - Step 6 Create Our Showcase Gallery <p> This step is a little involved because not only are we creating our showcase gallery of images , we are also including some additional content that sits above the gallery : <p> - Let 's start with the first part , which is the extra content we see in the screenshot above . This will be added to a text widget , which is where our Showcase gallery shortcode is going as well , so the amount of code going into our widget is a lot . Take this step slow and you will be fine . <p> Part 1 The Introduction- <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets , and drag a text widget into the " Inactive Widgets " area . This will give us a bit more room to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first batch of code ( includes shortcode ) you see below titled as " Showcase Introduction " and paste it into the text widget . Replace the content with your own and make any style adjustments as needed . <p> Now that we are ready to create our gallery , we need to upload our 4 images that you prepared ( or I hope you have ready ) . The images I used for the demo are 640+425 pixels in size so that on large 2560 pixels resolution screens , your images will fit . However , if you are using the boxed page width , you can make your images a bit smaller if you wish. - <p> Just like before , upload your images to your Media Library and copy the File URL of each one ; save it somewhere for later . <p> Let 's add a divider to separate our Introduction and our gallery . To do this , we need to add a shortcode like this : <p> longevity-divider style= " spacer " <p> Now we can copy the next snippet of code and paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that creates the gallery , so when you copy each code snippet , change the content to your own , including the File URL . For the link , change the link= " # " - ( just the # only ) that you see in the snippets , change this to a full URL of where this image will link to when clicked . <p> We will do this one shortcode at a time for each image . When done , copy the next one , then paste it " right after " the one you just pasted . <p> NOTE Normally , in a page or post , you do n't  have to copy and paste the code because the shortcode plugin adds a button to your editor that let 's you fill in each element . For more information about this , you can check out the Introduction to Shortcodes tutorial . <p> We first need to wrap our showcase shortcodes in a container shortcode : <h> Time to Publish Your Showcase Gallery <p> When you are done with your widget , now its time to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes you made , make sure you click " Save " on the widget . You will also need to set the options at the bottom of the widget to publish this only to the Front Page . Once done , you can check out your front page . <h> Step 7 Would You Like to See More ( Call to Action ) <p> This is a Call to Action that I put at the bottom of the page , which also uses a shortcode . <p> Go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets , and drag a text widget into the " Inactive Widgets " area . <p> Title your widget with an ! before the title so that its hidden from the front-end . <p> Copy the shortcode snippet below into the text widget and then update the content there , including the link for the button .

The best way , and a way that the people at WordPress strongly recommends ( and requires ) , is that these kinds of functions should be " Plugin " based . It also makes it much easier to update a theme as needed , and when a single plugin has an update , it makes it much easier to update them individually . <p> NOTE- My recommendation is to take it slow when putting your site together with this theme and try not to rush development .

Frustrating at best , especially if you want to show it only on a few pages , but not all pages . <p> By default , WordPress shows a widget everywhere a sidebar exists but leaves no method to choose what pages . To do this , you need to use a third party plugin to add that functionality , but not all plugins are equal as there are several that you can use . <h> What Are Your Options ? <p> You have several options , but as I just mentioned , I will show you two plugins that can acheive the result you want without having a steep learning curve , but let 's begin with a short list of options : <p> Theme Functionality Some themes may have this function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite well . However , what good is this option if you later change your theme to a different one ? Exactly ! You will lose everything and must start over . So we will scratch this one off the list . <p> Conditional Widgets Some plugin based widgets are available with this built in , but I find these are limited because it only applies to that specific widget ( s ) . So scratch these off the list too ! <p> Widget Logic A nice plugin , and granted I have used it in the past . However , you need to refer to WordPress documentation for conditionals that you use . This plugin adds a conditional set of options at the bottom of most widgets , default and third party , but still means you have to refer to WordPress conditional tags documentation . Were almost there , but I would list this one as a runner up . <p> Jetpack A massive collage of modules , this plugin by Automattic includes one called Widget Visibility . This adds a set of options at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the settings you get give you the ability to simply require a few mouse clicks . <p> Display Widgets This is an awesome alternative to the Jetpack option and is strictly a standalone plugin that functions only for displaying widgets on select pages . My latest theme demos use this and it works perfect . <h> How to make your choice <p> This will be your own personal preference , but it will also depend on what you are usingif anything . If you 're not using Jetpack , I would recommend using the Display Widgets plugin because it offers a much easier method to manage your widgets , compared to the other options ( with excerption to Jetpack ) . However , one thing you can do is to try each method and explore which one works best for you . If you decide to try each one , do this on a test site ( development location ) so you can play with each one as long as you need and not worrying about messing up your website . <h> My Opinion <p> With most of my themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on select pages , but the method I use the most is the Display Widgets plugin by Steph Wells .

I would recommend you read more about child themes : <p> Long story short , if you plan to use a child theme , you can install the premade one that came with your theme package download .

The main reason is that maintaining a theme with all of that in it would be an absolute nightmare and become too overwhelming for most users . The best way , and a way that the people at WordPress strongly recommends ( and requires ) , is that these kinds of functions should be " Plugin " based . It also makes it much easier to update a theme as needed , and when a single plugin has an update , it makes it much easier to update them individually . <p> NOTE- My recommendation is to take it slow when putting your site together with this theme and try not to rush development .

Although you do not have to have a banner , you can also put in a slider as well ( I recommend Smart Slider 3 ) . To help you with this setup , you can refer to another tutorial called " Add a Banner to your Page " which gives you additional information , but we will make this tutorial a quick one . We will make a banner like this : <h> Prepare Your Image <p> The first thing you need to do is prepare your image before uploading it . We do this by cropping and sizing it to your preferences . As a guideline , the demo site uses an image that has a size of 2560+750 pixels . The reason for this is to accommodate large screens that have that kind of resolution .

To make this easier for you , here is the code from the demo site : <h> Let 's Examine the Code <p> First , we need to wrap our caption in a container that has a class of " banner-caption-content " applied to the div .

You will notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will talk about shortly , but this makes the caption title animated with the help of a plugin . This title also has a background colour to the first word of the title " Creative " which is wrapped in a span tag so that only this word has a background colour . If you want to change the background colour , you can change the #75aada HEX colour to one of your own . <p> The next part is our second caption title level which is in an H2 heading tag also containing animation . <p> The last part is a text link that is styled to look like a button . The # symbol is only a placeholder link , so for you , an actual link ( URL ) would be added instead .

@@105095220 @495220/ <h> Things you should know before upgrading your free theme with a pro version <p> One of the frustrating things about using free themes from the wordpress.org directory is that upgrading to a pro version means that you will have a 99% chance you will have to make notes of all your customizer settings . How WordPress checks for updates for plugins and themes from the wordpress.org website repository means you need to be aware of a few things , but hopefully I can help with the process with the least amount of work . <h> Its Great to Have Free Themes <p> Do n't  get me wrong , its great to offer free themes at WordPress , because it gives back to the community and it also gives people an opportunity to explore WordPress without making costly mistakes when they building a website . If a theme does n't  work out , you go back and find another one to try out . The same goes for plugins too ! <p> Theme sites , such as Shaped Pixels , sometimes offer both free and paid versions of themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others may opt in for the premium version to get more features . <h> Updating Free Themes is Easy ! <p> Another great feature using themes from WordPress.org is that updating is very easy . When WordPress checks the theme repository for updates , it compares the latest version to the one you have installed ( active or not ) and if it finds an update , you get an update notice in your dashboard for you to click " Update " . <h> How WordPress Checks for Theme Updates <p> For most people that do not know how the Update works , more specifically , for themes , this process happens in the background . As a theme developer , even I was curious , so I went into the WordPress Slack Chat ( a type of chat room ) and asked the core WordPress developers how WordPress checks for theme updates , so this is how it goes <p> WordPress checks for theme updates based on the folder name of the theme you are using and then looks in the repository ( a type of storage ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exists . When it finds one , it then checks the version number and compares it to the one you have . For example , your theme is version 1.0.0 . It gets this information from the themes style.css file . <p> When it finds an update , such as version 1.0.1 , it gives you notification within your dashboard that one is available . <p> You then simply click on the " Update " link for your theme . <p> This is an awesome method for keeping your free theme up-to-date providing that you installed it from the wordpress.org website . However , if you later decide to upgrade to a paid premium ( or pro ) version , then you may encounter some interesting problems ! <h> Why this is a Problem for Pro Version Upgrades ? <p> The reason why this can create some potential problems , relates to the folder name of your theme . Let 's use my Senses Lite theme ( which is available on the wordpress.org website ) as an example <p> When you install Senses Lite , the folder name where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located in your WordPress themes folder here : <p> **31;220;TOOLONG <p> If you decide to get the pro version of Senses Lite ( which is named Senses ) and install it separately , your theme folder name and location will be here : <p> **26;253;TOOLONG <p> WordPress will see both themes as two separate individual themes whether you have one or the other activated . Now we get into the problem of what if you want to upgrade Senses lite without installing Senses separately ? The idea of performing a direct upgrade is often a much preferred method because in theory , you can maintain all your customizer options and settings because the Senses theme has the same ones that the free one has.just more options and features . <h> So What is the Problem then ? <p> If you were to upload Senses files to overwrite the Senses Lite files in the Senses Lites folder , you have the potential of losing your upgrade the next time WordPress checks for updates . <p> When WordPress Update checks themes , it knows you have a " senses-lite " folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme in the repository . So if it sees your theme version as 1.0.0 ( which would be your Senses pro version ) but it sees the updated Senses Lite is version 1.0.1 , guess what is going to happen ? WordPress Update will tell you that there 's an update and once you click " Update " , your pro version files that were in the " senses-lite " theme folder will get overwritten and you will lose the pro versionnot to mention having some wonky looking things happening on the front of your website . <h> What If you did not get the theme from WordPress ? <p> If you did not install a theme from the WordPress site , then you are in good hands because you can overwrite the existing theme files with the upgrade and everything will be OK as WordPress will not find the theme in their repository . <p> I 'm actually considering limiting my free themes - in the WordPress repository by making them available only from the Shaped Pixels website . Doing this would make it possible to upgrade your free theme to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upgrading would appear almost seamless . For example , if I had Senses Lite only available from the Shaped Pixels site , the theme folder would be named " senses " and the pro version would also be named " senses " . There would be no conflict of themes and versions . Simple and Easy ! <h> So How do I Upgrade my Free Version ? <p> The reality is , the only way to upgrade your free version to a pro version is not to upgrade it , but to install the pro version as a new install and activation . This means you will need to make note of what customizer settings you currently have , things like blog styles , what elements were enabled , colours , and anything else you had set for the theme . Although in most cases , your widgets should in theory stay in their original sidebar positions because they will match what the pro version has , its best to make note of where each widget was published to . <p> When you install and activate your new pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings . <h> The Good News <p> If you got your theme from the wordpress.org website , you have at least one option available to you . There is a plugin called " Easy Updates Manager " that let 's you control what gets updated , whether its plugins or themes . <p> NOTE- If you are interested in checking out one option that can manage what gets updated , look for the " Easy Updates Manager " plugin . <p> As I mentioned this earlier , I am considering limiting my free themes on the wordpress.org website and making them only available from the Shaped Pixels website . This means you would be able to upgrade easily and simply by overwriting the existing theme files . I will be testing this later to see how things go , and if all goes well , I will make this change for next year ( 2017 ) . <h> Final Thoughts <p> Of course , if anyone has a method of upgrading a free theme from the WordPress website with a pro version without the problems mentioned in this article , Im open to hearing your solution
