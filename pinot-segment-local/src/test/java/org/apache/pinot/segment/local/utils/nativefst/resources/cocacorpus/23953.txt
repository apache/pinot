If you like your milk shake thinner , use + cup milk for 1 cup of ice cream . But for a thicker shake , double the ice cream , keeping the milk at + cup .

Simply unwind and bake in a nonstick doughnut pan and you 're winning Mom-of-the-Year award just like that . <p> I used the basic biscuit-like rolls , but you can also use the cinnamon rolls that unwind . And you will need a doughnut pan , but I find it 's worth it to make doughnuts without heating up a pan of oil for frying .
