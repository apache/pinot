Initially I tried to sail around the world as part of my quest to see the world but after I sank my catamaran in 2005 in El Salvador I kept going via backpack and ended up visiting nearly 100 countries and lived for a period of time in places like Hong Kong , China and Thailand before returning to my favorite place in the world : Acapulco ! <p> Not many people know much about Acapulco . It is a 500 year old city and port and was the originator of global trade when Spanish Galleons would travel bi-annually from Acapulco to Manila in the Philippines . Still to this day most Acapulquenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave trade and part Spanish too . <p> It also was the world 's first true tourist destination as early as the 1950s and throughout the ' 60s and ' 70s it was the playground for the world 's rich and famous . But , then , the Mexican Government decided to build , from scratch , tourist zones such as Cabo San Lucas ( to attract the West coast Americans and Canadians ) and Cancun ( for the East coast ) and decided to leave Acapulco as being the place for Mexico 's rich and famous . It is still that way today and that is why I love it so much . Today people , like the richest man in the world , Carlos Slim , is putting tens of millions of dollars into the city while many other Mexican billionaires and multimillionaires dot the hillside in exclusive areas such as Las Brisas and Diamante . <p> As well , tens of thousands make the four hour drive from Mexico City every weekend to enjoy one of the most beautiful bays in the world . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants to some of the most high class and prolific discos such as Baby O 's , Classico del Mar and Mandara and best restaurants on Earth such as Becco al Mare and Suntory . <p> La Isla Shopping VillageThe city is currently undergoing another rebirth . World class artists like Jennifer Lopez , Pitbull and Wisin and Yandel are regularly here filming music videos and new restaurants open each week adhering to all kinds of tastes . People such as world famous singer Luis Miguel has just recently opened an opulent , outdoor shopping and leisure area called La Isla . And the city has new convention centers and is currently building a new soccer stadium . <p> In other words , it 's booming . But , here is the great thing not many people know it yet . Real estate prices are still incredibly affordable and have yet to move up dramatically which we think they will in the next few years . <p> As one example , I found one 30 year old building right on the middle of the bay in Acapulco that is surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of $60,000 or less ! All they needed was some refurbishment which we did and I was sure theyd be worth much more and I was right . This is now known as AcaCondos and is doing very well . Then , upon selling a number of units I realized that most owners ( not all , but some ) did n't  want to live here year round but to either have the units as a full time investment property or just to use it for a few weeks or months per year in the winter so we set-up a boutique hotel concept called Las Torres Gemelas Private Suites in which we rent out the rooms on their behalf . <p> That too has been a big success . It is the #1 rated boutique hotel in Acapulco on Trip Advisor and our rental occupancies continue to rise every year . <p> But , then we heard from other potential buyers that they are interested in more than just studio and two bedroom condos and penthouses on the beach some want larger homes or homes or condos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help foreigners find the property of their dreams in Acapulco . <p> All told , we are now an all-service company that can help anyone find exactly what they need . Even better , we can offer you to come down , pick you up at the airport and you can stay in some of our privately owned suites at a substantial discount while you check out potential condos or homes for sale ! It is the ultimate turn-key solution and believe me , I wish this existed four years ago when I first tried to buy here I could n't even find a real estate agent who spoke English ( and back then I knew no more than " una mas cerveza , por favor " ) and many of them tried to take advantage of me . But now we are building a large expat community here who can help you find your way until you learn a few Spanish words which is n't as hard as it looks once you are immersed in the environment . <p> So , if you are looking to move to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROIs can be as high as 15% per annum or more ! ) you 've found the right place . <p> Enter your info below and let us know how we can help . Then , come down and have a cerveza with us on the beach and let us show you what is available . Believe me , you wont be disappointed ! 
@@99475002 @3675002/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Gold &amp; Silver Off To Shining Start to 2017 <p> Bitcoin stole the headlines in the first week of 2017 , rising nearly $200 in the first two days of the year before swiftly giving back those gains and more since . <p> Quietly , however , gold and silver have gotten off to an excellent start to the year . <p> Gold began the year at $1,154 and has rarely looked back , rising to over $1,200 on Thursday . <p> Silver has been similar . It started the year at $15.93 and has gone nowhere but up since and came close to hitting $17 on Thursday . <p> And all of this comes after gold rose against all fiat currencies in 2016 , rising 9% against the US dollar , 13% against the euro and 31.5% against the British pound . <p> And continued its massive bull run since 2002 with only two down years in the last 15 . <p> What is interesting about gold and silver 's rise so far in 2017 is how it correlates to their rise in 2016 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver rocketed higher . <p> And gold did n't stop rising until it hit nearly $1,400 in July . <p> But then , for the second half of the year it was almost all downhill . <p> Gold stocks followed the same pattern . <p> Gold stocks nearly tripled , as a whole , from January until August of last year and then fell until the end of the year again . <p> This is what makes the rise of silver and gold so sharply at the beginning of this year so interesting . If they go on to repeat a similar performance in 2017 it will mean massive gains in the gold stocks . <p> It is even possible that the downturn gold experienced in the last half of the year may not occur this time . It is certainly possible that gold could remain relatively stationary or even continue to rise . There are certainly reasons why gold could continue to rise , especially if the dollar erodes . <p> TDV Premium subscribers made massive gains in the first half of last year . And TDV 's Senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most potential . <p> And , on January 24th , in a live webinar , Ed will be divulging his top mining stock pick for 2017 . It 's an incredibly special situation that has the potential to gain 1,000% or more in the coming years . <p> And make sure to mark your calendar for February 24th for the TDV Internationalization &amp; Investment Summit with many of the world 's top experts on precious metals , cryptocurrencies and finance including Ed Bugos , G. Edward Griffin , David Morgan , Bix Weir and Bill Murphy of GATA . <p> Shares <h> YouTube 28884 @qwx888884 28880 @qwx888880 28885 @qwx888885 <p> I got darn lucky ( sorry , not a TDV subscriber ) to sell close to 800 shares of GDXJ last summer at $49.99 , just about $2 shy of its high , before the sharp drop in gold . In January of 2016 I bought 1000 shares of AUY ( Yamana ) at $1,83 and when GDXJ was $49.99 , Yamana was close to $6 ! . But I figured Yamana was insanely cheap when I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . So again today I bought more Yamana and I have GDXJ limit price to $20 , just in case , for about 800 shares . But yeah I think a pattern is repeating . I too , sense a big change is underway of the markets , fundamentally , and this could be the real gold boom . <p> terry <p> Do you know Jeff I follow the market , it took me years to sus how rigged it is , myself I have been out of the market for 2 years in gold and silver mines and bullion . I know what a f-p the world is in , Trump will not be allowed to operate the deep state or the neocons will see to that , I just hope the cia who are the police of the illuminati do n't  kill him .

To this day more than a million investors use Stockhouse.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO from 1994 until 2002 when I sold the company and still continued on as a director until 2007 . Afterwards , I went forth to live on and travel the world by sailboat , but after one year of sailing my boat sank in a storm off the coast of El Salvador . After being saved by clinging to my surfboard with nothing of left of all my material possessions but a pair of surfing shorts I decided to " live nowhere " and travel the world as spontaneously as possible with one overarching goal : See and understand the world with my own eyes , not through the lens of the media . <p> I went on to visit nearly 100 countries over four years and did and saw things that no traditional education could ever teach .

A weakening yuan in combination with increasingly strict capital controls in the country have driven investor 's capital out of mainland China and into bitcoin . <p> Likewise , since the Chinese government considers bitcoin to be a commodity rather than a currency , it is impervious to foreign exchange regulators - meaning that it is nearly impossible for them to limit its upside . <p> But , in my opinion , China is only one of numerous reasons bitcoin has been rising . <p> But , with it breaking out to all-time highs now , it begs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's look at the total market cap compared to other money and sectors . <p> Bitcoin is currently near $14 billion of total market cap . - If you multiply the total amount of bitcoins available ( currently just above 16 million ) by its current price you get its market cap near $14 billion . <p> At $14 billion , bitcoin has nearly the same market cap as silver . <p> But , when compared to Bill Gates , with a worth of $75 billion , bitcoin is still worth much less than the world 's richest man . <p> When comparing it to companies , like Apple , the world 's highest market cap company at $620 billion , bitcoin is still only worth 2% of the value of Apple . <p> And , compared to the total value of all gold in the world of $7.8 trillion , bitcoin is only 0.17% of that value . <p> Gold is likely the most similar item to compare bitcoin to . - Like bitcoin , it is a store of wealth and considered by many to be money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how digital the world is becoming , it is fair to posit that at some point bitcoin may be worth as much as gold . <p> If that were to happen the price of each bitcoin would have to be valued at $487,500 . <p> Another item that could be compared to bitcoin is the value of all fiat money in the world . - It is estimated , by the CIA Fact book , that there is about $28.6 trillion of coins , bank notes and bank deposits in the world . <p> If bitcoin were to replace all fiat currencies , something in which we speculate is certainly a possibility , the value of each bitcoin would be worth $1,787,500 . <p> We 've been telling you to pay attention to - bitcoin since it was $3 in 2011. - But , even now at well over $800 , it is still in its early days and massive price increases are not only possible , but quite likely . <h> YouTube 28884 @qwx888884 28880 @qwx888880 28885 @qwx888885 <p> When everything will come down , Bitcoin will be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. <p> alohajim <p> Bitcoin is an excellent vehicle for trading and it appears to be acting exactly how gold and silver should be acting in the face of insane currency creation by central banks around the world . But Bitcoin as a store of wealth and gold is the most similar item to compare Bitcoin to ? Sorry , the reverse is true : gold is the last thing to compare Bitcoin with and Bitcoin has zero intrinsic value . Bitcoin is even more ephemeral than fiat currencies , there is not even a paper representation , it only exists in digital form . Its pretty obvious that TPTB are herding folks into Bitcoin , presented as a safe haven , where they can collectively be Mt . Goxed when the time is right . Best to trade Bitcoin and take profits and put them into tangibles imho . <p> Perhaps you are correct , but the elliptic curve cryptography stuff that Ive examined suggests that their plan is idiotic , if you 're right . I guess its kind of like their plan with StuxNet . They do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing more damage to themselves than they are helping . <p> For example , I ca n't be " MtGoxxed " because I have n't placed any faith in other people to handle the keys to most of my bitcoin . <p> For another example , being " MtGoxxed " hurt a lot of people , but it made many others just chuckle because they lost a percent or two of their holdings and were prepared for such a thing , and then a tremendous lot of other people did n't  lose anything because they did n't  have coins in MtGox . Besides , the plan you 're describing seems already to have happened , perhaps twice , once with MtGox , and then again with BitFinex . It does n't  seem to do much damage . <p> Still , it pays to be wary . <p> alohajim <p> Agreed Dave , it does pay to be wary . Three more reasons to be wary of crypto currencies : 1 . New crypto currencies are sprouting like jack rabbits . Is one better than another and do they all have value ? 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to sell them to you . The reverse is not true far fewer folks are willing to part with legal tender to buy your bitcoins . One should consider how many buyers of bitcoin there might be if the system is stressed ( war , market crashes , recession/depression etc. ) 3 . Money must represent and be a measure of human labor . Mining bitcoins with powerful computers and lots of electricity is a misnomer and is an insult to miners everywhere . Banks also have powerful computers from which they create fiat currencies . Fiat is accepted everywhere and resides in computers at banks ( with a little paper floating around ) , and cryptos are not widely accepted anywhere and reside in privately owned hard drives or memory devices . Imo they both share identical characteristics in being seriously flawed and unsuitable representations of money . Bitcoin has been rising like a rocket recently and anyone holding bitcoins this year has seen their value more than double . Yay ! But what kind of money goes up and down in value like a yo yo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than bitcoin , but I have n't become aware of the reasons . 2 . It is easier for me to sell my bitcoins than it is to buy them . Of course , I buy them for under the market value and sell them for over the market value . 3 . You 're right that its a misnomer , but I 'm not sure how its an insult . The demand for that service ( protecting the existing transaction log ) is high . Perhaps you identify with the sweaty outdoorsy work undertaken by the foot-soldiers of mining companies . Consider the folks who maintain the hardware at data centers . That hardware maintenance job is basically what " mining " bitcoin amounts to . Its important .

@@99475052 @3675052/ <p> 1Broker is a simple and easy to use website which allows you to trade gold , silver and other markets via contract for differences ( CFDs ) , which represent contracts between two parties in which the seller will pay to the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at contract time . <p> Apple ( AAPL ) , Facebook ( FB ) , Google ( GOOG ) and Microsoft Corp . ( MSFT ) are the stocks which can be traded . <p> Enjoy our interview with 1Broker . <p> What is 1Broker ? <p> 1Broker offers derivatives on various well-known financial markets . The aim of our platform is to allow Bitcoin users to participate in these markets without worrying about Bitcoin exchange rates . Our primary goal was to make trading as simple and transparent as possible . For this reason we decided to offer CFDs ( Contracts for difference ) as a market maker and settle all markets directly in Bitcoin . <p> How has the response been ? <p> 1B : Surprisingly well . When I launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism . After some months of operation I think we proved ourselves and there was hardly any hostility against us left . <p> What can a user do with a 1Broker account ? <p> 1B : The range goes from conservatively investing your Bitcoins into a stock market like Google Inc. to making highly speculative forex trades on EUR/USD . <p> Since 1Broker started , many platforms have come and gone . What is the reason for 1Brokers longevity ? <p> 1B : We decided to build our platform with damage control in mind . Given the complexity of todays software which every website relies on , we do not fear successful attacks , we simply expect them . Till today , no attacker was able to breach the hot wallet or to access our database , what is certainly an exception in bitcoin-world . It certainly helps that I have solid technical knowledge and design all security-related implementations myself . <p> How has 1Broker hedged risk ? <p> 1B : Hedging positions is a smaller issue than most people think . With enough traders our markets tend to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions on long and short . In reasonably balanced markets there is no need for us to hedge . I do n't  want to disclose the specifics of how we handle unbalanced markets , since we put a lot of testing and research in this topic . <p> What has 1Broker taught you ? <p> 1B : I certainly underestimated how important marketing is . When I launched 1Broker I expected a hype and hundreds of traders within the first months actually there were only 5-10 active traders . I would definitely not start a project like this again without having a basic marketing strategy . <p> Are there any 1Broker plans for the future ? <p> 1B : Sure : more markets , more trading-related features and a mobile app are my top priority right now .

If you watch mainstream media in the US ( which no one does anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2014 ) you get the impression that gold is not only dead but going much lower . <p> However , in every other currency , other than the US dollar , gold advanced in 2014 . <p> This past weekend a grown , 30 year old man shot his father over unhappiness with his allowance according to reports in Associated Press as reported at ZeroHedge . <p> While we rarely believe what we hear in the media if this report is even slightly close to the truth it is a sad commentary on how so many from the Millennial generation have been warped , indebted and destroyed by the very systems their father 's generation have been part of creating . <p> In the early morning on January 5th , one of the largest bitcoin exchanges , Bitstamp , stated , " We have reason to believe that one of Bitstamps operational wallets was compromised on January 4th , 2015 .

@@99475053 @3675053/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Obama Agrees with Hitler on Schooling Children 28883 @qwx888883 <p> According to Godwin 's Law , the first person to invoke Hitler loses the debate . But there is a corollary . Sometimes the comparison invokes itself . <p> In a legal case that seems headed to the US Supreme Court , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has sided with Hitler against parental rights . Romeike v. Holderinvolves a German family which is seeking asylum in America because Germany has threatened to remove the Romeike 's younger children if they continue to homeschool . <p> In 1938 , Adolf Hitler ordered all German children to be educated either in state schools or in government-approved private schools that strictly followed the Nazi blueprint . The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz ( Compulsory Education Law ) , which specifically banned home schooling , remains in force in Germany today . <p> The Nazi and American systems of education have always had similarities . The 19th century American education reformer Horace Mann is called the father of American education . The main goal of both systems was not to teach children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . The Nazi vision of a " good citizen " and that of Mann differed but the two approaches had definite overlap . For example , they stressed the inculcation of obedience to authority . Moreover , they reflected a belief that the state should focus upon children because , unlike adults , children were ' wax ' and could be more easily shaped . <p> " This new Reich will give its youth to no one , but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing . " Adolf Hitler <p> A key difference between the German and American educational systems , however , is that Americans are legally permitted to home school their children . <p> That situation may change under Obama . In his 2012 State of the Union address , Obama called on " every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18 . " Traditionally , education is a state prerogative but the federal government is often able to dictate terms because state schools depend upon federal funding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing . The family was initially granted asylum under a statute that applies to any or political opinion . " US Attorney General Eric Holder objected to the asylum and the ruling was overturned on appeal . Romeike v. Holder was then taken to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals where the homeschoolers ' petition was denied . Nevertheless , the court has ordered the DOJ to respond to a rehearing request . <p> Given that the DOJ brief in Romeike v. Holder was filed on behalf of the US Attorney General , it can be seen as an official statement on home schooling from the Obama administration . It states " The goal in Germany is for an open , pluralistic society.Teaching tolerance to children of all backgrounds helps to develop the ability to interact as a fully functioning citizen in Germany . " In other words , banning homeschooling promotes tolerance and good citizenship . The brief makes favorable reference to a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a justified interest in counteracting the development of religiously or philosophically motivated parallel societies and in integrating minorities in this area . " In other words , people whose philosophy contradicts the ' general good ' ( as defined by the state ) should be integrated by forcing their children to attend state schools where they become part of a propaganda machine . <p> " When an opponent declares , ' I will not come over to your side , and you will not get me on your side , ' I calmly say , ' Your child belongs to me already . A people lives forever . What are you ? You will pass on . Your descendants however now stand in the new camp . In a short time they will know nothing else but this new community ' . " Adolf Hitler <p> The comparison between Obama and Nazis on education sounds like hyperbole , but it is rapidly becoming less of an overstatement . Consider an social experiment being conducted by the Los Angeles Unified School District ( LAUSD ) the second largest school district in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance exchange , has granted LAUSD almost one million dollars for a pilot program . One of the program 's main goals is to train students to become " messengers " for Obamacare . Specifically , the children will be trained to ' educate ' their families and possibly other adults about why they should enroll in the tax-subsidized healthcare program . Public school is now training children to educate their parents toward the correct political position . <p> Heartland Institute explained , " LAUSD will also use tax-paid staff to promote ObamaCare through phone calls to students homes , in-class presentations , and meetings with employees eligible for ObamaCares taxpayer-covered healthcare . " <p> Investor 's Business Daily reported the words of LAUSD spokeswoman Gayle Pollard-Terry . She explained " proudly " that the " pilot program " was meant to ascertain " how well teenagers serve as messengers of government-sponsored information . " Investor 's reported : " If they prove proficient at influencing their own families to believe material sent home from schools , she said , the teens will be used to deliver numerous other official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And pilot programs , by definition , are trials in contemplation of expanding the model . <p> Public schools have always been used to spread state propaganda but the LAUSD program is so blatant that it is being widely compared to the Hitler Youth ; sadly , this also becomes less and less hyperbole . The Nazi program was for males aged 14 to 18 , with children aged 10 to 14 being divided by sex into two other sub-programs . The Hitler Youth were instilled with Nazi values which they then spread them to relatives and the general public . The program evolved from children teaching their parents to children denouncing those parents who refused to ' learn ' . <p> But for Obama Youth to be truly effective , children must be forced to attend public school or state-approved private ones . He could do it with the stroke of a pen by using his favorite political weapon : an executive order . That is what Michael Farris , founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association , expects to happen . <p> To me , Farris ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , I have just compared Obama to Hitler and a LAUSD program to the Hitler Youth . When reductio ad absurdum no longer works , as it no longer does in American politics , it is not possible to say what is overstatement .

If you are n't  a TDV newsletter subscriber , where I comment nearly weekly on the markets and on precious metals stocks youd think I 'd all but disappeared . <p> However , Jeff Berwick and I have been on the same page that the market was n't ready for a heavy focus the last few years , and I 've been helping our subscribers maintain and manage their portfolios and develop their broader macro-economic outlooks ( which included a bullish call on stocks up until the end of 2013 that was not popular with most subscribers ) . Meanwhile , Jeff has done a great job in focusing on other areas that have had massive growth including bitcoin ( up from $7 to $500 since he began talking about it in 2011 ) and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just delivered a double since it was brought to TDV and TDV Golden Trader subscribers just a few weeks ago and went public yesterday at more than double the price our subscribers got into it at . <p> But , as Jeff has recently stated , we believe now is the time to buy gold and silver shares , if for no other reason because they 've been abandoned by even the value investor . In the TDV portfolio , we have about 18 companies , and we are working towards rounding it out at 20 names . <p> Two of them have disappeared in takeovers in recent months : Osisko Mining and Papillon Resources . <p> The buyers are companies that are already included in our portfolio ( i.e. Agnico Eagle , Yamana , and B2Gold ) so we have not lost the assets altogether . But it gave investors a bit of liquidity and nice gains for those who bought along with us , as we suggested , and it left room for us to bring in a couple of new picks . I will be telling you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can subscribe here ) . Importantly , the timing is good . What we see now is that most gold/silver shares have been bottoming for over a year . Some have been rallying through the year , like Agnico Eagle . <p> Ever since I tripped over Merrex at a conference in San Francisco a few years back I felt they were on the right track having acquired a large contiguous land package of over 900 square kilometers in the southwest part of Mali , West Africa , adjoining both Senegal and Guinea as part of a thesis that the FalTmT river was related to the mineralization on the southern extension of the 200km long north-south trending shear zone that hosts most of the mines in Mali . That bet paid off right away with the discovery of a 600,000 oz 2.2 g/t gold deposit about 20 kilometers east of the main shear in 2006 . <p> The only other deposit in the area then was Robexs 1.6Moz low grade Nampala ( mostly sulphides and less than 1 g/t gold ) . Merrexs Siribaya oxide resource is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then other deposits have been discovered in the area , notably Papillons 5+Moz Fekola and IAMGOLDs 1.1Moz Boto both gold deposits within 20km of the Siribaya gold project . <p> In April , the Merrex/IMG joint venture made a new discovery ( Diakha see graph below ) just 10 kilometers south of IAMGOLDs Boto discovery that may just be part of one large system . <p> In anticipation of this possibility Merrex has applied for a permit in Guinea on trend in between Boto and the current discovery ( Diakha ) . Merrex and IAMGOLD have a 50/50 JV on the Siribaya project with over $40 million spent to date but Merrex is applying for a 100% interest in the Guinea claims . <p> The company has yet to drill some of its best targets to the east where it has strong termite mound based geochem readings coincident with north-south trending lineaments ( possible shear zones ) . <p> But right now the big question is , how big is the current system at Diakha ? <p> Keep in mind this point too . Merrexs shares suffered like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also suffered unduly due to a general misapprehension of the political reality of the 2012 coup . What has changed is the realization that mining in Mali has been and will likely continue to be relatively unaffected as long as the government is itself mining friendly , whomever the government . The second thing that has changed is the high probability now ( given B2Golds entry ) that an actual mining operation will be formed in the region , which increases the value of every satellite deposit in the area . In other words , Merrexs 600,000 ounces of 2.2 g/t gold oxides are worth more if there is a plant next door than if the joint venture would have to build its own plant and mine . <p> The third thing that has changed is the Diakha discovery on trend with Boto and Fekola . <p> The discovery also confirms their exploration methodology , which is driven by sophisticated geochem . <p> The Diakha discovery was the first of seven high priority targets uncovered by the method . <p> Its too early to tell how big the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Boto , but Merrex has most of the ground covered if it is that large . All we can tell you is that they are hitting good grades at shallower levels than either IAMGOLD or Papillon did up north , and that the rock type and visually identifiable minerals are the same as Boto ( based on the core presented on their website ) . <p> We can tell you the exploration geologists are excited , and so is Merrexs management . The stock has been consolidating in the $0.10-$0.15 range pretty much as expected , as the shareholder base continues to turnover . But liquidity appears to have been drying up at this level , leaving only a residual offer of about 500k shares remaining at the 15 cent level . I have a feeling that if someone took that out it would be 20 cents bid quickly ! But well see . An upset in gold could change that ! <p> However , the story is getting out , despite a market all but abandoned by retail . <p> Last weeks BNN interview with CEO Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , and there has been a steady drum beat about the war chest of Yuan ready to buy up African deals . <p> With B2Gold soon to be raising capital for the Fekola project I cant imagine this story will remain quiet for much longer . This region is quickly becoming the fastest developing undeveloped mining region in the world . In my opinion there 's the potential for many discoveries on Merrexs very prospective block . <p> At the moment we feel safe putting a $0.25 valuation on the stock . <p> It has the potential for a takeover by IAMGOLD or B2Gold ( or the Chinese ! ) , and ultimately if we can compare its potential to that of Papillons ( which I very much believe is plausible ) it is a $2-3 stock . <p> It is definitely a speculation and not something you should be putting your life savings into . <p> But this is the first exploration stock that we have publicly featured at TDV and I believe in the potential of this stock to realize significantly higher values . For those looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of our current favorite ways to take advantage of it . <p> Editor 's Note : Read more about Ed 's and the Dollar Vigilante 's take , recommendations and outlook for precious metals in the TDV Newsletter.

Last year , the libertarian-anarchist became a citizen of the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis and renounced his American citizenship . Ver may be a bellwether of how the US plans to treat those who renounce their citizenship or who are otherwise inconvenient expats . <p> A frequent speaker at bitcoin events held in the US , Ver was meticulous about the process of renunciation and its implications . " I checked with lawyers very carefully before I renounced , and they clearly assured me that I will qualify for a visa to visit the USA . I would be fine with them denying my visa if it was for a valid reason . " <p> Ver also went through a mandatory " one-week cooling-off period " and confronted such official questions as " Did you know if you renounce citizenship , you wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers thinking , " darn , " before renouncing as fast as he could . <p> On January 6 , he was denied a visa to attend the North American Bitcoin Conference , held from January 16 to 18 in Miami , a three-hour flight from St. Kitts and Nevis . ( That passport allows for visa-free travel to 120 countries but the US is not one of them . ) <p> It was apparently Ver 's third attempt to re-enter America within an eight day period . The US Embassy in Barbados was happy to accept the $160 application fee each time it refused a visa . The stateside government had also willingly accepted his payment of a $325,000 tax bill just weeks before . Blood money , yes ; entry , no . Ver can not appeal the decision , only reapply and lawyers opine that each denial reduces the chances of future approval . <p> The official reason ? The denial of entry was based on Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) which is notoriously elastic . The Section states , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer , at the time of application for admission , that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status " In short , this section of the INA presumes every applicant for a visa to America intends to eventually reside in America . It is the burden of each applicant to demonstrate that this is not the case " <p> The embassy 's rejection letter stated : " One of the most common elements within the various nonimmigrant visa requirements is for the applicant to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning You have not demonstrated that you have the ties that will compel you to return to your home country after your travel to the United States . " In short , America allegedly fears Ver will overstay his visa and become an illegal immigrant in the land of his own birth . <p> The official reason for denying a visa to Ver beggars belief . Do officials think Ver was ' just kidding ' about renouncing his US Citizenship ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a prank ? As pointed out , " It is strangethat Mr. Ver was denied by the US Consular sic General , Barbados , under a regulation that requires he prove his intent to depart the US when he appears to have already done so . " <p> The strong ties demanded by the embassy usually consist of a job , a house , a family , a bank account , a business , a history of residency Although Ver 's family resides in the United States , he is ' tied ' to St. Kitts and Nevis by almost every other measurement of residency . <p> Moreover , Ver 's primary residence is in Tokyo where he moved in 2006 . In an interview , he told Coindesk that the Embassy officials refused to so much as glance at the documentation of the business he started in Japan or at " the other nine years worth of history he has with that country . " Instead , " they would n't even let me slide the documents regarding Japan through the slot in the window . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant intent " requirement ) as a pretext for denial , which is a common practice when they need an elastic excuse . 214(b) is a pretext that expats may encounter with increasing frequency . <p> The real explanation for the border shutting to Ver is almost certainly political . It could be based on one of three circumstances but probably draws upon all of them . <p> 1 ) In the aftermath of Waco the 1993 Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco &amp; Firearms ( ATF ) siege of a Texas compound in which over 70 men , women and children died needlessly Ver took a hard line . While running as a Libertarian candidate for California State Assembly in 2000 , he called the ATF " a bunch of jack booted thugs and murderers . " ATF agents in the audience took umbrage . <p> " They began looking into my background in the attempt to find dirt on me , " Ver explained . One of his business ventures sold a product called a " Pest Control Report 2000 , " which was a type of firecracker used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ATF called it " an explosive , " instructed everyone else to stop selling them , and prosecuted Ver . He was imprisoned for 10 months with three years probation for " dealing in explosives without a license . " <p> After the probation was over , Ver left to live in Japan . <p> 2 ) In October 2013 , the FBI arrested Ross Ulbricht on multiple charges of which he was indicted on four counts : Computer hacking , money laundering , narcotics trafficking and engaging in a criminal enterprise . Ulbricht was accused of being the pseudonymous Dread Pirate Roberts , who founded the Silk Road online black market . Ver posted on Twitter : " I 'll give $10 to @FreeRoss for each RT ( retweet ) . " Ver has donated over $150,000 to Ulbricht 's defense , which can not please the Department of Justice . <p> 3 ) Ver founded a service called Passport for Bitcoins through which he assisted people who wished to obtain a St. Kitts and Nevis passport . The US Government could not have been amused . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " residence and citizenship planning . " and Ver now forwards any second citizenship requests through " Passports for Bitcoins " to TDV Passports . <p> Ver is unlikely to set an official foot on American soil again . And , yet , he has recently been seen strolling the streets of New York City , handing out free bitcoins to bypassers . A headline in Coin Telegraphreported " Virtual Roger Ver Spotted Handing Out Bitcoins in NYC . " <p> The man has done the next best thing to cloning himself . He used Double a remotely-controlled robot that featured a screen with his face and had the ability to interact in real time with people near it . The article explained , " While enjoying the sun on a Caribbean Beach , Roger Ver simultaneously romped the streets of New York City , taking in the sights of the Financial District .

But his flesh-and-blood experiences are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homeland in the past , Ver was denied entry this time . Like the Biblical Jesus , he was denied three times . Expats should secure their visas before buying non-refundable tickets . <p> This is one of the big questions we get asked at TDV Passports , from Americans , is " will I be able to return to visit the US after I have renounced ? " It , as always , is a very grey area whenever governments are involved . If you get a second passport in a country which does not need a tourist visa to visit the US then you will have far less problems . However , you have to keep in mind that governments change their visa requirements all the time . As example , in November of 2014 , Canada changed their rules and now require that St. Kitts citizens apply for a visa before being allowed to visit Canada . <p> From my perspective , however , I question if or why anyone would want to return to the US at all over the next few years . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , and going to get worse and worse , to even physically be in the country with the world 's largest amount of people in rape/work camps as a percentage of the population in human history . The US government is also the most bankrupt government in human history , now with over $18 trillion in debt and the US dollar is quickly becoming shunned around the world which will cause a collapse of the dollar and a further roll out of a police state in the US . <p> Even for Roger Ver , who mostly wanted to return to the US from time to time for bitcoin conferences , we are finding that due to all the rules , regulation and oppression in the US in regard to bitcoin that it is becoming a very unimportant market for the cryptocurrency . Numerous bitcoin entrepreneurs , including Charlie Shrem ( who was just convicted to two years of person ) and Ross Ulbricht ( who goes to court next week facing 30 years to life for running an unregulated Ebay ) have been kidnapped , extorted ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulbricht evn though he has never been convicted of anything ) and harassed just for their involvement with bitcoin . Bitcoin conferences from Beijing to Dubai to Buenos Aires are becoming much more important , and safer , meeting grounds for those interested in the currency . <p> And , that also includes Anarchapulco , this February 27th to March 1st , which will be held in much freer Acapulco , Mexico . Roger Ver applied for a tourist visa to Mexico and received it in a few days in order to attend this event which will have leading edge bitcoin , cryptocurrency and bitcoin/internet 2.0 leaders attending . <p> As for me personally , I already stated last year that I will no longer go to the USSA until after the upcoming collapse whether I need a visa or not .

At threat of force ( imprisonment ) it had already laid out four agencies that were massive hurdles for putting a BitcoinATM in the US and Europe , at the very least , almost impossible for a small organization . <p> I still had n't given up hope and , as I always profess , I will fight oppression and control over the money , banking and financial system with everything I can . <p> BLESSING IN DISGUISE <p> And then the 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the BitcoinATM notified me a few days ago that my participation was no longer necessary . <p> That was interesting , I thought , as we had an agreement for my involvement and I had done everything I said I would do . It turned out that once I had put BitcoinATM on the world stage he decided to take all that I had done and dismiss me . <p> I do not wish to publish dirty laundry and while the actions of the co-founders of BitcoinATM were incredibly dishonorable , I put it down it to them being much like me I was when I was 23 young , unwise and unaware of what they are even involved with . <p> But it is my belief that he has no idea what kind of business he is trying to get into and how hard it will be to do without a number of the right pieces in place . <p> OFFICIAL END OF MY INVOLVEMENT <p> As always , and very unlike Barack Obama , I am very transparent in everything I do so I do wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with BitcoinATM . <p> After a day or two of pondering , however , I have realized that this may truly be a blessing in disguise . The biggest issue with BitcoinATM , and one that I have stated in the past many times , is that it is hardware . Any government , anywhere , can just come and take it away . <p> It was always the achilles heel of this product . <p> Can it succeed ? Sure , under the right guidance and a massive amount of capital of lawyers to fight off every single country in which the machine is placed . And , even then , there is no guarantee . Just look at Canada which has already begun to shutter bank accounts of anyone even involved in a bitcoin exchange . As I 've also stated numerous times in the past few years , there is no real law . Those with the guns do what they want . And , those with the guns are backed by the major money controlling cartels ( central banks and those who control them ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> MY FUTURE IN BITCOIN <p> I still am incredibly excited about bitcoin . It will change the world . And the reason it will is that it is decentralized and there is no physical place where the powers that be can shut it down . This is the one very difficult challenge for BitcoinATM . And one that I have always stated but still got behind it because it does have the ability to change the game . <p> I am now focusing more of my efforts on less physical ventures that will be much harder to be controlled by governments and central banks . Things such as a P2P bitcoin exchange , similar to Mt . Gox , but without any central servers . And many more . <p> In this vein , if you or anyone you know is one of the top percentile programmers and theorists in P2P protocols please contact us here at TDV . <p> If there is one thing that my involvement with BitcoinATM has shown me very plainly in the last month is that bitcoin has the direct attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly two decades to figure out the internet would be their downfall . In this case , it has only taken them months to realize that bitcoin could end their monopoly on money and banking . The only way for us freedom fighters to defeat them will be to do so much in the same way as bitcoin is and has been doing by being decentralized and unable to be stopped by guns and regulations . <p> That is where my focus will now go . This is an incredibly revolutionary environment and mistakes will be made along the way constantly . I 've never been shy about admitting my mistakes and neither have I been shy in promoting the value of things like the internet and bitcoin to unchain humans from slavery . <p> My involvement with BitcoinATM has turned out to be a mistake . But not one without some positives . I sat front and center in front of the US and world media alerting to the scam of central banking and government controlled money systems . That alone has some value . <p> And I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not the last you 've heard from me on bitcoin . <p> Shares <p> Filed Under : Uncategorized <p> ken <p> Thanks for the input Jeff ..

In Chile , The Communist Revolution came shortly after the 1964 elections . The rise of communism ended the reputation of Chile as South America 's most stable state and one of the oldest democracies in the Americas alongside the United States , which had been a point of pride for the Chilean middle class .

@@99475062 @3675062/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Some Questions about Deflation <p> Editor 's Note : The following post is by TDV contributor , Robert Blumen <p> What is deflation ? <p> According to dictionary.com , it is " a fall in the general price level or a contraction of credit and available money " . <p> Falling prices . That sounds good , especially if you have set some cash set aside and are thinking about a major purchase . <p> But as some additional research with Google demonstrates , that would be a nanve and simple-minded conclusion . It quickly becomes evident that deflation is a serious economic disease . According to the St Louis Fed , <p> " While the idea of lower prices may sound attractive , deflation is a real concern for several reasons . Deflation discourages spending and investment because consumers , expecting prices to fall further , delay purchases , preferring instead to save and wait for even lower prices . Decreased spending , in turn , lowers company sales and profits , which eventually increases unemployment . " <p> The problem with deflation is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . It is the macro equivalent of a roach motel : perilously easy to enter but impossible to leave . The problem , you see , is that deflation reduces consumption , which reduces production , eventually shutting down all economic activity . <p> Wikipedia explains it this way : <p> " Because the price of goods is falling , consumers have an incentive to delay purchases and consumption until prices fall further , which in turn reduces overall economic activity . Since this idles the productive capacity , investment also falls , leading to further reductions in aggregate demand . This is the deflationary spiral . " <p> Deflation is far worse than its doppelgSnger , inflation , because the Fed can fight inflation by raising interest rates . Deflation is nearly impossible to stop once it has started because interest rates can only be cut to zero , no lower . For this reason , Ben Bernanke believes that monetary policy should be biased toward preventing deflation more than preventing inflation . <p> Japan , according to Bloomberg " has been battling deflation for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices since 2000 damaging economic growth " . The New York Times reports that Japans new prime minister Abe " has galvanized markets by encouraging bold monetary measures to beat deflation " . <p> I hope that everyone is clear on this . <p> Now that you understand the basics , I have some questions for the people who came up with this stuff . <p> Why do falling prices make people expect falling prices ? <p> The observation that prices are falling , means that in the recent past , prices have fallen . <p> One person noticing that the price of a good that appears somewhere on their value scale has fallen for some time might interpret that information and conclude that in the future , the price of that good will be lower . But a second individual might see the same thing and expect the price to level off and stay where it is , and a third might interpret falling prices as an indicator that in the future prices will be higher . <p> Why should a price having fallen indicate that it will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future trends . Why should past trends continue indefinitely ? <p> Why will the public mainly choose the first of these three outlooks , more than the other two ? <p> According to economist Jeffrey Herbener , the assumption that falling prices create expectations of more of the same is a feature of certain popular macroeconomic theories in which price expectations are modeled as part of the theory . In his testimony to Congress , Herbener observes that " the downward spiral of prices is merely the logical implication of assumptions about expectations within formal economic models . If you assume that the agents operating in an economic model suffer from expectations that are self-reinforcing , then the model will produce a downward spiral . " <p> Are expectations self-reinforcing ? It would make just as much sense to say that expectations are self-reversing after people have seen prices go down for a while , they will expect prices to go up . <p> Are these formal models a good description of human action ? Contrary to what these models say , there is no fixed response to an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times I or someone that I know jumped on a low price because we do not expect the opportunity to last . <p> But what about wages ? <p> The postponement theory depends on the assumption that a fall in the prices will benefit buyers who wait . This is true if we are talking about people who have lots of cash and can sit on it indefinitely . But most of us have ongoing monthly expenses and we depend on our wages to replenish our cash reserves . Our purchasing power at the time when we want to make a delayed purchase , comes from our cash savings and our wages . A fall in wages , if substantial , would wipe out any gains in purchasing power realized from lower prices . <p> If consumers do not buy today because they expect lower prices tomorrow , then what are their expectations about their wages ? Do they anticipate that their wages be the same , higher , or lower ? If lower , then by how much ? As much as prices have fallen ? <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are consumer prices included the models but wages are not ? Does deflation only affect consumer goods prices , leaving all other prices untouched ? <p> According to the deflationary death spiral theory , decisions not to buy drag the economy into a death spiral . Does anyone expect that could happen without affecting wages ? <p> And what about asset prices ? <p> In addition to cash savings and wages , individuals decide how much to spend and save taking into account the amount that they have already saved . Someone who is trying to save to meet their familys future needs will feel less comfortable about spending . <p> Most people hold some of their savings in cash . That portion of their savings increases in purchasing power when prices fall . But people also save by purchasing financial assets , such as stocks and bonds , or real assets such as property , and rental housing . All of these assets have a price , which could rise or fall . Depending on the mix of cash and other assets that an individual holds , a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from the cash portion of their savings . <p> Do people take value of their past savings into account when deciding whether to buy or wait ? Or do people form expectations about consumer prices only and ignore what might happens to their savings in a deflation ? <p> If falling consumer prices generate expectations of more of the same , what impact do falling prices have on expectations about asset prices ? Do buyers who delay purchases expect the prices of their saved assets to be lower as well ? If not , then do they expect that consumer prices will be lower and asset prices will be higher ? <p> If deflation causes the economy to disintegrate , will asset prices be spared ? <p> Is it only buying behavior that is affected ? <p> The deflation death star begins to destroy the earth when buying is postponed . <p> But is it only buying that is affected by expectations about the future ? If buying is affected but not selling , then why not ? <p> If consumers expect lower prices of most things , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would sell their possessions and their assets in order to buy them back later at a lower price . Selling your home and renting a similar one would be the place to start . Selling your car and leasing would be the next step . Finally sell your saved assets for cash would be equally profitable . Expectations of lower prices should lead to a spiral of selling , driving prices down even faster , leading to more deflationary expectations and more selling until everyone has no possessions and no assets other than cash . <p> If this happened , then who would buy ? <p> Do prices ever get low enough ? <p> If buyers expect lower prices , then how much lower ? Any number in particular ? If a buyer expects a specific lower price , and the price reaches that level , will he buy ? Or does he always prices to go even lower than they are today , no matter how far they have fallen already ? <p> If expectations of lower prices turn out to be correct , and prices drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a minority of contrarian buyers defect from the consensus and begin to see a bottom , or even an uptrend ? Or do these expectations go on forever adapting to lower prices causing prices to drop indefinitely ? <p> The point of delaying a purchase is so that you can make the purchase in the future and have some additional cash left over to make another purchase or to save . What is the point of delaying a purchase that you never make ? <p> We have all had the experience of buying a new computer or some other device the day before the next version was released that costs less and does more . If you knew would you have waited ? Maybe , but maybe not . If you need a computer for work , then you will buy it sooner rather than later . <p> Many people delayed their purchase of the iPhone 4 in order to buy the iPhone 5 , then they bought the iPhone 5 . My iPhone4 was worn out by that time and I needed a new phone . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of demand , a greater quantity of a good is demanded at a lower price than at a higher price . If that were true , then people would buy more , rather than postponing purchases . <p> What happens to the law of demand in a deflation ? It turns out at that the law of demand has a loophole : it requires that all other things remain equal . In a deflation death spiral , all things are not equal . Consumer preferences change in response to prices . Stationary supply and demand curves do not exist in such a world . For prices to fall and yet still fail to induce buyers to buy , the quantity demanded must always fall by more than enough to compensate for the lower asking price . The demand curve is always shifting downwards faster than the price falls , to prevent an equilibrium price from ever forming . Economist W. H. Hutt calls this " an infinitely elastic demand for money " . <p> Does this describe the world that we live in , or any world that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical way to price changes ? How do we explain , for example , shoppers competing to buy at low prices ? <p> Why do sellers not lower prices ? <p> Why is it only buyers whose expectations of lower prices are based on falling prices ? Are the expectations of sellers included in the model ? <p> If not , is that because the models assume that sellers not have expectations ? Or do the expectations of sellers not match the expectations of buyers ? <p> If sellers have the expectations of lower prices , why do they not lower their prices immediately in order to sell inventory ahead of their competitors ? <p> If buyers and sellers both expect future prices to be lower , why do market prices not converge upon this new , lower level immediately ? <p> If customers are postponing purchases expecting lower prices in the future , but sellers do not cooperate , then inventories will accumulate . If this began to happen , then why would sellers not lower their prices immediately in order to clear out inventories ? <p> All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at different times . To say that only the expectations of buyers are affected by falling prices is to say that the same person at one time has expectations about his own future purchases but later the same day , does not have expectations about his own current and future sales . Does the model assume that we have all been lobotomized so the two sides of our brain do not communicate with each other ? <p> Do producers have any control over their costs ? <p> In the previous question , I asked whether sellers expect lower prices as well as buyers . If the producers expected lower prices , why did they go ahead and produce , or order the products with such high costs that they could not make a profit ? <p> If a single business firm is experiencing fewer sales , they may not be able to reduce their costs because a single firm is close to being a price taker in the markets for labor and capital . There are usually alternative uses for their factors that value them more highly , at or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales are falling everywhere , or if everyone expects this to be the case , then why will suppliers not lower their prices if they expect their costs to be lower ? <p> What are people doing with the money that they did not spend ? <p> Suppose that people postpone spending . What do they do with the money not spent ? Are they increasing their cash holdings ? Or are they spending on investment goods ? Saving and investing is a form of spending , only the expenditure is for capital goods rather than consumer goods . In this case , there would be no general decline in total spending , nor employment . Workers would have to change jobs from consumption industries to capital goods industries as Hayek explains in his essay " The Paradox of Savings " , but production would continue . <p> How much lower prices are necessary to induce people to postpone purchases ? <p> There is a return on the purchase of a consumption good , namely the services provided by the good . This must be balanced against the return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , Center for Economic Policy Research ( CEPR ) a small price change is not much of a motivation to wait , if you need a new product : <p> " Samuelson gets some of the other aspects of this issue wrong . For example , he says that Japan 's deflation is a problem in part because falling prices cause people to delay purchases since items will be cheaper in the future . This would be true for rapid rates of deflation , but Japan 's deflation has almost always been less than 1.0 percent a year . In 2011 its inflation rate was -0.2 percent . This means that if someone was considering buying a $20,000 car , they could save $40 by waiting a year . It is unlikely that this rate of deflation affected the timing of many purchases to any significant extent . " <p> Why do quantities adjust but not costs ? <p> If there is a generalized increase in money demand , then prices need to adjust downwards . Why is it that all the quantity of goods bought and the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> According to The Asia Times , when deflation strikes , factories lay workers off in order to cut costs . Why can not producers lower their bid prices to their labor force and their suppliers in order to preserve production ? If they could lower their costs , then they could produce profitably at a lower price level . <p> The general price level does not matter to business firms , so long as their costs are below their sale prices . Why does a deflationary melt-down assume that business can not operate profitably at any nominal price level ? Why can business not lower costs ? <p> The deflation death spiral is a theoretical description of a situation but it does not describe the reality of human action , for any number of reasons : <p> 1 . There is in reality always a diversity of expectations among the public . While some people will expect prices to continue in the same direction , others will form the opposite view . Everyones expectations will change not only in response to changes in the data , but taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their situation . <p> 2 . Expectations are not entirely driven by prices . A broad range of things influences our expectations about price . <p> 3 . Lower prices are not always sufficient motivation to delay purchases because everyone prefers to have what they want now , rather than later . <p> 4 . Expectations of buyers tend to be met by sellers , if not at first , then fairly soon . In some cases , buyers can hold onto their cash for a bit longer , but most businesses have no choice but to sell their inventories at what the buyer will pay . In other cases , buyers may not be able to delay purchases , or may not wish to , and will pay what they must in order to buy . <p> 5 . Everyone buyers and sellers ( and every one of us acts in both of these roles at different times ) has expectations not only about consumer prices , but about wages , employment prospects , even asset prices , the economy in general , the progress of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A coherent plan of saving and spending takes all of these things into account . <p> 6 . Expectations can be met . Buyers have a buying price . Even if not known in advance , they know it when they see it posted . Even if they do not know what they plan to buy in the future , a bargain price will be met by buyers . <p> 7 . People only need so much cash . Beyond that , they start to look around for either consumption goods , or investments . <p> The other conclusion you can draw from this is to be very wary of accepting the goverment spin on economics .

You 're more in line with the classic comedians of our time , the Bill Hickses and the George Carlins . You are not a pundit . <p> You 've certainly been in the spotlight since you called for revolution on BBC . Some hate you , some love you , but most of all , you got yourself some excellent press . I 've got to admit : well-played . <p> You 're obviously a brave man . You 've appeared on The Alex Jones Show . You are outspoken . You are unswerving in your dedication to justice and an end to global inequities . Me too , Russell . I feel your frustration , your anger , your dismay . <p> You amused me on the BBC . Thank you . I spend a life in airports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find myself in . It is mind-numbing . " Low-vibration , " communication , as you call it . And it drives me insane . <p> But , not when you were on BBC . That was something I could get behind , especially compared to most of the drivel I see on the globe 's propaganda networks . <p> Some comments surely made me cringe . One ? " Profit is a filthy word . " <p> In my opinion , " prophet " is filthier . <p> In my opinion , profit is the way we know if someone is doing a good job of something . In my personal endeavors with my multinational company , TDV Media , profit is how I know whether or not I am providing good services and products to our customers . <p> To quote you directly : <p> " I say profit is a filthy word , because wherever there is profit there is also deficit . " <p> I disagree with this statement , Russell . In my opinion , wherever there is theft , like taxation at the greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is profit , there is an exchange , and both parties leave the transaction " made-whole " , both feeling that they are better off than they were before the exchange . The businessman gets his payment , and the customer gets his good or service . Both profit . <p> As Mises wrote , " The elimination of profit , whatever methods may be resorted to for its execution , must transform society into a senseless jumble . It would create poverty for all . " <p> I also cringed when you called for a " socialist egalitarian system . " <p> But , I also understand you were n't aiming to devise an alternative system during your BBC spot . Rather , it 's almost as if you spouted the first thing that came to mind . <p> That 's okay with me . You were entertaining . That was your goal . That and to make people think for a second . You 've obviously succeeded . Kudos . <p> But , I want to share with you some of the things I 've learned in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " socialist egalitarianism . " I want to tell you what I learned about profit . <p> In the late eighties , I started a rap group that became one of the most popular in Canada . We did well initially , but our popularity waned , and I learned something : There was n't overwhelming demand for me as a rapper . <p> So I started a company , StockHouse , in the late nineties . I grew the company to $240 million USD , before the dotcom bubble burst . My company , StockHouse , lost basically all its value . I learned that , in the absence of a financially manipulated bubble , the demand for StockHouse 's service was n't quite what I originally thought it was . <p> After the dotcom bubble collapsed , and my company lost most of its value , I was quite confused , to say the least . <p> Eventually , I found myself traveling the world . It 's what I saw while traveling the world , as I am sure you can understand , which changed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial markets are manipulated . Sure , they might be manipulated by banks , but if it were n't for central banks ( creatures of the state ) , as well as corporate welfare ( money stolen by the state and given to legal fictions of the state that protect people from the consequences of their actions with corporate " personhood " ) , none of these banks would be in a position to manipulate so much as a small , gullible child . ( I imagine they could n't afford the candy to take advantage of the small child , let alone exist as a " Too Big To Fail " institution . ) <p> During my travels , I learned of libertarianism , and I learned of anarchism . I found out that I was an " anarcho-capitalist , " but this does not mean that I love to feed on the blood of the poor . <p> Instead , it means I love to create , and I love to offer what I create to the people around me without anyone getting in the way of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself an anarcho-capitalist , I do give and give and give . That 's because , despite what you may think , profit does n't mean deficit . Profit means offering something of enough value to people that they are willing to trade their own wealth for it . You 've amassed profits in the millions by providing millions of people with the kind of humor that has them handing you their money . So I 'm sure you can understand . <p> I also give in the form of time , seemingly all of the time . I am sure you can also relate to a hectic schedule , in which you 're constantly being whisked around . I speak all around the world , sharing what I 've learned on my journey . And , although I might be a dirty capitalist , the burners of Burning Man might even be surprised at how much giving some of us capitalists do . Charity is fine , by the way , as long as it is done voluntarily . And voluntary charity does n't create the dependent , permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centralized redistribution you want more of . <p> Again , I refer to Mises , " After all , it is not the frivolous doctrines of the Bohemians that generate disaster , but the fact that the public is ready to accept them favourably . The response to these pseudo philosophies on the part of the molders of public opinion and later on the part of the misguided masses is the evil . People are anxious to endorse the tenets they consider as fashionable lest they appear boorish and backward . " <p> You call for a revolution , but the revolution you are calling for has already come and gone . The 20th century was full of the revolution you are calling for . Millions of people were murdered and as many other lives were mired in collectivist misery as misguided masses let ambitious men try to beat nations into your egalitarian socialist society where profit was a dirty word . <p> If there is to be a revolution , it will be one that dispels a couple of very persistent lies . The first is that there needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progress ( in fact there is a negative correlation between having order and having a rulers ) . The second is that wealth is a zero-sum game in which profit comes at at least one party 's expensethat profit represents a deficit . The opposite is true here as well . Wealth is created as people constantly reshape the world to make life better for everyone and in the processprofit . <p> The revolution starts here , Russell .

But as I looked at my fellow school inmates around me they did n't  seem to notice . <p> By the time I reached high school I had resigned myself to just getting a passing grade to make my parents happy and move on . My goal : 50% . I did n't  want 51% if I got that , I was trying too hard . I 'd rarely show up . And when I did I 'd sit in the back row listening to the horse race reports from the warmup sessions at the track where I would go each evening and , in nearly 100 visits , perhaps recorded a loss at the end of each evening once or twice . <p> As for school , I 'd really only go for the tests . I 'd go two hours early and speed read the textbook and make sure I knew just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where on my final exam of high school I had planned it perfectly so passing the course would give me just enough to graduate and I even knew the exact score I needed on the test to pass : 62% . <p> It was social studies , which I detested for having to memorize obvious propaganda , but it was easy enough to pass the exam . I 'd short-term memorize as much as I could and the dates and places that I could n't remember I 'd write on my forearm , or my leg , or on any number of cheat sheets I had . It was a two hour exam and there were multiple choice questions worth 70% and essays worth 30% . I went through the multiple choice in about 30 minutes and knew I had enough to get 62% so I did n't  even bother with the essay section . I got up to leave and was informed that there was a " minimum time requirement of 1 hour " . <p> " A minimum time requirement , " I complained ! " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour is up , " they admonished . Servitude to unworthy authoritarian figures is the real goal of schooling in the west . Angry , and bored for the next 30 minutes , I went on to write some of the more disturbing and outright erroneous essay answer questions probably ever recorded in social studies history . <p> But , finally the hour was up and I could escape . And I did pass that course and finally was allowed out of child prison . <p> THAT WAS THEN , THIS IS NOW <p> Even back in the 1980s school was atrocious . But when I look at what is going on today I can only come to one conclusion : sending your child to public school in the US is child abuse . <p> Think Im exagerrating ? Hear me out . <p> Let 's just start with all the injections your child will receive if you force them to go for their government training .

" Parents give up their rights when they drop the children off at public school , " said Melinda Harmon , a US Federal Judge , recently . <p> Now , in a new amendment to Californias Health and Safety Code as it relates to vaccinations will take effect this fall for the 2012-2013 school year , and will require all incoming seventh graders , as well as eighth and twelfth graders for the first year , to get a Tdap booster vaccination for pertussis ( whooping cough ) before being admitted to school .

Theyll be sent home with a prescription for the highly addictive and dangerous chemical , adderall . <p> PRISON ENVIRONMENT <p> When they are n't  being dumbed down by drugs or having their immune system destroyed by vaccines they have to actually deal with their Lord of the Flies type environment . <p> Many parents actually are aware of this environment and will support it stating it is good it will toughen them up , they say . Were not so sure sending your five , ten or fifteen year old into something that is not that different than a high security prison to avoid getting shivved in the bathroom is the best way to teach them about life . You could just rent Oz for them and save them some terrible emotional scars . <p> TDV subscriber and correspondent , David Giessel , sent us these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And this : <p> Well , maximum security child prison . That 's an elementary school in Oakland . Your kids will have such warm memories of their time interned , no doubt ! <p> The cop was almost giddy as he stated , " A lot of jaws dropped when they saw me . They knew me as that kid at school that they hung around with , and then the next thing they 're in handcuffs and I 'm in a uniform . " <p> And when they are n't  being beaten up or entrapped into prison sentences by the state , they are being prepared for their future FEMA camp internment . <p> All over the United States , school children are being taken out of their classrooms , put on buses and sent to " alternate locations " during terror drills . These exercises are often called " evacuation drills " or " relocation drills " and they are more than a little disturbing . Sometimes parents are notified in advance where the kids are being taken and sometimes they are only told that the children are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since 9/11 and the Columbine school shootings , there has been a concerted effort to make school emergency drills much more " realistic " and much more intense . Unfortunately , the fact that many of these drills are deeply traumatizing many children does not seem to bother too many people . Do we really need to have " active shooter " drills where men point guns at our kids and fire blanks at them ? Do we really need to have " relocation drills " where kids are rapidly herded on to buses and told that they must surrender their cell phones because they will not be allowed to call anyone ? Our schools more closely resemble prison camps every single day , and it is our children that are suffering because of it . <p> Or , like at an elementary school in Baltimore recently , three nine-year-old girls and an eight-year-old boy were arrested for fighting and marched out of their elementary school in handcuffs . In New Haven , Connecticut a 10-year-old boy was actually arrested by police for giving another student " a wedgie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mateo , California a few months ago a 7-year-old special education student was blasted in the face with pepper spray because he would not quit climbing on the furniture . Police were then able to subdue the boy and he was " committed for a psychiatric evaluation " . <p> And , when they are n't  being arrested or handcuffed , the school will be working to ensure your child adheres to the will of the collective and does not try to be an individual and use their own mind independently as this teachers letter reinforces : <p> CHILD ABUSE <p> You can state that you have been the victim of theft and are forced to pay for these schools . And , yes , you are . But nothing can justify actually sending your children off everyday to this type of environment . If you do , you are a child abuser . Especially when homeschooling and unschooling have been made so eminently possible thanks to the internet . <p> You can then state that thanks to the socialist/fascist government and the central banks you 've been so impoverished that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive and that is why you send your kids to prison camp . But , even that is not justification enough to do this to your own children . If this is the case and you can not find any other way then leave where you live and search for a place with better opportunities . <p> Its hard . I know . It was hard for your ancestors to get on that boat and survive scurvy and come to a foreign land to make a living too . But they did it . <p> Here , at TDV , we are working on all manner of ways to help people in that situation . We are helping people get out of the western world through foreign residencies and second passports ( TDVPassports.com ) and the TDV newsletter regularly covers all these subjects . <p> The latest thing we are working on is a liberty-minded enclave , likely in Mexico to start ( and then other locations through Asia , Africa and Central/South America afterwards ) which will be built in co-housing style . Our top priority will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work and co-operate with each other to build a prosperous community . And the other main factor is price . We want to make it as cheap as possible to attract young , freedom-minded families . We are talking under $50,000 for a complete family unit and total daily living costs of under $5 , using economies of scale to efficiently provide organic food and **25;89;TOOLONG opportunities for all . Not anarcho-communism that is seriously stupid . But a community of anarchists who believe in property rights and the non-aggression principle . <p> This is the type of thing we are working on here at TDV . Stay tuned for more . In the meantime , do n't  be a fool , get your child out of school .

The measles ! <p> No , I 'm not kidding . Apparently this latest mainstream media panic is how measles is everywhere and if we all do n't get immediately vaccinated we will all get the measles ! I guess , somehow , ebola morphed into the measles what we really need is a vaccine for propaganda . <p> I think I had the measles and the mumps and the chicken pox . It definitely was not a fun couple of days but I 'm not sure it is worthy of widespread panic . <p> After all , this is how the Brady Bunch reacted in 1969 when all their kids got the measles . <p> It was a lighthearted , relaxed approach that mostly meant poor Alice just had to serve breakfast in bed for a few days . Not like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything must be done ! <p> In the 70s , if your child , named Kelly , got the measles you 'd often invite her friends over so they could all get it and then enjoy immunity . <p> In the 2010s , your child is quarantined in a room in isolation left to wear only a paper gown . Various talking heads discuss how inconsiderate and anti-science her mother is . Kelly is taken by the state and her mom arrested for depraved indifference . Next election cycle some panderer wins on a platform to pass Kelly 's Law mandating everyone vaccinate or pay fines and face jail time . <p> Of course , with wonderful democracy , it is people like this who " vote " and demand these actions . <p> Now , there is even discussions with airlines in the US to demand vaccine proof before being allowed to fly . <p> Please do n't tell me that the thing that finally stripped Amerikans of their ability to travel was n't just the proposed national I 'd cards but was the threat of the measles ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerikans are . Some have been shrieking like banshees demanding that everyone is immediately forcibly vaccinated for the measles due to the dire threat ! <p> The logic of the pro-vaxers is that everyone must be vaccinated for their own safety but this logic makes no sense . If they really believe vaccines work and they vaccinate themselves then the unvaccinated pose no risk to them . <p> And , to put it mildly , the record and evidence of vaccines , especially for things like " swine flu " is far from compelling . <p> In probably one of the most unbelievable cases , children in war torn Syria , which has been turned into near hell on Earth by the US government , were injected with the measles vaccine because of course , when you are living in a war zone you should really be worried about getting the measles ! The result ? 34 Syrian children died from taking the vaccine . <p> Even the history of vaccines and their effectivity is highly questionable . <p> I 'm no expert on vaccines , other than my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't get into a long and detailed argument about the true risks and rewards of vaccines . <p> What I will do , however , is once again sit back and watch people in the " home of the brave " be scared to death that a few kids in the USSA got the measles and shake my head . 
@@99475071 @3675071/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Is The Fed Getting Ready to Juice Once Again ? <p> Editors Note : The following is from Tampa Bay TDV Correspondent , Brett Heath <p> As fiduciaries our job is to forecast which asset classes have the highest probability of increasing in value with the least amount of risk . Since late 2008 , irrational market behavior has increased due to the monetary interventions by central banks . Herein lies the problem . The rules of the game have changed and we must change the way we look at the markets as well . <p> Governments around the world have been using their central banks to extend the life of the current economic system . Confirmation of this behavior is evident in the diminishing number of foreign buyers of US debt , yet we are at record low yields . <p> Without the largest buyers in the treasury market to soak up the ever-increasing supply , we know the Fed must inevitably intervene and fill that gap again . This brings us to the Feds bond buying programs , each more cleverly named than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets have reacted or anticipated this type of easy monetary policy . The following chart of the S&amp;P 500 was generated in 2008 during the announcement of QE1 . The market anticipated the announcement and reversed on big volume the day before . The result was a 21.6% move in five trading days . <p> When this proposed stimulus was n't sufficient to pump the markets higher and interest rates lower , the Fed expanded its program to $1.25 trillion on March 18th 2009 . Again this was anticipated six trading days earlier with a reversal of 13% before the announcement was made . <p> During the summer of 2010 , market volatility picked up at an intense pace . The stimulus engine was running out of steam and it looked like the market was about to roll over . The Fed announced at Jackson Hole , Wyoming on August 27th 2010 its intentions for a QE2 program . The market responded with a rally of over 20% during the next 4 months . <p> Towards the end of the summer of 2011 , stimulus again began to run dry causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term QE had so much negative press attached to it that the Fed announced a bond buying program under the name " Operation Twist " on September 21st 2011 . The market reaction was strong again ; in a little over a month the market moved almost another 20% from low to high . <p> So here we are mid-June 2012 , and once again the previous program is coming to an end . We see the resurgence of market volatility as the Fed has managed to push interest rates to previously unimaginable levels . On June 6th 2012 we noted that the Dow was up almost 300 points on no significant news . At this stage in the monetary easing cycle , we think the market is anticipating another program to be announced in the near future , maybe even in the next two weeks . <p> The chart below confirms current market behavior similar to what is previously described in this article . <p> The probability of a new bond buying program increased after the big move in the DOW and S&amp;P on June 7 , 2012 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more stimulus programs . Normally this would send markets violently lower , but they finished higher and up again the following day into the weekend . <p> Market behavior today is truly irrational . Navigating these treacherous waters requires years of training your mind to see the world through an objective lens . Today we see that the market has only two asset classes : risk on and risk off . The problem is that the central banks have placed the wrong label on the underlying assets through monetary intervention . The WEE ( Washington Economic Establishment ) has convinced the general market opinion that the US government Treasury Bond is one of the safest assets , even though we see this as one of the riskiest . To put this in perspective , take a look at this long-term chart on the 30 year US Treasury Bond . <p> Financial Timesreported on June 8th : LONG ... type of behavior is reminiscent of the top of the real estate market in 2006 . <p> As the money flows into these return free risk assets at record levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior gold and silver producers trading at record low multiples relative to the metals they produce . <p> Brett Heath is a Dollar Vigilante subscriber based in Newport Beach , California and is a full time investor and a founding principal of KSIR Capital , LLC .

However , there are downsides definitely book ahead at any restaurant or know somebody ( which of course I always do here ) or you 'll be constantly waiting for a table ( and that also is a big business opportunity in a recent TDV newsletter to subscribers I offered a serious business opportunity here ) . But , even without my input , any entrepreneur who came here would instantly recognize countless ways to create wealth . <p> Just watching all the bartenders at my current location is astounding .

It recounts how a female college student was ambushed by seven thugs from a gang called ABC . It apparently stands for the Alcoholic Beverage Control agency . By the way , lame name for a gang . They apparently thought she was carrying a six pack of beer . Where anywhere else in the world would just be called a party or , at worst , a nice night at home .

She drove a block and called the police ! <p> This is how insane it has gotten in the USSA . Cops are constantly attacking and killing people and , very often , the only thing that brainwashed , publicly edumacated slaves can do is call the very same people that committed the crime !

But occasionally I find myself watching cop stories and having to shut my moral outrage off , or at least turn it way the hell down . <p> This was the case with The Heat . The scenes that introduce the two main cop characters are both so full of insulting assumptions of the state 's right to tell people what to do with their bodies and what to put in them that I had to stop watching after just 20 minutes .

" <p> Ugh . <p> And then a little later we meet the overweight , foul-mouthed and unpleasant local Boston City detective lady who will partner up with Sandra 's " straight man " character . The Boston cop disrupts a man 's attempt to pick up a prostitute ( the frustrated john is that actor who plays the one-handed brother in Arrested Development , by the way ) . She puts him in handcuffs in the back of her car and then heads off to harrass , chase and kidnap a fey black pimp and drug dealer on the grounds that he is smoking marijuana in public . <p> Granted , the jokes and acting are funny .

Or a public service announcement short from the ' 40s about keeping one 's women , children and colored folk in line with regular , sound beatings . <p> It was vulgar . And it made me sad to think that so many in the world casually agree with this fundamental immoralitythat a ) there ought to be a central monopoly on violence to prevent unpopular but non-aggressive activities and b ) if the government says it 's not allowed , then it is right that it should not allowed .

@@99475076 @3675076/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Will Obama Confiscate Guns and Gold ? <p> Editors Note : The following post is by TDV contributor , Wendy McElroy . <p> Barack Obama often compares himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt . When he does , gold owners reach for a gun , of which they usually have several . Gold and guns are becoming politically entangled , and a connecting word is often " confiscation . " <p> The prospect of gun confiscation is fueling discussion of FDR 's 1933 nationalization of gold ownership , which resembled Hugo Chavez 's nationalization of Venezuelan gold mines in 2011 . FDR did so by executive order ; Chavez did so by decree . If guns in America are also ' nationalized ' , then the 1933 gold grab may have insights on how the state could proceed and how American public may react . <p> IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1933 GOLD HEIST <p> Roosevelt was inaugurated as President on March 4th , 1933 . He immediately moved to outlaw the private ownership of gold . He proceeded in several steps . <p> On March 6th , FDR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt " heavy and unwarranted withdrawals of gold and currency from our banking institutions for the purpose of hoarding " ; that is , to cease redeeming money for gold or releasing client-held gold from its vaults . FDR blamed the " severe drain on the Nation 's stocks of gold " on foreign speculation and individual hoarding , which were causing a " national emergency . " The President assumed the power to " investigate , regulate or prohibit " the so-called wrongful use of gold . Americans violating the Proclamation or the regulations produced under its authority would " be fined not more than $10,000 " or " imprisoned for not more than ten years , or both . " <p> On March 9th , the Emergency Banking Act passed Congress without being read because it had not been distributed . The Act affirmed all of FDR 's orders since March 4th , and amended the WWI Trading with the Enemy Act to give the President " absolute control over the national finances and foreign exchange " not only in times of war but also in emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold that they possess or have custody of to the Treasury " in return for other lawful currency . Only Federal Reserve-approved and accountable banks were to remain open ; private or independent banks were no longer permitted . In effect , all banks had to meet Fed regulations , including reporting and turning over gold in their vaults upon demand . <p> On April 5th , FDR signed Executive Order 6102 that prohibited the ownership , called " hoarding , " of " gold coin , gold bullion , and gold certificatesby individuals , partnerships , associations and corporations . " ( There were minor exceptions such as jewelry . ) Gold-holders had until the end of April to surrender gold to the Federal Reserve . They were reimbursed in currency worth $20.67 , which had been the gold price per troy ounce since the late 1800s . <p> On January 30th , 1934 , the Gold Reserve Act required the Federal Reserve to surrender its gold and gold certificates to the US Treasury . It also arbitrarily changed the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government increased the value of its gold by 69% . <p> The process : a declaration of absolute Presidential authority ; Congressional affirmation ; an executive order of implementation ; and , an arbitrary devaluation of the dollar to increase government 's wealth . <p> Remember that Obama models himself on FDR A good reason to get your larger gold holdings out of Dodge and beyond his reach while you can . Ed . . Obama actively pursues a path of regulation through executive orders . For example , a January 16th , 2013 Forbes headline reads , " Here Are The 23 Executive Orders On Gun Safety Signed Today By The President . " Obama also favors rule through policies imposed by massive and unaccountable federal agencies of which there are close to 70 ; their counterparts in FDR 's time were called Alphabet Agencies . Congressional approval is rarely required . Executive power has swelled since FDR 's days and Congress has been largely reduced to a funding role . As for devaluing the dollar , what else can you call the incessant increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to spend the new dollars before they can devalue through circulation . The main element missing from the FDR procedure is the executive order that provides implementation . <p> But how will the American people respond ? <p> A PASSIVE PEOPLE NO MORE ? <p> FDR was able to confiscate private gold for a combination of reasons . A major one was the cooperation of banks under the Federal Reserve . But what of the multitudes who directly surrendered their wealth ? ( In 1933 , gold still circulated as currency and private ownership was widespread . ) <p> One reason was fear of punishment . Another was patriotism . The Austrian economist Thomas Woods explained yet another reason . " The paper currency $20.67 they were receiving in exchange for the gold had always been redeemable in gold in the past . " It was only later that they realized " they were n't getting that gold back , and that the paper dollars they were being given in exchange would be devalued . " In short , they were duped . <p> Today 's gold-holding public is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulating currency and those who buy it do so knowing that government is devaluing every dollar through inflation . Moreover , they know history . <p> Will Obama move to confiscate gold ? No one knows . If he does , I expect it will not start as a direct confiscation from individuals . It would probably begin through steps to nationalizing private retirement accounts such as IRAs . This could happen in one of two ways : require accounts to hold some percentage of government security , especially Treasury bonds ; or , have a government agency manage the accounts . <p> " Just as with thenationalization of Healthcare , the tremendous amount of funds in private retirement plans and IRA accounts are also being targeted to meet future revenue needs . Bills have just been introduced in both the House and Senate to create the new Auto IRA accounts which will at first be voluntary but later will become mandatory like Social Security and I expect the early 3% employee after tax contribution levels to eventually rise to 10 to 15% of compensation rising even more than Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step to replace our private system with a forced , government controlled Social Security type program . In addition they will force much of your retirement funds into buying junk treasury bonds along with the Federal Reserve when the dollar/national debt crisis hits as billions of retirement funds become the buyer of last resort " ( Auto IRA bills remain in both the House and the Senate , a glaring sign that you should get into a self-directed IRA while there 's still time . ) <p> The relevance of such " pension reform " to gold is twofold : many retirement funds contain a considerable amount of gold in some form ; and , the state control would set a precedent . <p> Gold confiscation would likely begin with pension accounts because the state mechanisms to do so are already in place . Moreover , as with the gold in FDR-era bank vaults , the location and quantity is known ; the organizations holding it would cooperate fully . ( Again , more reason to make sure your IRA is self-directed and that you can internationalize the assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more problematic , and not merely because of its comparative anonymity . Direct confiscation returns us to guns . Given the personality of the typical gold bug and the simmering state of society , Obama must know that gun confiscation is a political prerequisite of a direct gold grab . On February 13th , the UK Market Oracle predicted for 2013 , " The collection programs for guns will be eclipsed by collection of private pension funds and perhaps gold itself . " Guns and gold are blurring . <p> Will Obama confiscate gold ? Indeed , no one but Obama and his cronies know for sure . But if you pay attention , you can almost hear and see the gears in Obama 's head turning as he comes up with a cover story to rationalize confiscating gold like his hero FDR did . As the saying goes , it 's written on his executive order-issuing , drone-sending , dictatorial face . His speechwriters are probably already through the first couple of drafts of what Obama will read to the public school-educated American multitudes the majority of whom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech will undoubtedly be full of references to hoarding with lots of buzz words like " profiteering " and " fair share " . Gold owners will be cast as greedy , selfish a-holes who are making money hand over fist on the suffering of the masses in the killing grip of inflation . We can guarantee you that the central bank will not once come up as a possible culprit , even as more and more quantitative easing is announced . And it will be harped upon that a lot of those greedy gold-hoarders are mostly those same " soulless " jerks who stocked up on guns after the Sandy Hook massacre ! <p> The grab for gold will no doubt grow out of the grab for guns , and will be based largely on vilification of the group of people who tend to own both : the sort of people who read , who think , who know history and who therefore just do n't trust the state , its monopoly on currency or its burning desire to disarm its tax serfs . That also happens to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can see it coming . So you should get prepared . You should keep some gold on hand and hidden in a very secret part of your basement , not in a bank vault . But in the age of all-seeing drones , even that may not be enough .

@@99475078 @3675078/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Central Bank Theater 28883 @qwx888883 <p> As the curtain rose on the economic stage , it revealed politicians and central bankers hand-in-hand , ready to act out a farce . <p> A June 23rd article in Bloombergconstituted the first review . It opened , " Germany has decided its gold is safe in American hands . " The gold in question is the massive German reserve that is allegedly stored at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( NY Fed ) . On January 16 , 2013 Germanys central bank , the Bundesbank or BuBa to its critics announced an intention to repatriate a sizable portion of its gold from the NY Fed by 2020 . But , now , the government 's budget spokesman Norbert Barthle declared , " The Americans are taking good care of our gold . Objectively , there 's absolutely no reason for mistrust . " <p> Objectively , there 's no reason for trust . The repatriation was requested precisely because popular opposition leaders are convinced the NY vaults are either deficient or empty . The German people agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , the German government itself has displayed a deep distrust of America . For example , Germany recently declined to renew its contract with the telecom giant Verizon . Tobias Plate , a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry , explained , " There are indications that Verizon is legally required to provide certain things to the NSA . " Specifically , the government suspects Verizon will monitor the communications of top officials in the same manner that Chancellor Angela Merkel was " intercepted " by the NSA . <p> The abysmal history of gold repatriation should be another source for skepticism . In a June 16 article entitled " Is the worlds biggest gold vault empty ? , " the UK financial magazine Moneyweek explained , " When the German government recently asked to see around 1,536 tonnes of German gold stored in that vault , which amounts to roughly half of Berlins reserves , Der Spiegel reports that the Federal Reserve refused to allow German inspectors to view them . " The reason cited ? Inspection was not " in the interest of security and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The US agreed that 674 tonnes would be repatriated over eight years . That 's an annual run rate of about 84 tonnes a year . " It should have been repatriated upon demand . It should have been no problem . The US is supposedly the world 's largest holder of gold with over 8,000 tons of its own ; the German gold has supposedly been stored untouched . There was a problem . Despite the passage of over 18 months , the US only managed to repatriate five tonnes of gold back to Germany . <p> Normal logic should lead German officials to scream " foul play ! " Instead , government logic led them to proclaim confidence in the NY Fed . The reasons for doing so are both political and economic . <p> Political Payoff For ' Trusting ' The Yanks <p> Merkel does not trust the US . The German Parliament continues to investigate the NSA 's monitoring of its officials despite US Requests to drop the matter . And there is a growing call to grant asylum to whistle blower Edward Snowden . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises were not as paper thin as its dollars . <p> 1 ) Merkel and her government can avoid the public embarrassment at being duped by Americaagain . Merkel has been Chancellor of Germany since 2005 . She has presided over the European Council and chaired the G8 . During several financial crises , including the bailout of Greece , Merkel earned the nickname " the decider " due to the financial power Germany wields . What nickname would Merkel ' earn ' if she were exposed as the victim of a scam that makes Nigerian ones pale in comparison . After the public embarrassment , of course , would come a public rage that could end her shaky coalition government . <p> 2 ) The Bloomberg article cited above is entitled " German Gold Stays in New York in Rebuff to Euro Doubters . " The Euro-Doubters and -Critics are adamant opponents of the European Union and of Merkel who considers the EU to be her legacy . Rebuffing the Critics must be deeply satisfying to " Mutti " ( Mom ) , another of Merkel 's nicknames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way toward healing a political rift between the two nations . When Germany demanded its gold back , the Fed reacted with fury . It finally agreed to repatriate the gold over a seven year period a promise on which it spectacularly reneged , delivering a small fraction of what was promised for the first delivery . <p> Economic Reasons For Not Demanding Gold Back <p> Peter Boehringer , leader of the " Repatriate our Gold " movement , quickly refuted the Bloomberg article by posting at length in its commentary thread . Blasting the piece for its uncritical approach to the " statements of politicians and BuBa-bankers . " He summarized his critique ; the piece was " a ' non-news ' article with a wrong headline , strange interviewees , old news , and with a clearly apologetic ideological approach : the main purpose seems to be NOT to give space to the myriad of unanswered and extremely relevant questions BuBa and the Fed have been refusing to answer for decades . " Boehringer vowed to continue the public repatriation campaign . <p> Nevertheless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the entire system of international finances is a house of cards . If one card is pulled out , then the entire structure collapses . Every central bank will lie , cheat and falsify records in order to prop up a system upon which their continued and misallocating existence depends . <p> They need to protect a scam practice called " gold leasing . " In extremely simplistic terms , this is how it works . Central banks lease gold to bullion banks ( e.g. Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan ) at a tiny rate of return ; the gold is supposed to come back at an agreed upon date . Meanwhile , the bullion banks sell the physical gold at market rates and use the money to buy Treasury bonds which give a much higher rate of return than is being paid to lease . The central banks continue to list the gold on their balance sheets as an asset . This means the amount of gold is artificially inflated and the price of every real ounce is suppressed . <p> Meanwhile , the bullion banks hedge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by buying futures contracts . When the lease time expires , the bullion banks can return the gold or its cash equivalent and pocket a neat profit . Or the period of lease may be extended to become a de facto permanent loan . This is the basic structure of what is called the gold carry trade . ( There are other expressions of the trade such as gold swaps between central banks , which further inflate the amount of real gold available . ) <p> Governments like the system because it props up the price of bonds and allows them to inflate the currency while keeping interest rates low . If the credit-fueled boom lasts , everyone makes moneyas long as " everyone " is defined as governments and banks . But the bubble depends on maintaining the lie of how much physical gold the banks are holding . <p> The myth that German gold is safe in American vaults is part of suppressing gold prices because discovery of the gold 's absence could cause other vaults to be inspected and the general dearth of physical gold to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank to demand gold back . A bullion bank would have to buy the physical gold it needs to return at what might be ruinous prices ; big banks could fail . One question too many could topple the scam . <p> And , so , the German government and BuBa " trust " the NY Fed with their nonexistent gold even when they do not trust America in the slightest . Those who wish to understand Germany 's real attitude should stop listening to politicians and start watching their actions . For example , in March , Merkel struck a deal with China to make Frankfurt a clearing and settling hub for Chinese currency in Europe . This is widely viewed as a step back from the U.S. Dollar . Germany is in a position to know .

I was delighted to be informed of not only my ability , but also my obligation to do so . Thank you for your kind offer ! <p> Its hard to know where to begin . I guess the first suspicious activity I would like to report was in 1910 when Senator Nelson Aldrich sent his private railroad car to the railroad station in New Jersey and six other men were told to come under conditions of great secrecy . Each of these men were told to arrive one at a time and not to dine with each other on the night of their departure . They were told that should they arrive at the station at the same time they should pretend like they did n't  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a day on board this car and they arrived after a 1,000 mile journey to Brunswick , Georgia . From there they took a ferry across the inland straits and they ended up on Jekyll Island in the clubhouse where for the next nine days they sat around the table and hammered out all the important details of what eventually became a private takeover of the US monetary system via the creation of the Federal Reserve System . <p> It should be noted that no private central bank was allowed under the US constitution and , in fact , having a central bank have the power to create money had been warned against by many of the founding fathers of America . Even President Woodrow Wilson , in power at the time stated most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world . No longer a government by free opinion , no longer a of dominant men . " <p> Yet , despite all of this , nothing has ever been done and this small group of men still control the money system in the US and now centrally plan the economy , Soviet Union style , with utmost secrecy . <p> It also seems strange and suspicious that the gold supposedly held in Fort Knox has n't  been officially audited by an outside auditor since 1953 . I know we should , of course , trust the US government , but itd be nice just to check to make sure its still there . Its been more than 50 years since anyone counted it . <p> It also seemed suspicious that the US government cut off Japans oil supply in 1941 which for all intents and purposes forced Japan to react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japans oil supply led to the US being drawn into World War II where 418,500 Americans were killed and also led to the largest civilian terrorist attack ever committed , the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , with the total deaths of civilian men , women and children amounting to approximately 200,000 . Yet no one has ever been investigated or taken to task for provoking Japan into its attack on the US . <p> It also was suspicious that an outright lie , the Gulf of Tonkin event , was the reason why the US invaded Vietnam resulting in the death of more than a million Vietnamese and 58,236 Americans . <p> I also noticed some suspicious activity with regards to 9/11 . I found it quite suspicious that at the most secure facility in the world , the Pentagon , not one camera caught video of the plane that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon . It is also strange that World Trade Center building 7 collapsed completely , at freefall speed into its own footprint without having been hit by a plane . Its also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the collision and subsequent explosion but no flight data recorders have ever been found . I refer you to the following documentary , Loose Change , for literally hundreds of other suspicious activities that occured on September 11 , 2011 , which actually led to the formation of your agency . <p> It is also suspicious that the reasons given for the US government invading Iraq in 2003 , Weapons of Mass Destruction , have all turned out to be lies or blatantly wrong information . This war , to date , has resulted in the death of 4,400 Americans and over 100,000 Iraqis . Not one person has been taken to task for this and , in fact , the administration who committed this serious act now jokes about it . <p> It is also strange that since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007 the US government and Federal Reserve have bailed out bankers to the tune of over $10 trillion . Especially considering that the financial crisis was supposedly caused by a crash in US real estate and the total outstanding value of all US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why would the government have put US taxpayers more than $28,000 per person more in debt to pay off a handful of connected bankers who had made very risky bets instead of just paying off every mortgage in the US with the same funds or just allowing the bankers to take their rightful losses ? <p> I could go on and on Janet , but those are just a few of the suspicious activities I have noticed . These activities alone have resulted in millions of deaths and trillions of dollars stolen from American taxpayers and paid to politically connected bankers . <p> I know you are busy installing $350 million worth of naked scanners which are being sold by your former boss , Michael Chertoff , into airports nationwide . I have to congratulate you on your amazing speed and efficiency on buying these millions of dollars worth of scanners only months after the underwear bomber you allowed on a flight , despite his being on your no-fly list . <p> I 'll keep my eye out for any other suspicious activity Janet .

This utterly wrong notion is what Ralph Benko seems to be suggesting in his recent article on NationalInterest.org titled " How to Go Gold " . <p> Basically Benko sees a return to gold through world government initiative and collaboration , starting with the US president . He appears to cite evidence that this is underway , starting with the central bank 's buying of gold . Then Benko concludes by citing Lewis Lehrman 's 5 steps back to a " classical " gold standard : <p> Step 1 . America leads by the president announcing unilateral resumption of the gold monetary standard at a certain date , not more than four years in the future ( allowing for a market adjustment period ) . <p> Step 2 . The president issues an executive order eliminating any and all taxes imposed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Shortly after the announcement in Step 1 , the United States calls for an International Monetary Conference of interested nations to provide for multilateral currency convertibility to gold , and the deliberate termination of the dollar-based official reserve currency system . <p> Step 4 . The conference agreement attended by representatives of the BIS , IMF , WTO , and the World Bank would establish gold as the means by which nations would settle residual balance-of-payments deficits . <p> Step 5 . A multilateral international gold standard the result of the currency convertibility agreement would effectively terminate floating exchange rates , reestablishing stable exchange rates among the major nations . <p> Obviously I disagree with this stupid idea . Lehrman is Ron Paul 's ally from back in the Reagan days ( when they were the only two on Reagan 's gold standard commission who actually favored going to gold ) , though Paul appears to have moved increasingly towards anarcho-capitalism since then . <p> But the above solution is anything but an anarchist ( read " a true free market " ) one . The obvious reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpinnings of the Fed , for one ( the Fed being backed by the coercion of government ) . That is to say , there is no repealing the Fed 's legal tender and other monopoly privileges or the government 's protection of such , and allowing the market to determine what should be the instrument of sound money . ( Hint : the market may not choose gold as sound money . ) <p> We may think gold would be the market 's first choice as sound money , but the market ( i.e. all of us ) choosing is different than having the choice imposed via government . <p> About 10 years ago I wrote an essay about how central banking and sound money are mutually exclusive that they can not co-exist in the same economy anymore than lovemaking and rape can co-exist in the same act . It has to be one OR the other . Hence , the return to sound money can not be achieved without ending the Fed .

Limit or abolish the taxing power of the federal government <p> 5 . Repeal all remaining industry protections and subsidies <p> 6 .

But I have to wonder if there would be too much chaos any other way . <p> Of course , the world is likely going the " other " way .

Ed founded goldenbar.com in 2001 , a website publishing his gold &amp; currency digest portending the collapse of the strong dollar policy and the rise of the secular bull market in gold and commodities . He was one of the first to make the call for $2,000 gold ( he now is calling for $5,000-$10,000 gold ) , back when it was still struggling with $300 per ounce and it was a sin to own it . <p> The thing about us anarcho-capitalists is that we 're utterly peaceful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why we would like the state to go away .

You know : regulation , taxation , money supply monopoly But then , it would n't be the state ! Even if the state were to enforce a seemingly good idea like the gold standard , the fact that government power was involved would make it go sour ( as Ed reminded us in the case of postwar Britain ) .

@@99475087 @3675087/ <h> Tax Day Cometh : To Hold Or Not To Hold an IRA <p> Tomorrow in the US is the last day for tax slaves to pay their extortion fees . It ' s a day , as a Permanent Tourist/Prior Taxpayer ( PT ) , on which I remember how lucky I am to legally not have to pay income tax in any jurisdiction . But , I realize it is a painful day for many . In a way it is painful for me , also , to know that millions are being forced at gunpoint to hand over a large amount of their income to the biggest terrorist organization on Earth ( the definition of terrorism being " the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce , especially for political purposes " ) , the US federal government . <p> Unfortunately , millions are still subject to this tyrannical organization and have to find any way possible to reduce their tithe . <p> One of the popular ways to lower your extortion ( tax ) burden is to roll some portion of your income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it is withdrawn at a later date . <p> Based on your own personal situation this may or may not have been something reasonable to consider in the past . But , in my estimation , people should stay away from putting more funds into an IRA . The reason being is that the US government is now very close to complete bankruptcy and un-taxed funds in IRAs ( some estimates have it over $18 trillion currently in IRAs ) will become sitting ducks for the US government to seize or take-over to stay afloat . Barack Obama made the first pretext to this earlier this year with the launch of MyRA which would be an IRA held entirely in government debt . <p> As well , the US government ' s fiscal situation does nothing but get worse year-after-year and if any attempt is to be made to continue to look solvent then tax rates will have to rise . This means that you will have put the funds in at a lower tax rate only to withdraw them later at a higher tax rate . Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will likely demand that IRAs be invested in government debt to keep it solvent and then inflation , or hyperinflation , will erode away any paltry nominal gains made on the interest . <p> So , I suggest you think very carefully about putting your funds into an IRA at this time . <p> Now , for those who already have funds in an IRA , here are some options to consider : <p> Withdraw The Funds . Why withdraw them ? For the reasons laid out above . IRA funds are sitting ducks . Can you withdraw them ? There are differing rules on types of IRAs but you can usually withdraw them IF you pay the income tax due when you withdraw ( which will be deemed as part of your income for that year ) and usually a 10% penalty if you are younger than 59.5 years old . If you are older than 59.5 there is no 10% penalty . <p> In a regular IRA you are usually limited to owning only stocks , bonds or mutual funds . Stocks are nearing the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be due to money printing which means any gains won ' t be real gains as the price of everything will be rising . <p> Bonds are a nearly sure-thing loser with interest rates in most Western countries near 0% and some even now into negative interest and as interest rates rise , the value of bonds falls . And mutual funds usually just hold stocks and bonds . With a self-directed IRA you can own a much wider array of assets and , more importantly , they can be anywhere in the world and not just in the US . <p> As example , you could buy an investment property anywhere in the world and hold it in your self-directed IRA . With the US dollar up against almost every other currency at the moment it is a fantastic time to bargain hunt for foreign real estate bargains . <p> As just one example , at AcaCondos , a company I founded nearly a decade ago , you can buy beach front condos in Acapulco for under $70,000 and it is 100% managed and rented out for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would qualify to be held in a self-directed IRA . Other things you can own in a self-directed IRA include almost any asset including precious metals stored abroad . <p> A Precious Metals Only IRA . A self-directed IRA is a bit more complex and so if you just want to put your funds into a specially designed IRA that is held in precious metals , check out the Hard Assets Alliance " SmartMetals IRA " . It is an all-in-one IRA that is fast and easy and can have your IRA converted into precious metals held offshore quickly and easily . You can get more information on that here . <p> As I ' ve said before , the coming years will be the most dangerous time in history for human capital . Ignore pretty much everything you hear on CNBC and from most government registered financial advisors . You are going to have to take control of your own financial future to have a reasonable chance of surviving the coming collapse . <p> Not many out there call a spade a spade as I do and pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent , as a bit of " tough love " to those who still don ' t realize that what worked in the past few decades will NOT work in the next few decades or more likely years or even months . <p> Self-actualization is paramount and taking at least a modicum of control of your assets now will give you at least a feeling of empowerment . <p> Or , you can just let the government steward your hard earned capital .

In this view , all of the participants in bitcoin are working towards preserving , growing and marketing the 24/7 , global project . They are , in a way , contractors for the technology .

Like any job , helping to develop bitcoin and the bitcoin ecosystem can trigger stress and all its associated detriments . <p> Even when a person is in an industry beaming with success , they might not have the best of luck or make the " right " decisions .

Its " free " , but in truth , it is not . Its paid for by prostitution of our mind . So , then it is easy to see why , in case of the internet , as soon as there is a pressure from the competition , then the direction of change is going to be from more exclusive to less exclusive , from complex to simple , from expensive to cheap , from capable to useless , from real to imaginary .

This action by Banamex USA is , of course , because of FATCA , which has forced 77,000 banks in 70 countries to surrender all information on American customers to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) or be extorted and possibly put out of business altogether . <p> Banamex USA , a subsidary of Citibank with its headquarters in Los Angeles , has sent letters to many US customers informing them that their accounts will be closed June 30 . As one online commenter wrote : <p> " No more SS check deposits : no more linking of accounts to Banamex Mexico , no more credit card , no more ATM for free , no more nada . " <p> One customer was told that it was a " bank decision " with no reason given why . This move has left former account holders scrambling to find a bank that will let them open an account without their presence in Mexico , something likely impossible to find . <p> It does not appear that all accounts will be closed , but nobody knows Banamex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US who we have contacted who are confused about what is going on . <p> What 's for sure is this : Are you an American expatriate living abroad or an American currently thinking of moving abroad ? This could and likely will happen to you . <p> OPTIONS FOR US EXPATS IN MEXICO <p> There are many ways to protect yourself and to sidestep many of the issues that FATCA will be bringing upon US citizens trying to transact in the financial system worldwide . <p> In the case of Americans who live and/or spend a large amount of time each year in Mexico one solution is to attain Mexican citizenship ( this is a process that TDV Passports can help with ) . By doing this you can still have bank accounts in Mexico if you so chose as you can open the account as a Mexican citizen , not as a US citizen , thereby not being restricted by banks that do wish to deal with US citizens due to the egregious nature and expense of filing with the US government all transactions of US citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a very prudent move as it has become very difficult to do anything financially , worldwide , as a US citizen . It also has a tremendous amount of side-benefits including large tax breaks ( up to nearly $200,000 per year , tax free , for a married couple if they live outside of the US ) and if you choose to renounce your US citizenship the benefits can be massive for those with a high net worth or income as this would unchain US citizens from the worldwide taxation imposed on them by the US government . <p> Other options that are still available to US citizens is to re-organize their affairs internationally using things like offshore trusts which are specifically set-up in a way that FATCA regulations do not apply to it . This is a service , for high net worth ( over $1 million ) US citizens that is offered exclusively by TDV Wealth Management ( TDVWM ) . TDVWM has recently held two Crisis Conferences in Panama and in Mexico helping US citizens stay ahead of the curve and to organize their affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more banks worldwide closing accounts for Americans . <p> We also predict that more countries in the West will begin to enact FATCA like controls as the economy in the West continues to fall and governments begin to enact more egregious worldwide taxation laws . In the case of Canadians , for example , many " snowbirds " ( those that are retired and usually spend six months or more per year in the US ) are beginning to be deemed " US resident " even without their knowledge and will soon find themselves under attack by the IRS for tax liabilities . As well , the Canadian and US governments have reached all manner of agreements tying the sharing of financial information between the two countries . <p> As we 've researched and written here and at TDV Wealth Management Crisis Conferences ( which we will be holding another one soon , likely in Mexico due to recent events ) , FATCA is very real and Americans abroad will be forced to adapt and quickly .

@@99475099 @3675099/ <h> How Not to Start a Business in Mexico <p> Recently , during one of my frequent visits to LewRockwell.com , an article caught my attention . It was titled , " So , How Can I Make a Living in Mexico ? " written by Jim Karger of The Dollar Vigilante . It piqued my interest because I had actually attempted to make it in business in Mexico . <p> For about a year during 2006-2007 my wife ( fiancT at the time ) and I made our foray into the wild world of small business . We moved to the beautiful town of San Miguel de Allende , Mexico , loved the place , and decided to strike out on our own and support ourselves with a local business . Our dream and vision was to create a bohemian-chic art-cafT near the Art Institute and attract a wide range of artists , locals , and tourists . The Gypsy CafT opened and over a few months expanded into a restaurant , and then a bar , and finally closed its doors in the spring of 2007 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missteps into 7 categories . I hope these lessons will be helpful to other aspiring entrepreneurs . <p> 1 . Lack of Capital <p> Though a clichT , it is true and can not be stressed enough . We had what I thought was a decent amount of startup capital . We planned , prepared spreadsheets , created budgets . But once the " go " decision is made , its a race against the clock to open the doors and start bringing in cash . In the meantime money burns fast . There is always something unexpected . <p> We were all in . We had no additional savings or backup . When the doors opened for business , we had only enough to cover a few months of rent . Through tenacity and hard work , we actually began breaking even after only a couple of months . But , this was not an optimal situation . Restaurants notoriously lose money for months before turning a profit . <p> So , always budget extra for the unexpected and leave a cushion of savings to live on in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high hurdle , consider a business with minimal start-up costs . <p> 2 . Insufficient Market Intelligence <p> It is good advice to talk to the locals anywhere , but especially true in a small town in Mexico . We had only lived in San Miguel de Allende for a short time and thought we had it figured out . We had a great idea to do something no one else was doing . We planned things on paper . I even went to a barista course in Guadalajara . I knew I could make some of the best coffee in town . But it takes more than that . It takes a certain amount of street smarts . We were really quite nanve about many of the softer skills of business operations that can be difficult to foresee such as locating the best suppliers , creating effective advertising , and reacting to changes in customer preferences . <p> Just one example is that we opened without a liquor license and thought we did n't  need one until we hired an Italian chef and started making pasta . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian then took us to the local cerveceria ( beer distributor ) . What we did n't  know is that the cerveceria can get you a liquor license for free as long as you agree to buy from them . They do n't  teach that in business school . <p> 3 . Work the System <p> This lesson is similar to the previous . When operating a business in Mexico , or any foreign country , it is a tremendous help to have a partner from that country . In my case my wife is a Mexican citizen , which eased much of our paperwork troubles . Even so , neither of us had operated a business before , so we had a lot to learn when it came to the authorities . One aspect of Mexican local governments ( which I was very frustrated with at the time , but later came to appreciate ) is that while they can be very inefficient and slow , they can be flexible in some cases . The trick is to know which rules can be bent and when you can bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were just ready to open and acquiring various permits , the " Uso de Suelo " permit was taking particularly long to get approved . We were worried we could n't open , so we asked our local accountant what we should do . His response : " Open ! " In other words : " do n't  wait on them , open your doors and start making money ! " We did , and sure enough , the inspector showed up a week or so later , and our permit was approved . Its not that easy in every case , so ask around to find out how to get things done efficiently . <p> 4 . La Migra <p> This topic is worthy of a whole book . If you 're going to do business abroad , you 're going to have to deal with immigration . And similar to other government entities , it is slow , confusing , and frustrating . But , having dealt with the US immigration system as well ( worthy of another book ) , I would take the Mexican system any day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English in Mexico , so I had a work visa . But I needed a visa for the Gypsy CafT . So , my wife and I went to the local immigration office . There we were able to sit down and talk to an official regarding our situation and get some minimal advice . We filled out the paperwork as they asked , and a month later got our response : Denied . It was like a kick to the gut . The official was empathetic but could not give us an explanation other than " it was decided by the director . " That 's when we got smart and hired a lawyer . The lawyer filed my papers and a couple months later I had my official work visa . <p> Note : Immigration laws got a significant revamp and are going into effect soon , making it possibly easier to obtain a work permit/visa . Still , hiring a competent , local , immigration lawyer is wise . They know the system , the officials , and they will get your papers approved . Its worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some may disagree with this , but I absolutely hate paying rent . We did not initially consider buying a place , but a month into the lease I was already regretting it . Finding real estate within walking distance to the town centro in San Miguel de Allende is not easy . So , when we found a place suitable for a cafT , we jumped on it . My wife and I made several upgrades and renovations to the place that we paid for . The landlord only showed up to collect the rent , which is not an uncommon situation in any country . What is interesting about Mexico is that there are very few zoning laws , making it possible to live and run a business in the same place ( its also why in the US I have to drive a mile from my house to get a candy bar ) . It is common in Mexico to see storefront shops where the owners live in the back or upstairs . <p> In addition , we later found out from the cerveceria manager that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our space . We got suckered . So , if renting is a necessary evil , shop around and negotiate like crazy . Another trick a landlord can pull is to not renew the lease , effectively terminating the business . Then , they re-open your business and make the money for themselves . That did n't  happen to us . We were replaced by a real estate office . Go figure . So , sign a long-term lease ( 3-5 years ) if you plan to stay . <p> If I had a chance to do it again , I would utilize part of my capital investment on real estate . No landlords to deal with , and its much more fun to paint walls that you own . <p> 6 . Workload <p> It almost goes without saying , but its worth saying anyway . Running a business , especially retail , and most especially a restaurant is a ton of work . We opened for breakfast to attract the expats who liked bacon , eggs , and hash browns and even the adventurous that opted for chilaquiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing open mics , art openings for students at the institute , and parties in the evenings . We had to let the Italian chef go , but we had my wifes mother and two sisters working there in addition to one part-time waiter . We opened 7 days a week , and closed early on Sundays . There was really no such thing as free time . In the end , the workload did us in more than anything else . We had great food , great coffee , and a vibe unique to the town . We had somewhat of a following after only a few months . But , working crazy hours to break even is not sustainable . We simply burned out . <p> 7 . Do n't  Sell Assets <p> A classic hurdle in sale of a business negotiation is stock vs. assets . Sellers want to sell stock . Buyers want to buy assets . This is mostly due to liabilities sellers want to get rid of them and buyers do n't  want them . The Gypsy CafT had no stock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to sell the entire business to an investor who wants to continue the operation . Instead we had a big garage sale , which was stupid . Selling the business as a whole , there would be value placed on the brand , operating procedures , menus , suppliers , etc . By selling piecemeal assets , we were lucky to get half of what we paid for our stuff . <p> That principle is universal . In Mexico it can be difficult to acquire , and therefore , sell certain goods . Case in point , our prize possession was a La Pavoni semi-automatic Italian-made espresso machine not your standard home-brew piece of equipment . As can be imagined , the market for second-hand espresso machines is fairly nonexistent in a small town in Mexico . After placing the item on mercadolibre.com ( Mexicos version of ebay ) , we finally sold it within a few months . On top of that , we had left town and left the espresso machine in the hands of a friend , who was helpful and honest . He completed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a commission . <p> And with that sale , the Gypsy CafT was no more . They say that what does n't  kill you only makes you stronger . I can testify to that today , although it took quite a while to bounce back . And even though I moved back to the US to get a " real job , " the entrepreneurial spirit in me is still trying to break free . The key is to learn from these mistakes for the next time around . <p> Ben Lagow studied accounting and information systems at Texas A&amp;M University .

" <p> One of the 22-year old candidates main talking points is the nullification of legal tender laws by elevating the importance of the US Constitutions Tenth Amendment . <p> " I would nullify legal tender laws and money exchange laws to allow individuals to engage in the currency of their choosing , whether it be gold , silver , copper , Bitcoin , voluntary exchange , or even the devaluing Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pyramid scheme , " the candidate wrote on his Facebook page . <p> On a recent appearance on The Our Very Own Special Show Podcast , the candidate proposed that the income tax apply only to the US Dollar , absolving bitcoin , precious metals and other alternative currency users of paying the income tax . ( That part starts at 58 minutes ) <p> " The Fed and IRS were both created in 1913 as one entity . The income tax should only apply to Federal Reserve Notes , so if you 're a major corporation using Federal Reserve Notes , its probably because you 're connected to the banks . It will be mostly small business that stop using the corporate-fascist medium . Exempting alternative currencies from the income tax would be good for employment , and the dollar would lose value . People would only have to report taxes if they use the federal reserve note . " <p> That 's a lot of upheaval . So what does this all mean ? <p> " You would n't be a slave to the dollar system , " the candidate says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider to go together very well . But in the US they are two things that have been going together increasingly since Bitcoin became a thing in 2008 . <p> The crypto-currencys use in government all started when E-Gov Linkmade it possible for local governments to accept bitcoin payments for tickets , fines and other city administration . <p> The link between politics ( or anti-politics ) and Bitcoin has only grown more obvious . <p> The road was paved in May thanks to a unanimous vote by the Federal Election Commission to make it legal for bitcoin donations to be donated for political campaigns . Donations are capped at $100 per person , per cycle . <p> Introduced to Bitcoin four years ago while working in tech , Andrew Hemingway is now a Republican candidate for governor in New Hampshire . He is the first candidate for governor in New Hampshire history to accept bitcoin donations . <p> What might this added Bitcoin dimension bring to US elections at the city , state and federal levels ? <p> " The use is as much for candidates to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation , said . " The Bitcoin demographic is younger , more tech-oriented , probably more male-heavy . " <p> Whether or not Bitcoin plays a major role in future democratic elections has yet to be seen . Of course , the Bitcoiners are planning on this being the case . <p> If you 'd like to donate to Alexs campaign , you may do so here , while simultaneously learning about the candidate . <p> To listen to the interview , click here .

Pat yourselves on the back , entrepreneurs the parasites love you . As I 've written here in The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) Blog , approximately 65 million US citizens work . The rest receive welfare in various forms . " <p> " It was announced last week that Burger King had bought a famous Canadian restaurant franchise known as Tim Horton 's to reduce the amount of taxes they owe to the US government . An upcry arose ! <p> As usual the mainstream media and the people who watch it have the story totally wrong . Burger King is not giving US taxpayers a raw deal by looking to move abroad so as to save on profits , which are not repatriated . Instead , the iconic fast food burger chain is doing the moral thing by moving its tax-base outside the war-mongering , highly socialist US federal government 's reach . " <p> " People are subtly mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This new post-graffiti sees these new street artist taking aim at the political elites and hierarchy . <p> For example , sometime during the Labor Day weekend someone painted red the hands of the Washington statute in Mill Park in Trenton , New Jersey .

" <p> " The police state has only grown worse in recent decades and there is a nationwide cover up of the true details about how many police officers kill people each year . Many newspapers have recently reported the number as 400 , but I highly doubt this is accurate and it seems to me to be grossly under reported . Of course it is coming from the mainstream media . " <p> " I hate to always be the bearer of bad news but while we focus a lot on The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) there is one event that could be more catastrophic and is well within the realm of distinct possibility actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago as being the actual number one real , factual threat to human life on Earth and still believe that to this day .

" What would you say ? Might sound like a great idea at first , until you realize that I lack the capacity to organize millions of people to travel to the nations capitol on a workday . Especially when I predict people will wind up dead and in prison , its not exactly the most appealing thing for people to hire babysitters for . <p> Operation American Spring <p> Let 's make matters worse . Let 's insert religion into the issue , and try to reclaim America as a " Christian nation " . While were trying to create a religious government , let 's pretend this is about a Constitution that specifically forbids such a thing . Let 's pretend that " securing borders " has some historical precedent for increasing freedom . <p> When that fails to accumulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it anyway , imagining that tens of millions of people are going to travel across the country , when less than 30k would even bother to hit " Like " on Facebook . When a couple hundred of us show up to remove the most powerful man on the planet from office by force , let 's just turn around when a few capitol police tell us we need to be behind a barrier . From behind that barrier , let 's call for blood , and blame this failure on the people who had the good sense to stay home that day . <p> If this sounds like a complete failure to you , then you 're a lot smarter than Harry Riley , the organizer of the event . Organizer might be putting it strongly , actually . Let 's just call him the right wing religious zealot who created a Facebook page . <p> I regret to inform Harry , and his supporters , that the republic is a god damn fairy tale , just like Jesus . It began with a central bank and slavery . Shortly after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were the Alien &amp; Sedition acts . Just a few more tyrants down the road , you had a civil war , full blown fiat currency , conscription , and a collection of unbelievably tyrannical acts too long for me to list in the limited time I have to write this article . <p> If you think removing Barack Obama from office is going to do anything to stop a centuries long train of abuses and usurpations , you 're deluded . If you think god is going to help you , then you 're fucking crazy . If you think tens of millions of people are going to take on the most powerful government in the history of mankind , at its seat of power , because a deluded , uninformed , crazy person created a Facebook page , you seriously might consider suicide . <p> People who read this blog or hear rumors about me know that I 'm no opponent of forceful resistance to government oppression . What I am an opponent of is irrationality , and terribly uninformed people thinking they have the unique capacity to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think God wants them to . <p> I do n't  want to live in a " Christian Nation " . The last thing I want is militarized borders checking me for papers when I attempt to flee that insanity before the witch trials begin . Perhaps the scariest part of the political climate in America is not the government itself , but the lunatics who think they are uniquely qualified to replace it . If democracy is a terrible idea , violently overthrowing an elected government , only to insert new rulers by force is the only thing I could possibly imagine being worse . Especially when those rulers are obviously completely out of their minds . <p> Christopher Cantwell is an activist , writer , and satirist originally from New York . <p> From an anarcho-capitalist perspective , he covers news and current events , addresses philosophical questions , and even cracks a joke or two at ChristopherCantwell.com , and is a regular contributor to CopBlock.org , Economic Policy Journal , Lew Rockwell , and A Voice for Men . He also was a past guest on Anarchast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " million man marches " does there have to be where only a few hundred or thousand people show up before people stop calling it that ? <p> In any case , it does n't matter if hundreds , thousands or millions show up to " protest " . Protesting is for slaves . Free people do not protest and ask their masters for change . They just do it . <p> As Chris Cantwell so well points out these people do n't actually want to be free . What they want is for their owners to listen more to their concerns and to do things which they would prefer . <p> Many in this group will hold up " do n't tread on me " banners and then , in their day-to-day life , get completely trampled and do nothing about it . They will hold up a piece of paper , like the constitution , and say this gives them their rights . This is flawed . I do n't believe I need a piece of paper written by some dead criminals to give me the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further show my belief in this self-right , I also through my actions show that I believe all others also have the right to self-ownership and will stand up where I can to defend that right . <p> Aside from that , the days of protests and marches are over . Much more can be done to loosen yourself from bondage all without violence , marching or protesting . Just ignore the state . The easiest way is just stop paying extortion fees ( taxes ) to the mafia ( government ) . Of course this does come with some risk but people like Thomas Jefferson would laugh at how scared the slaves of today are to take on any sort of risk . <p> There are , too , many legal ways to separate yourself from the state which we often discuss here which include getting a foreign passport to a much more lenient tax farm , expatriating and even renouncing your slavery ( citizenship ) . <p> Unfortunately the fight today in the USSA is not just against the state but the millions of brainwashed tax slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made up of a few hundred people , proves that Aldous Huxley was right in his estimation that the majority of the US population is now too brainwashed to even fight their slavery or even know they have been enslaved . <p> When faced with this a free-minded person should forget about marching and protesting and just separate themselves from the current system , both physically and financially , as much as possible . The CEO of the popular hot sauce , Sriracha , recently stated that Kalifornia is not much different now from Communist Vietnam from which he had initially fled . <p> Human history is replete with free-minded people fleeing away from the ravages of collectivism and government and going to places that are more free . Amerikans looking for freedom should now realize that they should be looking to greener pastures outside of the USSA much as the founding fathers originally did in leaving England for America . <p> And it 's better to be a year or two early than a day too late during times like these .

@@99475106 @3675106/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> An American Success Story in Mexico : Jim Bourque Starr <p> Editors Note : The following post is by TDV legal correspondent , Jim Karger <p> Forward : Puerto Vallarta , Mexico This is an interview I completed December 2 , 2012 with Jim Bourque Starr , chiropractor extraordinaire , whom I met several years ago when he was practicing in San Miguel de Allende , Mexico . I was experiencing severe dizziness that was affecting my quality of life . I had been to a myriad of medical doctors and had a plethora of tests , all to no avail . Jim suggested he might be able to help . And he did . Within a few weeks , all dizziness was gone . I owe him , and it was my pleasure to interview him in his new environs , Puerto Vallarta , Mexico . This is one of several interviews I will complete with successful expats in Mexico ( although all future interviews will be solely in the TDV newsletter click here to subscribe ) , with a view to empower those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn how to make a living abroad from people who have done it . <p> Q : Jim , when did you first come to Mexico to live , and more importantly , why ? <p> A : In 2004 , I moved from San Jose , California , to Mexico City . I was in the States and met a woman from Mexico City . We married and moved to Mexico City . I started a chiropractic clinic there . It was surprisingly easy , because I did n't have to jump through any hoops . I just set up shop . <p> Q:How did you communicate with the Mexicans who became your patients ? <p> A : It helped that I was bilingual . <p> Q:Bilingual coming from the US ? <p> A : In San Jose , California , many of my customers were migrant farm workers and over the years I became fluent in Spanish . <p> Q:Was it tough leaving your practice in the US ? <p> A : Not at all . The State of California made it easier for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being treated and often testified on their behalf in disability proceedings . The insurance companies and the medical lobby despised me . I had five clinics and they decided to come after me and did so by using the government of the State of California as their weapon . <p> They decided to make an example out of me and came in to my clinics with a warrant one day , seized everything I had , brought the media with them , and took out everything I had in five U-haul trucks . They held me and my 40 employees prisoner until they were done stripping my practice . The specious claim they concocted was that my x-rays were not of " diagnostic quality " and by sending them through the mail to insurance companies I was committing fraud . It was nonsense , but the State had unlimited assets with which to fight . I hired lawyers and fought it for six months . When they found they had no case , they came to me and said , " We ca n't leave with nothing . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle for a fraction of what they originally wanted . <p> The X-rays were the legal excuse , but they could prove nothing there , so they settled by finding a technical infraction of the business code for failure to have a sign posted in my waiting room that said I was the owner of a medical rehabilitation center next to my chiropractic clinic . It was a joke but they had to find something . No fraud anywhere , none of the allegations that they thought they would find true ever came to the surface and were defeated . My lawyers said I could win it all , but I would have to spend everything I owned and more to do it . So , I settled in order to get on with my life , but my practice was ruined . <p> Q : How tough was it starting a new practice in Mexico ? <p> A : For me , it was easy because I was so used to treating Mexican patients . This was really virgin territory . In the US there are about 150,000 chiropractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred , even today . It was a challenge because I not only had to sell myself but also the importance of chiropractic care . There have always been charlatans here who will crack your neck , but they are uneducated and many are , frankly , dangerous . I was able to educate people as a part of opening that first practice . Six weeks and I was up and running and successful . It is amazing what you can do without government standing on your chest . <p> Q : How long were you in Mexico City ? <p> A : About a year , and then went back to the States to teach . It was during the months there that I decided I did n't want to live in the US anymore . As soon as I finished my teaching obligation , I returned to Mexico City . I then opened two clinics in Mexico City . Unfortunately , I did n't want to live in Mexico City . Too much traffic , smog , and crowding . That is when I moved to Acapulco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People came from the first day . I built a great practice there in a short period of time . Unfortunately , my wife did n't like the heat and humidity in Acapulco , especially during the summer , and after a year-and-a-half we started looking for some place we both liked in Mexico and found San Miguel de Allende . I started my clinic there three days after I arrived and , as you know , Jim , I was fully utilized in a matter of months . From there I also opened a practice in Queretaro , a city of a million people just 45 minutes from San Miguel . Likewise , it was successful . <p> Q:But you are in Puerto Vallarta now , Why ? <p> A : I was divorced last year and , unlike my ex-wife , I love the beach and decided to return . I love Puerto Vallarta natural beauty , clean air , and there are a lot of people here who want to maintain a certain quality of life , of health . It is a popular place for Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice here is about 80% Mexican and 20% Americans and Canadians . <p> Q : How would you compare Puerto Vallarta to San Miguel de Allende ? <p> A : San Miguel has more culture , but Vallarta has the beach . San Miguel is less expensive day-to-day , but Vallarta has its own airport close by . People are the same . I love both places . They are very different . <p> Q:What about government here ? Any problems ? <p> A : None , not in Vallarta , not anywhere I have practiced in Mexico . I had one jealous chiropractor in one location complain to the city government . They came out , took a look at our papers , and left . We never heard from them again . Here the people are so grateful to have this level of professional care , we have no problems at all . No one has ever threatened to sue me here . In the US , in the medical profession , that is a common occurrence and runs up the price of care . In the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit . Here I get $35 a visit and live better , a lot better . You can have a nice life , and you can do it without always worrying about the next shoe to drop . <p> Q : How do you like Puerto Vallarta ? <p> A : I love it here . Puerto Vallarta has two natural rivers that flow from the mountains to the sea . There are jungles everywhere , natural habitats to an untold number of species . It is still very much a Mexican city , with rich and poor . A one acre lot in upscale Punta Mita , for example , costs $3 million US . On the other hand , you can find a nice studio apartment in a good section of town near the marina for $5500 pesos ( $450 US dollars ) a month . It is more expensive than San Miguel de Allende , but a fraction of the cost of living anywhere in the US . <p> I opened a clinic here ( a place I had n't been in 25 years ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . I recently teamed up here with the BioSpa and Chiropractic Center . We have an anesthesiologist , natural medicine doctors , and I am the chiropractor with an associate doctor . I have been implementing a patient management system and it has worked out well for both of us . Vallarta is becoming well known in the medical tourism arena and so we are seeing more Americans here having procedures that are either unavailable or extremely expensive north of the border . <p> Q:Would you ever go back to the US to practice ? <p> A : Never . Not a snowball 's chance in hell . I learned up close and personal just how dangerous the government is there . They can and will take everything you own whenever they want to . You can assume the noble pose and say you will fight to the end , but that is exactly what you will do you will fight until the end , until you are broke and broken . You are guilty until proven innocent . <p> Authors Note : That sad dynamic has not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a continuing medical education seminar in California and they talked no medicine , none . The entire seminar focused on compliance with the law , with regulations , on how to avoid having the State crush you . There are a lot of chiropractors there who are leaving practice not because they do n't like the practice but because they are scared . There are young chiropractors who wo n't even adjust patients there because they are afraid . <p> Q:And how about you ? <p> A : I am unafraid and I intend to stay that way . Mexico is still a place where you can do business without fearing the State . It is changing , especially in the immigration area , but compared to the United States this is still the Wild West . It is still fun here . <p> Q:Any regrets ? <p> A : Perhaps that I did n't make the move earlier , but I ca n't really say that . All these experiences made me who I am today . <p> Q:Any advice to those who are thinking of coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do n't let fear limit you . Follow your dream . If you stay in the States , there is going to be pain and pleasure . The pleasure is the convenience of knowing the way things work . The pain is the constant fear of government overreaching and mistreatment . Here in Mexico there will be pain and pleasure , too . The pain will be having to do things different ways , the need to learn a new language , a new culture . But the pleasure will be the freedom you can still enjoy here that was long ago eliminated in the States . <p> Q:Thank you , Jim . <p> A : Always a pleasure , Jim .

@@99475108 @3675108/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> A Letter To My Fellow Prisoners <p> The following post is written by Randal Lane , TDV Egyptian Correspondent <p> But wait , you 're not an prisoner you say ? Well , I would disagree with that and allow me to explain . <p> First off , we should define what a prisoner is and let 's start off with a definition from the Merriam-Webster dictionary . <p> Pris-on-er <p> : a person deprived of liberty and kept under involuntary restraint , confinement , or custody <p> Simple enough , right ? So how can I assert that we , meaning everyone in the USA , are prisoners ? Well notice that the definition above does not state how restrictive the depravation of liberty must be in order to fit within that definition . <p> I would argue that we are all prisoners of the USSA and that our country has become nothing more than a giant prison camp where we are all inmates to one degree or another . <p> Within a state or federal prison , there are levels of " lockup " ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey the rules of the prison , the more freedom of movement you are allowed . If you buck the system , you get thrown into the " hole " or solitary . <p> If you move beyond the walls of our physical prison system , you can see that the society outside of the physical walls of the penitentiaries is pretty much the same way . You would be hard pressed to find any activity that you do , on a daily basis , that is not regulated or restricted by some level of government . <p> Now one would argue that we have complete freedom of movement but do we really ? Are you free to drive your car ? Well yes , as long as you have a state approved drivers license , all the various stickers and tags that the state require on your vehicle , you obey the laws , and pay any and all taxes that come with owning and operating that vehicle . <p> Now I suppose that if you did n't  want to put up with that , you could just walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depending on the state , you might have to carry a state issued identification with you in case you are stopped for , well , whatever reason they decide they want to stop you . <p> Air travel ? I 'd required plus body scans and/or being sexually molested by some costume wearing bottom feeder . And these measures are starting to be used at bus and train depots . <p> Bicycle ? Same thing as walking plus some cities require you to have a license to operate a bicycle . <p> Body scanners are going to be deployed at the upcoming Super Bowl . <p> And the list goes on . <p> Now someone will say that you are free as long as you obey the laws but using the same ( lack of ) logic , the women in Afghanistan were " free " as long as they wore their burkhas and obeyed the laws of the Taliban . <p> Muslims and Jews are " free " during the Spanish Inquisition days as long as they renounced their faith and bent to the will of the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try leaving if you do n't  have the proper documents ( passport ) . And with almost 30% of young adults having been in jail or charged with a crime , which restricts their ability to obtain a passport , that is not a ( legal ) option . <p> A prison is a prison regardless of size or physical boundaries if the PTB can restrict your movement inside those boundaries or your ability to exit through those boundaries . <p> But like the state and federal run prisons , the PTB try to keep us complacent and ignorant of how bad it is . They keep us occupied with gadgets and mindless entertainment on the TV screen . They tell us how " free " we are and how , in exchange for just a bit of that freedom , how secure they will keep us . <p> Because , you see , just like in the movie " The Matrix " , we are the batteries that power this monster of a machine that has become the USSA ( United Socialist States of AmeriKa ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run this monstrosity as long as they are feed continuous programming through the TV tube telling them that they are living in the freest country in the world , there is an invisible enemy out to get them and that they only way we can protect ourselves is to travel around the world killing them . But this requires money and support from the sheeple . The military-industrial complex has to justify its existence by having an enemy to " protect " us against . That requires massive amount of money from the batteries that power The Matrix . <p> But the day is coming where that military-industrial complex will turn its weapons to within our own borders . Technology introduced , and perfected in Iraq and other countries are already being used here . Unmanned drones over Houston , biometric technology , etc . <p> And if you dare to speak out about it , you are unpatriotic and siding with the terrorist . <p> So welcome to the USSA prison system . <p> Randal Lane , also known as " Long tooth " to his friends , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigs but plans to return to Egypt in the near future . He works as a HSSE ( Health , Safety , Security and Environmental ) manager in the oil and gas industry . <p> As either a result of Randals amazing ability to adapt and learn or , more likely , his rampant ADD , he has worked in the following professions : paramedic , deputy sheriff , animal control supervisor , delivered pizzas , sold postcards , delivered telephones , worked offshore as a medic/safety puke , cleaned up a slaughter house , drove an armored car , private security officer and done screen printing . He has also owned 4 businesses with various degrees of success , or lack of same .

" Steve Forbes <p> To My Dear FreedomFest Friends and Family , <p> As you know a few weeks ago Mark attended the famed Milken Institute Global Conference where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He summarized the sessions he attended with the following statement : <p> " It became clear to me that both the United States and Europe face financial disaster unless they adopt austerity measures and rein in their overly generous welfare systems . Im convinced that this " fiscal cliff " is coming much sooner than you expect , and you better be prepared . Chaos could result , raising the specter of serious unrest and protests in major cities across the country , and another collapse on Wall Street .

To me that is THE catalysts on the doorstep or at least a damn good excuse for the US to justify a dollar failure . Unless i do n't  quite get it 750 billion would basically wipe out much , if not all , QE efforts to date , not to mention start a domino of selling .

We expect the majority of the major problems to occur in the western nations which are the most tied into this US dollar reserve , debt based system . <p> For this reason I have already moved to Mexico and have purchased land and intend to build a house in a place that I call Galts Gulch in northern Argentina . <p> I 'm not the only one . Most of the free-market writers and investors you probably pay attention to have already absconded from their western nations , mostly to Latin America or Asia . Doug Casey ? Argentina/Uruguay . Marc Faber ? Thailand . Jim Rogers ? Singapore . Steven Saville ? Malaysia . <p> I even just found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing is so obviously on the wall that he is rushing to move his entire family to Argentina by this fall and even planning to turn in all their US passports once they do ( they already have secured a foreign country passport ) . <p> You can question how imminent a major crisis in the US is to fruition , but it is almost certainly coming . In 3 months ? 12 months ? 2 years ? Those are the general time parameters . And , as with most things it is better to be too early than too late . <p> Do n't  get me wrong . I 'm not the type who runs from problems and I 'm not the paranoid type who owns a bomb shelter . But , when the facts are this obvious that there will be significant difficulties and turmoil in the US ( and most western nations ) in the very near future , I 'd rather watch it from the tropics in southern Mexico ( the further from the US border the better ) or in the tranquility of northern Argentina than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even living in most western nations today is already difficult with all the taxation , rules and regulation I 'd live in Mexico or Argentina even if I did n't  foresee major problems . <p> That is why , if you have been giving serious thoughts to getting out of dodge for a few years , or permanently , I urge you to consider coming down and joining me in Argentina this November . I will be heading down to a special event in Cafayate , Argentina which will be hosted by the brainchild of the development , Doug Casey , himself . <p> A Special Invitation to Cafayate , Argentina <p> From November 9-13 , I will be in Cafayate , Argentina where Doug Caseys group will be putting on a special event . I went to the last one in March . I had no intention of buying a place there seemed a little too remote for my own personal tastes . But after having a truly magical time amongst singles , couples and families from around the world who all descended there as their own personal version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place there . <p> So , I will be going back to Cafayate this fall ( spring there ) to enjoy their bi-annual celebration and to look into plans to build my own little house . <p> I highly recommend going . Here are just a few of the things they will have on offer in 4 days of activities : <p> First night , an in-town welcome dinner <p> On the second day , personalized property tours , an Argentine asado lunch hosted by Doug Casey and drinks in the evening at a local winery <p> On the third day there is an al fresco lunch and a " Self-Reliant Living &amp; Investment Conference " hosted by a number of expatriation specialists including myself <p> On the 4th day there is a golf scramble ( golf is included free for the entire four days , by the way ! ) and a final dinner party <p> There is a $300 per person fee ( just to cover the costs of the lunches , dinner and the copious amounts of local wine you will be drinking during your stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you register before October 1st . The cost is really nothing for what you will get . And , to hang out with people like Doug Casey and similar like-minded people , like those who read The Dollar Vigilante , it is a complete bargain . In fact , I even suggest you consider going even if you have no interest in buying a property you 'll still have a magical 4 days amongst like-minded people from around the world . I came away from the last celebration with about a dozen new , good friends . <p> There is a limit to the amount of people accepted and as soon as I heard about it I rushed to put this blog out I want to get as many dollar vigilantes in as possible . So , if you have any interest in joining myself and Doug Casey in Northern Argentina in early November for a magical experience complete with world class wine , Argentine cuisine , horseback riding , golf , tours and more , respond quickly . <p> I should also mention that this may be the last event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , in Doug Caseys words , " a success beyond what I could have imagined " . I believe him . As usual , Doug has found the next big thing communities of entrepreneurs , investors and free-market types , looking to get away from under the dead weight of government . <p> Also , note that they are close to being sold out from what I hear this will likely be the last celebration where lots will be available for sale . And they wont be making any others . So , if you had been thinking about this , this may be your last chance . <p> *note : if you previously have entered your email there and you already have a sales representative contact , then feel free just to contact them directly about this event . If you have entered your email previously but never heard from anyone then enter your email again to ensure we contact you . <p> ** also note : I have accepted an invitation to receive commission if you buy a property there but as you will hopefully see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place there and only after several dollar vigilantes bought a place there did they tell me I should earn a commission for directing people to them . I am a capitalist , and never turn down getting rewarded for the things I do , but as you will see if you come down I bought a place there 100% with my own money and you will see for yourself why if you go down . My earning a commission on it is just free-markets at work . I have only ever promoted two places to escape the coming storm and I own a place in both of them . In Argentina and in my condos in Acapulco . So , if you ever have a problem with your purchase , all you have to do is walk over to my house/condo , knock , and yell at me. =

@@99475121 @3675121/ 28881 @qwx888881 <p> Thomas Piketty is a new rockstar in the Keynesian and Marxist economic world . In the best-seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century , an onslaught of data I have n't read nor plan on reading , he demonstrates how he is an obsolete economist ignorant of 21st century economic tools . <p> The book demonstrates that wealth inequality is bigger than income inequality . This is common sense . Anyone who has spent a bit of time thinking about how the world works has seen that there are some very established interests who have been a sort of ruling class for a very , very long time . Piketty paints a picture , with statistics , that the elite hold the rest of the world in debt to itself . In other words , they are not productive , but earn via economic rent from debtors . In other words , they are not producing anything , not building any wealth . The ruling class is a class of debt collectors . <p> Whereas Piketty posits government as a tool towards global economic fairness , bitcoiners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 21st century , government is not needed to regulate , because regulation can be managed by computers and open-source code , not plenipotentiaries . Here are some quotes from Pikettys book , coupled with an analysis from the purview of a bitcoiner . <p> " Taxation is not a technical matter . It is preeminently a political and philosophical issue , perhaps the most important of all political issues . Without taxes , society has no common destiny , and collective action is impossible . " ( p. 493 ) <p> This is a dark view of mankind . The extremely cynical quote , " without taxes , society has no common destiny , and collective action is impossible , " is troubling . This implies that mankind must be forced by a third-party , government , to be philanthropic . <p> Let 's put this view of individual action to bitcoiners . Bitcoiners had already grown their community to worldwide prominence before any tax authorities on the planet had meaningfully commented on it . Bitcoiners had gathered around the idea of bitcoin , had banded together to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while creating a rather sophisticated online community capable of transacting most things for bitcoins . It has pushed the idea of finance and economics to new extremes , all without taxes . It was n't until 2013 when taxes truly started coming into the picture , long after bitcoin had established itself as a viable community . A simple Google search demonstrates the philanthropy bitcoiners have shown without taxes . Back to the quotes : <p> " Piketty and co-authors ' findings have important implications for the desirable degree of fiscal progressivity . Indeed , they indicate that levying confiscatory rates on top incomes is not only possible but also the only way to stem the observed increase in very high salaries . According to our estimates , the optimal top tax rate in the developed countries is probably above 80 percent . " ( p. 512 ) <p> The philosophy of bitcoin is not to " confiscate " anything , but rather to participate in something ( bitcoin ) and thus benefit for having brought individual uniqueness to the greater whole . Progressive in the bitcoin mind is not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather how much a system can be turned towards centrifugal ends . In other words , how decentralized can mankinds social arrangement become ? Whenever you hear " peer-to-peer " anything , you 're hearing about the true , progressive cutting-edge , in the eyes of a bitcoiner . <p> Piketty highlights a problem many bitcoiners also see with the current financial system : an out of control and destructive financial and banking system . Piketty parrots that " The primary purpose of the capital tax is not to finance the social state but to regulate capitalism . The goal is first to stop the indefinite increase in inequality of wealth , and second to impose effective regulation on the financial and banking system in order to avoid crises . " <p> What he fails to internalize is that , in the modern world , this method has resulted in the state and the top corporations working together . Governments have never been so sophisticated as they are today , but where is the effective , sophisticated regulation ? There is none . There is only corruption . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " An 0.1 percent tax on capital would be more in the nature of a compulsory reporting law than a true tax . Everyone would be required to report ownership of capital assets to the worlds financial authorities in order to be recognized as the legal owner " ( p. 519 ) <p> Bitcoin has been designed , in part , to protect financial privacy . People do not trust government agencies nor banks because government agencies have a proclivity towards prosecution and confiscation and most of the worlds biggest banks only exist today thanks to government subsidy and protection . It is this fact , coupled with National Security Agency revelations , that has led to bitcoins adoption . Pikettys philosophy , if implemented ( that is , an inheritance and global wealth tax ) , would only bring more people into bitcoin . His view of offshore tax havens underscores this : <p> " No one has the right to set his own tax rates . It is not right for individuals to grow wealthy from free trade and economic integration only to rake off the profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft . " ( p. 522 ) <p> Firstly , for Piketty to flat out claim that " no one has the right to set his own tax rates " pretty much shows him to be a sociopathic control freak . Hyperbole aside , if the above-mentioned offshore haven were merely seen as bitcoin , Pikettys writings are essentially suggesting that bitcoiners owe non-bitcoiners some money , and by keeping the treasure trove of new wealth created by bitcoin , bitcoiners are stealing . Piketty comes up with theoretical examples fit for a Disney cartoon to prove his point : <p> " If , tomorrow , someone were to find in her backyard a treasure greater than all of her countrys existing wealth combined , it is likely that a way would be found to amend the law to share that wealth in a reasonable manner ( or so one hopes ) . " ( p. 537 ) <p> Piketty reveals his Marxian dis-taste for usury : <p> " From the standpoint of the general interest , it is normally preferable to tax the wealthy rather than borrow from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask bitcoiners about taxing or borrowing , it is likely they would prefer borrowing . Wherefore ? Well , there is already a fledgling lending system evolving in the bitcoin ecosystem , and people within the community , in many cases , feel a desire to help each other out . Moreover , many people are excited about peer-to-peer lending , which could , given enough time to properly develop , re-invent the way the world sees lending . It could be the end of the taboo on money lending . <p> Unlike Piketty , the bitcoin community has a plan for its wealth , which it built by being innovative . Whereas Piketty supports a global tax on the wealthy , with no real plan for how to use that money other than to put it in the hands of the people read : government , bitcoiners desire a world more decentralized than ever before , putting emphasis on the talents of individuals and what they can bring to a community . Bitcoiners pay a tax of their own , as well : time working for the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the crony-capitalist system and flowers of alternative realities are cropping up . The middle class has been brought to the brink , practically eviscerated over the past ten years in the western world . Stock markets high on intraveneous debt cocktails post record nominal highs daily . " <p> " The War On Drugs is finally ending . It has been a heinous collectivist/statist invention . The world will be better off the more libertarian drug laws become ( and eventually if there is no drug laws at all ) . Not only the US is moving towards more relaxed regulations of marijuana , but so are many countries . The War On Drugs has functioned as the leading vehicle of mass incarceration in the US . Billions are spent on the War and its produced the highest incarceration rate in the world with 2.2 million Americans in prison or jail . " <p> " Central bank officials from several countries have expressed their view that digital currencies like bitcoin represent risks to the dominant banking system , with many officials suggesting digital currencies could undermine the current money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation-state . Bitcoin 's historical price rise has done much to bring bitcoin into the public eye . " <p> " One common thread between today 's governments is wanton printing of fiat currencies by central banks . Not all governments are printing to Zimbabwean levels , yet , but many are nearing that point . In any case , all have centralized monetary policies usually involving highbrow yet banal men ( or now women , with Janet Yellen ) in either case they have beards and sit beady eyed in secret rooms . Part of the reason why the US crisis seems in a frozen state since the 2008 banking nadir has everything to do with the fact that other central banks are printing just as much or more of their own currencies as the Federal Reserve . What does this mean ? It means that these countries currencies are growing weaker in relation to assets like stocks , bonds , real estate , precious metals , minerals and other commodities and resources , just like what 's happening in the US Dollar . So those poor people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises routinely to try to keep up with the increase in the cost of living .

The notice read , in part , <p> When President Abraham Lincoln established the USDA in 1862 , he called it the " People 's Department . " The USDA website lists its current areas of authority as : Assisting Rural Communities ; Conservation ; Education and Research ; Food and Nutrition ; and , Marketing and Trade . The agency has over 100,000 employees . Why do employees of the People 's Department need semi-automatic machine guns to do their job ? What would the job description be ? <p> Second Amendment sites have speculated that the most likely recipients are agents of the US Forest Service ( USFS ) Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit ; the USFS falls under USDA control . Although this seems likely , there are also counter-indications . The solicitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents are already armed . The Wikipedia site on USFS states " Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms , and other defensive equipment " Moreover , the weapon being solicited is typically used for close quarter operations , such as inside a building or into a crowd , rather than in an open or unpopulated area . <p> Several people have attempted to reach the two " public servants " listed in the notice as USDA contacts for interested weapon companies . Attempts to contact Linda F.B Josey , head of the Procurement Management Branch , reach an auto-reply that states she is " out for training . " Desiree Clayton , the contracting officer , is " not in the office at this time . " <p> The news site Politico managed to get an answer . Politico reported , " USDA spokeswoman Courtney Rowe says the guns are needed by the more than 100 agents employed by the law-enforcement division of the departments Office of the Inspector General . Theyve carried machine guns for 20 years , she notes . USDA OIG officers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another USDA official told POLITICO . ' They make arrests , they serve subpoenas and they engage in undercover operations ' . " What sort of " very dangerous law enforcement situation " does the USDA confront ? <p> Assuming The USFS Is The Intended Recipient <p> The USFS is closely allied with the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) and often provides it with back-up . A key reason is because the two agencies share responsibility for managing an estimated 167 million acres of public rangeland in America , with the USFS presiding over more than half . The BLM recently laid seige to the ranch of Cliven Bundy . A timeline on the Bundy conflict provides insight into the relationship of the two agencies . <p> In March 1993 , the BLM designated hundreds of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada for conservation efforts and closed it off to livestock grazing . Since the 1930s , federal rangelands in Nevada have been managed primarily by the BLM ( or its predecessor ) and the USFS . Rancher Cliven Bundy called the BLM move a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he refused to remove his cattle . <p> In 1995 , the USFS was responsible for overseeing 7 million acres in Nevada and became quickly entangled in conflict with ranchers . In April 1995 , USA Today reported , <p> Thursday evening , a small bomb went off in the U.S. Forest Service office in Carson City , Nev . <p> " If it was sent as a message , " says Forest Service spokeswoman Erin O'Connor , " we got it . " Ultimately the issue will be settled by the courts , but ranchers who say they ca n't afford to raise livestock without greater access to public land are taking matters into their own hands setting up what some officials fear is an inevitable and dangerous confrontation . The situation is becoming so tense that federal workers now travel mostly in pairs and are in constant radio contact with district offices . <p> " I 'm concerned about the safety of my employees , " says Jim Nelson , Forest Service district manager for Nevada . " They ca n't go to church in these communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school . Stores and restaurants are not serving them . " <p> A year later , more pipebombs had exploded in the offices of the USFS and the BLM . <p> In 2002 , another Nevada rancher was found guilty of grazing on federally-claimed land . His sentence affirmed the USFS 's authority over the disputed area . <p> Skip forward to April 2014 . There were a series of conflicts with the Bundys and their supporters on one side , and armed BLM and other agents on the other . A photojournalist described one incident . " We were on a bridge in southern Nevada in the midst of a tense standoff between the BLM and a group of angry ranchers , milita-members sic and gun-rights activists .

Socialism always has the same predictable process . Once the government collectivizes a sector then the politicos and bureaucrats get to work on " improving the system " . In a private enterprise , that 'd mean offering more to your customers for a cheaper price . In government , it is always the opposite , finding ways to reduce benefits for their " customers " . <p> This is why Obamacare is and will be a disaster to anyone interested in having quality medical care and choice in the US . Once the government uses its force to gain a monopoly on a sector like medical care then all of a sudden it now becomes everyone else 's business what you do with your own body . You smoke ? You should be stopped ! Do n't wear a seatbelt ? You should be fined . Why ? Because we are all paying for each other 's medical care and so it now becomes everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could potentially cost them more money . <p> The same has been happening since the US government has had a multi-decade long monopoly on retirement savings ( IRAs ) . Since they get to make the rules they get to decide just how much is enough for your retirement and that is exactly what will be happening next week when President Obama will be releasing his budget plan which will limit how much a wealthy individual can keep in those tax-reducing IRA plans and other retirement accounts . <p> According to a senior administration official , wealthy taxpayers can currently " accumulate many millions of dollars in these accounts , substantially more than is needed to fund reasonable levels of retirement saving " and of course in the communist administration 's eyes , that 's a real shame . The job of government is of course to " level the playing field " by stealing from and putting up obstacles for those with " too much . " <p> What is the " reasonable amount " that he thinks is enough ? The numbers being bandied about seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Well , let 's look further at the proposal . <p> " The budget would limit an individuals total balance across tax-preferred accounts to an amount sufficient to finance an annuity of not more than $205,000 per year in retirement , or about $3 million in 2013 . " <p> So , according to them , $205,000 per year is sufficient and people should not be allowed to have more than that in retirement savings . But , remember , disbursements from an IRA are taxable , so that $205,000 , if you lived in any number of states where total income taxes are over 50% , very quickly brings that number down to around $100,000 after theft or tax as they call it . Of course , that is just the beginning of other payments to the state . Your average person with a $3 million IRA probably lives in at least a $1 million house . If that person lived in New Jersey where property tax averages 1.89% of property value , then you can take another $19,000 off of the remaining $100,000 for property tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be numerous countless really other taxes paid over the course of the year gasoline tax , cigarette taxes , alcohol taxes and numerous others . But , even without including those we are already below $7,000/month . <p> But here is the real kicker . If that person did take the $205,000/year annuity , their retirement funds would only last them fourteen years . Of course , some may state that they could and should be earning a return during that time which will extend it . <p> But your average person who owns mostly 2% paying dividend stocks or 2% paying Treasuries is actually losing nearly 10% per year to monetary inflation . The US central bank 's current rate of money printing which does and will turn into price increases is over 10% . If they are losing 8% per year on that $3 million then it will only be ten years before that $3 million is actually only worth $1.3 million in real dollars . <p> That $205,000 per annum , at today 's monetary inflation rate , also will only be equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be paid that person would be likely eating cat food just to survive . <p> These are the wonders of the American Dream today . It is turning into a nightmare . They have you coming and going from all sides . And then , if you manage to survive all the taxes and inflation , whatever remaining money you have left will be mostly gutted by the death tax . Yes , there is a tax to die in the land of the free . And do n't try to commit suicide either . That 's illegal . <p> Next Confiscation <p> This , of course , is the warm up for big confiscation of retirement account money later on a topic that has already been discussed openly in Congress . I ca n't understand why anyone would put their money in a retirement vehicle under government control . That 's like putting your child in a cage full of lions for safekeeping . <p> You could also invest in precious metals in a self-directed IRA and get a significant amount of them into jurisdictions that are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on doing that , see Getting Your Gold Out Of Dodge free to TDV subscribers ) . And it would n't hurt to take some of those savings and invest in a foreign passport in a place that does n't view your assets as their own . <p> The central planners in the US and most Western governments have and will decide how much is " enough " for you to have and if you manage to still have significant assets after that , they 'll continue to whittle them away via taxation and inflation . It 's all easily predictable as this is where things always go once things are socialized or collectivized . <p> As is the equal sharing of miseries .

Police try to beat back the hordes of protesters by smashing indiscriminately into the crowd with their billy clubs . <p> This was the scene recently in Madrid , Spain , as tens of thousands of people took to the streets to fight against the budget cuts and tax increases put into place by Mariano Rajoy , the current Prime Minister of Spain . The protesters chanted " no more cuts " as they demolished storefronts and threw firecrackers at police . <p> The march was organized by the group Marcha de la Dignidad ( M-22 ) which also had the support of the labor unions . You can read the demands of this organization on its own website . They consist of : <p> A law establishing a basic income for every citizen <p> Universal , free and high quality public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy as a human right <p> Nationalization of all banks along with all " strategic " sectors <p> As you can see from these demands , the M-22 , along with their labor union allies , are outright communists .

The results are realized the next day when those that live in or are visiting the historic city wake up to the formerly beautiful streets being littered with piles of trash and graffiti , others who are not so lucky wake up in a jail cell or hospital gurney . <p> Some of the protesters complaints are well-taken . They point out that the Euro was forced upon them without their consent , which has now resulted in their countrys loss of economic competitiveness . The Euro has indeed caused disruptions that have been thoroughly analyzed in books such as The Tragedy of the Euro by economist Philip Bagus . <p> He shows how the Spanish have been able to borrow at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has created a free-for-all , where countries with less overall saved capital are incentivized to take advantage of the low interest rate provided by the saved capital of individuals in the core .

They claim that the debt is being forced upon them and that they should not have to suffer for the governments mismanagement of the economy . I find this argument to be sound overall . From an ethical standpoint , individuals should not be born into the world with a giant albatross of debt piled up by past generations . <p> These arguments become disingenuous , however , if you are then out of the other side of your mouth demanding higher government spending for public services .

Many pray for a strong man to come in and bring back order with an iron fist . They reminisce of the 1960s and the dictatorial rule of Franco , when Spain had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world . <p> Although this is a temping trap to fall into , it is only one of many choices that there are .

What many people think of as " sustainable " or " living off the grid " is in fact just a justification for lowering your standard of living . Our current luxurious way of life is impossible without free international trade . <p> While many in the United States see this as a far off country without much in common with themselves , I would beg to differ .

But , by inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a government statistic that all but takes most of the real inflation out of the CPI as well show below . <p> Here is a chart of the Median Household Income in the US since 1971 . <p> In 1971 , the median household income , in CPI-adjusted dollars , was $45,641 . In 2013 it was $52,100 . <p> Even when adjusted to the CPI this sticks out as being a 42 year period of stagnation . Why ? Because of productivity increases . Remember , in 1971 , your average office worker had access to a rotary telephone and a calculator . To do so much as book a flight , or calculate some accounting numbers would have taken all day . In todays world , with the internet and all manner of other technological advances , what could have been done in a day forty years ago can now be done in about five minutes or less . <p> Aside from the internet , nearly every sector of the economy has seen massive technological improvements . Even in terms of agriculture , according to the USDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every industry is similar . There have been massive productivity increases but where is the increase in household income ? <p> The fact is , it is far worse than it looks . Since 1971 , the average annual CPI increase , has been 2.69% per annum . In other words , according to the governments calculations , there has been price inflation , each year of 2.69% . <p> However , the true money supply , as calculated by TDV Senior Analyst , Ed Bugos , has increased by approximately 7% per annum since 1971 . <p> Which number seems most correct ? Well , let 's look at a few main indicators in terms of price . <p> In 1971 , the Median Sales Price for new homes sold in the US was $24,500 . As of August of this year , the Median Sales Price was $275,600 . That is an annualized increase of 5.93% per year since 1971 . <p> Much closer to the true money supply gauge of monetary inflation of 7% than to the governments gauge of price inflation , the CPI , of 2.69% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones Industrial Average was at 830.57 on the first trading day of 1971 . Today , it is at roughly 17,000 for an annual average increase of 7.45% . Again , nearly the same as the increase in the true money supply and far removed from the governments inflation index of 2.69% . <p> How about " education " ? Forget for the moment that most college educations are a complete waste of time and money , particularly in todays digital information where all information is freely accessible . According to Bloomberg , from 1978 to 2012 , the cost of attaining a college degree rose 1,120% . <p> That is an annualized increase of you guessed it , 7.5% per annum . <p> Adjusting Median Household Income to True Inflation <p> Assuming that 7% annual inflation is much more of a better gauge of inflation over the last four decades let 's re-adjust the Median Household Income to 7% instead of the governments 2.69% . <p> In 1971 , the Median Household Income in the US was $7,805 . If the median income kept up with the true money supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum then the Median Household Income today would be $125,000 . <p> It currently stands at $52,100 as of June , 2013 . <p> That is how central banking and its money printing rob the average person . <p> Of course , for societys most wealthy who have most of their wealth in hard assets like real estate and the stock market , they are the main benefactors of inflation as most of the new money flows to these assets . <p> The rest of this article is available to TDV subscribers in the September issue of TDV along with Austrian economics based analysis on the markets by TDV Senior Analyst , Ed Bugos , discussion of Apple by Justin O'Connell , our regular expat article/interview from around the world , TEOTMSAWKI News &amp; Redmond Weissenberger .

The conflict over marijuana , for example , calls into question whether any freedom can regain a toehold in America . Freedom may have already died through duplicity . <p> A Snap Shot of Current Marijuana Use in America <p> The federal government wants marijuana to be illegal whatever it may be saying . And so marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug along with heroin . Schedule I drugs are " highly addictive " ones which have no " accepted " medical value and can not be prescribed by a doctor . But the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) specifically grants the Attorney General power to reclassify controlled substances . That authority resides in the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) , a branch of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) . Obama has the power to order the ultimate yes-man Attorney General ( AG ) Eric Holder to shift marijuana 's classification from Schedule I to Schedule III along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For one thing , the tinkering would cause a political backlash and alienate the financial support of Big Pharma . That 's why Obama told a CNN interviewer , " What is and is n't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress . " It is not , but he wants Congress to absorb the heat . <p> As well as reclassifying marijuana , Obama could easily legalize it through an executive order that bypasses Congress . He has the lawful authority to wield any power granted to him by Congress or by the Constitution . When Congress passed the CSA , the executive branch received the power to declassify a drug as a controlled substance . AG Holder needs to receive a favorable report from the Department of Health and Human Services but both federal offices are under Obama 's direct control . On May 20th senior Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer declared that the President would be " picking up the pace on executive actions . " But nary a one has appeared on marijuana . <p> Obama could also direct Holder not to pursue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DOJ announced it would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act through court cases ; the decision clearly came from Obama . Now that the subject has changed to marijuana , however , Obama insists that he does not have the authority to instruct Holder to cease prosecuting marijuana growers who clash with federal law . He also calls himself powerless to overrule drugs laws passed by Congress despite the fact that he has virtually rewritten Obamacare on his own . <p> But why marijuana ? And why move on the issue now ? <p> Cracking the Back of State Power <p> Obama 's attack on marijuana is largely motivated by a deadly serious competition between state and federal power . It is especially important to rein in rebellious and independent states before the November election , which could throw the Senate over to Republicans . But , again , the administration does n't want to clash openly with state governments and be seen to nullify measures that were approved by state voters . SWAT-style warfare with the states and their residents could affect November votes , especially those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superb at it . <p> But bitter conflict is brewing . Colorado and Washington State recently legalized sale and possession for both medical and recreational use . 18 other states and the District of Columbia permit medical use and other states are on the fast-track to do so . Some states are edging toward the legalization of recreational use . <p> Editors Note : The Dollar Vigilante newsletter is identifying and alerting subscribers to potentially massive profits in the booming multi-billion dollar medical marijuana industry but has avoided companies based in the US due to the Obama administrations actions another booming industry in which the US will fall far behind . Last week , subscribers were alerted to a Canadian based medical marijuana company that could return profits well in excess of 1,000% in the coming months . Click here to subscribe to gain access <p> The Whack-a-Mole Strategy of Obama <p> The federal government 's stand on marijuana is being expressed indirectly . Federal agencies are attempting to make its production and sale prohibitively expensive and cumbersome . Their policies can often be executed behind the scenes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose them is like playing Whack-a-Mole . <p> Whack-a-Mole is an arcade game in which toy moles randomly pop out of holes and players hit them back inside with a mallet . It has come to mean a situation in which ' solutions ' to a problem are fleeting and futile . And , in America , Obama owns the mole . <p> The Latest Federal Mole Pops Up <p> In August 2013 , Holder publicly announced that the DOJ would not challenge state laws on marijuana use . It was a lie . The power of a whack-a-mole strategy lies in never letting a player know what to expect or when . But the DOJ is losing at least one of its advantages ; the public is getting wise to the game . <p> Last month , Operation Choke Point was featured in the news . This DOJ program targets America 's payment infrastructure through which an estimated eight million merchants process credit and debit card payments . The infrastructure includes banks as well as alternatives to them such as Paypal . One DOJ tactic is to flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the harassment go away , all they need to do is comply with the DOJ demand to drop individuals and businesses whose activities are legal but " objectionable .

Coin dealers are as well . <p> Water Politics <p> This month the US Bureau of Reclamation a subcategory of the Department of the Interior made an announcement . The agency " will administer its water-related contracts in a manner that is consistent " with the CSA . Translation : marijuana growers can not use federal water on their crops even in states where growing is legal . <p> It is not clear how many growers will be affected by the Bureau 's announcement ; in Washington State , at least , the impact could be profound . The Bureau controls the water delivered to 2/3rds of that state 's irrigated land . Growers may need to sink wells or use the water supply of nearby cities . And the pressure on cities to refuse water delivery or permits to drill is likely to be intense . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own laws above federal ones . It is willing to use innovative measures and reinterpret law . The Democratic Congressman from Colorado , Jared Polis , stated , " This policy places the Bureau of Reclamation at odds with the administration 's current guidance to not interfere with the marijuana and hemp industries made lawful by voters in those states . The Bureau of Reclamation is challenging the commonly-held understanding in the arid west that water rights are state-based , an extremely delicate proposition for citizens dependent on water for their livelihood . " <p> The next whack-a-mole conflict may well be the dams that operate under the Bureau 's control . Dams , power plants and canals controlled by the Bureau help to irrigate 17 states . Consider the Pueblo Dam in Colorado . Although 80% of the region 's water is locally controlled , it passes through the Dam . The federal facility has a legal obligation not to obstruct the flow but legal obligations can be changed or reinterpreted . No wonder some local water districts pre-emptively refused to supply marijuana businesses . <p> The federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : water . Wars have been literally fought over water .

@@99475136 @3675136/ <p> At The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) we are always looking for ingenuitive ways to keep the majority of your assets outside of the current financial and monetary system . At numerous conferences we keep running into Knut Andersen , the President and CEO of SwissMetal Inc. , and Knut and SwissMetal are also the Gold Sponsor at the Anarchapulco freedom event coming up at the end of this month . <p> SwissMetal is based in Panama and has a very unique and interesting way to invest in hard assets , like rare and strategic metals with a focus on asset protection of individual and industrial investors . <p> I had the opportunity to speak with Knut this week to get some insights into what they offer . <p> The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) : Knut , thank you for taking the time ! First , why do n't  you tell us a little about SwissMetal and also your role there ? <p> I am the President and CEO , and lead an experienced team of account managers who provide personalized access to these metals for clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing investors how to profit from this brand new asset class . <p> Strategic metals are a set of metals which are vital in 95% of products that are manufactured today , including air , sea , and land equipment , medical equipment , pharmaceuticals , TVs , cell phones , computers , armaments , night vision goggles , jet engines , clothing , cosmetics and creams , hybrid and electric vehicles , solar panels , and much more . <p> By purchasing and storing these metals for the future , clients can fight inflation , and make profits by reselling these assets back into the industry when prices increase . <p> Strategic metals are free from the manipulation that plagues the gold and silver market , completely private and non-reportable since they are non-financial assets , and are fiat currency proof since they can be cashed out in any currency , anywhere in the world . Normally our clients choose to store their metals in our bank level secure vaults , which are 100% insured , and where their assets are fully allocated and segregated . <p> TDV : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . Give us some examples of what you mean by " strategic metals " . Which metals exactly ? <p> KA : Strategic metals are a set of elements needed by industry that are either rare , or expensive and difficult to produce . Many of these metals are byproducts of other metal production , and are not found on their own in nature . We focus on metals our industry contacts tell us are in short supply , or are currently difficult to find . <p> At this time , that includes indium , hafnium , gallium , tellurium , tantalum , bismuth , molybdenum , chromium , cobalt , zirconium , tungsten , rhenium , dysprosium , germanium , and niobium . We also supply gold and silver in the forms most often wanted by industry . <p> We separate these metals into 4 different diverse baskets focusing on different industries , or they can be purchased as single metals for a more direct play . <p> TDV : This is a very interesting approach ! I have n't heard of other companies doing similar things . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can be answered a couple of different ways depending on who you consider as competitors . <p> Within the Strategic Metals space , there are two types of companies you can buy from . The first is from companies who sell strategic metals to industry . These companies are n't  competition for us because they deal with large companies needing manufacturing metals , not individuals looking to stockpile metals for the future . <p> The second type do sell individual strategic rare metals to individual investors . However those companies havent done the leg work to form relationships with industry buyers . So while they will sell you a kilogram of a strategic metal , you are on your own to try find a buyer , and large manufacturing firms are n't  going to purchase that kilogram of metal . They also have very little or no guidance on which metals are in demand , and why . <p> Swissmetal Inc on the other hand has been working with industry insiders to create diverse baskets focusing on specific industries . We also have the contacts and the network built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into the industry . Our group currently manages over 300 million dollars in strategic metals , and within the next few years will manage the biggest stockpile outside of China , so we have the industry clout to actually make the assets work for our clients . <p> Our real competition comes from outside of the strategic metals world , and is in other asset protection tools , the biggest two being gold and silver . We do n't  knock gold and silver , and can actually help our clients with those . But we see strategic metals as an add on because while gold and silver both are prone to manipulation in the market , and gold does n't  have a strong industrial demand , strategic metals can fill both those gaps . <p> TDV : Can you expand on that a little , why would clients choose these little known metals over the much more popular gold and silver ? <p> KA : There are a few reasons , and one of them hinges on the popularity itself . Gold and silver are both traded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is much more gold and silver traded on a daily basis than actually exists in the physical form . This causes 2 problems . First , if everyone were to sell at one time , there would be a run on gold and silver , similar to a run on a bank , where there is n't enough actual metal to meet all the paper flying around . <p> Next , big entities are in a position to manipulate the market by shorting massive amounts of these precious metals . That drives prices lower causing a panic sell by leveraged investors who would be forced to cover their assets , driving prices even lower . The large entities can then swoop in and buy more precious metals , either in physical or paper form because they have driven the prices so low . <p> Owning physical gold and silver protects you somewhat from the above problems , but they can still cause volatility in prices if you need to sell in a hurry . <p> The next issue comes down to supply and demand . Especially in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many critical items we need in a day-to-day basis . Gold on the other hand , has a few industrial applications like high end connectors , but other than that is little more than a pretty yellow metal . That 's why historically gold is a great hedge against inflation , but if you do n't  time it perfectly it is n't really a profit tool . <p> TDV : At Anarchapulco , your keynote speech title is " How To Profit From The Upcoming Wave Of Technological Metals Shortages . " Could you tell us what that is about ? <p> KA : The world is experiencing an unprecedented technological boom right now , and unlike other booms in the past ( like the industrial revolution ) , the technological boom does n't  experience the same limitations . For example , during the technological revolution man invented flight , which was a huge advancement . Since then planes have evolved , but there has n't  been the same jump . <p> Technology on the other hand feeds itself , so the more innovation we have , the more technology can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reach singularity , or the point where new technology is developed instantaneously . <p> +G-Strategic metals are also known as technological metals because almost all technology relies on these metals to exist . As the technology is increasing at this incredible pace , the mining and production of these metals cant progress at the same pace , so shortages are very near on the horizon . These shortages are already seen as critical problems in most countries growth plans , and prices should skyrocket as manufactures fight to acquire the metals they need to foster current and future growing demand . We are already seeing the crunch in several metals . <p> Like I said earlier , strategic metals are crucial in 95% of all products manufactured today , not just technological products . But technology is definitely one of the aspects we are most excited about , and will increase the shortages experienced in all of those other industries . <p> Another exciting prospect is the fact over 1 billion people will be emerging from poverty over the next few years . All of those people will demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cellphones and other technology to clothing , cosmetics , and pharmaceuticals . <p> TDV : This is a fascinating service you are offering to individual investors that they would not be able to do on their own without . What kind of clients do you accept ? Do you accept American clients ( that is always a big question nowadays ) ? What is the minimum investment amount accepted ? <p> KA : Yes , we do take clients from the US , in fact its an area we specialize in because of the difficulty Americans have in many alternative investments . One of the big advantages strategic metals have over other asset protection tools like gold and silver , is they are not considered financial assets or accounts . <p> So for that reason , there are no reporting requirements , just like there are no reporting requirements if you purchase a car . In fact , we do n't  have a mechanism for reporting even if we wanted to . They are completely private and confidential making us a very popular choice for anyone who values their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of citizenship and residency , clients may have reporting requirements when they sell their metals , and need to report a gain . But it is between them and their financial / tax advisers what those reporting requirements are , and we do n't  report purchase or sales to anyone . <p> Another advantage of our business model is , we opened the strategic metals market to almost any investor , as opposed the the millions of dollars it used to take to get involved . Our baskets , or groups of metals , start at around $10,500 , and go up to around $53,000 . But you can purchase as many baskets and mix and match for the best diversification to suit your portfolio . <p> For investors wanting a direct play in single metals , the minimum investment is $25,000 . <p> KA : Owners are welcome to take delivery of their metals , but due to the cost and logistics , most choose to have us arrange storage for them . We store the metals in bank level secure vaults in either Panama or Switzerland depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the owner , and are fully 100% insured . <p> The metals themselves can be owned a number of different ways . Some of our owners choose to just purchase the metals in their own name , while others prefer the added privacy of an entity like an LLC . <p> Funds for metals can be paid onshore , directly to a bank in the US , and then transferred offshore by us . Or , if funds are already offshore , they can be transferred to Panama or Germany in any currency . We also accept Bitcoin , which I think would be of interest to many people seeing this interview . <p> TDV : Youve probably heard of the new MyRA plan in the US , and many of us think this might be a path to nationalizing the IRA . Do you have any thoughts on how to protect those ? <p> KA : Yes , we have a fully compliant IRA / 401K program . <p> We will work with you and a US-based IRA custodian to setup an offshore LLC which owns the metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfectly legal structure that protects your assets from confiscation , lawsuits and more . <p> Plus thanks to the magic of triple compounding , profits can really soar in this type of structure . <p> There 's a little bit more complexity to it , but we 've compressed it down to 3 simple steps , and its a very popular option for anyone with assets in an IRA they would like to protect , and get out of the volatile capital markets . Look at what happened in 2008 , many IRAs were virtually wiped out . <p> TDV : Speaking of profits , what kinds of return are you getting on these investments . <p> KA : Since we 've launched , the gains have averaged around 12% across all of our diversified baskets . But where we really add value , are the inside contacts , and the huge stockpiles we manage . We are able to sell metals back directly into industry , and can take advantage of short term shortages when prices can increase rapidly . <p> For example , in 2010 prices of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon , those gains could look like small potatoes . <p> The thing with strategic metals is only minute quantities are used in different products , so from a per unit cost basis , even big jumps in price do n't  make a very big per unit cost difference . Even if prices doubled or tripled , a company like Boeing would n't feel too much of a hit on the cost of an engine . But if you are the person holding the stock pile , profits could be massive . <p> TDV : For many Americans , looking to get into hard assets outside of the US , this appears to be a very , very enticing product , especially in this day and age of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) reporting . And , even for non-Americans , this is a unique approach that I am not aware of anyone else doing , anywhere . I would recommend for those looking for this type of investment/service to contact SwissMetal for more information . How is the best way for them to contact you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , we are available during normal US business hours and can be reached by phone at 1-855-854-4679 from the US , or elsewhere at 1-786-693-1135 .

A Sign Of An Impending Rise ? <p> Robert McEwen was on CNBCs " Fast Money " Wednesday afternoon to talk about the gold miners , which are up 30% compared to golds 7% gain so far this year , as well as McEwen Mining ( MUX:TSX ) , which I recently added to the TDV portfolio . You can watch the clip here . <p> CNBC has been a gold hater for as long as I have been writing up the gold story back to 2000 . They laughed and ridiculed and shamed the story all the way up ! <p> Hence , I know where they are coming from they do n't  see the outperformance of the miners as a leading indicator of anything , but only as a little flurry of speculation that is too far from the mean and thus will ultimately be wrong . <p> As McEwen talked about MUX , gold , and what has happened in the sector which nobody on CNBC cares about one of the traders on the show interrupted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedging gold now , which he had also pointed out the miners failed to do when they should have at the $1900 top . <p> McEwen responded with his bullish target : $5000 , and he threw out a time line too : 3-4 years . It was at this point that the camera went back to Amanda Drury ( at the 2 minute mark in the clip at the link above ) who reacted with outright laughter , which the network edited out leaving only a mocking look . <p> Now , McEwen has been a guest on the show since the beginning of this gold bull market ( early 2000s ) as well , and I have no doubt in my mind that they knew ahead of time that they had invited a very bullish miner to talk . Not just that , Goldcorp , which he co-founded , made a splash in the early years by marketing itself as being about as anti-hedging as was possibleall the way up from $300 his slogan was " gold is money " and they had a program of withholding gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hedgers were doing : that is , Goldcorp was accumulating a net long . So the surprised look and classless live laughter in reaction to his call for gold $5000 in " 3 or 4 years " seems to me a bit cheap , even for them . <p> Gold went from $35 to $200 in 3-4 years , $100 to $850 in 3-4 years , and from $300 to $1900 in 11 years . These are gains of approximately , 500% , 750% , and 550% all of which occurred despite various naysayers . Anyone with any experience in the market has seen things far more extreme than gold tripling or quadrupling from these levels over 3-4 years . Did Amanda Drury expect the Dow to crash in 2008 like it did ? Did she expect it to recover and go off to record highs five years later like it did ? Did she ( as her cohort pointed out ) expect Apple to go from $3 to nearly $300 per share in 3-4 years , or from $100 to $1000 in the same time ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite short in the whole market back in 2000 when I was short the stock market , which I have not been so far in this cycle . I have seen things in my 25 years in the business that would not make me laugh at such a call even if I were bearish on gold . <p> CNBCs reaction was contrived , especially as gold is on the verge of breaking out and CNBC has always knocked it at such times . For a gold call that is n't all that far from the mean especially given that the yellow metal has outperformed most investment asset classes for over a decade Drurys reaction would seem to portray her naivety . <p> When I first predicted in 2000 that gold would go to $2000 by 2013 people thought that call was out of touch with reality . They thought you would have had to have hyperinflation to get numbers like that from $300 per ounce . <p> We had a lot more inflation than I expected , except it is still mostly in assets not to minimize the consumer price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see how many billions of dollars are in circulation per troy ounce of gold today , and in the past . <p> These people act as if they have no idea that the only reason the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have nearly tripled off their 2008 bottoms ( a period of about 5 years ) is thanks to the nearly doubling of money supply since that time . Indeed , they probably do n't  . <p> Our forecast for gold today is for it to get to $3-5k by 2017 . I have raised this target from my original call of $2700 owing to the unexpected actions of the Fed . My original target assumed that the unsound monetary policy would have been abandoned by then . Instead it was expanded and compounded and amplified . <p> The new forecast presages a severe stagflation over the next few years . That look you see on Drurys face at the end of that clip is the one you see as you are about to hit a deer on the highway , and its too late . The laughter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My critics laughed at my call for $2000 , and they are doing the same again today with a more modest target as though they have not learned anything . The only time they stopped laughing in the past 14 years was for precisely that brief moment where they should have been selling gold and buying the Dow . <p> Those who look to people like Amanda Drury on CNBC for their investment advice will find out the hard way that she has no clue of what she is talking about . <p> Jeff Berwick , I believe , has it totally correct with his " 5 Killer Bees " to survive The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) : bullion ( and the miners ) , bitcoin , bullets , bud ( medical marijuana which TDV Golden Trader currently covers and finds amazing investment opportunities in the space ) and " being " . <p> Next week I 'll be bringing another investment opportunity to TDV Premium subscribers in the junior gold mining space . If gold even half does what I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $0.05 junior gold/silver mining stocks will have exponential returns . The fact that they are laughing about the gold price rising dramatically on CNBC is just another indicator that the gold market now is near the same level psychologically as it was in 2000 when it was at $250.

@@99475144 @3675144/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Fried by the Volt <p> The following post is by Redmond Weissenberger , Managing Editor of the Dollar Vigilante and Director of the Mises institute of Canada <p> A government that sets out to abolish market prices is inevitably driven toward the abolition of private property ; it has to recognize that there is no middle way between the system of private property in the means of production combined with free contract , and the system of common ownership of the means of production , or socialism . It is gradually forced toward compulsory production , universal obligation to labor , rationing of consumption , and , finally , official regulation of the whole of production and consumption . <p> The wholesale socialization and subsequent destruction of the US economy continues apace . The most recent example of the massive malinvestment brought on by the Federal leviathan is the saga of the Chevy Volt . <p> GM recently decided to suspend production of the volt due to declining sales they have also stopped releasing sales projections . From AP : <p> A GM spokesman said Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from March 19 until April 23 , idling 1,300 workers at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant . <p> General Motors was once the Jewel in the crown of American Capitalism . By many , it was considered the greatest manufacturing company in America , if not the world . The company was destroyed by the insidious nature of the Neo-National Socialism that has infected the USA for well on 80 years now , when the merger of state and corporate power that swept across Europe was aped first by Hoover and then by FDR in the disastrous New Deal . The unions that were encouraged to eat away at GM from the inside were bailed out and the US Federal government took a 25% ownership in company . In the 2009 deal to " restructure " GM , the bondholders were wiped out , and the Unions were given a free pass to continue their destructive behaviors . <p> Built by what is now a de facto state-owned corporation , the Volt was the child of the green-washed brains of the Obama administration . The Volt was built for no-one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man " . Who is buying the Volt ? According to Bill Visnic , senior editor of Edmunds.com , " The Volt appeals to an affluent , progressive demographic " General Motors itself stated that the average income of a Volt buyer is $175,000 a year . This trend does of course line up with the type of individual who has been at the forefront of the environmental movement since day one . A rarefied elite , righteously indignant , statist in nature , ready to have the government force eco-correct behavior on all who inhabit the land . The classic example is Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , who once opined that " In the event that I am reincarnated , I would like to return as a deadly virus , to contribute something to solving overpopulation " . <p> The Volt is a very good example of what happens when the means of production falls into the hands of the State . The system of profit and loss that can only operate when prices are set by the private owners of the materials and the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of the state wherein there is no rational economic calculation possible . From Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig von Mises : <p> Hence , in a socialist state wherein the pursuit of economic calculation is impossible , there can bein our sense of the termno economy whatsoever . In trivial and secondary matters rational conduct might still be possible , but in general it would be impossible to speak of rational production any more . There would be no means of determining what was rational , and hence it is obvious that production could never be directed by economic considerations . <p> When taking a look at the resources that have been poured into the Volt , one can only come to the conclusion that there was no rational economic calculation present . It is estimated by Tom Gantert that the Volt has received up to $3 Billion in Local , State and Federal Subsidies . And if you believe that GM has indeed sold 6,000 Volts , then the total subsidy per car can be estimated anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 . All of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( eligible for a $7,500 federal rebate of course ) . <p> Compare that with TATA motors Nano , a four door wonder built in India with a sticker price of just under $3,000 USD for the base model . Without the hampering effects of state intervention and government backed unions monopolizing the labor pool , it is amazing what can be profitable . Its a wonder the car does n't  explode into flames . <p> If you have an understanding of the necessity of private property , and the market based , wealth generating price system that accompanies it , one should n't be surprised that the Volt is such a massive failure . Even after the clear example of the failed crusade of abolishing private property for half of the worlds population during the 20th century yielded nothing but starvation and death on a genocidal scale , there are still some who claim that " Socialism has n't  been tried " or " free markets cant allocate resources " . Of course if we take an honest look at the test cases provided by history , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the end of the Second World War , Germany was split into two halves the eastern half ruled by the Soviet Union was known as the GDR or German Democratic Republic , and the western half was occupied by France , the UK and USA and known as the FRG or Federal Republic of Germany . <p> In East Germany Socialism and the abolition of private property and central planning of the economy for the allocation of resources was instituted . According to Jacob G. Hornburger , in Western Germany : <p> The Allied occupation officials imposed an extensive set of price controls on the German economy . When Ludwig Erhard , the free-market leader of Germany , asked the officials to lift the controls in order to relieve the economic plight of the German people , they refused , claiming that an immediate lifting of controls would produce chaos . One Sunday morning , to the surprise of everyone , Erhard issued a public announcement lifting the controls . It was that action , more than anything else , that led to what became known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day threw off the yoke of price controls and opened the doors for innovation and capital accumulation . <p> MERCEDES VS . TRABANT <p> Two populations , similar in composition , were subjected to two different economic systems , private property and free market prices vs. state ownership of the means of production . The results of this 40 year experiment were quite clear in 1988 , West Germany was producing the best cars in the world and East Germany was producing the Trabant , a car that literally melted away . <p> The USSA has been accelerating down the road of serfdom for more than 80 years now , and the incremental destruction of private property and the rule of law . The USSA is gradually forcing compulsory production , universal obligation to labor , rationing of consumption , and , finally , official regulation of the whole of production and consumption .

@@99475146 @3675146/ <h> TSA : New Sheriff , New Rules ? <p> Changes within the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) should prompt you to reconsider the wisdom of crossing into or out of the United States . The TSA is slowly turning from counter-terrorism to criminal law enforcement , which will include the pursuit of tax violaters . And you may not be able to rely on the agency 's notorious incompetence for much longer . <p> Meet the New Sheriff . Not Quite like the Old <p> John Pistole stepped down as head of the TSA on December 31 , leaving an acting administrator to keep the seat warm . On February 3 , Rep. John Katko ( R-Camillus , NY ) conducted his first hearing as chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security . News reports glowed about his ' performance ' , saying " Katko looked as if he 's done this before . " All signs point to Katko becoming a new power player behind the TSA . <p> The man is a hard-liner with a mandate . The freshly-elected Katko is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering 20 percentage points of the vote even though his democratic opponent overspent him by millions . After his first subcommittee hearing , Katko explained that his training in the US Attorney General 's Office made heading the subcommittee " a very easy transition . " <p> Having been a prosecutor also defines his vision of the TSA and whom its agents should target . Pistole had publicly stressed the need to control terrorists . Katko now publicly calls for the detection and detention of anyone suspected or guilty of committing a crimeany crime . Only one month into his stint at the House of Representatives , Katko has introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at reforming the TSA . <p> One of them , the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act ( HR 719 ) would require TSA law enforcement officers to " spend on average at least 50 percent of their time investigating , apprehending , or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States . " Katko accuses the current TSA of relying " primarily " on the " criminal investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct their own investigations . <p> There is no indication of which crimes would absorb 50% of the focus of TSA agents . The category " crime " is so broad that it includes everything from prostitution to drunk driving , murder to rape , insider trading to bribery , domestic violence to child support arrears . Tax violations , money laundering and other financial ' crimes ' are likely to be among the most hotly pursued ' crimes ' because they invite the confiscation of goods and bank accounts ; they would be profitable . And , since individuals only need to be " suspected " of a crime , almost anyone crossing the US Border could be summarily detained aka arrested . <p> " Show me the man , and I 'll show you the crime . " Lavrentiy Beria , head of Joseph Stalin 's secret police <p> HR 719 ( and Katko ) would convert the TSA into an explicit frontline for the enforcement of criminal law in America . <p> Do n't Rely on the TSA 's Incompetence <p> In an article entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Feb. 6 ) observed , " The TSA already delves into a treasure trove of private information about all Americans in the name of security before they even arrive at the airport , including tax identification numbers , vehicle and job history , and property ownership records . " <p> But the TSA confronts two problems in gathering information about travellers . First , it is an incompetent bureaucracy . Second , few people have signed up for its PreCheck program through which the TSA hoped to reap a bonanza of sensitive information . <p> The PreCheck program allows a traveller to be approved for quick TSA processing at airports ; for example , the traveller will never need to remove his shoes or to endure secondary screening . The cost to the PreChecked traveller is $85 and the surrender of personal data on everything from financial transactions to interactions with family . <p> TechDirt ( Jan. 23 ) listed the type of " commercial data " that enrollment opens to TSA eyes . It includes : " public record data , such as criminal history and real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; other publicly available information , such as directories , press reports , location data and information that individuals post on blogs and social media sites ; and wide ranging data such as purchase information , customer lists from registration websites , and self-reported information provided by consumers that is obtained by commercial data sources such as data brokers . " <p> But not enough travellers were willing to turn their data over to the TSA in exchange for keeping their shoes on . Of course , the TSA views the low enrollment as a marketing problem rather than the result of their offering a bad product . The official solution ? The TSA quietly announced its plans to hire huge data mining companies to woo Americans into the PreCheck program . Those who fly should expect solicitations and promotions from the quasi-private sector also known as crony capitalists over 2015 . <p> Before you sign up , however , read the small print because the data companies want more than your enrollment . They will want permission to access your credit card accounts , your grocery receipts , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . <p> The information has clear commercial value to any company that possesses it . But the data will also be used to provide the TSA with an assessment of a traveller as a terror risk . The TSA is confident enough about this method of assessment that it is considering a reduction in airport screeners for whom the massive outsourced data mining would substitute . ( It is not clear whether the information will be used by other government agencies . But private companies have the ' advantage ' of not being subject to constitutional restraints on their behavior . ) <p> If HR 719 and Katko are successful , then the TSA will undoubtedly receive an assessment of a traveller 's criminal status as well . Even if HR 719 is not successful , criminal evaluations are likely to occur . In soliciting bids for " multiple vendors " of PreCheck , for example , the TSA was clear that it explicitly wanted data correlations between terrorism , criminal behavior and commercial conduct . Moreover , the bid solicitation reads , <p> " Contractors may use commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-screening ) of potential applicants . The eligibility evaluation shall include , at a minimum , validating identity and performing a criminal history records check to ensure that applicants do not have disqualifying convictions in conjunction with the TSA Pre++ " disqualifying offenses " <p> Note : the actual bid solicitation seems to have disappeared from online . <p> Of course , the evaluations may ( and probably will ) occur whether or not you enroll in PreCheck ; but they will be more difficult to generate and , perhaps , less thorough . <p> In a sad irony , travellers who eschew PreCheck for privacy reasons may receive enhanced scrutiny . The Federal Register describes the PreCheck program as " a risk-based approach to aviation screening that allows TSA to focus its limited resources on unknown and perhaps high-risk travelers . " This means greater suspicion and TSA time-hours will fall upon those who have opted not to be pre-cleared as a terrorist risk or as a criminal . Such people can expect longer lines , greater inspection and more indignities . <p> Two facts seem clear about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will focus increasingly upon criminal screening , including ( and , perhaps , with special emphasis ) upon financial and tax ' crimes ' . Arrests , fines and confiscations at the border will almost certainly increase . Second , travellers will be evaluated with more competence by semi-private data companies than they were by low-level civil servants . Any information culled even from unrelated parties such as Facebook may be a larger factor in your ability to cross the border or for the process to move forward smoothly . <p> Conclusion <p> Stop travelling to or from the United States . If you live within American territory , consider other options . If you choose to stay , be aware that the borders are closing , and it may happen more quickly than you expect .

I generally like reading Gary North because he not only has an extremely strong foundation in Austrian economics , monetary theory , and free market capitalism , but he has prolific publications showing that the Bible is largely a doctrine supporting those principles , and specifically espouses against socialism , totalitarianism and for the sovereignty of man . <p> I wo n't comment on the book further , but it raises what I think is a question of profound importance : Are there conspiracies ? And what impact have they had on history and our current state of affairs ? Conspiracies often get a really bad rap , but fundamentally understanding this question is paramount to understanding the way the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we are likely headed . <p> If you believe there 's no such thing as conspiracy theories , it follows that the governments of men are just bumbling incompetents , or isolated and greedy individuals acting in their own self-interest ( albeit on a vast scale ) . However , if conspiracy theories are right , there 's a more coordinated , nefarious agenda at work here , and our current path seemingly towards totalitarianism is a more pre-determined , more inevitable outcome . If a conspiratorial view of history is valid , the root causes of our present social problems probably run deeper , and will be more difficult to root out than many of us imagine . <p> Its amazing to me how many analytical and insightful people dismiss conspiratorial explanations out of hand , despite all factual evidence to the contrary , just because the term " conspiracy theory " carries so many negative connotations . Even if the conspiracy is not dismissed , it is often rendered off-limits to further discussion or analysis , to the obvious benefit of the conspirators ( by design one could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conspiracy theories " to clarify some terms : <p> THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION <p> The preeminent conspiracy theory of the last century has still not been adequately explained in line with existing evidence . The governments ( Warren Commission ) report is more evidence of a cover-up than a credible conclusion . Yet , with time , most of America has seemingly moved on . <p> But let 's separate fact from theory . To say that the single bullet scenario defies the laws of physics is a fact , not a theory . To say that the autopsy on the body was doctored and inaccurate is a fact , not a theory . It might be evidence of a conspiracy , but it is not a " conspiracy theory " . To say , however , that the CIA was behind the killing , or the mafia , is a theory . <p> 9/11 <p> The most widely researched and discussed conspiracy theory of this century continues to divide the country and to stifle much intelligent discussion and a more thorough analysis . To point out that the " official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even mentioned in the 9/11 Commission report ) is not a conspiracy theory . The testimony from firefighters that bombs were going off in the buildings before the planes hit is factual evidence of a conspiracy , but not a conspiracy theory . To say that Cheney orchestrated the attacks , or the Mossad ( evidenced by the Dancing Israelis : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ztgzW4cOdw ) IS a conspiracy theory . To be unable to point out FACTS that run contrary to the official account , however , is not a conspiracy theory , its tyranny . <p> But certainly not all conspiracy theories are true . In fact , false conspiracy theories are thrown out by conspirators themselves to discredit truth seekers and to generally give conspiracy theories a bad name . The problem is that the mainstream media only promotes a single , generally accepted , version of events and rarely scrutinizes the government or official sources anymore . The alternative media promotes every hare-brained conspiracy theory thrown out there . I know this is hard for a lot of folks , but just look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions .

To believe that governments are not capable of lies and deserve our blind faith , though , is to be truly nanve .

There are literally hundreds of proven , well-documented conspiracies . We now know the Federal Reserve was created as a conspiracy ( secret meetings on Jekyll Island , lies about the nature of the system , and operating secretively to this day ) . We know that the sinking of the Lusitania was a set up ( sacrifice ) to get the U.S. into World War I , after a coordinated anti-German marketing campaign in the press based on the British establishments secret promise to get the US to enter the war to save the UK from defeat .

To truly understand the impact of conspiracies in history , one must understand the extent of secret societies throughout the ages . Secret societies have provided the cover and coordination for all the conspiracies of any real importance . We know that many of our Presidents and many of the Founding Fathers were Freemasons . The Bushes ( as well as John Kerry and many captains of industry ) were part of Skull and Bones . The Knights Templar , the Jesuits , the Knights of Malta , Opus Dei and Ordo Templi Orientis were noteworthy secret religious organizations ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iPv7G20FELs ) . The Council on Foreign Relations , Bilderberg Group and Bohemian Grove are modern and inarguably secretive organizations that coordinate an agenda on an international and global scale , away from public scrutiny .

That conspiracy is designed to build a totalitarian system where men rule over other men ( and women ) , replacing our God-given rights with a system of tyranny and feudal overlords . It is the vision of men supplanting the role of God , with the technology to extend life , travel the stars , and perfect the human design . This was the original promise given to Eve in the Garden of Eden when the serpent said , " ye shall be like gods " . It is the " Ancient Promise " followed throughout the ages by various religious orders , ancient cultures and secret societies .

The minor conspiracies we see today , including the currently-engineered economic collapse , are mere subplots to the one grand plan . <p> In an earlier post I described how Jesus laid out a plan for the church to circumvent this new world order , based on a system where very few rights were delegated to governments , where people lived in a system of mutual self-support , loving their neighbors as themselves , and not relying on the government to be their benefactor .

Purchasing gold may become outright illegal if what 's going on in Connecticut is any indication . Even if Connecticut 's plan to track all gold sales is n't a harbinger for a modern day Roosevelt-like ban on gold ownership , it will at the very least drive gold bullion dealers out of business with the cost of complying with the new regulation . That will create artificial scarcity in Connecticut and could set a precident for other US States . <p> To require precious metals or stones dealers to provide a periodic statement of transactions in an electronic format to the local licensing authority and retain any goods purchased for at least ten days , and to make the requirements applicable to precious metals or stones dealers similar to those applicable to secondhand dealers . <p> Introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary North pointed out concering this bill : " You may recall that the terror of the French Revolution was run by the Committee on Public Safety . " In the section on " Bullions and Coins " , the bill says : <p> For bullion and coin sales , in addition to the requirements under current law , the bill requires dealers to keep the record in English , be consecutively numbered , and include the sellers general description . <p> Did you catch that last part about including the seller 's general description ? <p> This may be only the relatively tiny state of Connecticut , but the very fact that any government in the US is paying so much attention to gold transactions should send a very clear signal . Not only should you be running not walking to get more goldYou should also be running to get a lot of it outside of the US as a clampdown seems to be in the works . <p> Maybe it 's no coincidence that this bill is being introduced in Connecticut .

The state of Connecticut and the city of Boston , Massachusetts have been host to the kind of violence that governments love to use to restrict gun ownership and to increase surveillance powers . It would n't surprise me if we saw similar legislation to what Connecticut is proposing coming out of Massachusetts . Eventually , I imagine such legislation sweeping across the US . <p> There will come a time when you will simply not be able to get precious metals because of a lack of supply ( and no one will sell at any dollar price ) or because purchase and ownership of the metals will be flat out illegal . This is n't hyperbole . This is a prediction based on history and current trends . We have all watched as mere penstrokes have increased the state 's power to monitor , spy upon and kill .

( often referred to as perpetual traveller , permanent tourist or prior taxpayer ) , I have travelled to nearly 100 countries . During those travels there has always been one defining moment , upon entry into a country , which shows that the country is what is generally thought of as a " third world country " . <p> It is the moment when , upon arrival , you are charged a fee to enter the country . The reason generally being that the government of the country has so destroyed the economy and/or they have so little understanding of what creates wealth that they think that the way to make their country prosperous is to charge a fee upon entry rather than allowing people to enter freely and transact , trade and spend their money in the economy . Either that or the government is so desperate for money that it uses this as a significant source of revenue . <p> They have this in Cambodia , Indonesia , Bolivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it in the US . <p> The US has long-used " visa application fees " to bilk money from people in countries like Thailand as a way to raise money but now the US has announced that they are going to charge a $5.50 fee to Canadians upon entering the US . <p> The fee is ludicrous and counterproductive for many reasons . Not least of which is making it five dollars and fifty cents , ensuring that payment of the transaction will take twice as long as normal to make the extra change . Canadians who are one of the only large groups of people still bringing some economic activity into the US will both be turned off by having to pay to enter the US but also by the extra long lines to enter as they make change for this fee . <p> Not to mention the hilarity of calling it an " inspection fee " .

I snapped a photo of them on my way down . <p> As I walked down the runway , one of the men with guns told me , " go to the third man down , he can take care of you there .

Jeftovic <p> Ghandi was once asked , " What do you think about Western Civilization ? " to which he famously replied " I think its a good idea . " He may as well have been talking about free market capitalism . <p> Capital in the 21st Century has hit the world like a new teen idol sensation . Everybody is drinking the Kool-Aid and its being held up as the most important book ever written on the subject of how runaway capitalism leads to wealth inequality . Paul Krugman of course , loves it . As does every head of state and political hack in the ( formerly ) free world . A text-book sized brick that can be condensed down to a couple bullet points : <p> that unchecked capitalism leads to increasing wealth inequality , and <p> this can be fixed through government management , most notably more taxes and higher minimum wages . <p> What 's not to love ? <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the numerous factual errors and flawed research methodologies in the book , and countering the income equality assertions with observations around how the standard of living generally increases across the board during periods of free(er) market capitalism ( such as England during the industrial revolution under the classical gold standard or wider Europe during the High Middle Ages ) . <p> The age we live in today is not an example of this . I submit that the modern run of standard of living increases , say from end of WWII to present is not an example of " free markets given room to run " , but rather a crack-up boom fuelled by credit expansion ( cheap money ) and cheap energy . This era is now drawing to a close , as the cost of energy inexorably rises and the global debt super-cycle finally hits a wall . After decades of government targeted inflation , after the better part of a decade of ZIRP , after increased regulations in every aspect of our lives , after civil liberties being for the most part abolished ( after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and we are all under continuous pervasive surveillance ) what is difficult to fathom is that political economists can still make hay in the world by blaming its problems on capitalism gone wild and runaway free markets. - Put simply , true capitalism requires free markets , free markets require a free society and we do not live in a free society . <p> So let 's do something different here and accept a core premise of Capital , and say that wealth inequality is increasing , and that its a bad thing . Where the point is completely missed is in what causes it ( ostensibly " free market capitalism " ) and what to do about it ( increase government control , induce more inflation and raise taxes ) . <p> The point of this essay is to assert that it is not unchecked capital or runaway free markets that cause increasing wealth inequality , but rather that the underlying monetary system itself is hard-coded by an inner temple of ruling elites in a way which creates that inequality . <p> Well see that wealth does n't  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at by Pareto and captured in various " 1% memes " ) but rather can be best visualized as a vortex , like a tornado , or more accurately , a black hole , a centre swirling around a **27;207;TOOLONG nexus that sucks wealth into it from the periphery ( the rest of society ) . Society itself is hard-wired to facilitate this in such an entrenched and subtle fashion that we have arrived in a zeitgeist in which the key facets of this system ( the nature of money itself ) is out-of-scope . Its not even part of the debate because almost everybody in society is oblivious to its machinations . ( This is the reason why in my writings I do not refer to underclass or overclass but rather , the " outer-class " and the inner elites . ) <p> Because the nature of money itself has been so , for lack of a better word , " esotericized " , I need to include Stephen Zarlengas seminal work " The Lost Science of Money " in our expose . While Zarlenga blesses us with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does a superb job deconstructing the perniciousness of central banking and debt based money systems , he erroneously arrives at conclusions favouring direct government creation of fiat money ( he even came out in favour of that whole " Trillion Dollar Coin " idea because to him it signalled a tacit admission that the government does n't  really need the Federal Reserve ) . - However even his arrival at this seemingly ( to us ) off-base solution tells us something vital about the system within which we are all immersed . <p> This is what it tells us : if smart , scholarly people happen to believe that government fiat money is both feasible and beneficial to society , and they put serious thought into devising such a system , what they will not come up with is one run by private central banks issuing debt-based money . They just wo n't . Any critical analysis would grasp that such an architecture would become a parasitic cancer on the entire society . When you realize this , its hard not to posit a far-reaching conspiracy to institutionalize inequality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ascribe to conspiracy what can be explained by stupidy " it to me falls short in this case . When we look at the structure of the entire monetary system and realize that its the worst way possible to design a such a system if you have the best interests of the wider society in mind then you ca n't help but ask in whose interests was it designed and implemented ? <p> As such , the system within which we find ourselves seems to be one that is n't designed to be in the best-interest of most of us reading this ( and would remain true even if you were inexplicably reading this on Huffington Post , Slate or Business Insider ) . <p> If we want to understand where wealth inequality comes from , " The Lost Science of Money " is a good place to start- for two reasons : 1 ) his book is an exhaustive history of money , even if one disputes some of his takeaways from it ) and 2 ) like many libertarians and an-caps , he understands the pernicious , malignant effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly ( government controlled fiat , because governments will always inflate and debase ) but his exposure of the fraud is convincing. - Zarlengas main thesis can be put briefly that the primary arena of human struggle throughout history has been mainly over the monetary control over societies . If Zarlenga had to put it in one sentence , which he did , it would be this one : <p> " It is by misdefining the nature of money , special interests have often been able to assume control of societys monetary system , and in turn , the society itself " . ( emphasis added , and you 'll see why soon ) . - He broke his book ( almost as big as Capital ) down into sections , examining that : <p> The Main Obstacle is The Mystification of Money <p> Monetary History Has Been Ignored <p> Monetary History Has Been Censored <p> Monetary Data is Often Misinterpreted <p> All of which is correct and explains why a book like Capital is on the New York Times Best Seller List . The premise that wealth inequality is caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism gone wild ) derives from the biggest misinterpretation of them all . Its not only monetary data that is misinterpreted , its the entire framework around monetary policy itself which leads to these increasing imbalances. - In other words , it is the structure of our monetary system itself which institutionalizes accelerating wealth inequality. - Thus , taxation , intentional inflation , credit expansion , money supply injections and central planning all exacerbate income inequality , they do not alleviate it. - Pikkety is a political economist ( as is Krugman ) and Zarlenga calls political economists the " Priesthood of the Bankers . " - Among the Priesthood I 'll again list off Zarlengas bullet points but this time I 'll inject my own interpolation of their meaning in todays climate : <p> Ideas rule : <p> Here we mean academic political economists with no real world financial , market or business experience devise elegant theories which look good on a blackboard , will earn them Nobel Prizes and become ensconced into the prevailing orthodoxy of conventional economic thought . Governments can then utilize these theories ( or self-serving adaptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live beyond their means or otherwise further their own interests and those of their cronies . <p> These policies are utterly backwards in that they posit what economic forces should do according to some model , instead of trying to understand what they actually do based on observed results . When you do unleash Nobel laureates with their theoretical constructs on the real world , you do n't  get " green shoots " , you get LTCM . <p> Economists as propagandists . <p> Two words : Paul Krugman . <p> Economics degenerates from the scholastics <p> Even the untouchable pillar of Keynesianism is a bastardized caricature of what Keynes actually said , which was that governments could smooth out the business cycle by deficit spending during bust years by running surpluses during the boom years . In its most basic form this just means saving for a rainy day . But governments do n't  do that , because ( as people like Krugman opine ) " the government does n't  have to pay its bills " . Thus , its all deficit spending , all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay down debt was Eisenhower ( the so-called Clinton era surpluses were a sleight-of-hand fiction ) . The last president to pay off the debt was Andrew Jackson . <p> Fostering a disdain for the lessons of history <p> You can look at almost any financial panic , especially over the last hundred years , and you 'll see the same thing play out repeatedly . <p> For example , if you go back and look at the S&amp;L crisis and the policy response to it , one is stricken with the similarities between then and now , how nothing was actually resolved in the policy response to S&amp;L , in fact just the contrary , how bad behaviour and incompetence were rewarded instead of allowed to be punished via free enterprise rules of engagement . <p> The pattern is as follows : <p> poor policy , credit expansion , government management of the economy ( i.e. housing bubble ) and insulation from consequences by special interests ( bankers , etc ) leads to a panic . <p> The cycle repeats each time ensuing bubble and subsequent meltdown increasing by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably the most under appreciated commentators on our monetary system of this era . If ever there was a pair of " must " read books about what really causes wealth inequality in our society it is his Special Privilege : How the Monetary Elite Benefit At Your Expense , and The Monetary Elite vs Golds Honest Discipline . <p> In Special Privilege , - a chapter entitled " The Recurring Nightmare " enumerates the serial financial panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries ( to wit : The Panic of 1819 , The Panic of 1837 , The Panic of 1857 , The Panic of 1873 , The Panic of 1893 , and the Panic of 1907 , whose policy response led in a straight line to The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 ) . LoCascio poses the question " Isnt There A Lesson Here ? " <p> " The 19th century and early 20th century- panics were so uniformly accompanied by the liberal extension of credit for speculative purposes that any serious reviewer of these events could not possibly fail to hypothesize a likely causative relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the role the prior euphoria played in causing the resulting panic . Rather , attention was focused on the panics themselves and the virtually unanimous conclusion by those in position to bring about reform , was the great elasticity of currency would ameliorate , if not eliminate , the panics . " <p> He went on to observe , <p> " During the 50 years of the National Banking System , currency had increased from roughly- $1 billion to $3 billion or , by a factor of 3 . Bank loans on the other hand , grew from roughly $0.5 billion to $13 billionor by a factor of 25 . This provides a rough numerical measure of the tendency ( which continues to this day ) that money creation has been tied to debt creation by banks . " - <p> LoCascio published Special Privilege in 2001 ( he died in 2006 ) , but large swaths of his work could easily be cut and pasted into the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis and no doubt , will be highly germane during the forthcoming , next crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( possibly imminent ) wave of financial panic , it may be impossible to kick the can down the road yet another time . We may have finally , collectively come to the end of the line on " the great fiat monetization of everything " and be barreling toward the brick wall of unsustainability at the end of the runway . <p> This is what is so maddening about the irony of a book like Capital , chalk full of fallacious data and erroneous conclusions makes Pikkety hotter than Justin Bieber , while brilliant historians such as LoCascio die in obscurity . The fact is that financial panic , followed by institutional wealth transfer ( and confiscation ) is systemically ingrained into what is called " conventional economic thought " <p> The big question around wealth inequality is this : why does wealth inequality increase as the distance from the nexus of political power increases ? Why does wealth concentrate toward the centre ? When asked this plainly , the answer becomes just as obvious : because the system is rigged that way . <p> Because that is wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are able to see the underlying flawed assumptions that are otherwise considered " out of scope . " <p> Whether you do n't  believe in a classical gold standard ( Zarlenga ) or you do ( LoCascio ) , whether you think bitcoin is viable or lunacy , where all these schools of thought intersect is at the point that finds private , fractional central banking a blight on civilization that leads to cronyism oligarchy between banksters , career politicians and corporate/kleptrocrat elites and this is the point that is most vociferously relegated out-of-scope in any kind of dialog around todays central , pressing issues of the time . <p> As LoCascio predicts , <p> " The ultimate crisis will occur when the situation is so thoroughly perverted that the defenders of the status quo can no longer resurrect confidence in the system . " <p> What Pikkety has succeeded in is proving that we are not there yet . The propensity of the masses to rally behind this shows that confidence in the system is still long and strong . But what we are seeing are fissures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21st Century but in entirely new and nonsensical economic schools of thought seemingly conjured out of thin air for the sole purpose of justifying and explaining away the otherwise unavoidable distortions and non-sequiturs of our economy ( such as Modern Monetary Theory and Modern Monetary Realism more on those in another post ) . <p> People are still very willing to believe in Unicorn Economics , the emergence of crypto-currencies such as bitcoin point to a widening rejection of that , but it will likely not achieve critical mass until the wheels come off the current system altogether . <p> Postscript : <p> As I completed writing this essay , the ECB announced negative interest rates , in other words NIRP . This is sold to the public as a mechanism to spur bank lending to again stimulate the economy . What nobody asks is how the financial system can be so distorted , so perverted that policymakers can simultaneously implement negative interest rates while holding on to claims of legitimacy around their ability to " regulate " or " manage " the economy , or that the wider society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know some otherwise highly intelligent people who do that this is just some highly abstract financial smoke and mirrors that does n't  really mean much in the real world , remember where you read this first : when NIRP fails to stimulate lending , the next Big Idea in Unicorn Economics will be to target money velocity and put expiry dates on cash . Its the next logical step once you 've entered the Twilight Zone as we have , and that 's also what you get when a global monetary system based on perpetually expanding debt approaches the end of the runway. - ( Or as as Fiat Paper Money author Ralph T Foster put it , - " Reading history is a harmless pastime , reliving it is another matter .

Eastern time on Thursday , the price of Bitcoin climbed to $1,241.30 which was an all-time high for the digital currency . At the same time , the spot price of gold sat at about $1,241.25 per ounce . <p> So it is now accurate to say that bitcoin is as good as gold or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit another all-time high of over $1,290 and continues to rise ! <p> Equally as exciting is the fact that bitcoin surpassed the $20 billion market capitalization mark yesterday as well . <p> As we have mentioned previously , part of this upside can likely be attributed to investors anticipation of the new Winklevoss ' bitcoin ETF 's approval . This will be announced this March 11th . <p> There is a good deal of speculation that it wo n't be approved and that may bring the price of bitcoin down . But the Chinese especially are buying so much bitcoin that over time the upward surge in prices may not be deterred by any one thing . <p> Another contributing factor to bitcoin 's recent surge has been the Chinese 's need to protect assets . <p> With the number of strict capital controls that exist in the country , the Chinese people have been piling into bitcoin as a safe haven asset despite the PBOC 's attempts to freeze withdrawals from major exchanges . <p> Overall , bitcoin has risen over 185% in the last year .

@@99475169 @3675169/ <h> The Khorasan Group : Terrorist Flavor of the Month <p> All the war-propaganda , all the screaming and lies and hatred , comes invariably from people who are not fighting . <p> George Orwell , Homage to Catalonia <p> Obama has scammed the world into waragain . He is unlikely to repeat the facilitating lie this time , however . It was too thoroughly and quickly debunked for him to take the risk . Besides , there is no need . Iraq and Syria are already being bombed . Instead , the lie is now forgotten except by critics of Obama or of war . <p> The Lie And Why The Liars Told It <p> In early September , as he prepared to bomb Iraq and Syria without approval from Congress or the United Nations , Obama faced a dilemma . America had been actively at war for 13 years , ever since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan . The public was war-weary . And the public would be voting Republican or Democrat in only two months time . How could he bomb with public support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic for three reasons . There was general consensus that the new military front on terrorism would consume years and might require U.S. boots on the ground . Iraq and Syria posed no provable or imminent threat to the American homeland nor did they commit an act of war . And Obama had no constitutional , congressional , U.N . or other authority to launch yet another war . <p> In an article ( Sept. 28 ) entitled " The Fake Terror Threat Used To Justify Bombing Syria , " journalists Glenn Greenwald and Murtaza Hussain explained how Obama solved his dilemma . The solution " was found in the wholesale concoction of a brand new terror threat'The Khorasan Group ' . After spending weeks depicting ISIS as an unprecedented threat too radical even for Al Qaeda ! administration officials suddenly began spoon-feeding their favorite media organizations and national security journalists tales of a secret group that was even scarier and more threatening than ISIS , one that posed a direct and immediate threat to the American Homeland . Seemingly out of nowhere , a new terror group was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former province of Iran . The term is sometimes used to reference a more general **25;236;TOOLONG region . ) <p> The meticulous stripping of the lie came only 15 days after its debut . The debut : On September 13 , about a week before the bombing of Syria began , the Associated Press drew upon unnamed officials and classified ( undisclosed ) U.S. Intelligence assessments to warn of a new and deadlier terrorist threat . " At the center isthe Khorasan group , a cadre of veteran al-Qaida fighters . " The Khorasan group were " recruiting Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to board a U.S.-bound airliner " with explosives and destroy airplanes . The AP continued , " The Obama administration has said that the Islamic State group ISIS , the target of more than 150 U.S. airstrikes in recent weeks , does not pose an imminent threat to the continental U.S. The Khorasan group , which has not been subject to American military action , is considered the more immediate threat . " <p> In an anti-war.com article ( Sept. 28 ) entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new group 's importance to Obama . " What 's so fearsome about ' Khorasan ' ? " Raimondo asked , " Well , they could n't care less about establishing a Caliphateand as for overthrowing Assad , the Khorasanians wo n't stoop to conquer . No , nothing less than an attack on America , preferably using an airliner as a weapon of choice , will do . What they lack in originality they more than make up for when it comes to the all-important Imminence Factor . " <p> Problems one and two were diminished , if not entirely solved . Conveniently , the Khorasan group threatened the American homeland with violence , which is a traditional cause of war . The terrorists-on-steroids roused enough public rage and fear to justify an extended campaign against themor , at least , to quiet or confuse most objections to it . <p> Still One Stumbling Block <p> But what of problem three : the lack of Congressional and U.N . approval ? <p> The Congressional problem remains . Congress is not rushing back to vote on war ; it will stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , the Republicans who dominate the House are mostly hawkish and probably content enough with the status quo . They are also content to have Democrats absorb blow back or military disasters . Obama chose to bypass Congress so let the fall-out land on his shoulders . No wonder Nancy Pelosi , the leading House Democrat , is calling for her colleagues to return early for a war vote . Their absence harms Democrats . <p> The U.N . problem remains . On October 3 , U.N . Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for " all warring sides in this brutal and bloody conflict in Syria . " to redouble their efforts to bring this horrific conflict to an end and help reach a long-overdue political solution . " <p> In short , stop bombing . Obama has tried to sidestep such criticism by organizing a coalition to support his Syrian policy ; this gave the appearance of global consensus . The Daily Mail reported " the U.S. is working with 60 other nations in these attacks against the terrorist group " as of September 28 . <p> Domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure popular opinion . The corporate mainstream media lost no time in stirring the panic that promotes war . Airwaves , internet and print were filled with reports of the Khorasan 's threat to average Americans . On September 20 , a New York Times headline declared , " U.S. Suspects More Direct Threats Beyond ISIS . " While admitting " there is almost no public information about the Khorasan group , " the article went on to state , " it is the cell in Syria that may be the most intent on hitting the United States or its installations overseas with a terror attack . " <p> On September 23 , the Defense of Department ( DOD ) announced that the U.S. had expanded its " action in Syria to disrupt the imminent attackagainst the United States and Western interests conductedby the Khorasan Group who have established a safe haven in Syria to develop external attacks , construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit Westerners . " <p> Even then , however , voices of skepticism spoke in the background . On the same day as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace raised a red flag . Noting that " the ' Khorasan Group ' is a term that gained currency only in the past two week , " Carnegie remarked " what is being discussed is not a ' new terrorist group ' , but rather a special cellof an already existing al-Qaeda franchise . " The article concluded , " the sudden flurry of revelations about the ' Khorasan Group ' in the past two weeks smacks of strategic leaks and political spin . " <p> As skepticism grew , the corporate mainstream media began to backpedal . Five days after pushing the Khorasan story , The New York Times ( Sept. 25 ) questioned the group 's existence . It also observed that official accounts of the threat Khorasan posed " differed " and an attack on the American homeland was now being described as " aspirational " rather than " imminent . " <p> The pivotal point came on September 28 when Greenwald and Hussain blew the lid off the lie . They did so with such force that even liberal , pro-Democrat outlets such as Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Concocted a Terror Threat to Justify Syria Strikes , and the Corporate Media Went Along . " <p> Conclusion <p> In record time , a lie was born and died . But does the truth matter ? The bombing goes on . Perhaps the saga will convince some Americans to vote differently in November . Even if they do , will Republicans be any better on the war issue ? Whatever happens in America , the Iraqis and Syrians murdered by bombing raids that were launched will never draw breath again .

Do you have it in an IRA ? Well , the government might be interested in confiscating it . In a domestic bank account ? Well , legislation has been written legalizing a possible future bail-in . Some of the retirement money sitting in your account could be shaven drastically . That 's what has happened in Cyprus . How about a devaluation ? That 's what the people of Ukraine are suffering through as I write . <p> In 1953 the movie " How to Marry a Millionaire " was out in theaters. $1 million back then bought the equivalent of $8.7 million today ( based on manipulated government numbers , which means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even buy an average apartment in Manhattan today ! <p> Why is n't $1 million worth that much anymore ? Inflation . The Federal Reserve is printing billions of dollars every single month ! Ultra low interest rates in bond markets have also contributed . <p> Unfortunately for US citizens , they will be the victims of a crisis which is only going to get much , much worse . People do n't have the money to start saving in the first place . They 're too busy keeping up with an extravagant and over-inflated lifestyle , taxes , fines and what have you not . On top of that , the United States has chosen a geo-political strategy that has led the rest of the world want off the US dollar . They do n't want to use it anymore . China is buying lots of gold . Russia is threatening to abandon the dollar altogether . <p> When it came to saving , the old-paradigm told the middle class to get into bonds . So imagine your average 65-year-old couple with $1 million in tax-free municipal bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the current economic situation , if they spend that $40,000 a year , adjusted for inflation , it is more than likely they will use their entire bond before they die . If they try to take just 2 percent out , they will have trouble getting by on $20,000 , unless they live in a van . <p> " Thirty years ago , $1 million was a huge amount of money , " says Haitham " Hutch " Ashoo , CEO of Pillar Wealth Management , in Walnut Creek , Calif .

I definitely would suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about 30 or 40 years of unemployment , called retirement . " <p> THE BOTTOM LINE <p> There is some good news in all this . There are more millionaires . More than 9 million people in the US have $1 million or more . <p> But let 's forget about $1 million for moment . After all , $10,890 is the median financial net worth of an American household today , according to an economics professor at New York University . This is poverty . Most Americans are living in abject poverty . If they are not , they are still borrowing just as before the 2008 banking crisis . <p> Governments have no qualms stealing money . As we wrote earlier this year : <p> The Commission is looking to ask the bloc 's insurance watchdog in the second half of 2014 for advice on how to draft a law " to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing , " the document said . Mobilize seems such a palatable word for such flagrant tyranny . <p> The EU executive is also looking into introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be pooled and invested in small companies . Inspired by the US MyRA program ( which we term " TheirRA " ) , Europe will look into such collectivized savings instruments , likely as a way to streamline the " mobilization " of depositors funds . Interesting the US got to this instrument first <p> The EU document states the Commission will " take into account possible future increases in the liquidity of a number of securitization products " and will also " review " how EU rules treat covered bonds by the end of this year , thus making it official the EU is not opposed to re-allowing many of the products which led to the 2008 financial crisis . <p> Then of course there is MyRa in the US . Obama 's plan to help people save . The gist ? You give the US government your money , and at the end of your life , they give it back . I am sure people are running to open up their very own MyRa account . <p> ACTIONABLE ADVICE <p> The old way of savings wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the old ways of working . As Wells Fargo found last year retirement is " a 20th century relic . " As you can see , quite a few people in a recent poll do n't believe they will ever retire : <p> So why bother with it ? Forget retirement . You should be after something more meaningful anyway . Retirement was a concept developed in the twentieth century to keep people working as long as they possibly could in anticipation of the promise they could sit around and do nothing at the end of their life . For me , the concept of retiring is a lot like heaven . Pretty silly . <p> I do n't ever plan on retiring . But why would I ? I love what I do . I was n't scared to take risks and try for something more than my teachers were trying to prepare me for ( a lackluster life ) .

These small businesses have been forced in Washington and Colorado to deal in cash , a much riskier and expensive form of handling money than credit or even cheque for a business like a marijuana dispensary . <p> This has created dangerous obstacles for workers and owners , who must transport the cash they 've been forced to handle . Sure , they might be saving out on certain fees , but sometimes , if you 're handling enough money , cash is not perfect .

If she is considered such , then you best believe so too are gun shop owners , bitcoiners , and marijuana dispensaries . Presley explains further : <p> " And then they told me that they canceled my husbands account too , because our social security numbers are linked , " Presley told VICE News . " They told him that it was because I 'm a notorious adult star . Which is funny , because I 'm kind of a goody-goody in the business , and I 'm not even doing porn anymore . " Presley is not alone .

This is what fascism is the merger between states and corporations . So , basically , government and corporations are not separate entities . At the top , they are all one . What Noam Chomsky terms the " state-enterprise apparatus .

He then terrorized numerous countries including Syria and Libya . He then bombed an estimated 2,581 people from January 20 , 2009 , to December 31 , 2015 . ( Not including the hundreds of civilians killed ) <p> DEBT <p> Meanwhile , the United States currently has a national debt total of over $19.9 Trillion according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing 87% increase in less than an 8 year period . <p> Under the Obama regime , the total US federal government debt nearly surpassed all prior Presidents combined . <p> This , alone , will be Obama 's legacy . At some point , in the not too distant future , the US dollar will either go into hyperinflation to service the debt or the debt will be reneged on . - Either one will cause the US to fall into Zimbabwe/Venezuela level poverty . <p> POVERTY <p> Speaking of poverty , that is where Obama has left your average American . <p> One example being the fact that the number of people who can not afford to eat without government assistance has skyrocketed since 2008 . <p> Moreover , under his administration , a 75-year record was set for the highest percentage of young adults living at home with mom and dad . This number has nearly surpassed the staggering record of 40% during the Great Depression by a full percentage point at 40.9% <p> Many , well into their 20s and 30s live at home with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wildly unreported true rate of unemployment . <p> As this graph from the Federal Reserve shows , the percentage of the population that is employed has gone down since 2000 and fell off a cliff with an incredibly weak recovery after 2008 . <p> And the number of grown adults living with their parents can also be attributed to the massive student loan bubble - which grows at a rate of over $3,000 per second . That was created after the Federal Reserve 's tech bubble and housing bubbles collapsed in 2000 and 2008 . <p> According to Market Watch 's estimate as of this writing , the current student loan debt exceeds : $1,417,426,385,774 . An enormous sum . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Even if Donald Trump was the first politician in world history who honestly wanted to help people AND had any idea how to do so , there is simply no way to fix what Barack Obama and other Presidents have done before him . <p> Either Donald Trump will try to salvage this mess and fail . - Or the globalist elites will crash the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how dangerous Trump 's ideas are and bring in more centralized globalist control in the aftermath . <p> Either way , it 's not going to end pretty . <p> For this reason , we are offering our deepest discounted subscription to The Dollar Vigilante newsletter that we have ever offered . - As low as $1 .

But , I do n't  want you to think that because I am almost totally fine that I do n't  feel sad for those that are n't  . My own way of trying to help is to help my friends , family and employees as much as possible and to continue to spread the ideas that can help those prepare for times like these , and this is nothing compared to the coming collapse of The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) . So , I hope what I can tell you of this event will help you prepare for something much worse coming for most of the Western world . <p> THE STORM <p> For those unaware ( and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wildly mis-reported ) a tropical storm began on Thursday here in Acapulco . I wrote " The Weekend Vigilante " on Friday evening from my usual weekend outpost , Mangos bar , and commented on how it was very rainy and even chilly ( relatively to normal ) . What I did n't  know was that the heavy rain would n't end until about four days later . <p> Tens of thousands of tourists ( estimated at 40,000 ) , mostly from Mexico City , had come to Acapulco for Mexicos version of July 4th , a celebration of independence from European colonialism . Normally on this date , the city of Acapulco is completely full of revelers , many shots are fired into the sky and plenty of tequila , whiskey , and cerveza is consumed . This year , however , the streets were nearly empty on Sunday as they had begun to turn into rivers and while the city was full of tourists not many were out celebrating , most sat in hotel rooms and hotel lobbies drinking and trying to enjoy themselves despite the deluge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday other than a lot of rain , but that does happen in the " rainy season " , usually a few times per year when a tropical storm or small hurricane passes through ( the last large hurricane here was nearly 20 years ago ) . But by Sunday evening it was becoming apparent that there were major problems . <p> The rain had caused mudslides blocking most of the major roads into and out of Acapulco and we then heard that the airport was underwater and , almost to add insult to injury , full of crocodiles ! Apparently in the area near the airport , called Diamante , a very upscale area for the most part , an alligator farm had filled with water and dozens of alligators had floated out , and many were new inhabitants of the airport terminal . <p> THEN WE REALIZED THINGS WERE GETTING BAD <p> Things in town still werent too bad at that point . It was very wet but I continued on with my normal routine without much concern . However , then all the power , water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I returned to my house to pick up my son and we stayed in our hotel for the night ( Las Torres Gemelas Private Suites ) because they still had power and we found one place where the internet was still working and my son and I worked from there . <p> By Monday all the utilities and Internet had returned at my house so we returned to my house and I just assumed that everything was going to be fine since we had all our services restored . <p> Then my maid arrived and told me her house was underwater . I said to her , " You do n't  need to be here working " but she replied that she was worried about my son . That is so typical of the people here her house was practically destroyed and she still came to work saying that she was worried about myself and my son being here alone ( more on that later ) . <p> Of course , I offered to help in any way I could including offering her and her daughter to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very typical of the attitudes of the people here where almost nothing ever seems to bother them too much . <p> Then I found out that my wife who had been in Mexico City was driving back on Sunday and it got so bad that they had to stay in a small town outside of Acapulco called Chilpancingo . She appeared to have no communication but , somehow , she was able to relay messages through to her family and then to me to let me know she was okay but in a town with no power , water , telephones , or Internet . <p> The storm had appeared to have passed but it still had one last kick in it and the downpour returned . <p> News was slow to come by at first but it was slowly getting out that almost all the roads and bridges in the entire area were washed out or destroyed . <p> In Acapulco , all the bank machines were offline and no one could accept credit cards due to the phone problems . I did not have any cash for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars and restaurants and they all told me just to pay them when I could , which turned out to be a few more days . <p> Upon finding out that their credit card machine ( which had been working ) stopped working I jokingly said to my anarcho-son , " Well , I guess well have to wash dishes for a few hours . " <p> He did n't  realize I was joking , rolled up his sleeves and said , " I guess we have to do what we have to do , " and he walked into the kitchen in the back as the manager of the restaurant and I looked on with disbelief . <p> He came back and said : " They told me they do n't  need me to wash dishes , " breaking us into laughter . <p> " Its okay , " I told him , " We have many good friends in this city we can pay later . " <p> WORD GETS OUT OF THE REAL DAMAGE AND SITUATION <p> Finally on Tuesday the storm mostly subsided and then word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights in or out for at least a few more days and no ability to leave the area by road and subsequently , no ability to bring in supplies . <p> Michael Bach , who works with us at TDV in Acapulco had heard before I did and he sent me an email to let me know he was at Wal-Mart trying to stock up on things given that it might be a while before fresh supplies could get in , and he was n't the only person who had the same idea . He spent five hours in line to buy what was left ( all the bread and meat were gone ) and by the end of the day Wal-Mart was practically empty as were all the other grocery stores . <p> I began to grow a bit more concerned but deliveries kept getting made throughout the day . Four large 20 liter bottles of water were delivered and my cook kept receiving food items . I asked how it is that most of Acapulco is out of these items yet we are still receiving them . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> My wife who was stranded in a town with no utilities and no means of communication ( the phones and internet were out and I could n't contact her until Wednesday , four days with no communication ) had been somehow arranging things like it was just another day . <p> That 's why I married her ; she is one of the most amazing people I 've ever met . No matter what the situation , she deals with it . By Tuesday I had driven around and made sure everyone I knew was okay because no one could communicate still . My daughter had been staying with her grandmother and I pulled up to their restaurant and they were completely fine . <p> " You have everything you need here ? " I asked . <p> She winked , " no problem . " Theyve lived in this area for decades and have all the connections they need with the community . A lot of people here have lived for generations with not a lot of money and have seen it all , hurricanes , earthquakes , peso collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands of people from Mexico City , though , were a different story . Trapped in Acapulco with no communication , no bank machines , no credit cards working they were becoming quite desperate . Many hotels allowed them to stay free of charge and then private enterprise came to the rescue . Aeromexico and Interjet began bringing in flight after flight to the re-opened and soggy airport to evacuate them , all free of charge . <p> The area near the airport was the hardest hit and by Wednesday people were beginning to get desperate and people began just taking whatever they could from places like Costco and Wal-Mart . <p> And finally , by late Wednesday some power , phone and internet had been restored where my wife was stranded and I finally found out the real story there . <p> CHILPANCINGO DESTROYED <p> She said that it had been horrific , apparently much worse than what happened here in Acapulco . She said many people had died from drowning and mudslides and for all intents and purposes the city is destroyed . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been completely cut off from the outside and had no services . She was very angry that the government was diverting all their resources to Acapulco and ignoring Chilpancingo where things are exponentially worse . <p> Luckily , as of Wednesday evening , the road from Mexico City to Chilpancingo was reopened and even though Chilpancingo is only about an hour drive from Acapulco she is going to drive to Mexico City and then fly back to Acapulco tomorrow because the road from Chilpancingo to Acapulco is closed indefinitely . Tunnels are completely full of mud and all bridges have been destroyed . <p> As I write it had been a typical hot , sunny Acapulco day and almost the entire bay area where I live is almost totally back to normal . The beaches were cleaned by people very quickly and there was no major damage at all in this area . But as dusk fell incredibly dark clouds have moved in and rain has resumed , although at this point just lightly . A major storm appears to be moving across South East Mexico at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acapulco and this entire region it could be absolutely devastating , especially to the poorer areas in the surrounding areas which have already been hit hard . <p> MORAL OF THE STORY <p> I think there is much to take from my experiences . <p> One of the biggest is the importance of a social network ( and I do n't  mean Facebook ) . With countless friends and family in the city we were able to get through with almost no major problems . The people who work in or own restaurants and bars that I have frequented for nearly ten years treat me like family and were happy to give me whatever I needed and know I am good to pay once payment systems are again up and running . <p> One bar manager even told me that he always has months worth of food and drinks in his house for situations like this and told me if things get really bad that if I need anything it is n't a problem . <p> However that possible need also shows that I was not fully prepared for a disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always get taken care of ( usually by my wife ) I never worried too much about being a " prepper " . And , this event shows that I am generally right . For a number of days while many people had a lot of problems we had the network to easily get by . But , I never like to depend on anyone and so I will be making some changes . <p> Here are some major points and some pass/fail marks : <p> CASH/PRECIOUS METALS FAIL : I often tell people to always make sure they have at least a few weeks of cash in the house and to also have precious metals for when banks/ATMs collapse , and they will . And , I normally do but in the last few months I 've been away , unexpectedly , for weeks at a time and some fairly large expenses came up and I had told my wife to use the cash and the gold and silver coins for the expenses , with the plan to restock those items soon . I will be making a definite point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also realized that I should really talk to the local businesses I frequent about accepting Bitcoin . While Internet was down for a while , which would have been a problem for Bitcoin , it is nice to have alternative payment options . <p> FOOD FAIL : I have also been slow on a plan I 've had for a while to stock up on food items that can last for an extended period . I have moved three times in the last three years and used to have a lot stocked up but some of it had gone bad ( I had n't  bought the proper items ) and some just got lost or even eaten along the way . <p> POWER FAIL : One of the most difficult things about a permanent traveler ( PT ) style lifestyle is that I rarely ever stay in one place ( and definitely not the same house ) for very long . This has its positives but one of the negatives is that it makes it hard to justify buying generators or other like items . If I knew I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install a proper generator system <p> TRANSPORTATION COULD IMPROVE . We have a number of vehicles and all had plenty of gasoline but the one thing that would be a very nice to have option would be a sailboat . Being oceanside if an event that was really bad were to pass and there , like this , were no other transportation options , it would be very nice to have an option by which to escape and a sailboat is one of the best ways to do that . <p> COMMUNICATION COULD IMPROVE . When the power , phones ( land and mobile ) and internet all go out it definitely causes issues . Aside from buying everyone in the family a satellite phone that would be expensive and theyd likely never bring it with them anywhere there is n't much you can do . However , as my wife showed , by having a large network of friends and family who can be counted on to pass messages along goes a long way . <p> WATER PASS : Water was n't an issue . We have large cisterns on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , not to mention a swimming pool if things got bad enough ! <p> SELF-DEFENCE PASS : Arms also werent an issue . We have plenty of guns in the house if things get really bad . And my entire family are well-trained in boxing and martial arts , plus we have hundreds of similar style friends and family . It should also be pointed out that Acapulco still has a very real sense of community , something missing in a lot of Western cities and so the chances of a disaster turning into widespread , violent chaos in places like this is much less than , for example , Los Angeles . <p> I plan on making one of my permanent residences at Galts Gulch Chile and will work on some of the above items for that location . Another great thing about Galts Gulch is that almost all your neighbors will have all these items taken care of as they are well aware to prepare for emergency situations , and as I have shown , having a network of people around you can be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from all of these preparation items , the most important thing is to make money . Almost all of the most hard hit areas are very poor areas where people live in shacks on hillsides . Those with money live in well constructed homes and areas that are suitable to withstand major events . And , as you can see , Acapulco is getting the lions share of support in this region and it is the least devastated , that 's because the most money is here . <p> Its just a fact of life , whether you like it or not . Make money and prepare for crisis situations as best as possible to ensure you and your loved ones can get through tough times as comfortably as possible . <p> Because this was just a large rain shower and it shows how quickly things can go offline . When the fiat currencies collapse and the whole world goes Cyprus , its going to be very bad . Mad Max bad in many areas . And the more people that are prepared and know this the better it will be for everybody .

Just take a look at the Canadian government 's budget plan for 2013 , particularly pages 144 and 145 of Economic Action Plan 2013 . There the Canadian government promises to use Canadian deposits to save " systematicaly important " banks ( emphasis ours ) . <p> The Government proposes to implement a " bail-in " regime for systemically important banks.This regime will be designed to ensure that , in the unlikely event that a systemically important bank depletes its capital , the bank can be recapitalized and returned to viability through the very rapid conversion of certain bank liabilities into regulatory capital . This will reduce risks for taxpayers . The Government will consult stakeholders on how best to implement a bail-in regime in Canada . Implementation timelines will allow for a smooth transition for affected institutions , investors and other market participants . <p> Those bank liabilities that will be allowed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently bailing " out " banks with tax money is too 2012 . Now bail " ins " with customer money are all the rage . When a bank deemed " systematically important " finds itself in trouble , taxpayers wo n't be on the hook to provide the funds to rescue the bank from its bad decisions . Instead the bank will get to look inward , toward its own customers and the funds in their accounts . The Cypriot model is catching on . <p> The report says " in the unlikely event " that one of the banks becomes " non-viable . " How do you think not having to worry about losses will affect the bankers ' attitude toward risk , however ? We 'd say that this government-guaranteed ability to raid deposits will make the banks act more recklessly and also guarantee that the deposits will raided . The big banks in Canada will get to take on enormous risks in pursuit of greater profits for themselves without having to worry about their losses . After all , any losses will now be covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy notion that it would be safe from theft . <p> Before you chuckle at the silly Canucks who thought they 'd be safe , ask yourself if your bank account is really safe too . Because this legal right for the banks to steal deposits is becoming the new normal all across the Western World . It 's well on its way to becoming the law in Europe as early as 2015 . The European Commission has already written a draft of the law which will protect deposits under 100,000 euros , but which will treat deposits over that amount as capital that can be " bailed in " , i.e. stolen to make up losses . <p> Personally , I can not understand how anyone in Canada , the US or anywhere in the Western World could think even for a second that their money is safe in a bank , especially these days as The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) is forcing the governments and banks to show their true colors and just outright take people 's money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation or borrowing anymore .

Keeping your money in the bank at this point is like giving the keys to your house to a family of kleptomaniacs with pyromaniac tendencies . Do n't be surprised if all your stuff ends up getting swiped and your house is burned to ground . <p> Also , due to recent legislative reform , Canadian securities held by those with domicile in Canada can no longer be traded in accounts held in other parts of the world . Non-Canadian banks have been sending letters to their Canadian customers to inform them that they must sell or transfer any Canadian securities held in their accounts by an April 5 deadline . Canadians ca n't even transact with an offshore broker who is n't registered in their specific PROVINCE . Even US slaves are a bit freer in this regard as they only have to file with the SEC .

You can also be part of the vanguard who is using technology to avoid the government-banking-fiat currency system altogether by switching from fiat currency accounts to the decentralized digital currency realm with Bitcoin . If you must have a bank account , do n't keep it in one of the kleptomaniac banks of the Western World . Instead get the account in a safer , less indebted country .

@@99475186 @3675186/ <h> Do n't  Bother Raising The Minimum Wage <p> Elizabeth Warren just realized that the minimum wage should be $22 if it had kept up with economic growth . She suspects in her tender , socially conscious heart that greedy employers have been shafting the lowest level employees . But she 's laying her suspicions on the wrong bunch of people . She might want to read up on the currency debasement of the central bank , the command economy vampire that sits at the center of America 's supposedly free market economy . <p> Follow ( The Debasement Of ) The Money <p> Before 1965 , quarters and dimes were 90% silver . Quarters from before 1965 are currently worth a little over $5 and dimes are worth a little over $2 based on the silver content . <p> But the government had to stop making money with any actual precious metals because the central bank had been debasing the money supply for decades to fund the expansion of the welfare/warfare state . Roosevelt first debased the $20 bill which used to be a certifacte for one ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the debasement of the paper dollar , silver coins had to be debased as well . A few years later in 1971 Nixon would legally and figuratively " remove " every scrap of gold from paper dollars . But first in 1964 all the silver was quite literally removed from all new coinage . <p> Minimum Silver Wages <p> The minimum wage was $1.00 from 1956 to 1960 . It was $1.25 from 1963 to 1966 . Keep an eye not on the dollar figures , but on the metal content <p> The minimum wage in the two years before 1966 was five 90% silver quarters . That 90% silver $1.25 is roughly $25 in today 's money . Let me be clear : if the minimum wage had stayed at a mere $1.25 an hour and the central bank had not debased the money supply forcing the reduction or removal of the silver content , minimum wage workers would have been roughly two or three times better off today in terms of real purchasing power than they currently are with a nominal minimum wage nearly six times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , the minimum wage is nearly six times as highbut buys roughly half as muchor less . <p> Put another way , a pre-debasement quarter can still buy you a gallon of gaswith change left over . A gallon of gas cost about 15 minutes of minimum wage labor in the early 1960s . Gas has actually gotten cheaper relative to gold and silver money since then . A minimum wage worker in 1963 could work for ten minutes , then send the wages of those ten minutes ( two 90% silver dimes worth about four of today 's dollars ) forward in time and buy a gallon of gas . It takes today 's minimum wage worker about three times as long to earn that same gallon . <p> Every nominal increase in the minimum wage after the silver was removed from the coinage has been a lie . <p> Real purchasing power of the minimum wage peaked in 1969 . It should come as no great shock that was almost dead center between when silver was taken out of the coinage in 1964 and when gold " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitalism did n't leave the bottom earners out in the cold . The central bank has been stealing from the poor and giving to the government and the well-connected . <p> So , to all you minimum wage-earners : a tiny percentage of the population is indeed stealing from you . But it 's not the " capitalists " . It 's the fasco-communist central bank on behalf of the US government . You 're getting more by government decree , but you can buy a whole lot less . Do n't worry , however . Every other wager earner at all levels is harmed , too ( which is why it 's more important than ever for all of you reading this to get the best advice possible not just on how to keep inflation from picking your pockets , but also how to multiply your purchasing power in spite of it . ) <p> Gary Gibson , The Dollar Vigilantes Editor , cut his teeth writing for liberty and profit as the managing editor of the now-defunct Whiskey &amp; Gunpowder financial newsletter .

Lest anyone think that we are arguing for an increase in the minimum wage , let me be clear : we wish to see this panacea of the economically illiterate die once and for all . <p> I know it seems like a minimum wage is just creating a price floor for wages that prevents people from getting paid what illiterate , bleeding hearts would consider unfairly low wages . But some labor simply is n't worth even that price floor ! Just because the government says a job is worth $7 an hour does n't mean the job is worth that much . Governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they may as well decree that a man can fly by flapping his arms . The minimum wage simply means a lot of jobs of extremely low skill and economic worth simply get destroyed . No one bothers to hire the masses of young , extremely inexperienced or low skilled people whose labor simply is n't worth the minimum wage . <p> A wage is just a price for labor . And price controls including minimum prices for labor always create scarcity . Sure , some people end up getting paid more than what their job is really worth . But there is an equal or greater number of people who will not get hired as a result . It 's easy to see the million people who are happy to be getting paid too much for low level workbut not quite so easy to see the three million people who did n't get hired because artificially raising the price of their labor to some arbitrary minimum caused the available work to become tragically scarce . <p> Think of it this way : why not just actually raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop there ? Why not make it $220 ? <p> When you up the numbers , even the most economically illiterate fascist socialist understands that artificial wage controls would wreak havoc throughout the economy . Yet these people think that the economy can withstand just a little bit of fraud and tinkeringjust a teensy bit of gun-backed distortion to help out the lowest skilled . <p> Fact is , it helps a few low skill workers while harming many more . But to be honest , the relatively free enough market is still robust enough to keep going along despite centralized , coercive controls like these . But shit does n't stop being shit just because there 's less of it . In the case of the minimum wage , all of society is that much poorer because of this government-induced scarcity of income for productive activitybut the most harm is done to the weakest economic players who never realize their professed defenders in Congress have helped them out of a job .

Therefore , it is testing nuclear weapons in California . As RT reports : <p> An intercontinental ballistic missile was fired early Monday from a facility in California , the US Air Force announced , saying the tests were a message to the world about Washington 's nuclear capabilities . <p> The Minuteman III missile was fitted with a " test re-entry vehicle " instead of a live thermonuclear warhead , and was test-launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base ( AFB ) in California at 03:36 local time ( 10:36 GMT ) , according to the Air Force statement . <p> Why could this be ?

Well , Washington is not happy about these developments . It tried to force other countries to boycott it , but failed , causing an embarrassment for the US .

But what we see with the development bank is the US can no longer force its allies to go along with its agenda , especially against other powerful nations , such as China . <p> Germany has even been close to Russia in recent years , which surely has bothered Washington .

Generational fortunes . And there has never been a confluence of massive changes happening all at once on a global scale like there is today . <p> In the 1990s and 2000s the internet was the evolution in communications that has already created trillions of dollars in wealth and numerous billionaires . In 2000 those who realized The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTSMAWKI ) was coming and invested in gold and silver had done very well by 2009 ( and will continue to do extremely well in the remainder of this decade ) . And , bitcoin , an evolution in money and banking , which we covered here at TDV since 2011 at $7 ( currently $450 ) has seen substantial fortunes been made by those who recognized it early ( and will also do very well into the future ) . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages on any or all of the above . The next big fortune maker is here and it is still early . It is cannabis a.k.a marijuana . <p> It 's rare that the opportunity to get in on the proverbial ground floor of a new and important industry presents itself so obviously and promisingly as I will explain below . <p> THE RISE OF LEGALIZED MARIJUANA <p> At TDV we have been covering the budding ( pun intended ) marijuana market for more than a year . We even named our monthly newsletter targeted at those who wish to stay in the US ( and not expatriate or defect ) , " TDV Homegrown " , with a marijuana leaf as its logo as we could see the trend towards legalization evolving . <p> And , the TDV Golden Trader began talking about the medical marijuana space in January of this year . <p> So , we have been relatively early in covering this space which only really began in January of this year when the first legal cannabis stores opened in Colorado . Interestingly , the legalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past Anarchast guest , Joby Weeks , began soliciting for signatures to put decriminalization on the ballot ( see interview with Joby here ) . <p> That one action , by one person initially , ended up with countless states and countries around the world now legalizing or moving towards legalization of marijuana . <p> The buzz about legal cannabis is growing louder , but there is still enough confusion and unknowns to keep the big money and your average investor away from it creating an opportunity for those who see where this trend of legalization is going and be positioned before them . <p> The main source of confusion is , as usual , government . " Legalization " means what governments say it means , and governments by and large are n't yet sure what they want to say much like in the bitcoin space . They are still groping for a solution that ( 1 ) satisfies the public 's desire to be free to consume what they choose to consume and ( 2 ) let 's government regulate and tax the product . <p> For investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point it 's not even half plotted . Different countries even different regions of the US and of some other countries have very different approaches to legalizing marijuana for medicinal or recreational use . <p> But to those paying attention to this space it is clear . Governments worldwide have decided that legalization is acceptable , perhaps even preferable . US states such as Colorado and Washington are reaping enormous tax revenue from a recreational business model that is outpacing the growth rates expected by even the more optimistic forecasters . <p> Several states are debating proposals to emulate Colorado and Washington . Some are debating measures that are even more relaxed . Yet the investment landscape for US markets is still difficult to assess because of the Federal government 's continued classification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I ( most dangerous ) substance . <p> As more states move towards legalization it puts more pressure on the federal government to also do so . Even Obama has stated that " pot is less dangerous than alcohol . " And the US Justice Department has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pot businesses ( Bloomberg Feb 14 : " Pot Businesses Allowed to Open Accounts With U.S. Banks . ) " . <p> Despite all the uncertainty about the details , one point is clear : legalized marijuana is here to stay and the trend is strongly toward greater permissibility . That trend is n't confined to just the US . <p> Here are just a few recent headlines from around the world : <p> CARIBBEAN TRADE BLOC : Washington Post March 8 , 2014 Caricom Leaders to Debate Marijuana Legalization . Experts said the Caribbean already has a built-in competitive advantage with marijuana cultivation , noting that Jamaican researchers have launched a company that produces therapeutic and cosmetic products derived from the plants . " The region may wish therefore to explore any commercial benefit from a potential multi-billion industry including research and development and also the production of medical marijuana products , " the report stated . <p> MEXICO : Reuters February 18 , 2014 Leftist Mexican Lawmakers Present Medical Marijuana Bill .

A federal judge deemed Brazil 's ban on marijuana unconstitutional in a drug trafficking case , which some say could pave the way to reform . In a case involving a small-time marijuana dealer , Judge Ernesto Frederico Cardoso Maciel ruled that marijuana laws are unconstitutional because they violate principles of equality , reports Brazilian media . The judge , in his sentencing , claimed that the ban on marijuana was " the result of a backward culture and mistaken policy . " <p> CANADA : National Post January 23 , 2014 Justin Trudeau Says Canada Should ' Draw on Best Practices ' From Marijuana Legalization in Colorado , Washington .

" <p> URUGUAY : Bloomberg December 11 , 2013 Uruguay Becomes World 's First Nation to Legalize Marijuana . Uruguay , a nation of 3.3 million tucked between Argentina and Brazil , became the world 's first nation to legalize the cultivation , sale and use of marijuana in a move aimed at curbing the cost of combating drug trafficking . <p> ARGENTINA : Raw Story December 24 , 2013 Uruguay 's Neighbor Argentina Now Considering Marijuana Legalization .

" Argentina deserves a good debate about this , " Molina told local radio . " We have the capacity to do it . We should not underestimate ourselves . " <p> SWITZERLAND : The Libertarian October 4 , 2013 Another Sensible Drug Policy From Switzerland . Marijuana is now decriminalized in all of Switzerland . The new measure was passed last year and went into effect on the first of this month . Although cultivation and distribution remain illegal , anyone caught with 10 grams or less of the substance will now be free of any threat of criminal penalties , and will only be required to pay a fine of 100 Swiss francs ( about 68 or $111 ) . The decriminalization measure should result in significant savings for the criminal justice system , which will now be able to avoid processing an estimated 30,000 minor marijuana cases per year . This will also allow an estimated 500,000 current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble for a victimless crime . <p> There are nearly countless similar events happening in countries around the world on an escalating basis . <p> In a recent Pew Research Center poll , nationwide marijuana legalization seems inevitable to three-fourths of Americans , whether they support it or not . The telephone survey found that 75 percent of respondents including majorities of both supporters and opponents of legal marijuana think that the sale and use of pot eventually will be legal nationwide . It was the first time that question had been asked . Some 39 percent of respondents said pot should be legal for personal adult use . Forty-four percent of those surveyed said it should be legal only for medicinal use . Just 16 percent said it should not be legal at all . <p> Marijuana today is similar to the end of the prohibition of alcohol ( also replete with countless gangland murders and atrocities while it was prohibited ) . And not since the lifting of America 's prohibition on alcohol has there been such potential for a multi-billion dollar a year industry to develop literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bronfman families , among others , from the demise of U.S. Prohibition in 1933 . And that was a single-country event . Even greater fortunes will be built on the relaxing of the worldwide prohibition of cannabis . <p> This is the market that is opening up and available right now and most people havent realized it yet . Therein lies the opportunity to invest in a potentially massive market before the rest of the world even realizes it exists . <p> THE POTENTIAL MARIJUANA MARKET <p> An analysis from San Francisco-based angel investor network ArcView Group forecasts a 64 percent surge in the legal US cannabis market to $2.34 billion by 2014 . Additionally , according to ArcView , the five-year national market could grow to $10.2 billion . The numbers depend to some degree on how many states legalize pot , and how big the states are . <p> The Associated Press has conducted a poll showing that " Nationwide marijuana legalization is inevitable " in the US . <p> While the total size of the marijuana market will likely not surpass the alcohol market anytime soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol market to make comparisons . <p> The US beverage alcohol industry is a major contributor to the economy , responsible for over $400 billion in total US economic activity in 2010 , generating nearly $90 billion in wages and over 3.9 million jobs for US workers . <p> If/when marijuana becomes completely legalized in the US it is n't too much of a stretch to think that it could be 10-20% the size of the alcohol market meaning total revenues of $40-80 billion per year . <p> The trend in marijuana usage has been on a major uptrend since the " War on Drugs " began : <p> There is no need to go too much deeper into the potential size of this market . Based on this alone , especially imagined globally if legalized , the size of the potential market is absolutely massive . There are n't  too many markets you can invest in today that already have a worldwide brand and consumer basis , like marijuana , that is about to be opened up . In fact , nothing even comes close . <p> THE END OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was a heinous , ill conceived concept brought to the world by Richard Nixon in the same year in which he " temporarily " ended official conversion of the dollar for gold . To add insult to injury , of all people , one of the most public supporters of the War on Drugs was Elvis Presley who later died of a drug overdose after years of drug abuse . <p> This " war " on plants results in hundreds of thousands of deaths , millions incarcerated for victimless crimes , billions in wasted expenditures and , as shown above , did absolutely nothing to stop the usage of these plants . <p> Now , debt ridden governments worldwide are looking to these same " drugs " as a potential source of major revenue as they look to stay afloat . <p> The Huffington Post recently reported that cannabis is not the only drug that may soon be legalized or decriminalized . There is a growing movement among scientific and political leaders to end the war on drugs entirely . <p> A recent report , titled " Ending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Economics ' IDEAS center , looked at the high costs and unintended consequences of drug prohibitions on public health and safety , national security and law enforcement . The pursuit of a militarized and enforcement-led global ' war on drugs ' strategy has produced enormous negative outcomes and collateral damage , " says the 82-page report . " These include mass incarceration in the US , highly repressive policies in Asia , vast corruption and political destabilization in Afghanistan and West Africa , immense violence in Latin America , an HIV epidemic in Russia , an acute global shortage of pain medication and the propagation of systematic human rights abuses around the world . " <p> The report urges the world 's governments to reframe their drug policies around treatment and harm reduction rather than prosecution and prison . It is also aimed at the United Nations General Assembly , which is preparing to convene a special session on drug policy in 2016 . " The UN must recognize its role is to assist states as they pursue best-practice policies based on scientific evidence , not undermine or counteract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics at LSE and a contributor to the report . <p> Of course , especially in regard to marijuana , these so called polices around " treatment and harm reduction " are completely unnecessary as marijuana is one of the most healthy substances on Earth . <p> MARIJUANAS HISTORY IN THE US AND THE PROPAGANDA <p> You may have heard that Thomas Jefferson traded marijuana with George Washington and the other founding fathers . In fact , Both Washington and Jefferson tried growing hemp on their Virginia farms with varying degrees of success . Washington used some of what he grew to make hemp clothing . <p> Despite not being so good , both kept at it . Jefferson even invented a better " hemp brake " to separate the fibers from the stalks , He thought this was so important agriculturally he did not patent it . Whether or not they smoked it is unknown . But there was no social stigma attached to smoking pot in the late 1700s and early 1800s . In his diary for August 7 , 1765 , Washington writes , " Began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Domestic production of hemp was encouraged at the start of the country . In the 17th century , American production of hemp was encouraged by the government , primarily for the production of rope , sails and clothing . It has historically been an important tool for humanity . The outlawing of hemp hurts any economy . <p> In 1619 the Virginia Assembly passed legislation requiring every farmer to grow hemp , and hemp was allowed to be exchanged as legal tender in Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Maryland . <p> Domestic production flourished until post-Civil War , when imports and other domestic materials replaced hemp for many purposes . In the late nineteenth century , marijuana became a popular ingredient in many medicinal products and was sold openly in public pharmacies . You can still see photos today of products that used hemp . <p> As hashish became a fad in France in the nineteenth century , it did also to a smaller degree in the US . Until the 1930s , hash was smoked in private establishments regularly in places like New York . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act required the labeling of any cannabis contained in over-the-counter remedies . During this time , between the 1900-1920s , Mexican immigrants introduced recreational use of marijuana to American culture . <p> In the wake of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 , Mexican immigrants came to the US in droves , and the drug came to be associated with immigrants . Anti-drug campaigners began to warn against the " Marijuana Menace , " and terrible crimes were attributed to marijuana and the Mexicans who used it such as the raping of white women . <p> In the 1930s , although marijuana was used regularly by many people , a fear of it and immigrants set in . During the Great Depression , unemployment plagued the US and the rest of the west . The public in the US began to resent Mexican immigrants , and the government began to take note , turning its sights on marijuana . <p> " Research " linked the use of marijuana to violence , crime and other socially deviant behaviors . Blacks and Mexicans were generally associated with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Federal Bureau of Narcotics ( FBN ) , created in 1930 , saw Harry J Anslinger focus his effort as the first Commissioner on marijuana . The 1932 Uniform State Narcotic Act strongly encouraged states to accept responsibility for control of cannabis by adopting the Uniform State Narcotics Act . <p> 1936 's " Reefer Madness " is a famous propaganda film produced by French director , Louis Gasnier . At the time , The Motion Pictures Association of America , composed of the major Hollywood studios , had banned the showing of narcotics in films . <p> The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 came amidst a " lurid " propaganda campaign against the so-called " evil-weed . " Marijuana was from-then-on criminalized , and the possession was restricted to those who paid an excise tax for certain authorized medical and industrial uses . <p> However , in 1944 the La Guardia Report found marijuana to be less dangerous than the original hype made it out to be . In this report , issued by the New York Academy of Medicine , research from earlier was contradicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity or sex crimes , or lead to addiction or other drug use . <p> World War II created demand for hemp products , and the US was forced to import them . Without hemp , marine cordage , parachutes , and other military necessities became hard to come by . The US Department of Agriculture launched its " hemp for victory " program , encouraging farmers to plant hemp by giving out seeds to farmers to plant and even granting draft deferments to those who stayed home and grew hemp . By 1943 American farmers registered in the program harvested 375,000 acres of hemp . <p> From 1951-1956 stricter sentencing laws gripped the nation . The enactment of new federal laws such as the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956 set mandatory sentences for drug related offenses including marijuana . A minimum sentence for a first offense for marijuana carried a minimum sentence of 2-10 years with a fine of up to $20,000 . <p> The 1960s saw some things begin to change ; that is until the 1980s . A changing political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards marijuana . Use of the drug became widespread in the middle class and reports commissioned by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson found marijuana to be safe . <p> The 1970s saw the repeal of some mandatory sentences . Marijuana was soon thereafter differentiated from other drugs . 1973 saw the creation of the US Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) . In 1974 the well-known High Times was founded and in 1976 a so-called parent 's movement against marijuana began <p> This movement called for stricter regulations of marijuana so that teenagers did not use it . These groups were supported by the DEA and other NGOs and became instrumental in the 1980s War On Drugs . Mandatory sentences were re-introduced in 1984 , and the new law raised federal penalties on the amount for marijuana . <p> A later amendment to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act established a " three strikes and you 're out " policy , requiring life sentences for repeat drug offenders , and providing for the death penalty for " drug kingpins . " <p> In 1989 George Bush declared a new War on Drugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting the transition to today . <p> The fact of the matter is that marijuana , compared to other products such as pharmaceuticals and alcohol is not only not as dangerous but far less dangerous . <p> In fact , the number of medicinal uses for marijuana that have now been studied and proven is overwhelming . It seems rarely a day goes by where the use of marijuana or cannabis oil is n't shown to cure one ailment or another including cancer . <p> The amount of evidence and distribution of that evidence via the internet has made it impossible for governments to violently prohibit its use any longer . <p> THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY <p> And now , after the backstory on why I think this sector has massive potential I will reveal the investment opportunity that I consider possibly the best I have seen in over 20 years of being in the financial markets . <p> At TDV , TDV Homegrown and TDV Golden Trader we will be covering the emerging market for marijuana on an ongoing basis in the immediate future but I have identified what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and have gained access for subscribers to take part in a private placement round of financing . <p> Editors Note : The opportunity and full research report is available to TDV Subscribers only TDV Basic is $15/month and you can subscribe here to gain access <p> CONCLUSION <p> In conclusion I would like to comment on how quickly things are changing in todays environment . <p> I thought about this as I sat in a room with dozens of high net worth , mostly older , investors in the Cayman Islands .

Bitcoin and Blockchain are the Future of Money and Banking <p> Still to this day most other financial analysts either ignore bitcoin or , even stupider , deride it as being some sort of scam or ponzi scheme . <p> The dollar and government " services " like Social Security are scams and ponzi schemes but bitcoin clearly is not . - It is open source and so anyone who cares to look can see there is nothing nefarious about it . - Therefore , anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing willful ignorance as they could very easily look at it themselves and see it is not . <p> More than $1 billion was invested into bitcoin or blockchain related companies in 2015 from some of the biggest financial institutions in the world . - They realize that bitcoin and the blockchain have- changed the world of money and banking . They are just trying to keep up now . <p> Bitcoin is the biggest thing to be developed since the internet itself . - And , in fact , blockchain related technologies , like The DAO , which just raised $132 million and became the biggest crowdfund in history , are- creating the next generation of the internet itself a more decentralized one . <p> We have been one of the biggest sites following- the War on Cash , bank bail-ins and the move towards a one world taxation system . <p> We said that governments will continue to crack down on capital and its flow across borders . - In the US , the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) continues to cause massive problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US dollar system . <p> Bank bail-in clauses have now been written into law in every major Western country in advance of the next great crisis . - And schemes like the Panama Papers are making it harder to operate in offshore jurisdictions . <p> We said that this will lead a lot of people to bitcoin which can not be sequestered , controlled or regulated . <p> Speculation on the latest breakout on bitcoin has to do with- demand from- China , which continues to be subject to- heavy capital controls . <p> Probably the biggest reason we will see bitcoin go exponential in the coming months and years is due to the coming debt jubilee . - All Western governments are bankrupt and all Western banks are bankrupt . <p> As this comes to a head and we have a crisis that makes 2008 look like a wonderful time we will see currencies collapse , banks collapse and potentially the entire financial and monetary systems collapse . - Its actually all been planned as we have shown in our Shemitah and Jubilee video series ( see here ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how high bitcoin will rise as people panic and try to salvage some of their wealth but for most it will be too late . <p> THE BITCOIN HALVING <p> There is another reason why bitcoin could go up dramatically in the coming months that we have mentioned a few times in the past . <p> On July 18th of this year bitcoin undergoes a major event that only happens every four years called a " halving " . <p> Bitcoins are developed through the process of mining . Only- 21 million bitcoins can be in existence at any one time . - The value of mining is regulated in order to maintain this number . To prevent miners from surpassing this limit , the currency is designed to cut the value of mining in half every four years . - It- is as if the- Federal Reserve slashed- the amount of money-printing it does by half . <p> This could have a major impact on the overall value of the currency . If demand for bitcoin continues to grow while the number of coins that can be mined is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the law of supply and demand . <p> No one knows how this will affect bitcoin because the last time it happened was in 2012 , when bitcoin was near $12 and the currency was in its infancy . - So , we cant use the past to make predictions on the future . <p> No one else has been covering the cryptocurrency space like we have at The Dollar Vigilante . <p> We even featured ethereum , a new cryptocurrency , to subscribers in January . - It has since risen more than 400% . <p> TDVs Senior Analyst , Ed Bugos , is just putting out an alert to subscribers now on whether it is time to get back into gold stocks after the recent pullback and gives his technical analysis and insights on whether bitcoin is a sell here , or not . <p> And next week I 'll be telling subscribers about a new blockchain related company that is poised to take over Ubers market share and giving them exclusive access to invest in the company at the seed level . <p> Ca n't stand this super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bunk up . On its face sounds ridiculous . That being said BTC can go up and most likely will as it is more accepted as payment throughout the world . Hard to say in a real collapse scenario if it will be worth a lot or nothing . I do n't  see a collapse happening and the US debt simply does not matter . Just devalue the currency and problem solved works great for the Chinese .. Seriously if your bent on believing in " Shemitah " please just call it something else . <p> JR <p> Personally I think its fascinating to watch the Bible prophesy relating to our time period begin to play out . I say call it as it is regardless of the implications .

Because the financial crisis is not over , according to an EU document . <p> In other words , what 's happened already in Cyprus the stealing of savers ' money will go continental , and eventually worldwide . Only more aggressively than in the Cyprus example . The logic is likely simple : there was hardly popular resistance to the confiscation of funds in Cyprus , so why not expand the program ? <p> As we 've stated here at Dollar Vigilante over-and-over again , governments worldwide will persist with wholesale theft from savers . How do we know ? Because governments keep telling their people this . We are n't magic-8 ball readers . We simply read the news and make the proper connections . The IMF has blatantly stated financial repression is on the table , which we reported upon , and our readers have told us of increasing capital controls worldwide . <p> This is why gold , silver , bitcoin and cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people in the west . One thing is for sure , there will be a lot of people with sore backs due to lopsided mattresses . ( Spare yourself that sore back : to learn more about asset internationalization , click here ) <p> When the time comes , the " usage " ( such a pleasant way to put " theft " ) of depositors ' funds in EU banks will not be voluntary , but up to the European Union 's discretion instead . The EU would then make long-term investments with the stolen funds " to boost the economy and help plug the gap left by banks since the financial crisis " as if this would inspire confidence in a financial system about as loved as the human-trafficking trade . Of course , all of these funds would go towards lining the pockets of plutocrats and keeping a bankrupt financial system above-water for a few extra months . The banks need everything they can get . <p> The EU is trying to manage it 's piecemeal 28-country bloc madeup of diverse cultures and peoples with different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding small companies , infrastructure and other investments other than bank financing " because " the economic and financial crisis has impaired the ability of the financial sector to channel funds to the real economy , in particular long-term investment , " said the document , seen by Reuters . <p> The Commission is looking to ask the bloc 's insurance watchdog in the second half of 2014 for advice on how to draft a law " to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing , " the document said . Mobilize seems such a palatable word for such flagrant tyranny . <p> The EU executive is also looking into introducing an EU savings account , open to individuals whose funds could be pooled and invested in small companies . Inspired by the US MyRA program ( which we term " TheirRA " ) , Europe will look into such collectivized savings instruments , likely as a way to streamline the " mobilization " of depositors funds . Interesting the US got to this instrument first <p> The EU document states the Commission will " take into account possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products " and will also " review " how EU rules treat covered bonds by the end of this year , thus making it official the EU is not opposed to re-allowing many of the products which led to the 2008 financial crisis . <p> Why now ? Was n't the Cyprus deposit confiscation blatant enough ? This is tough to know . It could simply be that it is known by government and banking that such a thing will happen again-and-again , and that perhaps it would be best to predictively program the people to expect it . One thing is for sure : Europe is fixed . The savings of European Union 's 500 million citizens will be used to bail-in banks and line the pockets of bureaucrats . So let 's put it still a bit simpler : the west is being robbed at gunpoint . Are you in the west ? Do you know how to protect yourself against such transgressions ?

@@99475197 @3675197/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> American Borders Will Be Changing 28883 @qwx888883 <p> An iron curtain is slowly descending around the borders of America . When it falls , some people will be shut in ; others will be shut out . It will be up to bureaucrats and agents with guns to decide which one of those people you are . <p> Changes in border policy are in the wind . On June 27th , 2013 , the 1,300-page Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate and proceeded to the House of Representatives . Debate on the Act has focused on the path of citizenship being extended to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in America . This is controversial because Republicans fear that the new Americans , and especially Hispanics , will vote Democrat in upcoming elections . Happily , the bill has stalled in the House . <p> But one of the worst features of the Act has bipartisan support : namely , the ramping up of border security . ( The security provisions were a cynical bribe to House Republicans by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration policies through . ) The Act allocates an astounding $46.3 billion for increased border control . It proposes to hire 20,000 additional border patrol agents , swelling their numbers from about 21,000 ( in fiscal 2012 ) to about 40,000 . The stated focus of the mega bucks and muscle is the US-Mexican border but the entire system would be even more militarized . <p> Shutting People In <p> The proposed doubling of might comes in the wake of the Transportation Security Administration 's ( TSA 's ) announcement of a dramatic expansion in the screening of airline passengers . Even before a flyer arrives , he will be profiled by the TSA based on his travel record , and personal documents such as employment information , property records , police files , tax data , and car registration . <p> The number of travelers refused flights or passports for that matter is likely to increase . In fact , anyone can currently be refused the right to fly without explanation . And a long list of reasons to be denied a passport already exist . They include : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUI ; owing $2,500+ in child support ; being in default on specific loans from the United States ; or being deemed likely to cause " serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States . " ( The latter reason is elastic , especially since , again , no explanation for denial needs to be given . ) <p> In past years , there have been several attempts to link the granting of passports to tax compliance . The latest one is H. R. 3146 , which is now before the House . Sec. 4. is entitled " Revocation or denial of passport and passport card in case of certain unpaid taxes . " It reads , in part , " If the Secretary receives certification by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that any individual has a seriously delinquent tax debt in an amount in excess of $50,000 , the Secretary shall transmit such certification to the Secretary of State for action with respect to denial , revocation , or limitation of a passport or passport card . " It is only a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a person 's tax status . <p> Shutting People Out <p> And then there are those who could be shut out . The Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act or the Ex-PATRIOT Act came back from the dead in the above mentioned border and immigration bill . Again , the measure sought to ban certain expat Americans from legally returning to the US without receiving a waiver , this time from Homeland Security . <p> Having failed as a standalone bill , the new Ex-PATRIOT Act was introduced as amendment S.A. 1609 ; it piggybacked on another amendment to the omnibus border and immigration act . Smuggling measures into unrelated legislation is an increasingly popular ploy . For example , the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) , which devastated the ability of Americans to open bank accounts abroad , repeatedly failed as a standalone . It passed only by being tucked into to the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act or HIRE . Editor 's Note : Even more reason for you to click here to see how TDV can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1609 specify ? It would have shut the border to certain expatriates who renounced their citizenship . That act was considered to be tax evasion on its face . Any ex-citizen with a net worth of $2 million or an average income of $148,000 or more over the last five years would have been presumed to be banned from the border . To establish a right to return , the expat would have presumably needed to open up his finances to scrutiny . <p> S.A. 1609 did not make it into the final Act in the Senate , however . Democrats did n't want to risk the prospect of the bill being " blue slipped , " as the Republicans had threatened to do . Blue-slipping occurs when the House rejects a bill outright because it is unconstitutional . The bill is then placed into a blue envelope and simply returned to the Senate . The amendment was deemed unconstitutional because it reformed a tax law . In the opinion of many , this violates the Origination Clause by which all spending and appropriations must originate within the House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicality . <p> What to Expect at the US Border ? <p> More questioning . More in-depth screening . More difficulty in traveling to and from the United States . The situation will grow steadily worse through 2014 , when a compromise bill on immigration and border control is probable . <p> With expanded authority and manpower , border control agents are also likely to start enforcing the fine print of the law . For example , it has been illegal for many years for an American to cross the border on anything but a US Passport ; it does not matter if the person has dual citizenship and two passports . The American one must be used . 8 U.S.C. sec. 1185(b) states , " Except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe , it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter , or attempt to depart from or enter , the United States unless he bears a valid United States passport . " The law has largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission , especially to expatriates . <p> Whether you want to leave or to enter America , gridlock and technicalities will not preserve those options forever . Senator Jack Reed , a co-sponsor of Ex-PATRIOT , has asserted , " American citizenship is a privilege . " It is a privilege that he and his ilk want to grant at their discretion . It is one of the surest indications of a police state : the inability to cross a border . <p> Editor 's Endnote : The time is fast approaching when you will look back and be very glad you clicked here to find out how TDV can provide you with a supplement and possible alternative to US citizenship . <p> Comments or questions ?

" <p> Bloomberg recently reported that the US dollar reached a two-year low , it 's weakest level since November 2011 . Furthermore , the US dollar has lost 38.5% of its value since 2002 . Rogers predicted the US will soon abandon the dollar for another currency ! <p> " For the first time in recorded history we have all major banks and central governments around the world printing huge amounts of money , " Rogers said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is floating on an artificial ocean of lots and lots of printed money , " said Rogers . <p> " The debt is going higher and higher .

The longer you delay the day of reckoning , the worse the day of reckoning is going to be . This is not going to be fun . " <p> THE SOLUTION <p> " Abolish the Federal Reserve , " Rogers stated . " The world has gotten along quite famously and well without central banks for most of world history . " <p> " America has had three central banks in our history , the first two disappeared , " he said .

As you see , the US government is in so much debt , it is selling off parcels of land to creditors . But before it does that , it will have to go to war with the American people Many government officials have confirmed the standoff there is not over and Ron Paul has warned against a WACO style siege . <p> Then , just yesterday , we reported how Social Security and Treasury are stealing tax refunds to satisfy decade old debtsoftentimes parents ' debts .

Bankers are committing suicide or being murdered , and the finance minister of Canada just died . We are turning a corner and all of the debts and money printing is going to have a massive effect possibly as soon as this year , as Jim Rogers notes .

Although most developers aim to create a mobile application which is a close analogue to their site , Coinbase decided to go a different route and make something that 's about 75% , rather than the easily achievable 97.5% that most use as a standard .

I found that the QR scan had missed the first 8 digits of the address , and the last 4 . This was odd because I had successfully sent funds from wallet to wallet using this exact methodology . Aside from the obvious , the main problem I had with this is that Coinbase is quick to confirm transactions , even if they did n't go through , in which case there will be no error message . <p> Last complaints are that purchase order receipts do not include the price you purchased your coins at , so be sure to use an app to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user does not appear to have access to their private keys I 'm not kidding at all . <p> So , that 's my take on Coinbase .

A day , for many around the world , to celebrate the life of Steve Jobs . <p> Personally , it gives me pause for thought about how much he changed my life . At 10 years old , in 1981 , I remember begging my parents for a computer . They did n't  know anything about computers . Heck , I do n't  even remember how I knew about it or why I felt this overwhelming desire to have one . But , I did . <p> My grandfather was an electronics and communications tinkerer and a Ham Radio ( aka . Amateur Radio ) aficionado . He had a 200 foot tall antennae in his backyard that was so large you could see it from miles away . Its tentacles hung well over the property line on every side of his yard that was back in the old days before zoning laws and frivolous lawsuits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for his morning " sked " ( schedule ) and talk with people from around the world or even listen in to astronauts . Sure , theyd mostly just ask how the weather was " over there " and other completely meaningless conversations . But , that was n't the point . The point was that he could talk to anyone on Earth from his basement ! <p> He , more than anyone , understood my desire to have a computer . After all , ham radio was a precursor to the internet . So , when he heard about my request he found a company that manufactured computers in Vietnam and ordered it . A few weeks later it arrived and we had to build it ourselves . It was an Apple II+ clone called a Unitron . <p> September 1983 in the Hamshack Click to EnlargeI spent most of my adolescence on that Unitron in my grandfathers basement in the room called the HamShack . <p> As I sit here today , 30 years later , in front of the computer , headphones on , listening to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sense of gratitude to Steve Jobs . <p> EAT THE RICH <p> Sadly , maybe it is for the best that Steve left this realm now . After all , the uneducated masses are beginning to light the torches and get out the pitchforks and go after the " greedy " rich . <p> I hate to mention Elizabeth Warren on the same page as Steve Jobs but I do so to make a point . <p> Here is what she said recently : <p> Before we talk about why Elizabeth is the devil and Steve Jobs was like a god , let 's run her statement through a truth-analyzer : <p> To add to the insanity , Roseanne Barr , has called for anyone with over $100 million to be beheaded if they do not give it away . There is one thing that you can be absolutely sure of , then . Roseanne Barr is not worth more than $100 million . <p> **40;397;TOOLONG , after having failed countless times and having impoverished and literally murdered hundreds of millions of people can only , at this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast Elizabeth Warren to Steve Jobs . <p> Elizabeth Warren is a thief . Not much more needs to be said about her after that . <p> Steve Jobs transformed an industry which created untold wealth that he placed no claim on . <p> Let 's start with the 11,000 highly paid technologists at their Cupertino campus . After that we move on to the entire supply chain that manufactured and provided binary products to make up Apple products . Then let 's move on to all the creatives who have used his products , including musicians who , upon understanding the business model , were greatly enriched by iTunes . Let 's look at the App Store which allowed thousands of developers at home to become technology software entrepreneurs ( would there be an Angry Birds without Steve Jobs ? ) . Never mind that he single handedly did what the Department of Injustice couldnt do , break the Microsoft stranglehold on the desktop market . Linux has done amazing things , but it is far from going mainstream on the desktop . Because of Apple , Microsoft was forced to up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens of death have reduced dramatically in recent years since Apple has taken a larger share of the market . <p> For all of this , he has no " social debts " to pay back ; his payment forward in value to humanity was far greater than what he got to keep . <p> THERE ARE MILLIONS OF STEVE JOBS <p> Steve Jobs directly affected and enriched the lives of billions . But , he is n't the only one . There are countless other Steve Jobs in the world today . Sure , you may not know their name or their products specifically but they are also to be recognized and honored . <p> Right now there is someone in China who is devoting years of his life to making an electronic component for 5% cheaper than can currently be made something that could save the world massive amounts . Someone in India is working night and day to put together a new battery system that could hail the next wave of cheap , clean transportation . Right now , in Peru , a man is slaving through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit that if found could supply the world with copper for years . <p> All of these people , thanks to capitalism , work for us . They do n't  need to " give back " . They do n't  owe us anything . We owe them . <p> Anyone who is producing more than they are consuming should be considered a friend to mankind . Anyone who wants to take the fruits of their labor , by force , and give it to those who produce nothing and only consume is the enemy . <p> JOBS CREATED JOBS <p> Today , the braying masses who have been dumbed down in the indoctrination camps ( schools ) all clamor for people like Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren to " create jobs " . <p> The way to " create " jobs has been shown by countless people like Steve Jobs , yet they say we should go after the rich and take away from their production and give their wealth to government to be destroyed . Its no wonder " lost job " sympathy cards are now such top sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the wealth we have in society . We should be exalting anyone who creates wealth . Whether they find a copper mine , open a successful restaurant or just serve hot dogs at baseball games and keep their expenses so low that they can save a portion of their salary each month , these should be our heroes . <p> In the world of socialism these people are supposed to be our enemies . Socialism/Statism contorts everything . It makes bad , good and good , bad . <p> If Elizabeth Warren was around twenty years ago and stole most of Steve Jobs money after his first success with Apple , he would have never had enough capital to build his NeXT venture which led full circle back to his return at Apple and to things like the iPhone , iTunes and iPad . In fact , every industry would see much of the capital it needs to produce great products and necessities lost meaning countless untold developments and innovations would never make it to market . <p> We 'd live in a much , much darker world if people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> On Steve Jobs tombstone it should state , " Here lies a man who enriched the lives of billions and gave more than almost any other " . If Elizabeth Warren were to write Steve Jobs tombstone , it would read , ? " So he built a company . Good for him . " <p> R.I.P . MR . JOBS <p> Steve Jobs was quoted as saying , " I want to put a ding in the universe . " <p> Sir , you put a serious ding in the universe and in my own personal life . I thank you . And I will use the keyboard which you introduced to me to keep promoting your values of hard work , vision and innovation and fight against those who detract from that for their own selfish or deluded means . <p> -Thank you to my good friend , Pete Kofod , for his inspiration for this piece

It seems the measurement of success or failure with those psychopaths who group themselves into what we call " the-family-of-states " ( and/or " nations " ) is determined by how successful they whet their skills at keeping the serfs marching to " polls " and out of the streets ( revolutions ) . <p> All beans .

That we cant depend upon the public fool system to give our children a good basis to run their life on ? That we cant trust men and women with the power of life and death over us to do the right thing all of the time ?

ALL Ponzi Schemes fail one day . <p> But once again , here is what is being so sorely missed in this otherwise fine article . It is that when too many fraudulent controls are placed upon the people , it will all fall apart and collapse down to the very bottom of the basement .

What could I do to help in Cyprus and all other countries ( like Spain , Greece and Italy ) for which , as we have predicted at TDV , bank closures are coming ? The answer was n't hard to come up with . If these people had simply bought bitcoins with their savings , not only would they currently have 100% access to their funds , but also they would have enjoyed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENTER THE WORLD 'S FIRST OPERATIONAL BITCOIN ATM <p> Upon examination of the marketplace and many discussions with Justin OConnell ( TDV Newsletter &amp; Gold Silver Bitcoin ) , as well as another key strategic partner of ours , I have decided to move forward with what I believe could be the next multi-billion dollar business venture : Bitcoin ATM . <p> But that is n't all . It is wholly our intention at Bitcoin ATM to put the company in the right position to open its very first ATM in Cyprus . If we did this now , and we are moving quickly to make this so , we would be the only functioning ATM on the island . <p> How do I know this is such a good idea ? Just look at what Bloomberg recently wrote about Bitcoin as currency : <p> One place where its not safe is in Bitcoin . Bitcoin is generally referred to as a " digital currency " or " virtual currency , " a form of cash that does n't  need government backing . Unfortunately its missing the most essential aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise as a tool for financial speculation underlines the failure of the virtual currency idea . <p> As Dollar Vigilante readers will know , I take issue with a number of assumptions in this paragraph . For instance , no economic law exists ( in the real world ) which stipulates that cash needs government backing . Also , I have found that Bitcoin is useful for many things , not the least of which are the many things we accept Bitcoin for here at TDV Media , such as TDV Offshore , TDV Passports , TDV Newsletter , TDV Homegrown , and Get Your Gold Out Of Dodge . <p> I am not the first person to note Bitcoins Aristotelian attributes as money . <p> Durability : Bitcoin exists on the networks of users everywhere . Just like the internet , there is no singular switch to turn Bitcoin off . Bitcoin has already seen tremendous volatility , and the userbase has remained . <p> Portability : What 's more portable than a flash drive ? Or , how about a private key memorized in your brain . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitcoin can be if you memorize your private key and keep the coins on a cold storage medium ( also another technology the Bitcoin ATM team has planned ) . <p> Fungibility : Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places . That means that at its current growth ( inflation ) rate of 3,600 bitcoin-a-day , the ultimate total amount of 21,000,000 bitcoin ever to be on the market can be divided among billions of people on the planet . <p> Intrinsic Value : A bet for Bitcoin is a bet for the Internet . We all have first hand experience with the intrinsic value of the Internet . What 's more , Bitcoin values the notion of privacy in a world where privacy has become scarcer than silver . <p> In Europe , institutions like the International Monetary Fund , European Central Bank &amp; the German Federal Government have forced individuals to suffer through the confiscation and devaluation of their savings through techniques like taxes , levies and inflation . <p> The European Central Bank published a report in October , which stated that increased demand for Bitcoin " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , " particularly if the public perceives Bitcoins value is due to " a central bank not doing its job properly . " Yet another reason why I know this idea is a good one . <p> These reasons and others are why I feel that Bitcoin ATMs time is now . We picked our slogan , " Your Future Now , " to demonstrate the immediacy with which we feel we must roll out this technology . <p> I 've founded many successful internet companies , and rarely have I been as excited about an idea as Bitcoin ATM . I 've got a great , knowledgeable team who has already contacted important people within and without the ATM and bitcoin communities to make this feasible . You 'll be intrigued by the unexpected relationships we 're forging to bring Bitcoin to more people across the globe . In gauging shop owners in the digital currency unfriendly state of California last week , the Bitcoin ATM team discovered great interest from not only those who knew Bitcoin , but also from those who did not . Stateless currencies will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATM , and why now . <p> BITCOIN ATM FUNCTIONALITY <p> At this moment in time , you can deposit fiat currency into Bitcoin ATM and receive bitcoins to your account . You can also send bitcoins and receive fiat currencies . <p> OWN YOUR OWN BITCOIN ATM 'S POSSIBLE BUSINESS VENTURE OF THE DECADE <p> Ever wish you had gotten involved in the early stages of the internet in 1994 ? Or bought gold in 2000 ? Or invested in Microsoft in the 80s ? I see bitcoin and things like Bitcoin ATM as being the next big thing . And , this is not the first time I 've recognized a massive paradigm shift as I did starting Canada 's largest financial website in 1994 and became a gold advocate early in the last decade and starting up The Dollar Vigilante in 2009 with a focus on protecting from The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) something that is in full flight as people in Cyprus can attest . <p> As stated , we want to roll out these ATMs as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations which are currently undergoing capital controls such as Argentina and Iran . But , even more than that , there are communities of freedom minded individuals sprouting up all over the world . A few bitcoin ATMs in the free state , New Hampshire , where thousands of freedom loving agorists have already moved is a no brainer . Other areas that make complete sense include places like Chile where many are now gravitating as well as Cafayate in Argentina where Doug Casey has already formed his freedom loving expat community . <p> I am convinced bitcoin will be the currency of the future and all the attacks on it by governments and central banks shows they know it . <p> If you are interested in getting more info on becoming a franchisee in a particular area and installing a Bitcoin ATM in that region , please contact us at email protected As well , as things grow and I expect it to be rapid we may accept investors who are interested .

The US government is nearly indebted to the equivalent of all the privately held wealth in the world and possibly more ! <p> Remember that the next time someone says , " The US is the richest country on Earth " . It is much more accurate to state that the US is the most bankrupt and indebted country in the history of the world . <p> What should be much easier is calculating the total debt and liabilities of the US government but even this is mostly a guessing game . Even the US government 's own Government ( Un ) Accountability Office ( GAO ) which is slated with the task of trying to find out where all the money in the government is going has said that it is impossible to fully audit the government . <p> " The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government because of widespread material internal control weaknesses , significant uncertainties , and other limitations , " the agency said .

The federal governments inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies .

Former US Comptroller General David M Walker argues total US government debt is $73 trillion .

These are funds that have been extorted in the past for programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Socialist Insecurity that are theoretically supposed to be paid back . If accounted for under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) , like every other company in the US does , total US government debt and liabilities stands above $90 trillion and is rising at about $5 trillion per year . <p> THE ONLY THING KEEPING THIS GAME GOING <p> This is a truly record-breaking amount of debt for an empire .

" Salvian the Presbyter <p> We often get asked why we think a second passport is so important . There are several reasons involving convenience , freedom , costs and political risk management .

And it 's not just filing a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport . It 's the time during which you have no passport that 's hard to endure . Without a passport , your trip could get complicated , to say the least , and even after you get back to your home base , your international travel options are limited while you wait for a new document . With a second passport , however , at least you have another document which will allow you to travel . Just as with the tires on your car , it 's always nice to have a spare . <p> Then there are savings . Some countries require American , Canadians and other nationalities to have to pay a fee to enter . This is the case with Argentina , Bolivia and Chile , for example .

But some states are better to belong to than others . <p> Having a second , passport from a peaceful , unindebted country could act as a **35;504;TOOLONG card . Note that no one has ever hijacked a plane and threatened to kill all the Paraguayan citizens aboard . Yes , you may be " obviously " American , but any potential American-killer may respect your good sense in getting another passport and likely no longer funding the US government with your tax dollars . But , as I 've said , the more imminent terrorist danger is from the US government itself and having a second citizenship and passport gives you an out from obligations and ties to the US government . The US government is such an intrusive monster that other country 's banking systems are turning away US citizens as customers because those banks simply do n't want to deal with the meddlesome IRS . American expats have to get a second citizenship and passport just to be able to do business outside of the US . Those that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the world simply refuse to do business with them . <p> It 's not just the US that is guilty in this regard , however . As the world sinks deeper into economic and political crisis , expect more forms of capital controls to spring up . For example , a Canadian bank just closed the accounts of all customers who are citizens of Iran . The Netherlands forced GoldMoney.com to refuse Dutch customers . And Argentina and Italy are outright forbidding citizens to move money out of the country . Expect much , much more of this in all the western countries as they look to lock the doors on capital in a last ditch attempt to keep their fasco-communist systems afloat . A second passport in this type of situation could literally mean the difference between keeping all your assets and losing them all . <p> In the wake of very wealthy and high profile people renouncing US citizenship , grubby US politicians are already looking for ways to discourage or to block outright renunciation of US citizenship to keep the income tax money flowing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US government is also one of the very few countries on the planet that demands income tax from citizens who live abroad . And the rest of the Western world is following the US and becoming the sort of states you would not want citizenship with . More and more Western nations ( Canada , Australia and New Zealand and the countries of Europe ) will likely be taking a page from the US and trying to extract tax money from their citizens living abroad . Hungary has already started by announcing recently that it will impose taxes on its citizens worldwide , just as the US does . We have no idea how quickly the other Western nation-states will follow suit , but we 're sure that they will all indeed follow . <p> One of the biggest economic benefits of a second passport , depending on your own situation , residency and original citizenship is that you could end up avoiding a lot of money in extortion ( taxes ) being stolen from you . As one example , if a Canadian leaves Canada and has a residency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Paraguay they could find themselves in a situation where they go from losing 40% of their income every year to theft to 0% . Or , if an American were to get a Paraguayan passport and renounce their US passport they also could find themselves never being extorted for the rest of their life . Finding out how to legally avoid armed robbery each year is a tricky thing though and we recommend speaking to a tax specialist where you live for more . <p> So while the mundane reasons are compelling enough on their own , it is the management of political risk and extortion-avoidance that makes a second citizenship and passport truly appealing these days . But choose your second citizenship carefully . Citizenship in Latin America is much easier to acquire and represents actual geopolitical risk management . Trying to get away from the US with another nation-state in the Western world is to leave one sinking ship for another . The entire Western world is in economic collapse mode and Western governments will get increasingly brazen in trying to bail themselves out at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bound to get a lot worse before it 's over . <p> Keep in mind that TDV Passports does n't just get you a passport . You ca n't have a legitimate passport without first getting citizenship . TDV Passports can help get you both a second citizenship and the passport to go with it . We 've outlined the benefits of both in these increasingly uncertain times . To learn more , click here .

Top Analyst Says Coming in November <p> This summer I stated that I expected a fall crisis to happen mostly based on my insights- on- an ancient timeline called the Shemitah . I produced several videos that went viral around the world . <p> In fact , the- crisis - came a few weeks early- when 23 international stock markets crashed in and around August , - and the Dow fell over 1,000 points intraday near the end of August . <p> We profited immensely from it as we were positioned for collapse and one of our speculations rose 4,500% in three days ! - By then we were so well known that- - " Shemitah " and my name were among some of the- top-searched terms on Google in early September . <p> I still expect further market meltdowns either this year or next. - The fallout from Shemitah and its trends is nowhere near finished , and I 'm working on a new video explaining that . <p> Others have weighed in including- an analyst who has called- nearly every major event this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been following the Shemitah timeline . He even called- for September and October to be months that would include a rebound from the crash in August . <p> Now , he has predicted a- crisis/crash period for- November . <p> So far , as noted , he s had a streak of great calls including : <p> China 's stock market peak in April 2015 <p> Hong Kong market peak on April 29 2015 <p> US stock market drop beginning in July 2015 <p> Sharp drop in the stop market in August 2015 <p> US stock market uneventful in September 2015 <p> His name is Bo Polny of Gold2020Forecast and once I heard about his streak I contacted him and found that his theories were very much aligned with ours <p> His latest call is for a November crash/crisis to occur- and it certainly sounds possible. - Even my mentor , Doug Casey , has recently shortened his call for a " crisis to happen in the next year " and has now stated he thinks it will begin to happen by the end of this year . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reasoning on why a major crisis/crash may happen in the dollar and the US markets this month as well as a major upmove in gold and silver . <p> We do n't  have long to wait to see if he is right on his timing yet again . <p> If not , however , we are so close now to dramatic events that you - really need to be- prepared now if you have not . <p> The markets are tenuous at best . <p> We called the rise in- Bitcoin weeks ago and just today it was- up another $75 and is currently near $435 , nearly doubling now in the last month . - The massive crisis to come has n't  happened yet and already we are up nearly 100% on bitcoin in the last month . <p> I see bitcoin as being a " canary in the coalmine " due to the limited ability for it to be manipulated to the extremes we 've seen in gold and silver . <p> We had near triple digit gains in other gold-related investments in the last three months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll find all of our predictions in our TDV newsletter , published twice a month and usually exceeding 50 pages full of information on markets , preparedness , politics and general investment insights . Please visit www.SurviveShemitah.com to take advantage of our special low cost price- of US$39.95 while it lasts . <p> Yeah something has got ta give , Bitcoin finally broke out , were getting this ridiculous fake stock market rally that even mainstream investors are skeptical about . Also it looks like the Obama regime is desperate to start a war with Russia , but Putin is too smart to take the bait , another indication they cant keep this together for much longer without some sort of distraction . On the other hand though Obama is really focused on his " legacy " , and will do anything to keep things together until he leaves office , even if that means destroying everything else in the world , just another thing to keep in mind . <p> george <p> Things that amaze me a ) the people who say " nothing happened in September " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge " despite it now passing the $500 mark up $65 since you posted this ! c ) that the Fed kept the dollar going this long after becoming fiat . ( Although Google reveals the median life expectancy of fiat is 39 years so I 'm not that amazed any more ) . <p> Windrunner56 <p> BTC to the moon ? Maybe , maybe not . But it is apparently moving north according to the economic news . Gold and Silver ? I own all three , but I can not figure out when PMs will unleash their true power . We need more high rises with bankers on the top floor I guess .. <p> Michael Nickson <p> An anonymous person decides to " float " 21,000,000 Bitcoins from , i must conclude , out of nothing ? Touted somehow to be a commodity that can be traded completely outside the established financial systems of the world , i can not understand what the " money " is backed by ? Its not precious metals , it seems to me at the moment , to be as " fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governments and their sheeple . The originator would n't have backed his scheme with any money of his own , so again , i am left with the distinct impression that this is a " pyramid " scheme backed by thin air but for the craziness of those greedy souls who , without the likely ability to rationalize beyond their own self-deception , that this is a fraud every bit ( pun intended ) as monstrous as central banking . <p> However , that is not to say that in the initial stages of most ponzi type schemes that money can not be made if one gets in early enough as is the case in question . But like the stock market , for every dollar made someone else loses . These sorts of " investments " can make millionaires early in the game but many , many more unfortunates will , in the end , lose their shirts because of their greed . Be warned . <p> Bitcoin is complex and confusing , and surrounded by FUD . If you ask more specific questions , you 'll get better answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What you wrote indicates there are some misunderstandings that you harbor : 1 ) Bitcoins are created through the luck of a competition which effectively protects a database . Those participating in the competition keep the data safe , and they get paid for it with newly created bitcoin . About every four years , the rate at which bitcoin is created gets cut in half . 2 ) Bitcoin is backed by the same thing that any commodity is : the expectation that it will be valuable to other traders ( not " nothing " ) . While it has no weight , cant conduct electricity , and has no effect on any chemical reactions , it is easily transferred great distances , can not be counterfeited , and represents value to all who have control of some of it . 3 ) Greed hurts those who fall prey to its wiles whether or not such victims ( of their own failures ) use bitcoin or anything else . <p> I hope that your impressions have been tempered by this new information . If you have questions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to answer , but independent research is both more rewarding and more convenient . <p> Michael Nickson <p> Thanks , Dave . <p> One of my sons purchase Bitcoin yesterday and today i was about to when the thoughts i posted earlier flooded into my head . Since then ive looked at four articles , two for and two against , and i 'm not at all inclined to change my opinion . <p> Dave , " the expectation that it will be valuable to other traders ( not " nothing " ) . " does not provide any comfort nor assurance to the buyer except what he thinks it might do for his wallet , and that 's what drives this thing ; the thought of pure profit based primarily on greed . Say what you will , there 's no evidence of anything backing the investment like there is when it comes to regular stock in any given company and even that 's questionable . <p> Sorry , Dave , you 'll have to do a lot better than this , but heck , i 'm just a poor guy who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without concrete backing . I still hold hopes for Jeff to understand its better not to lay up for oneself treasures on earth but treasures in Heaven . <p> It seemed to me that your chief reservation in following your sons example of investing a little in bitcoin was the fact that nothing backs it , so I figured that if you recognized that nothing backs gold either , it may help . <p> There are two approaches to these things . If it interests you , then you identify a little bit of something precious to you that you 're willing to risk ( in this case , time ) , and you use it to explore . I do n't  recommend investing in anything unless you understand its value first . Understanding the value of bitcoin does n't  require that you hold any , but holding a tiny bit would provide the motivation for the curiosity and exploration that will grow your knowledge of its value . <p> I much prefer that people get interested in authority and coercion rather than bitcoin . I aim for a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool that helps me get there . The philosophical corruption that allows coercive authorities to persist is the main target of my efforts to destroy , while curiosity and prosperity are the main targets of my efforts to create . <p> Big Jim McGregor <p> Yup , you have proved undeniably that you do n't  get it ! Do n't  worry keep your bucks safe in the bank , nothing to see here ! <p> Shamic <p> Its like when you have money , but your money is bitcoin . Do you understand now ? <p> Shamic <p> YES ! ! ! YES ! ! ! YES ! ! ! ! ! ! Ah HELL YEAH ! ! ! This is so exciting ! ! ! ! So this collapse is Imminent ! ! ? AH finally its taken soooo long <p> Pauline Andree <p> Good for Dave for not removing Michaels post , that shows integrity . <p> WF <p> Thought this might provide some insight . Kimble has a great track record for anticipating moves based on technical analysis . <p> If you you google dollar historical charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart that graphs their movements . In short , gold and dollar value moves inversely to each other . <p> This is brief and only a hypothesis FED raises rates to save face , dollars become scarce , dollars increase in value , debt starts massive defaults starting in emerging markets , contagion spreads to more advanced nations as all banks hold liabilities for each other , all financial roads lead back to the FED , faith evaporates in the financial experiment as it will have failed , flight to safety lead from dollars to precious metals . <p> Nothing is for sure , but there are many patterns harmonizing simultaneously . If Bo Polny is correct , this might be one way it could come to pass . <p> It seems like the FED et al will continue pulling one thing or another out of a hat . I would like to think that gold and silver will begin to show true value by 2018 , but not before . Evil usually goes further than we can imagine . Maybe a black swan somewhere would change this prediction from the peanut gallery .

This document outlined the need for a " new Pearl Harbor " in order to facilitate the expansion of the military industrial complex and the US empire . <p> As Clark outlined , within days of 9/11 , the orders and plans were already laid out to attack Afghanistan and to " take out seven countries in five years " . He says , the plans after Afghanistan were , " to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libya , Somalia , Sudan and Iran . " <p> Those plans , so far , have been carried out in Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya . And , just yesterday , Obama stated his plans to attack Syria . The reason for attacking Syria is just as ridiculous and untrue as it was for Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya . This time , they say they must attack Syria because of this ragtag group of " terrorists " which just appeared out of nowhere called ISIS . <p> Of course , they did n't really come out of nowhere , the US armed the group now known as ISIS to create chaos in Syria originally , just a few months ago , and now say that they pose a serious threat to the US exactly like they did with Al-Qaeda . <p> The plan by PNAC , so far , has worked in that US military spending has grown dramatically since 2001 . <p> Total military expenses of $1.3 trillion per year means that more than half the tax revenue of the US government goes solely to the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than all other countries in the world combined . And , military spending by the US and its allies accounts for between two-thirds and three-quarters of all global military spending . <p> THE IMPORTANCE OF 9/11 <p> Millions of men , women and children have been killed , tortured or displaced all based on the US government 's official lie of 9/11 . Trillions of dollars have been wasted and destroyed and a global police state is being rolled out to protect us from " terrorists " . <p> The good news is that every year more people wake up to what really happened on 9/11 . <p> One of the most interesting and detailed explanations of it all comes from Barbara Honneger who has done countless hours of investigation into the event , specifically on the bombs that were planted in the Pentagon and reveals a bounty of new information here : <p> The amount of people waking up to and speaking up about 9/11 continues to grow .

Gox which was n't a legitimate high ) of $1,150 . And , bitcoin has remained above the $1000 price level for a record stretch of time - seven days ! <p> The price is currently $1122.19 as of the writing of this article and continues to climb . <p> This upside has been fueled by the potential SEC approval of the new Winklevoss bitcoin ETF ( COIN ) scheduled for Saturday , March 11th . <p> As it currently stands , rules and regulations state that wholesale investors are prohibited from taking positions on bitcoin . However if the ETF is approved , it will likely result in a deluge of money managers piling into the market . This could spark a trading frenzy pushing bitcoin much , much higher . <p> Right now there is only one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is through the Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTC : GTBC ) . Except it is not an ETF , does not track the price of bitcoin very well and it is listed on the OTC market which the majority of fund managers are unable to trade . <p> GBTC , however , announced last month that they are applying to get listed on the New York Stock Exchange as an ETF . <p> If either or both of these instruments gain approval , there 's no telling how high the value of bitcoin will go , but I told subscribers that it could be over $5,000 by the end of 2017 . <p> Of course , the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is a criminal enterprise that uses violence ( laws/police/jail ) to manipulate the markets in favor of its lobbyists who pay the most bribes . ( Donald Trump proudly proclaims that he has bribed almost every major politician in the US . ) <p> So , there is really no way to know what the SEC will do . It depends who pays off whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they did , they would cause a massive spike in bitcoin . This spike would allow bitcoin to further compete with the financial system of which the SEC is a part . <p> While we wait to see what happens , we featured another cryptocurrency in the TDV newsletter ( subscribe here ) this month . And , just like bitcoin , ethereum and monero , which we also featured in the last few years , it spiked dramatically right after our recommendation . <p> We featured it at $17.15 and it is currently at $21.95 for a near 28% gain . But , if we are right , it will go much , much higher . <p> Bitcoin hitting its all-time high just a few days before the TDV Internationalization and Investment Summit , Anarchapulco , and Cryptopulco starting this weekend is incredible timing .

@@99475240 @3675240/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Why Do Fascists Fight Communists ? They <p> A friend pointed me to the documentary Apocalypse : The Rise of Hitler from National Geographicthe other day . Being somewhat slow I sat dazed as I watched it ! These images were enthralling glorious ! I 'd never seen anything like them before how was that possible ? I quickly posted my question on Facebook and numerous of my much more intelligent friends noted that color film really did n't  exist at the time of most of the footage so it must have been colorized . I sat feeling stupid for a few moments and then returned to the documentary . It really is incredibly well done . The colorization made the events seem more recent and much closer to home . <p> In the documentary , one of the things that really struck me was the fascists hatred of the communists . The first people the Nazis put into concentration camps when they came into power were communist party members . And of course communist Russia was the great enemy of fascist Nazi Germany ( note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were much more fascist by action than socialist ) . <p> But I was confused . Why were these two totalitarian systems at each others throats in the first half of the 20th century ? It was sort of like Skeletor fighting Hordak . They both wanted total control of their subjects lives . The differences between fascism and communism are pretty subtle , especially to the anarcho-capitalist mind . Those differences amounted to issues of nominal ownership in a system of complete control by the state . <p> WHAT IS FASCISM ? <p> Fascism is totalitarianism that allows the illusion of private property . Communism is totalitarianism that does n't  allow private property . That is the simplest way to describe their differences . <p> Fascism is collectivist along national lines and it puts the state above the individual . It holds that the individual is better off when bundled together into a collective . In fact , the word fascism itself is derived from the Italian word for a bundle of sticks . <p> Fascism is inherently anti-capitalist . Capitalism is the economic arrangement that comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fascists let people keep their own property , both the means of production and the consumer goods produced by those means . But fascists tell everyone what they can do with their bodies and their stuff . In fact business under fascism is automatically corporatist ; because business has no choice but to collude with government . <p> WHAT IS COMMUNISM ? <p> Communists hate property . They think its authoritarian . Their goal is to abolish private property . But of course in order to do that , you need an all-powerful state . And while people think mostly of jackbooted thugs , attempts at world conquest , and ethnic cleansing of fascisms moustachioed poster boy , the fact is the communists killed far more of their own people than were killed by the fascists in war . Communist China alone killed about 65 million of its own people . Thats 5 million more than died in World War II . <p> Again , fascist regimes let businesses and people keep their stuff . Communists let no one keep anything privately . Both philosophies require an all-powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 're told . Fascists openly admit that fact , while communists insist they want a stateless world . Thing is , in a stateless world private property and voluntary exchange of that property and of labor would flourish . ( That 's why we often get so annoyed with communists who call themselves **35;541;TOOLONG its not possible . ) <p> MIXED ECONOMIES <p> Do n't  fall for it when people talk about " mixed " economies . When the state runs businesses through laws and regulations that is a fascist situation . That 's the funniest thing about fascism . It is such a pejorative term because of Mussolini and Hitler . No one will admit to being fascist , but almost every nation on the planet is fascist . That 's what the " mixed " economy is . Its just plain old fascism : private ownership of capital and consumer goods with strict state control . You do n't  have to have jackbooted thugs and concentration camps in order to be fascist . You just need the state telling everyone what they can do with their stuff . <p> Fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic term fascism just means state control over " private " property . But its in the states nature to grow and for the slaves in the state to suffer from Stockholm syndrome . They come to identify with their captors , to accept their dependence and helplessness , and to rationalize their abuse at their captors hands . The nationalism of fascist philosophy is inherently tribal ( on the national scale ) and tends to be very concerned with purity for the sake of unity . That 's why racism and democide come so easily to fascists . <p> THE FASCO-COMMUNIST USA <p> The US started out as a fairly capitalist place , but has become increasingly fascist over the years . You can look at the New Deal as an acceleration in that process . Ironically that came around the same time fascism was spreading from Italy to Germany . The US was mostly free of the jackbooted thugs for most of that time . But anyone who has been paying attention knows that the surveillance police state , the kind of thing most people envision when they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fascism is n't " coming " to the USSA . Its already here . It has been here for a long time . Pretty soon its not going to play as nice as it has been . Eventually the fascists are going to need a group to persecute vigorously . These days Jews and homosexuals are off limits . We suspect that this time it will be poor people ( already it is illegal to feed the homeless in many cities ) , certain illegal aliens , and libertarians who get rounded up into concentration camps . The illegals will provide a convenient scapegoat for economic woes while the libertarians will be labeled dangerous ideological enemies of the state and potential terrorists . <p> To make matters worse , not only is the USSA fascist but it has also taken on some of the worst ideas from communism , like central banking , government-controlled education and heavy taxation as we pointed out in the article , " The Fasco-Communist Police State of America " . <p> This underscores the point that even though fascism and communism are ideologically opposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , a society is either collectivized and authoritarian or it is individual and free . So its amusing for us to watch the fascists fighting the commies out on the streets of Berlin when they both really wanted the same thing . Its as silly as watching Republicans argue with Democrats .

@@99475247 @3675247/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> An Inside Look at the Mexican Medical System <p> I hope you are all doing well today . I just personally recovered from a stomach bug that had been ailing me for the last two weeks . It got so bad that I finally gave in to going to the hospital for two nights to get hooked up to an IV as I was becoming very dehydrated and needed to replenish my electrolytes . <p> I am currently located in one of my " home bases " , Acapulco , Mexico . I am a born Canadian but do not consider myself to be a " Canadian " . I consider myself to be a citizen of the world and refuse to be limited by borders and certainly have no allegiance to any government flag . My allegiance lies with freedom and I tend to gravitate to whatever places offer me the most freedom thus explaining why I 've spent a great amount of time over the last few years in Mexico , one of the " free-er " countries in the world . <p> Having grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I fell i 'll in Mexico and not Canada . To give you an example , my mother had fallen ill twice this past winter and neither time went to the doctor or the hospital . Not because she did n't  want to . She wanted to but was told both times that the waiting list to see the doctor was about 3 weeks . <p> Conversely , here in Mexico , on the first day I had a fever , vomiting and was feeling unwell I called a doctor who happens to be located right in the building where I live . She was here in my apartment within 5 minutes and diagnosed me and gave me an injection which took my fever down . She also put me on some antibiotics . The cost , by the way , was very manageable . About $50 for the in-home service and the cost of the medication she injected . <p> After I went off the antibiotics things got progressively worse and I again had a fairly high fever . Again I called the doctor . After consulting with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for me to go to the hospital and have some tests run and get hooked up to an IV drip to get rehydrated . <p> I showed up at one of the dozens of hospitals here . They have a full variety . Some are free and there are some very luxury private hospitals . I chose a medium level private hospital . When I showed up I was the only person there . This is in STARK contrast to anytime Ive ever been in a Canadian emergency room . Average waiting times in Canadian emergency rooms in major cities such as Edmonton or Vancouver are anywhere from 2-12 hours all depending how close you are to death . Those about to die get priority . I always thought that was nice . <p> But here in Mexico within 5 minutes of showing up at the hospital I was hooked up to an IV and put in a very nice private room with flat screen TV and wifi internet . <p> The service was very good and after 2 days I felt great and discharged myself . The cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneys worth . It was about $1,000 USD for the 2 full days in the hospital including the medications , food and numerous different specialists running a number of tests . Of course , if you are worried about having a big one-time cost for any major unexpected illness or trauma you can buy insurance . I have heard you can get medical insurance in Mexico for as cheap as $300 per year . <p> I have never been big on medical insurance . Of course , in Canada , you are forced to pay for medical insurance . Yet , somehow , if you talk to any Canadian , they always talk about how healthcare is free . That is one of the biggest brainwashing successes of all time ! <p> But as you have read in our Health &amp; Safety sections I try to eat quite healthy and exercise regularly and therefore I rarely ever have any health problems . The last time I can even remember being in a hospital was 20 years ago . So , for me , its just better to pay as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon in the US , I have the freedom to make that choice . <p> In the upcoming October issue we will have a full overview of Mexico as being a potential place to reside . If you have n't spent much time here and get most of your information from the mass media you may be surprised by many of the things in our report . I have traveled through most of Mexico , having traveled down the entire West Coast on my sailboat in 2004 and since having lived in Acapulco and visiting countless other towns and cities . <p> The full report in our Expatriation section will only be available to Basic ( $15/month ) or Full ( $25/month ) subscribers .

Most days I feel like Mugatu , from the movie Zoolander . I feel like I am taking crazy pills ! <p> Like , for example , this headline , " First Lady Asks Restaurants to Serve Healthy Foods " . I mean , really ! It is pretty obvious that the great majority of Americans would be advantaged by a fairly significant change in their diets . But , the wife of the President of the USA , going around to places like the restaurant association and asking them to " take a little butter or cream out of their dishes " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference and try to admonish people not to run with scissors ? ? <p> Meanwhile , her husband , the Nobel Peace Prize winner just sold $60 Billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia . If you or I did that wed be illegal arms smugglers . When he does it , its a great economic triumph and another feather in the cap of the Prince of Peace ! <p> And in our " this ca n't be true " category , comes this headline , UK Teenager Banned For Life From America Over Obscene Obama Email . There are so many things wrong with this story I do n't  know where to begin . But , let 's begin with this : the word he called Obama was censored in the story but they included the first and the last letter . The word he called the President was P***k . I 'm just scanning through my known list of obscenities but unless he called Obama a Prank or a Punkk then I am presuming he called him a Prick . First , is that even an obscenity ? ? And secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for calling Obama a prick then what 's going to happen to me ? I guess I 'll soon be off to Guantanamo the concentration camp , which still has n't  been closed , operated by the Peace Prize winner ! <p> But , let 's close todays blog entry with a positive story ! This headline , from FT.com , Cuba To Cut 500,000 from State Payroll . That is simply a massive number ! Cuba only has a population of 11 million and so that is an almost unbelievably huge figure and gives hope that Cuba may finally be letting hold of the horrible communist system . <p> If the US were to cut the same amount per capita they would have to fire 13.5 million national , state and municipal workers ! But if they did then they might not have enough people to scan emails and ban teenagers from the UK to visit the US for calling the President a prick !

Maybe all it will take is a significant terrorist attack on US soil . You 'll go to sleep one night thinking you had a retirement account invested in mutual funds , and wake up to learn that it has been converted to US Government treasuries for " security " purposes . <p> Mutual funds are sketchy enough .

That is on top of each and every required report on all personal cash transactions in excess of $10,000 . <p> Moreover , as Reuters points out , the FBI already enjoys full access to this database . The CIA and NSA must make case-by-case requests for information to FinCEN . <p> The Treasury program gives spy agencies more raw financial data than ever .

@@99475256 @3675256/ <h> Fiat Currency Insanity The Swiss Franc Shocker And TEOTMSAWKI <p> Things are really starting to go off the rails now . The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) is coming to a rapid , volatile end . It may not be this year but at this rate it would not surprise us if it was . <p> Many anti-bitcoiners like to point out the problem with bitcoin is that it is very volatile . And , they are right , it is an issue . Bitcoin recently flash crashed to nearly $150 and has now rebounded to over $200 as the Bitstamp exchange has re-opened without problem as we expected . <p> But bitcoin almost appears to be a beacon of stability compared to what is going on with the fiat currencies . <p> Of course , the Venezuelan Bolivar and Argentine Peso are lost causes . But more important currencies like the Russian Ruble have been incredibly volatile . Scott Freeman wrote his contrarian perspective on the ruble ruckus for TDV : <p> Moreover , at least in terms of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Russian government . This is because most of its costs are in rubles , whereas a significant part of its income is in dollars . According to a recent calculation made by the Moscow Times , at least in the short term each additional ruble per dollar translates into 205 billion rubles per year in additional government revenue . 27 rubles x R205b = US$92 billion at 60:1 . While such gains are likely to be partially offset by increased inflation , gains are immediate whereas additional costs are delayed . <p> Why carry out the devaluation now in the midst of the oil price drop ? The answer should be fairly obvious : because the oil price drop provided an excuse a scapegoat if you will for something which was both inevitable and planned . According to its own published figures , the Russian government had already expended US$80 billion to defend an unrealistic exchange rate , and anyone with basic math skills could see that a trend reversal was not very likely . It was only a question of timing , and for that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was abolished and the rate adjusted . The middle classes tend to be the principal losers in devaluation scenarios , but thanks to the apparent external cause , in this case for the most part they did not blame their government . <p> Then , yesterday , the Swiss Franc rose nearly 40% in a matter of seconds after the Swiss National Bank stated in a press release that they are going to charge people even more to hold the money : <p> The Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) is discontinuing the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro . At the same time , it is lowering the interest rate on sight deposit account balances that exceed a given exemption threshold by 0.5 percentage points , to ? 0.75% . It is moving the target range for the three-month Libor further into negative territory , to between 1.25% and -0.25% , from the current range of between -0.75% and 0.25% . <p> The minimum exchange rate was introduced during a period of exceptional overvaluation of the Swiss franc and an extremely high level of uncertainty on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss economy from serious harm . While the Swiss franc is still high , the overvaluation has decreased as a whole since the introduction of the minimum exchange rate . The economy was able to take advantage of this phase to adjust to the new situation . <p> Recently , divergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas have increased significantly a trend that is likely to become even more pronounced . The euro has depreciated considerably against the US dollar and this , in turn , has caused the Swiss franc to weaken against the US dollar . In these circumstances , the SNB concluded that enforcing and maintaining the minimum exchange rate for the Swiss franc against the euro is no longer justified . <p> The SNB is lowering interest rates significantly to ensure that the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate does not lead to an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions . The SNB will continue to take account of the exchange rate situation in formulating its monetary policy in future . If necessary , it will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Cancun at the Passport to Freedom conference and was having a drink with Jim Rickards , the writer of Currency Wars , when he told me the news on the Swiss Franc ! <p> I looked at him and he looked at me with the same expression .

Ourselves , as well , at The Dollar Vigilante , have been talking about this since 2010 . At that time I stated that the current monetary system might last five years but no more than ten . <p> I now am predicting that we might get pretty close to outright collapse this year , but , if not , no more than a few years . <p> You just have to open your eyes to see the symptoms everywhere .

@@99475258 @3675258/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Amerika : Keeping The Tax Mules In Harness <p> Editors note : the following post is by Jim Karger , TDV Legal Correspondent <p> If you are successful , the United Socialist States of Amerika does not want you to leave . It is not because they like you but because you are paying them and they intend for you to continue to do so until your last breath . They want you to stay so much that they are willing to threaten you , seize your assets , and imprison you , if necessary , to keep you and your money at home . Herein , I discuss four examples , which , at first blush , may appear disconnected , but each of which acts to communicate this message to the Sheeple . <p> ( 1 ) " You Can Leave Us , But You Ca n't Stop Paying Us " <p> Most have now heard of the Ex-Patriot Act , authored by Charles Schumer , a rabid statist , and his accomplice , Bob Casey , in response to Eduardo Saverins expatriation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this bill becomes law ( and it may since the Republican Speaker of the House , John Boehner , also supports it ) , any " covered ex-patriot " ( meaning an American who renounces or relinquishes his U.S. citizenship , and who has a net worth of over $2 million , or an average income tax liability of at least $148,000 over the last five years ) , " will be presumed to have renounced their citizenship for tax avoidance purposes . " <p> What is the effect of that presumption ? 1 ) The ex-patriot will be expected to pay 30% on all their capital gains going forward for 10 years , and 2 ) They will never be permitted to return , even as a guest , to the United States . <p> Only if the " covered expatriate " can demonstrate to the IRS that he or she did not leave for tax purposes , which they ironically call a " legitimate reason , " will these penalties not apply . Because proof of a negative fact is impossible , expect the government to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter where he or she resides . " <p> In short , the U.S. claims to have the right to tax a non-citizen , non-resident former American on his worldwide gains for 10 years in the future and , simultaneously , banish him from the United States forever . In other words , the expatriate is not treated as just another non-resident foreigner who pays no capital gains to the U.S. and most of whom can get a 10-year visa into the U.S. without much trouble , but rather , as a pariah , who must be punished and then banished forever , a financial leper . <p> Cruel and hubristic to be sure , but give the devil his due . If the Ex-Patriot Act becomes law , it will have the intended effect , which is to close the door marked " Exit " to most successful entrepreneurs . By leaving , they would be required not only to pay capital gains tax going forward for 10 years but also the punitive " exit tax " calculated by engaging in the fiction they sold all of their assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sold nothing ) and pay tax on the fictional " gain . " <p> Until the last few years , the exit tax was enough to keep the herd in the coral . But , in the last three years , expatriations have skyrocketed by 400% , some say far more . Hence the need to up the ante and add a financial minefield around an already barbed-wire fence that encircles the United States to keep the successful in the pen . <p> Government is not worried about Joe Lunchbucket . While leaving should be the first thing on the average Americans mind , it is the last . Twelve to sixteen years of public indoctrination and disturbing debt loads keeps the tax slaves in harness . The sole goal of the Ex-Patriot Act is to keep the best , the brightest , the most creative and productive in harness with them . <p> And know the Ex-Patriot Act is not all , but rather , just another in a long list of bills and laws intended to intimidate and harass Americans with the intent that they continue acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1813 authored by another statist , Barbara Boxer , is also pending , and if it becomes law will allow the federal government to prevent Americans who owe back taxes from traveling outside the United States . <p> Buried deep in a popular highway funding bill , it passed the Senate on a 74 22 vote last month . Ironically called the " Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act " or " MAP-21 , ? the bill includes a provision that would allow for the " revocation or denial " of a passport for anyone with " certain unpaid taxes " or " tax delinquencies . " Specifically , any individual who owes more than $50,000 to the Internal Revenue Service will be subject to " action with respect to denial , revocation , or limitation of a passport . " <p> Most troubling is the absence of any language requiring a taxpayer to be convicted of , or even charged with , tax evasion or any other crime in order to have their passport revoked or limited only that a notice of lien or levy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $50,000 problem is no problem for the IRS . For those with foreign bank accounts or trusts that hold real estate outside the U.S. , a single failure to file a timely FBAR form ( Treasury Form TD F 90-22.1 ) in a single year on a foreign account can get one to a $50,000 problem . And , the " owed " figures are generated by the IRS unilaterally , placing the burden on individuals to prove that they do n't  owe what the IRS says they owe , the proof of a negative fact problem again . <p> Separately , beginning with 2011 tax returns , the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) requires U.S. citizens and permanent residents to file a separate report ( Form 8938 ) listing " foreign financial assets " with an aggregate value of $50,000 or more with their annual tax return . As with the FBAR , failure to file this form on time every time subjects the offender to Draconian penalties , both civil and criminal . <p> Such technicalities are important if a U.S. citizen wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be further upped with the threat of passport revocation . This is especially important to Americans living outside the United States who rely on the validity of their U.S. passports to allow them to return to the U.S. and to keep them legally in their country of residence . To the extent that ones U.S. passport is invalidated , their status in their country of residence becomes problematic . Indeed , this bill implies not-so-subtly that the U.S. intends to begin extraditing those who owe too much to the homeland . <p> In an election year , odds are the transportation bill will be passed , and if passed , there is little doubt Obama will sign it with little , if any , public outrage or pushback . <p> It is not only the feds . Other levels of government are similarly circling the wagons with the same message . Even my former State of Texas , who some believe ( wrongfully ) is a last bastion of freedom in the United States , is sending the not-so-subtle message to young people " You ca n't leave , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them used to the idea , hey ? <p> ( 3 ) " Be Where We Tell You To Be , Or Else .

She makes good grades , but not surprisingly , with that grueling schedule she is often late for class . Sometimes she is absent . <p> The message ? The same as the federal government " You will be where we tell you to be when we tell you , or else . " <p> ( 4 ) " You Ca n't Leave . We Know Where You Are . " <p> Also from Texas comes the Northside Independent School District that will join other districts in tracking students by implanting Radio Frequency Identification System ( RFID ) tags into their student identification cards . <p> The reason ? Same as the Ex-Patriot Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can prove the number of students not enrolled but actually attending each day . The fact they learn nothing of value is irrelevant . The question is whether they show up . <p> " We want to harness the power of ( the ) technology to make schools safer , know where our students are all the time in a school , and increase revenues , " district spokesman Pascual Gonzalez said <p> Penalty for losing a student I 'd $15 . Penalty for not having $15 ? You already know the answer to that question . <p> The message ? Same as always . " You will be where you are supposed to be when we tell you to be there . You will leave only when we tell you to leave . " <p> These are few examples of the U.S. government ( and governments in the U.S. at all levels ) cracking down , closing in , and circling the wagons , not to keep the bad guys out , but the good guys in .

I have no crystal ball but here are a few educated guesses , each of which is worthy of discussion : <p> Capital controls . This message in the form of legislation may be , " You can leave , but your money ca n't , not without permission , which will only be granted to those who are not taking money out for a tax reason , " leaving the tax donkeys trying futilely to prove that negative fact again . <p> Revocation of passports for other offenses . Why should the government limit its authority to revoke passports and limit travel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to target ? After all , they may be a " terrorist , " whatever the definition may be on any given day . <p> Prohibition of second citizenship/passports . There are a few countries in the world that prohibit holding a second citizenship . There is no reason the U.S. could not do the same , saying , " If you do n't  have a second passport already , you cant have one . No more dual citizenship . " That is way of absolutely prohibiting expatriation since one has to have a second passport to expatriate under existing U.S. law . And , for those who are lucky enough to already have a second passport , their choice may be , " You can have one citizenship ours or theirs make a decision . " <p> There are countless other possibilities and we will soon know which manifest as law . For now , though , no one knows . And the fact that no one knows leads to an obvious conclusion : Prepare .

In the movie everything about the town was fake except for one person , Truman Burbank , who was n't in on the plot . In a sense your average person in the US , particularly when it comes to the economy , is akin to Truman . They have grown up inside this completely false environment and do n't even know it is all fake . <p> Virtually everything in the Truman Show-esque US economy is misinformation and completely skewed in which the creators , the US government , the Federal Reserve and the mainstream media constantly propagate blatantly false and wrong information and the American public , like Truman , have no idea that anything is even amiss . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us watching it as observers and not intimately tied into the story , were the latest GDP numbers released showing a -1% annualized rate in the first quarter of this year . <p> GDP IS A FALLACY <p> I wrote over three years ago about how the " GDP Is A Fallacy " . A fallacy being defined as an argument that uses poor reasoning . <p> For starters , to completely negate the entire concept , the total amounts of all goods consumed ( which is what GDP really tries to track ) in an economy can simply not be reliably calculated . <p> The GDP fallacy gives the impression that it is not the activities of individuals that produce goods and services , but something else outside these activities called the " economy . " However , at no stage does the so-called " economy " have a life of its own independent of individuals . <p> By lumping the values of all final goods and services together , government statisticians concretize the fiction of an economy by means of the GDP statistic . By regarding the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists reach a bizarre conclusion that what is good for individuals might not be good for the economy , and vice versa . Since the economy can not have a life of its own without individuals , obviously what is good for individuals can not be bad for the economy . <p> In the end it is just a bunch of numbers on a chalkboard that really signifies nothing of importance . <p> Furthermore , since GDP tracks consumption it is ridiculous to say that an economy grows when people consume more . This makes sense to even small children who understand that you " grow " or get richer by saving not spending . <p> The following joke perfectly explains the ludicrosity of GDP . <p> Two Keynesian economists , John Maynard Keynes and Paul Krugman , were walking down the street one day when they passed two large piles of dog shit . <p> Keynes said to Krugman , " I 'll pay you $20,000 to eat one of those piles of shit . " Krugman agrees and chooses one of the piles and eats it . Keynes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer , says , " I 'll pay you $20,000 to eat the other pile of shit . " Keynes , feeling bad about the money he lost says okay , and eats the shit . Krugman pays him the $20,000 . <p> They resume walking down the street . <p> After a while , Krugman says , " You know , I do n't feel very good . We both have the same amount of money as when we started . The only difference is we 've both eaten shit . " <p> Keynes says : " Ah , but you 're ignoring the fact that we 've increased the GDP by $40,000 . <p> That is really all you need to know about GDP it 's all dogshit . <p> THE MEDIA SPIN <p> Of course , the mainstream media loves these numbers , as it gives them something to drone on about and put their own spin on . The reaction to the most recent release of a -1% annualized GDP number by Bloomberg takes the cake in spinning this to meet their " recovery " propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think GDP is an important statistic then you would think that a negative GDP number would be a negative in terms of the " recovery " meme that mainstream media continues to peddle . Not so fast ! <p> Bloomberg has managed to take this negative number and say it is a positive ! <p> " Most of the decline in gross domestic product occurred because companies slowed the pace of inventory accumulation , according to data released on Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis . In other words , output slowed because they werent producing as much stuff to go on shelves . Now companies have an incentive to speed up production to rebuild those inventories . " <p> So , there you have it , in the Truman Show-esque world of US economics even a drop in the GDP is a good thing for the US economy ! <p> And , of course , they repeated what Janet Yellen recently said , that " cold weather " had slowed the economy in the first quarter ! This , while at the same time saying that Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder so many Americans are on anti-depressants and drinking themselves into a stupor when they live in such a bizarro world . <p> THE GOLDILOCKS RECOVERY <p> The government and media in the US continue to pound the table about a US recovery for which there is no evidence . In the past they used to call it the goldilocks recovery , which was very apt , since it was never anything but a fairy tale . <p> All one has to do is look at the percentage of the US population currently employed to see there is and has been no recover whatsoever . <p> But , some may say , " Yes , but the US is an entrepreneurial culture and self-employed people will grow the economy " . <p> Not so fast . Entrepreneurship is at an all-time low , as you can see by this chart provided by Inc . <p> And you can see that the employment level for self-employed and unincorporated folks has also dropped : <p> Scared to take chances , many Americans are staying put , choosing not to pursue new careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIGURE <p> The truth is that the true GDP figure is much worse than -1% annualized . This is because the statistics do not adequately take into account monetary inflation . <p> Inflation is the increase in the money supply . An inflation in the money supply leads to an increase in prices . However , the US government likes to fallaciously state that their statistic , the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which is highly manipulated , is true inflation . <p> Currently the official CPI sits near 2% but if it were calculated solely the way it was calculated in the 1980s , before they learned to remove all of the inflation out of the CPI number , it is closer to 10% as shown here by this chart from ShadowStats . <p> This corresponds quite well with the actual true increase in the money supply itself which currently sits near 10% annualized as well . <p> Given that the CPI as it was calculated in the 1980s is near 10% and the true money supply growth is also currently near 10% we can confidently say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since the GDP figures are adjusted to the heavily manipulated CPI ( currently near 2% ) we can say that the GDP figures , when adjusted for true inflation , is approximately -9% annualized . <p> In other words , the US is already deep into a depression that will become known in the next few years as the Greatest Depression . <p> THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END <p> This is why , for us , watching the US today is like watching the Truman Show . The average person is told all manner of things that are incorrect , wrong and falacious via the media and the government and think it is real . <p> One day soon , though , like in the movie , your average person in the US is going to have their boat run up into the falsely erected walls and realize that everything they believed about the US economy was a lie . <p> By then the US economy will be a smoldering crater , the US dollar will have collapsed and capital and travel controls will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realize what is really going on should be moving to protect themselves from this inevitability as quickly as possible ( subscribe to The Dollar Vigilante newsletter to be kept abreast of how to do so ) .

@@99475264 @3675264/ <h> How Private Policing Trumps Government Law Enforcement <p> To see how the private sector outperforms public policing in the real world , just take a look at Detroit . <p> Yes , Detroit of all places . So ruined by government planning , Detroit is becoming a hotbed of spontaneous orderof the market stepping in to do what the government has never managed to do properly . Frustrated with the poor service from their tax-funded overseers , Detroit residents have turned to the private sector for security and protection , like the customer-satisfying efficiency of private protection as provided by Dale Brown and his organization , Threat Management Center . <p> Dale got his start in 1995 trying to help a Detroit community during a wave of home invasions and murders . What he found among the police force were complacent , uninterested officers . And why should n't they be uninterested in murderous home invasions ? They get paid no matter what and are more incentivized to write traffic tickets and terrorize people in their own homes for buying plants . Sure there were some officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale used to get his start . ( Click on the above video image to hear Dale tell his story . ) <p> Today , Threat Management Center has a client base of roughly 1000 private residences and 500 businesses . And TMC also provides free service to those who can not afford their prices . That free help is available because of the healthy profit margin left from providing excellent services to the bigger corporations . ( Ah , the evils of the for-profit world ) <p> The key to effective protection , says Dale , is love . Not guns , not violence , not laws . His employees have to love their customers . They have to care about their customers ' safety more than their own . They also have to be the kind of people who would rather not use violence first . This is the exact opposite of what the government advocates for its police officers . Government teaches police that their own safety is paramount , and in these late stages of the degenerate empire , local governments are also recruiting recent war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people whose land they occupy to keep them in line . <p> Dale 's protective services are fundamentally different from those of the government police not just because of his loving philosophy , however , but because of the source of his funding . Dale 's services are market-driven . If he does n't provide protection in the way his customers want , he will go out of business . This is not the kind of pressure the government 's tax-funded sentries have to worry about . So while " to serve and protect " may be emblazoned on their squad cars , their real purpose is to enforce brutally . Their actions are funded by money extorted from their victims . They only happen to protect now and thenand practically by accident . And note that it 's their employer the state which creates the poverty and prohibitions that result in crime in the first place . ( Government , after all , is like a self-licking ice cream cone ; it creates its own demand . ) <p> What Kind of Protection Do Customers Really Want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras and drones , and the general fear and loathing that comes from armed , violence-ready thugs with a sense of " authori-tah ! " marching through the streets . They simply want to feel safe , to have someone watching out for them , not spying on them , invading their homes and pushing them around . <p> But the state ca n't give people what they want . The state can only cartoonishly , violently approximate the market . This is because the state is based on violence , not the feedback of profit and loss . It can never beat or even match the market when it comes to satisfying consumer demand . The market is negotiation that responds to economic incentives while the state is just a blunt force weapon brought to the surgery room . Sure , its violence is dressed up as the " will of the people " with words like " democracy " and " republic " but in the end the state 's only will is its own . The market is the true will of the people . Providers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be out of business . The state has no such pressure . At most it has to worry about its image a little , sort of the way a serial killer has to worry about mimicking human emotion so his victims will let their guard down . <p> So while the market provides protection and peaceful resolution because those are what consumers really want the state can only provide a para-military praetorian guard with varying levels of officious aggressiveness . This guard is paid for with money stolen at gunpoint ( taxes ) and can only ever fundamentally violate property rights , not protect them . <p> The police are n't around to help recover your stolen property or protect you from harm . They are here to enforce the law . Even when they capture thieves and murderers and rapists , no resititution is made to the victim . Instead the violator is jailed for his trangressions in order to repay his debt the mythical collective called " society " . He may be sent to a rape camp that itself is paid for with stolen money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for the police . The majority of their resources are thrown at generating revenue by enforcing the freedom-limiting prohibitions that the politicians set up in the first place ( though the revenue generation is secondary to reminding you that you are state property conditionally allowed certain privileges that can be taken away ) . The cops ticket you for driving above absurdly low speed limits and for not wearing seatbelts and for driving after downing two beers . They invade your homes and rough you up on the mere suspicion that you might own plants that politicians do n't like . Is this what you would pay for if you had the choice ? <p> Oh , and if you really want to see the police marshall their resources , by all means organize a protest to exercise your right to free public speech . Do it in opposition to a politician or government policy . Then you 'll really get to see the kind of " protection " your stolen money pays for . <p> In a free market , people get what they want . What people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long . In a free market , producers respond to consumer demand . Or else those producers have to find another line of work . So that 's why Dale Brown 's Threat Management Center uses peaceful protection based on love and sacrifice . The consumers have spoken . Dale 's services are what they want , not bullies and war-scarred , testosterone junkies who enforce prohibtion , invade homes , harrass innocents , get off on exercising authority and occasionally shoot " civilians " but who fail to actually serve or protect them . <p> Editor 's Note : Look at the above video only if you have a strong stomach . It contains just some of the evidence of the kind of brutal police state into which the US is rapidly devolving . If you have the means to get out before the US becomes indistinguishable from the former East Germany including the use of deadly force against those who try to escape then start planning your permanent escape by clicking here . <p> Instead , consumers want people who will bravely protect them without policing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects and regulate their behavior according to some state-imposed policy . They want valiant guardians of their bodies and other property who respect their other rights of self-ownership . They want people who are also willing to put their customers ' safety above and beyond their own and who are willing to find the most peaceful and least violent solution possible to disputes and danger .

And , even if they wanted to adhere to all the rules under FATCA it is nearly impossible to understand and fraught with risk . <p> The lawyers in the Cayman Islands told me that company incorporation in the Cayman Islands is rock solid in terms of privacy and ease of setup ( we will have more on that to subscribers soon ) but the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an American is even involved , in any way , with a company that has a bank account in the Cayman Islands they will report all information on that account to the IRS . <p> I informed them of a few things . <p> First , any American with substantial assets should be running , not walking , to get a second passport to protect against all of the capital controls coming out against Americans . We have heard of some companies that have stopped working with Americans at all just because of the problems it causes them with their bank accounts . <p> Secondly , there are ways for Americans to have international structures and banking without falling under the FATCA legislation . We enlightened dozens of people recently at our Crisis Conference on how to do this .

Countless movements are ongoing in Russia , China , the Middle East and more all moving away from the dollar and the US banking system and this is exacerbated by FATCA . <p> If you were caught on your heels in the lead up to July 1 , 2014 , then do n't be in the lead up to the next FATCA deadline .

The Cheyenne , Wyoming Star-Tribune reported last week that state representatives advanced legislation to launch a study into what Wyoming should do in the event of a complete economic or political collapse of the United States . The task force would look at the feasibility of Wyoming issuing its own alternative currency ( OK , good so far ) , and " examine conditions under which Wyoming would need to implement its own military draft ( Really ? ) , raise a standing army ( to fend off looters from Idaho , no doubt ) , and acquire strike aircraft and ( wait for it ) an aircraft carrier " . <p> Now , folks , there are some pretty bizarre hypothetical scenarios where you could see , maybe , California thinking about buying an aircraft carrier , but one of the last states that needs one is Wyoming . I know Cheney is from Wyoming and all , but , its a land-locked Rocky Mountain state that does n't  even have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , one of the reasons the U.S. economy will eventually collapse is because they bought too many aircraft carriers and stuff like that , as opposed to letting people spend their money in more profitable ventures .

Lorraine Quarberg , R-Thermopolis , said . " To put your head in the sand and think that nothing bads going to happen , and that we have no obligation to the citizens of the state of Wyoming to at least have the discussion , is not healthy .

But rather than giving up altitude and maintaining airspeed until finding a level place to land , we are trying to maintain the illusion of level flight as long as possible , increasing the angle of attack of the wings , losing airspeed until we fall out of the sky like a rock . In prolonging the inevitable we have doomed ourselves and our progeny to a worse fate than otherwise required . Perhaps this was the plan from the beginning .

The next best advice I have is to get liquid , i.e. , liquidate your liabilities and convert a reasonable number of remaining assets to something both tangible and portable . As global economies are currently slowing and businesses closing in record numbers , there are reports of astronomical auction amounts for fine art , jewelry , rare collectibles , etc . They may not be the obvious choices of assets that will emerge with higher values on the other side of the hard reset , but they are a lot better than some .

@@99475273 @3675273/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Fascism For Dummies <p> Editors Note : The following article is from TDV Correspondent Pete Kofod . Petes bio appears at the end of the article <p> Here at TDV fascism is frequently referred to as the increasingly prevalent form of government in the West . We recognize that this conjures strong emotions and we often get a few angry emails voicing displeasure with our characterization of their homeland . We understand that the word fascism is an emotionally charged word and we do not use it lightly . <p> We recognize , however , that we have never taken the time to define it completely nor place it within the context of our communications ( although Jeff did compare the USA to the dictionary definition of " fascism " in " The Fasco-Communist Police State of America " ) . As such , we have fallen victim to one of our own cardinal sins ; letting somebody else control the thoughts by controlling the definition of the words used to define those thoughts . To make matters worse , by default , we have relegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most criminally complicit estates in our society , namely the educational system and mass media . It is time to address this oversight . <p> THE ETYMOLOGY OF " FASCISM " <p> The word fascism is rooted in the Latin word fasces , a Roman object made of wooden rods tightly bound by red , overlapping straps . At the top , or occasionally in the middle , of the fasces was an axe head . The bound wooden rods represented strength through unity and the axe represented the means by which authority was exerted by the unified entity . In addition to being used as a weapon by Roman authorities , the fasces was a key symbol on government buildings of the Roman empire . The symbolism of the fasces is significant . The wooden rod represents the weak individual whose sole contribution is to provide strength to the unified object , in this case the State . The axe head , unsurprisingly , represents the force with which the State will ensure its survival . <p> Fascism is referred to as an ideology with numerous characteristics , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , militarism , and state control of production . While those traits are almost universally present in fascist run societies , we take the position that fascism in , in fact , not an ideology at all . Merriam-Webster defines ideology as the " visionary theorizing of a systematic body of concepts especially about human life or culture . " <p> MussoliniWe contend that the objective of fascism is to ensure the survival and further the influence of the State . As Benito Mussolini famously stated , " Everything in the State , nothing outside the State , nothing against the State . " Fascism holds self-preservation of the State as the supreme objective , regardless of method . It is therefore difficult to envision fascism as an ideology any more than a pride of lions being governed by an ideology . Fascism is an observed organizational structure in which the State exerts unlimited and arbitrary power over all its subjects merely for its own survival . <p> THE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF FASCISM <p> While we contend that fascism is without principles , that is not to say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform of principles from which to rule , however , these characteristics represents processes and tools that empower the State apparatus . As times and conditions change , a fascist State will shift message , priorities and effort , all for the purpose of self-preservation . At times the State will appear pro-market , other times it will claim national exigencies demand that it assume control of production in the economy . Commonly observed traits , however , include : <p> Nominal or no limit on the power of the State . Whether explicit or de facto , when the State ceases to recognize limits on its authority , it is displaying a core characteristic of fascism . This is often seen in the broad powers that are granted to the law enforcement , military and the intelligence apparatus . As a related aside , a common observation in fascist regimes is that law enforcement and military cease to be viewed as members of the community in which they serve . Their encroaching and increasingly heavy handed tactics become the source of discontent among the people which in turn results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending on national defense . Regardless of the financial conditions of the State and its subjects , military spending is virtually unaffected by financial stress occurring in other segments of the economy . The State recognizes that political power is meaningless without the force to back it . Money goes to salaries , weapons , research and various military adventures . In Germany and Italy in the 1930s , significant production and economic benefit was bestowed upon the military and the military industry . This is still the case in some countries today . <p> Key segments of the economy are granted cartel status by the State . Industries including agriculture , health care , banking , energy and manufacturing find themselves submitting to the States plan for production or being run out of business . In a fascist regime , the State typically does not actually seek to run the enterprise , they merely dictate the conditions and stipulations under which producers must operate . <p> A final note on fascism . It is commonly held that fascism is a right-wing form of government . We hold that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless . North Korea and the former Soviet Union certainly can be characterized as fascist . The key characteristic is a high degree of force and deceit that the State deploys in self preservation . <p> This brief article is far from an exhaustive study on the matter of fascism . Lew Rockwell of the Mises Institute and Richard Maybury , author of the Uncle Eric series of books have dedicated many years of academic research to this topic . Much of what we have captured in this short primer is a result of their pioneering work .

In November 2010 , the remaining savings of 2.5bn was seized to support the bailout of the rest of the country . <p> In December , 2010 , Hungary told its citizens that they could either remit their private pension money to the state or lose their state pension funds ( but still have to pay for it nonetheless ) <p> In November , 2010 , the French parliament decided to earmark 33bn from the national reserve pension fund FRR to reduce the short-term pension scheme deficit . <p> In early January 2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's pension scheme in Bulgaria . They wanted to transfer $300 million , but were denied on their first attempt <p> And , of course , this spring , Cyprus took it a step further and outright confiscated up to 50% of the funds from bank account holders in that country . <p> Last week the Polish government announced it would transfer to the state ( aka. confiscate ) the bulk of assets owned by the country 's private pension funds ( many of them owned by such foreign firms as PIMCO parent Allianz , AXA , Generali , ING and Aviva ) , without offering any compensation . <p> BUT IT CA N'T HAPPEN HERE <p> Think again if you do n't think this will occur all across the Western world until The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) . <p> To begin , the Social Security ( or as I call it , the Socialist Insecurity ) program in the US is , by dictionary definition , a ponzi scheme . <p> According to Investopedia : " The Ponzi scheme generates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scam actually yields the promised returns to earlier investors , as long as there are more new investors . These schemes usually collapse on themselves when the new investments stop . " <p> In fact , Social Security is even worse than a ponzi scheme . At least with a ponzi scheme you have the choice whether or not to " invest " with someone like Robert Madoff . You are n't forced into it . <p> Plus , completely fraudulently , the US government shows all Social Security ( SS ) incoming funds as actual revenue and then immediately spends the money and gives an IOU ( unpayable , bankrupt US Treasuries ) in return to the SS system . Let me repeat that : they immediately spend the money and deposit an IOU into what is already a Ponzi scheme . And in past years Congress has held committees to consider nationalizing private pension funds , just as Poland did last week ( and held committees on doing it in 2010 ) . <p> What was the main reason that all these governments such as Ireland , Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen 's private wealth ? It was because their governments were too indebted vis-a-vis their economy and in order to continue operating ( and borrowing ) they reached out and just took their own citizens ' retirement savings and , in almost every case , mandated that the only assets they can hold is government debt ( which will collapse or pay 0-3% at a time when inflation often is running over 10% , meaning a net loss of 4-6%+ per year ) . <p> So , let 's take a look at the debt-to-GDP of all these countries and a few other Western countries . <p> As you can see , with the exclusion of France , all the other countries who have outright stolen private pension funds are all in less debt than the Western countries ( or those who have bought into Western-style Keynesian central banking democracies like Japan ) who have yet to do so . <p> Why ? It 's mostly because the larger Western countries have yet to lose the confidence of the market . While the smaller countries with tinier economies and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of the market first . <p> But , this is very rapidly changing . Here is the interest rate change of US government debt in the last few months ( yearly chart ) . <p> The interest rate has nearly doubled in the last four months . This will have massive repurcussions in all markets and it will also mean that as interest rates rise the US government will look more and more insolvent by the day . With $17 trillion in current debt ( not GAAP adjusted GAAP adjusted is over $85 trillion ) an interest rate of 10% will mean $1.7 trillion in interest payments alone . The total tax ( theft ) revenue base of the US was only $2.4 trillion in 2012 . If interest rates were to rise to 10% , that would mean over 70% of the taxation revenue of the US government would go to paying interest alone . <p> But , remember , $841 billion of that " revenue " was payments into the Social Security scheme . No company on Earth would include payments into an employee pension plan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US government was $2.4 trillion minus $841 billion in 2012 or approximately $1.55 billion . In other words , an interest rate nearing 10% would mean that every semi-legitimate cent of tax revenue for the US government , and more , would go to interest payments on the debt alone . <p> And so expect the US government and most if not all Western governments to do what has happened in places like Hungary , France , Cyprus , Poland and more attempt to stay alive a little while longer by taking the assets of their citizens . And tax-sheltered retirements will be the easiest pickings . <p> HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF <p> Since retirement/pension savings will be the easiest target , immediately divest yourself of as much of those assets as possible while they are still assets and internationalize them . Get as much outside of the country with the government that purports to own you and your assets as possible . I did that in 2008 in Canada and have never regretted it . <p> If you are not willing or able to cash in retirement/pension savings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , you can easily convert your IRA into a self-directed IRA for a few thousand dollars and then you are able to invest in almost any asset worldwide .

This is all predicted by the mysterious " timeline of catastrophe " that culminates in Jubilee Year 2016 . <p> " What is of the utmost importance , " Jeff says , " is that people realize that while Jubilee Year ends on October 1 , 2016 , its ramifications will reverberate before and after that end date . Well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ongoing disasters of Shemitah Trends carry over from 2015. - Its my belief these " jolts " will be of such power that they will destabilize the worlds sociopolitical and economic system , allowing bankers to suggest a much more consolidated , global environment . " <p> Jeff has now posted a Jubilee 2016 video online that you can see HERE , along with a followup White Paper HEREexplaining what people must do to secure themselves- in this most extraordinary and disastrous year . <p> Like Jeffs previous " viral " Shemitah video that ultimately reached over two million viewers , the current Jubilee video is on track to reach millions as well . The White Paper , meanwhile , is being accessed by all those who- want to give themselves and their families a better chance to survive and thrive in 2016 when so many others will be facing desperate times . <p> " Its my hope we reach millions more than we did with the Shemitah video , " Jeff says . " The stakes are critically- high and 2016 is actually a turning point in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global regime and theyll stop at nothing to get there . If they need a world war , theyll have that too . " <p> Jeff concludes : " The foundation is being laid in 2016 for a worldwide catastrophe and much of the ground work will be completed by October 1 , 2016. - In the best case , such- groundwork does not suggest an immediate catastrophe but a series of terrible jolts that give people a little more time to prepare . But no matter what , worse times are coming and well do our best to keep our blog readers- and newsletter subscribers informed . We understand the key to the timeline in ways that others do not .

@@99475287 @3675287/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> America : Rumors of Food Riots , Realities of War 28883 @qwx888883 <p> The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) spent $80M to fortify federal buildings in New York apparently in preparation for civil disturbances and possible food riots on November 1st . The DHS plans included armed private guards who would protect IRS and other buildings against attack by fellow Americans . <p> Other officials joined in ringing an alarm bell . Margarette Purvis , head of New York City 's Food Bank the largest one in the nation also suggested that food riots were likely to break out in NYC . In a well-timed interview with Salon ( 10/29/13 ) , Purvis hinted she might not even be averse to unrest . Salon reported , " Rather than ' trying to raise a dollar ' to avert disaster privately , she Purvis said , a solution will require Americans to ' raise their voices ' , because ' the avenue has to be activism ' . " <p> The proximate cause of the expected unrest was November 1st cuts to the food stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus bill . The New York Times estimated that benefits for a family of four will fall $36 a month ; for a single adult , it will fall $11 . The most current data available ( July ) indicates that nearly 48 million Americans are on food stamps , or approximately one-seventh of the population . More reductions are expected over coming months as a result of Congressional renegotiations on a farm bill . <p> It is difficult to know how seriously to take the fact that the term " food riots " has entered the vocabulary of the American media and its bureaucrats . Both parties have a vested interest in creating panics . The media wants ratings and government wants an excuse for more social control . But a few aspects of the food riot talk seem clear enough . <p> The government seems to have been shaken by a glitch that occurred last month , bringing down part of the Electronic Benefits Transfer System ( EBT ) ; the system enables electronic food stamps . When recipients were not allowed to ' purchase ' food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wal-Marts in Louisiana allowed purchases even though they could not verify the e-balance on the EBT cards , the stores were " legally looted " ; that is , people with next to no balance stripped them of hundreds of dollars in goods . One woman with a balance of .49 cents tried to ' buy ' $700 worth but was thwarted when EBT reconnected . <p> In short , a limited and temporary breakdown in EBT caused looting to break out and riots to be threatened . What would have emerged from a nationwide and permanent disruption ? <p> But the real danger is more likely to come from a government clamp down rather than from rioting . The cut backs have not been severe . Heritage Foundation policy analyst Rachel Sheffield explained that food stamps is " one of 80 federal means-tested programs that provide food , housing , medical care to poor and low income Americans . " And the government certainly continues to promote the program . An October 16th , 2013 Cato study entitled " The Food Stamp Program Needs Reform " found that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prospective recipients . <p> Nevertheless , the government is not likely to waste a good crisis . <p> After all , a government clamp down and huge growth of bureaucracy was what happened in the wake of the last food riots that haunted New York City in 1917 . In an interview with a Lower East Side housewife , the New York Times identified a main cause of the brewing trouble . Food for her family had risen from an average of $22 a month in 1916 ; the average monthly salary was reportedly $40 . By 1917 , the same food had risen to $59 . <p> To protest soaring prices , about 400 women stormed City Hall , with babies in arms . A mass meeting was held at the Socialist Party headquarters where the Mothers Anti-High Price League was formed . They immediately demanded the " city , state and national governments " provide $1M in tax dollars to establish municipal stores through which the government would buy food and distribute it at regulated prices ; another $1M was demanded for a public school lunch program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 New York Times article entitled " Food Seizure by Commissioner , Governors Plan , " described the protesters attacking food retailers and their customers . They invaded poultry markets and destroyed the chickens sold there . " Through Pitt , Ludlow , Rivington , Essex , Suffolk and all of the east side streets the crowd surged , " the article declared , " passing from one shop to another waving the heads and wings and mutilated bodies of chickens . " <p> As protests spread to several other cities , President Woodrow Wilson authorized an investigation into food prices . Ultimately , he launched a campaign against inflation , which was largely fueled by America 's entry into WWI on April 16th , 1917 . To fight inflation , Wilson created new government agencies with authority over prices and wages . For example , the Food Administration was established and empowered by the Lever Food Control Bill . The Bill placed fuel and food under federal regulation . In times of emergency , Wilson could exercise what his Congressional critics called " dictatorial powers . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their creation was greatly facilitated by the grassroots demand for cheap food and for a government rescue which had sparked spreading riots only months before . Wilson had not wasted a good crisis . <p> If I were a conspiracy advocate , I would suspect a crisis is being manufactured today for political advantage . The Obama administration has aggressively encouraged an unprecedented mass dependency of Americans on entitlements . If food stamps are drastically reduced due to actions in the House of Representatives , then food riots may well occur , especially if Democrats encourage " activism . " Then Obama could point a finger of blame at the Republicans and do so just months before the 2014 election . Obama could also justify a surge in the police state that he has nurtured so assiduously . <p> It is a tried and true statist sleight of hand ; government deliberately designs or co-opts a problem for which it masquerades as the remedy . And , as happened with Wilson , the tactic is often expediently associated with war . <p> Editor 's Endnote : Food riots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your television in a Latin American villa , not from your living room window in a US metropolitan area .

@@99475288 @3675288/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> For The Children : Save Yourself , Get Expelled <p> Editor 's Note : The following post is by TDV contributor , Justin O'Connell <p> Hi Kids , <p> Do you find yourself locked down at your local dangerous public school between the hours of 7am and 3pm five days a week ( six if you have Saturday school ) for nine months a year ( ten if you have Summer school ) ? Do you find it a waste of time ? Well , there 's no need to worry anymore , because The Dollar Vigilante is here to give you the lowdown on how to handle your plight . Be sure to share this information with a friend in the same situation ! <p> I was recently speaking with my twelve-year-old nephew . I asked him : <p> " What grade are you in ? " <p> " I am in sixth grade ? " <p> " Do you like it ? " <p> " Why would I ? " <p> Of course , I am proud of him for this answer as is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because by my public school-educated estimates , if he is currently in sixth grade , that means he has , like , six more grades to go until he is freed from the physical and mental confinement of public school . A lot of damage lies ahead for this fertile , active mind . So I wondered , what could TDV suggest to this kid ( and others like him ) to help ? I looked back on my elementary school , junior high and high school days and I thought to myself : If there is one thing I would do differently , what would it be ? <p> Would I a ) study more , b ) have more casual sex , c ) do everything in my power to undermine the authority of all the robotic and totalitarian teachers and administrators , as well as campus officers ? <p> Well , the answer is an undeniable " c . " ( Technically , I guess , " b " could fall under " c . " ) <p> So what does this choice entail ? Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USSA ? I figure that if I had to do it all over again , here is what I would do in certain situations . If you 're currently in school , you have a choice now : Every time a teacher disrespects you , treating you as a subhuman , you can either submit to their illegitimate violence-backed authority or you can develop your social skills . <p> here 's an example of how to do the latter : <p> I remember the first week of junior high when a kid took my hat off . I received detention for having my hat taken off . The Vice-Principal Nordquist took me by the arm and dragged me into the office . I was scared . She mustve loved it the power , the authority , the skin contact with a young life . Back then , I submitted , just hoping I would n't be seriously reprimanded with weeks of detention or something for nothing . <p> Kids , this is how this would go over for me knowing what I know now , and I urge you to consider standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So what if your high school grades wont get you into college ? Take the GED , go to community college , and then do whatever you want , whenever you want . Instead of ending up in debt and working for someone else , start a business . Use TDV Weekly to help with your investments . <p> 13 year-old me : " I will use whatever language I want this is n't church . Now I need to speak with your supervisor because you just grabbed me by the arm without my permission . Bad enough I am here against my will , forced to consume your sub-par services my parents are paying for at gunpoint . You need to let me speak to your supervisor and it needs to happen now or I will be calling my parents to tell them you 've assaulted me . Do I make my 13 year-old self perfectly clear ? " <p> My girlfriend 's sister recently received no credit on a very important five-page paper in her English class . She now risks failing and being held back . My girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same English class ) write the essay , and so the quality of both were about the same . But her sister received no credit ( F- ) because she had n't  accurately done one part of the essay , while her cousin received an A. The teacher told the sister that she received the grade she earned , an F , despite the fact that she spent hours doing the project . So the message is that all her work is rendered worthless ( Is n't the point of " grading " to measure the various degrees between perfection and getting everything wrong ? ) . <p> The sister and cousin have pointed out to us that the teacher makes quite a few grammatical and spelling errors on the board ( I , too , have witnessed many an English teacher who could not spell . With that said , there are many people who spell words differently , and I believe that if I understand what is being expressed , then that 's generally okay by me ) . But since the teacher is an unreasonable hag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are completely unacceptable . <p> Were it I in this situation , I would raise my hand in class <p> Me : " Teacher , teacher who the hell taught you how to write English and then made you a teacher ? " <p> Her : " Excuse me ? " <p> Me : " You suck at spelling and grammar and I am supposed to sit here and respect you and trust your judgment on the subject ? Give me back the time I 've wasted in this class . " <p> The moral of the story ? Be yourself in high school and do n't  bend over . If you are out on recess and a teacher asks you to hand over an iPod just because you were enjoying music during what should be your break , refuse to hand it over ; If a teacher insists that you raise your hand to go to the bathroom , do n't  just go . As TDV has expressed over and over again , public schools are nothing but concentration camps for you to waste your time and brain . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated high school : <p> Richard Branson ( Virgin ) With an estimated net worth of $4 billion , Richard left high school at age 16 to start an arts and cultural magazine called Student . <p> Eminem ( Rapper ) With a net worth over $300 million , Eminem once failed the ninth grade three times before dropping out . <p> Andrew Jackson ( President of the United States , picture on twenty dollar bill ) With little formal education , Andrew studied law in his late teens and became a lawyer . <p> Jack London American author <p> Ray Charles American musician <p> Dizzy Gillespie American musician <p> Peter Jennings US/Canadian journalist <p> Ansel Adams US nature photographer <p> Louis Armstrong American musician <p> Humphrey Bogart Actor <p> Rosa Parks Activist <p> 007 Superspy ( Neither Sean Connery nor Pierce Brosnan graduated ) <p> Charles Chaplin **30;578;TOOLONG <p> Thomas Haffa German self-made double digit billionaire <p> This list goes on and on and on .

We are just against anything that is accomplished by means of theft and violence , that is anything accomplished through the state and the political " process " . These things are not only inherently reprehensible . They are also inherently inefficient . Public school ( and private and even home school as they are highly regulated by the state ) provide very much the same useless programming for millions of very different individuals . It is like a classroom composed of hundreds of different kinds of animals who are all graded on their ability to climb . It 's the communist version of education . The market would produce hundreds , maybe thousands of ways to educate children just like it produces countless kinds of automobiles to fill consumer demand all of them better than the current prison model that takes 12 years to teach them what could be learned in two . <p> I admit to my shame that I have been seeing a public school teacher lately . I consider it a personal failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stolen loot , but it has given me a bit of confirmation about some of these crazy free market ideas of mine . She is actually the one who after fifteen years in the system brought up to me the idea of entrepreneurialism in the education market . " I would love to start my own school , " she said , " I know that all these kids have different needs , that the system is horribly flawed with its attempts to group and to standardize . <p> " But it would be too hard to get started and compete " And here I launched into an explanation of how government is either a monopoly in certain markets itself ( education , money , policing ) or supports a near monopoly with its favored players ( just about every other industry ) . Sadly she fell back on her statist training and said that public schools just need even more money to cater to the kids better . <p> You and I understand that would just be tossing good money after bad , akin to putting young minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning how to be productive or entrepreneurial . <p> Our advice : do n't spend a dime more on school for yourself or your children than you are already forced to by the state . Learn how to make money instead . Figure out how to turn your and your children 's talents and interests into a means of support and wealth accumulation .

One- reason this statistic is so important is because it is the Feds- main tool for manipulating the overnight bank and formal lending rates . It does n't  simply decree the rate of interest . <p> It is also important because it is the reason we have unsound booms i.e. , we have " bubbles .

The interest rate suppression did not stimulate anything but consumption , and it did this by trickery and deceit so that the increase in consumption came at the expense of- lasting wealth . <p> The economy is n't suddenly going to grow , as Wall Street expects .

I 'm not planning for now , I 'm trying to learn to live without fear and take everything as it comes without controlling . But I 'm trying to live a healthy life as well , I swim in the mornings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sun , there are plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables available here . I have plenty of time to just reflect and connect with myself and the nature without stress . I 'm just enjoying my life 100% , its not like I 'm escaping from something . <p> Adil : I know , not running from something awful , but running towards something beautiful . <p> Lina : Exactly . <p> Adil : Did people warn you against going to South America ? Of course that 's just silly , people keep falling for all the hype in TV <p> Lina : A lot of people ! They kept saying : " Why are you going there by yourself ? " " Are you crazy ? " , " Its so dangerous to travel in South America by yourself as a woman ! " But you have to take some risks in life to find amazing things , because if you keep being afraid of everything , you lose your life . But of course , I 'm not walking around by myself at night either . <p> Adil : Lina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And what things do you especially like about living here ? <p> Lina : I love it ! And its a lot of things , you meet a lot of wonderful people from here and all over the world . You learn a lot all the time , both about yourself and the rest of the world . And there 's the lifestyle , the contrast with Europe is that we focus on problems instead of what we have , people should be more grateful . Being rich is n't only about money . <p> Adil : Haha , in fact they say that travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer . <p> Lina : Its true , the main reason I did n't  do this trip before , is that I thought I did n't  have either time nor money , so I took the time and pretended I had the money . <p> Scary as hell , but a very nice feeling when you take the last steps into your dream ! <p> Adil : Awesome , it seems to be working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could n't keep waiting the rest of my life . Sometimes you have to create and take the opportunities instead of waiting for them . <p> Adil : So I 'm guessing you 're not a big fan of the always popular : " This is how you should live your life ! " The M.O gives it away : One-size-fits-all . <p> Lina : I do n't  like it of course , but also it 's important to understand that this is my dream and truth . If some other people want to live their life in another way and then they should do that . I do n't  like when people are trying to convince me or other people to live exactly the same life they live . We are all different . But unfortunately a lot of people are stuck in what society wants from them in my opinion . I 'm soon turning 36 years old , and I guess that some people think that you should focus on your career and have a family , a nice house and that kind of stuff at my age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and do it , you do n't  need to wait for the approval of other people . You just do it . When I left my last job , I did n't  even have another job lined up . If you want something in life , you must take action . When you just go and do it , you feel satisfaction , it gives you a lot of good energy . And I really believe that if you follow your heart and dreams everything will always be solved at the end . <p> Adil : Its true , good energy . When you 're succeeding you feel that energy around you , you create the momentum , its something beautiful , but if you never take the first step , you never get there , but that 's what makes you different Lina , you have n't choked and gotten paralysed by worrying about not having time nor money , you just went and achieved what you desired . <p> Lina : Instead of seeing it as a problem , I see it as a challenge . Its not always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best challenge ever ! <p> Adil : Your original plan was to visit just for time first , right ? <p> Lina : My first plan was to stay in Peru three and half weeks . Thats four month ago . And as I 'm freelancing I did n't  have to go back to any work in Sweden . <p> Adil : And you have been here so long ! John Lennon said once : " Life is what happens to you while you 're busy making other plans . " <p> Lina : Suddenly , it became the best feeling for me , when you never knowwhat 's nextNow I do n't  plan too much , before I used to want to know everything about everything . I think I was trying too much . Sometimes you just have to relax and open your eyes . You miss a lot of stuff when you are too focused on a certain goal in your life . You have to be open and understand that sometimes life has better plans for you you ca n't imagine . <p> Adil : What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they never take steps to protect themselves when the economy is crashing for example , all they want to do is know everything , making small plans about every insignificant little thing , sucking out the spontaneity from every aspect of life , and spending their entire lives in worry . Sometimes I think that people have everything backwards . Life should be backwards . <p> Lina : Its like what you told me yesterday , life should be backwards . <p> Adil : That was the genius George Carlin , actually . <p> Adil : Talking about Sweden , well this is not only about Sweden , people everywhere seem to not take risks anymore , as it was n't part of life anymore ! We fall , we stand up , we try to learn from it sometimes , and we try to surround ourselves with beauty , these things are part of life in my book . <p> The other day I was having dinner with a Swedish girl , and she told me that nobody has ever walked up to her in the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner , ever ! She was very attractive , so I was surprised , and I asked her why not , and she said that in Sweden people just become boyfriends and girlfriends after they meet in some friends party , or after they meet through someone , that generally very few people take the first step and engage the other person , she told me that very few couples meet in the supermarket for example . <p> Lina : Its all about the fears again . When you 're afraid of rejection and too afraid to fail , it 's often easy to forget that failure is part of life . <p> Adil : I never understood that fear of failure thing , like that girl ? Go and ask her out , maybe she 'll say no , maybe shell accept , but if you sit in a corner afraid of rejection , the only thing you 've done is ensuring that the answer is inevitably a " NO " . <p> They say there 's a thin line between : " Shit , I shouldve talked to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Same with everything in life , if you take a chance and try , maybe it works out , maybe it does n't  , but if you do n't  try because you 're afraid to fail , well , how can you expect to get anywhere ? <p> Lina : MSnniskor ( Swedish word for people ) generally are driven by fear of failure instead of desire to succeed , which gives a lot of energy . <p> Adil : I agree , its funny that you bring energies up , they say there are two types of people , those who are driven by fear , and those who are driven by passion and love , and generally fear is represented by dark and love by light , immediately it becomes clear that you can take a small candle to a dark room , and it brightens the whole place , but what you cant do is to take a container of darkness to a big park in a sunny day , and expect it to darken up the whole place . Anyways , I 'm digressing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned since you took this adventure and came to South America ? <p> Lina : That the biggest failure is not to not do what you want because you 're too afraid to fail . <p> Adil Elias is The Dollar Vigilantes Rio de Janeiro group moderator and TDV Latin America ( TDVLA ) Editor ( email protected ) .

The fundamentals for gold ownership have not changed and remain as strong as ever , and that 's why our special report Getting Your Gold Out Of Dodge ( GYGOOD ) comes highly recommended . Over two years ago , I started researching and writing this report with The Dollar Vigilante team . It is a complete compendium on how to internationalize your precious metal 's holdings and move them out of the western financial system . <p> The reasons are clear on why we encourage moving your gold out of the financial system . There is a high degree of risk that desperate governments will take what they can , whenever they can , because THEY CAN . <p> The highest risk to your gold holdings is not so much the price of gold but making sure it can not be easily confiscated and taken from you like money in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for money held in banks to be bailed in the next time the banking system goes into meltdown mode . But there is a new threat to your money held at banks and it comes from your very own government regardless of another financial meltdown . <p> As governments around the world become more desperate for higher tax revenues , they will empower themselves and increase their ability to confiscate your assets if they deem it necessary to do so , this includes money held in your bank account . <p> For example last week in the UK , the Commons Treasury committee raised concerns about the potential powers that could be given to HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) to confiscate cash from bank accounts without a court order . MPs warned that innocent people face having money taken from their bank accounts by the taxman . <p> The committee recognizes the fact that there could be an " abuse " of power and that taxpayers could suffer " serious detriment " for no wrong doing if officials are able to take money directly from bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove money from your bank account when a person has failed to act on four formal warnings requiring payment and only after gaining permission from a magistrate or judge . The concerns revolve around how taxes are calculated and the security of the information gathered . Andrew Tyrie , who is the Conservative chairman of the Treasury committee does n't  even trust the tax officials to be accurate . " People should pay the right amount of tax . But HMRC does not always ask for the right amount , " Mr Tyrie said . <p> MPs who are reviewing the latest budget report say : " The ability directly to have access to millions of taxpayers bank accounts raises concerns about the risk of fraud and error . " <p> " This policy is highly dependent on HMRCs ability accurately to determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe , an ability not always demonstrated in the past .

When the government runs low on funds , which is a mathematical certainty , it will take the low hanging fruit of money held in bank accounts . Of course the justification for these changes is to get HMRC in line with other government agencies to access money held at the bank for people who have funds available and are not current with tax payments . <p> We see this as a growing trend , where desperate federal tax departments will be given carte blanche to access and take your money with very little recourse if you are deemed to owe them money . Of course once the precedence is set by one govt agency , then the potential exists for these powers to be extended to all government agencies in the future . <p> The good news is that people still have the option to store financial assets like gold outside the banking system which is not easily accessible by government officials as they get more desperate in the coming years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously buy precious metals and store them safely away and out of the reach from easy confiscation .

Casey <p> " I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold . " Richard M. Nixon , August 15 , 1971 <p> In the spirit of commemoration , we can not allow the 42nd anniversary of Nixons speech go without comment . Addressing the nation to " outline a new economic policy " , he failed to disappoint : wage and price controls were instituted , the automobile industry was browbeaten into reducing prices , and a 10% tariff was assessed on all imports . All this before Nixon announced his grandest exploit the termination of US commitments to exchange gold for dollars with foreign governments . <p> Previously , the Federal Reserves ability to issue new money was limited by the threat of depleting the governments gold reserves . Printing too many dollars led foreign governments to start favoring gold over holding depreciating US dollars . Nixons actions ( which proved not to be temporary ) ended the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unchecked printing of money , and effectively ended the worlds currency system ( known as Bretton Woods ) in place since World War II . <p> Whether Nixon was sincere in his belief that these actions would truly , to use his terms , " nurture and stimulate " the economy or if perchance he knew better and deceived the American people , we have no comment . We reserve our commentary not to purpose , but to effect . <p> And the effect was an unmitigated disaster . Nixon promised Americans that any talk of inflation with an unconstrained Federal Reserve was a " bugaboo " and that his actions would actually " stabilize the dollar . " ( If you wish to listen to Nixon in his own words , the latter part of his speech can be viewed here ) . According to him , the risk of Americans paying higher prices was extremely limited : <p> " If you want to buy a foreign car or take a trip abroad , market conditions may cause your dollar to buy slightly less . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products in America , your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today . " <p> Despite these assurances , inflation became a hallmark of the 1970s as the unimpeded Federal Reserve zealously increased the money supply . The year 1973 experienced inflation of 9% , 1974 brought 12% , and the decade was closed out with a peak inflation rate of 14% in 1979 . Since the date of Nixons speech , the dollar has lost 83% of its value . One dollar then is worth 17 cents today . What will it be worth tomorrow ? <p> We can not say with certainty , for while the creation of money causes inflation , the effect does not correspond fully in magnitude . Nor is it immediate . In fact , the lag between the expansion of the money supply and the onset of inflation could be years . If so , what expectations are reasonable based upon the Federal Reserves actions since 2008 ? The scary answer can be found in this chart depicting US monetary growth . <p> Editor 's Note : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty quickly and they would n't stand for it .

Society is impoverished and life rendered less remarkable with every single departure because society is only the sum total of the individuals who comprise it . <p> America is actively punishing the best and brightest , the most productive and passionate in a drive for a vicious egalitarianism . Consider the situation at University of WisconsinMadison where a new vista of affirmative action is being opened . A July 18 headline in the National Review read , " University of Wisconsin Faculty Votes to Apportion Grades by Race . " <p> The article explains , " Earlier this year , the University of WisconsinMadison faculty senate adopted a new " Framework for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence . " One of the policies is a cry for " representational equity . " The term is defined as " proportional participation of historically underrepresented racial-ethnic groups at all levels of an institution , including high status special programs , high-demand majors , and in the distribution of grades . " <p> Awards for participation : a newer American phenomenon . <p> On July 16 , The Pope Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ran an article by UW Madison professor W. Lee Hansen .

It is also likely to trigger a new outbreak of grade inflation , as professors find out that they can avoid trouble over ' inequitable ' grade distributions by giving every student a high grade . " <p> Hansen also commented on the policy 's call for " proportional representationin high demand majors , " such as computer engineering . <p> " The obsession with all those non-academic details about students comes with a costthe cost of good students who are not admitted because they do n't  seem ' diverse ' enough .

A constant complaint of employers is that degree-holding job applicants can not spell , compose a grammatical sentence or perform their job descriptions at a basic level . Many financial advisers now say that avoiding a college education is a better path to success . How did America get to the point where it is discriminating against excellence because it is excellence ? <p> Affirmative action is one of the key social programs responsible for higher education being decoupled from success in life . From its early roots as an attempt to impose non-discrimination , it has morphed into " diversity programs " which mandate discrimination in favor of certain racial groups and of low achievers . <p> The process started in March 1961 , when President Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925 . It required government contractors to " take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed based on race . ( Of course , it should be not distributed or collected at all . ) But almost immediately in the same year as the executive order ' civil rights ' and black rights organizations cried out for discrimination rather than its absence . For example , a National Urban League official told a congressional committee that " being colorblind " was not enough or even a virtue . " What we need to be is positively color-conscious . " <p> From an equality of opportunity ( albeit , and alas , a government enforced one ) , affirmative action hit the fast-track to social engineering in order to achieve an equality of results . The absence of equal results would soon be viewed as prima facie evidence of discrimination in employment , education , housing , credit across the social and economic board . <p> On August 28 , 1963 , Martin @ @ @ @ " He advocated a meritocracy because he knew it would be the most just society in which his children could live and grow . <p> Meritocracy : the concept is now as anathema as cannibalism and often for similar reasons . People equate it with elites who feast off power and privilege while the worker ants live in squalor and labor . But by meritocracy , I mean a society in which people advance based on their own efforts ; where children are judged by their character and their achievements . <p> The key difference between the two views of meritocracy is one question . How did any single individual acquire the advantages of wealth and status he enjoys ? Market meritocracy refers to advantages that are justly earned on the free market or are gifts from others who justly earned them . It refers to people who rise because they are skilled and diligent about providing services and goods that others want ; such people enrich society . By contrast , coerced meritocracy comes from using force or fraud especially through political connections and legal privileges . These elites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do ; they gulp down taxes and divert private sector wealth into scams like monopolies ; such people impoverish society . <p> America has moved from being a largely market meritocracy to being a coerced one .

They distract attention from their own stolen wealth and power by pointing a finger and shouting at the private sector . While she cried out at companies who evade their taxes , earlier this year Hillary Clinton publicly claimed she was " dead broke . " Meanwhile , Bloomberg ( July 21 ) pointed out , " Hillary Clinton has earned at least $12 million in 16 months since leaving the State Department , a windfall at odds with her partys call to shrink the gap between the rich and the poor .

@@99475309 @3675309/ <h> Jeff Berwick Announces Candidacy For Upcoming Canadian Election <p> Well , here is something you probably never expected . - After more than half a decade here railing against the evils of government I am , as of today , announcing that I am running for government ! <p> Explain this shit , you might be saying ! <p> EXPLAINING THIS SHIT <p> In the last five years I have been here at The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) trying to help people with information , advice , analysis and services to help free themselves from government and the ravages of the central banks . <p> During that time I have also conducted more than 200 interviews on Anarchast with anarcho-capitalists ( ancaps ) around the world on the topic of how to reduce or remove government completely from our lives . - It has been a learning experience the entire time . - And , what I have learned is that just ignoring the government will not result in it reducing in size or disappearing entirely ( unless the great majority of the public decided to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . - As I believe someone once said , you can ignore politics but politics wont ignore you . <p> In recent months I have been convinced by a number of anarcho-capitalists that an excellent , and unused way by most libertarians , to affect government , and more importantly to educate the public on liberty , is to get involved in the system itself . <p> It began in April when I interviewed Judge Andrew Napolitano and he convinced me that Rand Paul was a true libertarian and should be supported . That thought simmered until- I interviewed Mr. Libertarian , Walter Block , and the idea came up that all of us anarcho-capitalists should run under the Libertarian Party banner in Canada for the upcoming Canadian federal election . - Soon after that I interviewed Darryl Perry , an ancap running for President of the US in 2016 and he most eloquently stated all the reasons why we should get involved in the political system . - He countered every argument as to why trying to ignore the system is n't helping our cause and why getting involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The most prime example being how Ron Paul ran for President and it created millions of libertarians in a matter of a few years in the US . <p> At that point I was sold on the idea and very quickly I picked up the Skype to the leader of the Libertarian Party of Canada , Tim Moen , who is also an anarcho-capitalist ( and past Anarchast guest ) , and the deal was sealed . <p> Tim Moen , who I call the " Ron Paul of Canada " , joined me on todays episode of Anarchast to talk about why this is important . <p> The history of the Libertarian Party of Canada is an interesting one . - Founded in the 1960s , the founder , Sieg Pedde , is an anarchist , a past Anarchast guest and even attended and spoke at Anarchapulco this year . - And the prior leader of the Libertarian Party was Katrina Chowne , a past Anarchast guest and also an anarcho-capitalist. - In this sense the Libertarian Party of Canada could just as easily be called the Anarcho-Capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up in the Great White North . - My goal will be to bring as much attention as possible to the Libertarian Party in Canada and its platform ( which you can see here ) . - Now , you may say , part of the platform is to reduce taxes to 15% and that number should be 0% . - I agree with you , of course , but I also know that trying to effect any change is going to have to happen in increments and I support any and all reductions in the size of government . - In the Libertarian Partys platform , every stance is one of reducing government and I support that . <p> Call me a wild eyed dreamer but I actually think the Libertarian Party of Canada can come out of nowhere and win the upcoming election in October ( watch the video above with Tim Moen for all my reasoning on this ) . - But it is going to take a massive effort from all ancaps and libertarians to get out there and make it happen . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known Canadians to also run for the Libertarian Party in the upcoming election : <p> Stefan Molyneux of the 50 million+ Youtube- views , Freedomain Radio . - Stefan is possibly the most well known anarcho-capitalist celebritarian , a past two-time Anarchast guest and a widely passionate and engaged audience that would knock on doors across Canada stumping for the Libertarian Party if Stefan would get involved . <p> James Corbett of the 25 million+ Youtube views , Corbett Report . - James is an anarcho-capitalist , former Anarchast guest and speaker at Anarchapulco and has a massive worldwide following that he can use to promote liberty in Canada . <p> Walter Block , Mr. Libertarian. - Walter is an icon in the libertarian community worldwide and him running for government would create waves throughout the libertarian community and congele a movement . - Plus , he is the one who convinced me that we should all run for election and so he must follow through on this thought . - He has issues with residency ( as he lives in the US ) , as does James Corbett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residency issue and I will share with them and any others who care to know . <p> Wendy McElroy , another icon in the liberty movement . - Wendy is quite possibly the most influential woman in the liberty movement and has been so for decades . - She is a contributor here at TDV , an anarcho-capitalist , a past Anarchast guest and , as with Walter Block , would set off shockwaves in the libertarian community by running . <p> Dan Dicks of the 6 million+ YT views , Press for Truth . - Dan is , what I call , the Luke Rudkowski of Canada . - Press For Truth is very well known and followed in Canada for its investigative reporting and exposing of governmental crimes . - Dan is also an anarcho-capitalist , past Anarchast guest and speaker at Anarchapulco . <p> Redmond Weissenberger , founder of the Mises Institute of Canada . - Redmond has been a leader in bringing free market , Austrian economics thinking , to Canada . - He also is the Managing Editor of TDV and one of the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing that all of these people have in common . - They are all incredibly smart , knowledgeable , well spoken and many have large audiences . - The chances of any of them being involved in a debate with an opposing statist politician and losing is approximately 0.000%. - Its actually impossible . <p> Imagine Stefan Molyneux in the mainstream media in Canada talking about libertarianism and destroying his competition in debates . - Imagine all the other libertarian greats from Canada doing the same thing across the country . - Imagine the Libertarian Party going from almost not existing to all of a sudden having a candidate on the ticket in all 300+ ridings across Canada and the media having to cover this new uprising . - Imagine the Libertarian Party getting not only its first candidate elected but dozens , if not hundreds and how the world will take notice . - Imagine watching a live stream from Parliament where Tim Moen , Stefan Molyneux , James Corbett , Walter Block , Wendy McElroy , Dan Dicks , Redmond Weissenberger , myself and countless other philosophically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament look like buffoons on a regular basis . <p> Imagine that this creates such a chain reaction that the Libertarian , or Anarcho-Capitalist , Party of Canada wins a landslide election and anarcho-capitalist , Tim Moen is Prime Sinister but does n't  actually sin by actively reducing the initiation of violence as far as he possibly can under the restraints of the public who will , as this happens , all become libertarian . <p> What happens then ? - I do n't  know but it ca n't be bad for humanity ! - The worst case scenario is that the Canadian public becomes awakened to the views of libertarianism and , much like Ron Paul effected , creates millions of new libertarians in the process . <p> For this reason I am going to wade into the raunchy quagmire of the political system and try to slay the beast of government from the inside . - I see no harm in doing so and nothing but good effects can come from it . - And , in the most desirable of circumstances , it changes the world , forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous world than we have ever known . <p> I like those odds . - No risk , all reward . <p> The " reward " part is dependent on you , however . - It is , as always , up to you if you are going to take action to attempt to improve the world . - Inaction has never been shown to improve anything . - And , if you are not going to take action please limit your castigation of those doing and acting to a minimum and stay out of the way of those of us who are going to effect positive change by any means . <p> If you do wish to play a role here are the key ways in which to do so : <p> Run for election . - This is obviously for Canadians only , in this context of this upcoming election . - The Libertarian Party of Canada has over 50 candidates already nominated but that leaves 250+ others to be filled . - If you are Canadian and believe in the tenets of freedom then please enter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . - It is simple and easy . - You can enter your intention to run on this page in a matter of minutes and help fill out the ballot across Canada which will be sure to garner a massive amount of attention to this libertarian movement rising . - If you are not Canadian then look to coalesce a similar movement in whichever tax farm you are bound to . <p> Donate . - If I understand the Canadian laws on political party contributions only Canadians can contribute to the Libertarian Party ( LP ) of Canada . - But , if you are Canadian , understand that the opposition has literally millions of dollars in donations to work with and the Libertarian Party , currently , has almost nothing . - If you 'd like to support this cause then you can donate directly to the LP ( donate here ) it would be greatly appreciated . - Even the leader of the LP , Tim Moen , quit his job to focus on this fulltime and gets almost nothing monetarily in return for his efforts . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own weight . - In my instance , for example , I do not intend to accept donations for my candidacy ( ever hear of a political candidate say that before ? ) and intend to fund it fully myself . - However , the LP can use any and all funds it can get to further the cause of liberty in Canada . <p> Support . - If you are n't  Canadian , cant run and cant donate you can still help . - Just support in any way you can via likes , shares , subscribes of any libertarian related content that many of us will be putting out in the ensuing months . - Just little things such as " liking " my Facebook page specially set-up for this election ( click here to like ) can help . <p> You will be hearing a lot more on this in the coming weeks and months including a planned " Liberty Bus/Train " cross-Canada tour and other events . <p> I wo n't stop trying every angle possible to awaken the public to the beauty of liberty and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create change . <p> If you love liberty , ask yourself , " What am I doing to create the kind of world I 'd like to live in ? " - If the answer comes back blank then look to get involved in any way you can , wherever you are , to spread the message of liberty . <p> Do what you may feel you have to do , Jeff . But keep this in mind ; the political machinery has as one of its primary goals the ensuring of its own survival as a whole , and therefore the individual players are all subject to being sacrificed on its altar . This is why I am totally apolitical and stand for a VERY strict merit-based system being used to staff all government jobs , from dog catcher all the way down to PM , President , High Chancellor , whatever you want to call it . No government job should be occupied for more than five years , no more than 20 years total service , no lavish pay grades or life time benefits , no free travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be filled by a lottery style drawing in at least two stages , so there is little room if any to rig the system . Everyone who wants a government job must first PROVE that they are fully capable of doing that job under both good and bad conditions , just like when you try for a job in the private sector . I went through some rigorous testing ( seven tests in total ) before I got my job with SoCalEdison in 1984 . And that was just to work in the garage department ! Why should it be any less for a job that is much more important to a society ? Being in a societal leadership position means LOTS more responsibility than the average man or woman will ever see otherwise . Does n't  running a nation take a lot more intelligence than changing tires and fixing trucks does ? Politics is generally made up of people who want to control other people as much as possible , and by whatever means necessary . If you are getting into politics only to raise awareness of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck with that . But when the fiat paper currency financial system falls on its collectivist head , the political " leadership " that we have now will all go by the wayside . And that day is fast approaching us all . The clues are all around with all of these capital controls going in and preparations for massive social unrest . It is now even admitted that this is what is expected to happen ! <p> Randy <p> Samarami <p> Libertarian Party is an oxymoron . If it walks , talks , waddles , quacks , and is odoriferous like a " Party " ( capital " P " ) it is NOT libertarian ( lower-case " l " ) . Sam <p> I started with " Challenge Authority " a long time ago , before I found voluntaryist.com . Next , I started encouraging people to distinguish between " Coercive Authority " and " Persuasive Authority . " Nowadays , I 've refined this to : " Authority is Good , but Coercion Perverts it . " I have n't been able to simplify it much beyond that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my authority ! " is a good one to throw around . <p> The proper occasion to admonish someone not to pervert authority is when they suggest any kind of state involvement in anything . If they do n't  ignore you , theyll probably ask what you mean . Then the door is open . If it is n't relatively immediately obvious to you how coercion perverts authority , please ask , or check out LONG ... <p> Thanks to Marshall McLuhan for pointing out that art tries to have an effect by trapping you . It presents something ( the trap ) that holds your attention long enough for the rest of its presentation to change you ( the effect ) . He uses this description not as a " feature " of art , but as its essence , so that , for example , advertising is an art ( trying to effect purchases ) . <p> Bryan HM <p> Good luck sir . Hope you stock up on coffee and whatever else for your media appearances . Is this the result of your ayuhausca trip ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible yourself before going after the system , but perhaps youve already done that having moved to Mexico . The political system is not something I would associate with before first firmly establishing my own freedom . Good luck ! <p> Matthew Shaw <p> A couple of days ago , a friend texted me and said , " Did you hear Jeff Berwick is running for the Libertarian Party of Canada ? " I immediately texted back , saying , " I highly doubt that " . Much to my surprise , my friend was correct . Upon learning this , I felt kind of like I had when I learned that Rand Paul had endorsed Mitt Romney . However , after listening to what Jeff had to say and listening to Tim Moen , I became convinced that simply haranguing against the evils of statism was n't enough . I was inspired to join the party and submit my application to run for the Libertarian Party of Canada in the next election . <p> Well , first of all , good luck on your attempt to gain office . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no libertarian . Any person who thinks Ed Snowden belongs in jail is not a libertarian . <p> Have fun . <p> Nate <p> You wade right into that raunchy quagmire , Jeff . Just remember to take a good bath afterwards . Ron Paul actually woke me up , so who knows . Maybe some good will come it . I have a whole bunch of family up in Quebec that might be supportive . They 're basically farmers who want to live off the land and be left alone . My mother-in-law is a French separatist and mayor of a little town outside Quebec city called St. Agapit . People like that might support you if you framed the message right . <p> But in general , talking to people about politics is just so depressing . Like with this tournament for Micon . I ask people why they think he should be thrown in jail . The answer I always get is : " because he broke the law . " Its just so discouraging . Most guys seem to have no moral compass whatsoever . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me want to flee into the countryside and hole up with my shotgun against the predatory zombie statist hordes . <p> But as you say , I do n't  see much downside to it . So here 's a hardball question : you support any and all reductions in the size of government , yes ? So what about your own salary if you win ? <p> Best of luck <p> Jeff goes to jail <p> Tick tock Jeffery David Berwick your time is coming and we cant wait . The countdown begins

Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice , emphasizing political freedom , voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment . <p> The word " libertarian " was mostly an unknown word even a decade ago . A small but passionate group of individuals kept the meaning of the word and the philosophy behind it alive . Then came Ron Paul first in 2008 and then even stronger in 2012 to spread the message of liberty a word and philosophy mostly forgotten in the US for decades . <p> And then , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally started to become understood for what it meant a philosophy of not wanting others to violently rule over you and not wanting to violently rule over others when Ron Paul was asked about whether anarchy was a good thing . He responded , " I think this is a great idea ! " <p> On Fox News , one of the anchors even proudly proclaimed he was an anarcho-capitalist . <p> The modern libertarians are being boistered by a constantly growing segment of the youth who , for whatever reason , have rationally looked around , seen the system does n't work and is inherently flawed , and are building an entirely new decentralized , peaceful and voluntary world without permission ! <p> Now a growing group of people , worldwide , are rethinking and reinventing everything . From money , like bitcoin and a plethora of cryptocurrencies , to decentralized platforms that look set to create a secure new internet and completely negate the need for a centralized legal system to new ways of parenting and education outside of the boundaries of strict government schools to 3-D printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing model obsolete . " <p> And with Austrian economics groundings and a deep understanding of the power for humanity of libertarian philosophies put into action many are creating a New World Order . But this was n't the one George H.W. Bush expected nor can he stop it . <p> And so , now is the time to create an event where many of the world 's best and brightest in the libertarian movement can meet , exchange ideas and have a lot of fun and outside of the Empire a sort of anti-Bilderberg . A place where , out in the open , world non-domination plans to free the human race from their chains can coalesce . <p> It mostly started as an idea years ago . After going to many freedom related conferences in the US I would constantly ask , " Why would you have a freedom conference in one of the least free places on Earth ? " <p> And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to live in Acapulco ? " I decided the time was right to hold a festival/conference on the beach in one of the most beautiful bays in the world and in late February , no less , at a time when much of the world will be experiencing the effects of Al Gore 's " Global Warming " which has seen record cold temperatures and the largest amount of icepack in Antarctica right now since modern records have been kept . <p> I am thrilled to officially announce Anarchapulco today . You 'll be hearing a lot more about it so I wo n't go into too much detail right now . But here are just a few of the highlights : <p> Rethink Conferences . Anarchapulco will be held from February 27th to March 1st , 2015 . There will also be numerous add-on workshops in the days prior to the official opening of the conference . As well , it will also have true libertarian musical acts in the evenings poolside on the beach including Rob Hustle of " Call the Cops " in a 24/7 city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions on any substances for personal use and is known worldwide for its nightlife . <p> Rethink Entrepreneurialism . The leading-edge entrepreneur cultivation group , Exosphere , will be having a two day boot camp called Exobase on February 24th and 25th at Anarchapulco . Exobase is an intensive 2-day introspective journey about your life , options , and calling , while providing a set of practical philosophies and tools to navigate your path as you take your next steps . In short , if you want to learn some of the most important skills in starting up successful businesses in just two days what you would likely not even learn in business college in two years this is where you start . <p> Rethink Parenting and Education . Most libertarians , given any choice whatsoever , would n't send their kids to government public schools to be vaccinated , forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and risk their 5 year old child being forced to sign a no-kill/no-suicide contract if the child even makes a gun shape with her crayon and says " pew pew " . Homeschooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unschooling , Dayna Martin , takes it one big step further . Dayna has been inspiring others for over a decade by sharing her experience through natural birth , attachment parenting and Unschooling . She is an activist , educator and author of , " Radical Unschooling : A Revolution Has Begun " , and her newest book , " Sexy Birth " . This has allowed thousands of other parents to learn about Unschooling and to proudly live their lives without fear . She 's been all over the media including Dr. Phil , CNN , Nightline , Australias most popular morning news program , The Jeff Probst Show , ABCs hit show , Wife Swap , Fox News and 60 Minutes Australia . Dayna will be giving a one-day workshop on all of the above and more on February 26th . Countless families wonder how they can improve the life and the health of their family and this workshop could positively change their lives dramatically . <p> Rethink Media . Luke Rudkowski , founder of We Are Change , one of the most famous and cutting edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-day Change Media University Bootcamp also on February 26th . We Are Change has successfully exposed the hypocrisies of Henry Kissinger , Ben Bernanke , Joe Biden , Mitt Romney , Jacob Rothschild , Mayor Bloomberg , Larry Silverstein , and the Rockefeller family . It reaches millions of people , operating on a shoestring budget while effecting laws , vindicating people who were falsely charged , creating national debates , and awareness on issues that would have never seen the light of day . Change Media Universitys mission is to create a new generation of journalists , unafraid of institutionalized authority , unafraid to challenge the status quo and preconceived notions . If you want to get into independent media on the internet there is no greater teacher than Luke Rudkowski . <p> ReThink Defense and Privacy . Cody Wilson , the inventor of the first 3-D printed gun , founder of Dark Wallet and now a founder of the popular 3-D gun printer , Ghost Gunner will be on hand to discuss creating new ways to make the state and its regulations obsolete . <p> ReInvent Politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and known as the " Ron Paul of Canada " will discuss how he hopes to decentralize government from the inside and bring peace and prosperity through the political process . Tim , like many past Libertarian party leaders in Canada is a philosophical anarchist . <p> ReInvent Money . A large part of the bitcoin community will be on hand at Anarchapulco including all the main players in the Mexican and Latin American bitcoin community including Jose Rodriguez , the partner of Unisend , the Latin American Bitcoin Exchange and Rafael Rodriguez , a major venture capitalist in the bitcoin space and founder of Emericor . <p> ReInvent Governance . Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof of Bitnation will talking about Bitnation which aims to provide the same services provided by traditional governments , but in a geographically unbound , decentralized , and voluntary way . <p> And that is just a sampling of groundbreaking and world changing speakers , artists and ideas that will be on display at Anarchapulco . Others already confirmed include Angela Keaton of Antiwar.com , Orion Martin , creator of the Sidekik police-state protection app and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also be speaking at the event . <p> The crazy thing is that we are just getting started . Countless big name anarchists will be added in the coming weeks and months with some big announcements to come . <p> And , of course , for TDV readers and subscribers many from the TDV team will be there including Chief Researcher , Justin O'Connell and representatives from many TDV related companies including TDV Passports , TDV Offshore and TDV Wealth Management . <p> It will be an amazing meeting of the minds that already has attendees coming from Europe , South America , Australia , Asia and , of course , many from North America .

" Carolyn Myss <p> To fully understand how societies operate , one must go back to where everything started , to the very beginning , from the days when people left the caves and started to come together to form small tribes . <p> In order to survive , people started gathering for food , then sharing it , and trading it between themselves ( natural human interaction ) , people were minding their own business living their own lives , taking care of their young , as it is normal in any species . But there was always someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sociopath in these days , but that 's a subject for another day . In this article we will talk about their historical antagonists . <p> There was once a young man , fresh out puberty , and just before starting his first hunting with his fellow adult males he was repeatedly told what is expected from him in life : start hunting , get a wife , give your offerings to the gods , etc . " That is the real world ! " he was told time and time again , but one day he started to wonder , " What else is there in the world ? This ca n't be all there is ! " He was n't satisfied with the answers he was given . He wanted to explore , he wanted to break free from the inflexible tribe mentality , and make his own destiny . So after uncountable afternoons wondering if there was something else behind that hill he was told marked the end of the world , one day he decided to take action . He was set on discovering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Due to his nature , the ruler of the tribe ( almost certainly a sociopath ) , could n't possibly have one of his tribe members , whom he saw merely as human cattle , just pick up and leave . What if more people decided to leave as well ? Or even worse , what if the young man came back with news about some wonderful new place where the trees were filled with fruits , or rivers filled with fishes , or plains filled with animals ? After all , sociopaths always rule by means of scarcity and fear ( they are incapable of love after all . ) So faced with the situation , the ruler convinced the rest of the tribe that this was all there was to the world , and that thinking that there might be something more was a ludicrous fantasy , and whoever thinks differently was a threat to the tribe ! <p> And people believed the ruler . He talked a big game about unity and hope , and how he cared about their well-being , and folks ate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because for most people , whoever think differently must be the enemy . <p> The ruler then escalated , as it is most common among sociopaths . He went further and told his tribe members ( human stock ) that they should punish and execute the curious young man , wait for it For his own safety ! And people bought it . It 's astonishing to observe how to this date people still believe that sociopaths are making up all kinds of rules for their own safety . But let 's return to our story . <p> The rest of the tribe had no trouble at all executing the young man for daring to explore for himself . Worse than that they had no problem justifying their crime by claiming that they did it for his own safety . Unbelievable , I know , but trying to explain to them the absurdity and of their actions is like teaching a dog how to drive a car , although if I had to bet , I 'd probably put my money on the dog . <p> They bought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to subject everyone else to them as well , which showcases the dangers of collectivism . As I always say : Collectivism to a sociopath is like the bible to a priest , a tool without which everyone would realize that their power is in fact imaginary . <p> Side issue : It becomes clear that rulers are exactly what 's holding us back as a species , and that without them people would have left the caves literally centuries ago . <p> So when the ruler ( almost inevitably a sociopath ) realized that he could just make some rules up , and torture , imprison , and kill with total impunity , it was then just a matter of a time before the real question became , how many more rules should he invent to have absolute control over his fellow tribe members ' entire lives ? <p> Rulers then began to make up all kinds of crazy stories , about the history of the world , gods and deities only they could speak to . They invented all kinds of bogeymen as well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some strange reasons those stories , right out of the imagination of a sociopath , did n't seem as ludicrous fantasies to them , no matter how insane they sounded , even worse than that they began to pass them onto their own children as true facts , and if that was n't enough , some of them let their whole lives revolve around those fables . <p> Unfortunately , trying to explain to them how insane those stories sound , is like trying to teach a baboon how to post pictures on Instagram , although if I had to bet , I 'd put my money on the baboon . <p> The sociopaths , observing the reactions of people to those fables , could n't believe their eyes ! They realized that controlling people was basically child 's play , so they started treating people as children , and how does most people effectively control a child ? You give them a treat if they do what you ask for them , and you punish or scare them with some bogeyman story if they do n't do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is , rulers are all about taking , and not so much about giving , so why would they reward people with real things , if they can offer them imaginary tales of eternity in paradise ? <p> Talking about taking , it was then just a matter of time until the sociopathic rulers started to figure out ways to take more from people . Soon enough they convinced people that those deities they previously made up were now demanding a piece of every fruit that is gathered , a portion of every wild boar that is hunted , and a slice of every fish that is caught . And the portion then became bigger and bigger . The sad part is that those tribe members believed that that was their duty . The problem however was that they wanted to subject everyone else to the same . <p> You do n't relate do you ? <p> Let 's try this again : <p> There was a young man , fresh out of his local indoctrination center just about to enroll in some university . He was repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , get a job , pay your taxes , etc . " That is the real world ! " He was told time and time again , but one day he started to wonder , " what else is there in the world ? This ca n't be all there is ! " He was n't satisfied with the answers he were given and he wanted to explore life on his own , he wanted to break free from the inflexible societal group mentality , and make his own destiny , so after uncountable afternoons wondering what if there are other ways to live life , one day he decided to take action . He was set on discovering for himself how the world really works , his journey was about to start . <p> So once he took his first step , stopped accepting and complying with all those imaginary rules he was supposed to just accept , he started to question them . At first he could n't figure out why the government is constantly coming up with all these new rules and regulations , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions . <p> So he started with " drugs " . Since our young protagonist did n't know much about the nature of the government he just could n't understand how pharmaceutical drugs companies were given free range , facing little to no regulations despite the high numbers of people who lose their lives due to secondary effect of prescription drugs , and despite the fact that all the latest shootouts had as presumed authors people who were hooked on similar substances : James Holmes ( the Aurora massacre ) , Adam Lanza ( Sandy Hoax ) , Aaron Alexis ( Navy Yard shooting ) , etc . <p> On the other side peaceful consumption of marijuana seemed to be one of the reasons behind landing good and decent people in jail , making the US the largest prison population on the planet , despite the fact that marijuana is scientifically proven to calm people down . So the government ( generally with a selection of sociopaths , Pareto 's law ) rules by scarcity ( oil , shortage ) and fear ( they are incapable of love after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these artificial divisions , race , religion , income , social and educational background , sexual orientations . All they can do to keep people operating on law vibrations . <p> Due to their nature , the government ( generally with a selection of sociopaths ) , would n't possibly have one of their fellow citizens whom they see merely as human cattle , just smoke some joiny in peace and live and let live . What if more people decided to live in peace as well ? Or even worse , what if they all realized that all these divisions are artificial , and that those enemies they were supposed to fear are fabled ? What if people realized that the nature of the con job ? <p> So faced with the situation , the government convinced the rest of society that they should punish and imprison the curious young man , wait for it For his own safety ! And people bought it . They had no trouble believing that the reason government is sending all those " substance users " to rape camps where they are sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day they may or may not end their lives to stop the agony and the suffering , is simply because the government is a benevolent organization that cares about them . <p> Unbelievable , I know , but trying to explain to them the absurdity of their actions , is like teaching a propagandist to say the truth , but If I had to betYou know who I 'm putting my money on . <p> Society ( modern day tribe members ) bought into those imaginary , made-up rules , and accepted and enforced those barbaric punishments the bully inflicts on their victims if they do n't comply with his made-up rules . The problem is they wanted to subject everyone else to them as well , which showcases the dangers of collectivism . <p> " Society 's leaders , through illegal dictum , deception and force define a space in which life is supposed to occur " .

They believed it all ! For some strange reasons those stories , right out of the imagination of a sociopath , did n't seem as ludicrous fantasies to them , no matter how insane they sounded , so they consented to all kinds of violations on their privacy . <p> The sociopaths then , observing the reactions of people to those fables , could n't believe their eyes !

And the portion then became bigger and bigger The sad part is that those tribe members ( civilized people ? Really ? ) believed that that was their duty to finance the genocide and the genetic wrecking of young children , the problem however is that they wanted to subject everyone else to the same . <p> " Theres a lot of ways of dividing people in two classes , but let me give you the one that 's relevant now : Theres two ways you can deal with your fellow human beings , one , there are people who believe you should deal with people voluntarily , without using violence without using force , that 's one type.The other type is a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to deal with people coercively , by force .

As he played his final games in baseball parks around the US , he was given gift-after-gift . And , with each gift , his tax headache grew . Reports state he could owe $16,000 in taxes on his $33,000 in gifts things like vacations , wine , surfboards , kayaks and framed jerseys . <p> Because these gifts are not given out of " detached and disinterested " generosity , they are taxable . And Barack Obama and his group of henchmen want their cut . After all , Derek Jeter " did n't build that " . <p> It 's a fitting cap to a long career in which I am sure Jeter became very aware of how taxes work . As a pro athlete , he 's among the most extorted of tax-cattle . <p> Former Chicago Bears linebacker Hunter Heillenmaeyer and former Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday are suing Cincinnati because of its taxes on athletes . Very few know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town teams on the games they play in their domain , but Cincinatti took it further , taxing players who were hurt or not even there . <p> " Nobody likes paying taxesthats obviousbut they should be fair , " says Hillenmeyer . " It was just such an egregious and shameless money grab by the city of Cleveland , it just felt wrong not to try to do anything about it . " <p> All taxes are " egregious and shameless " money grabs and since they are involuntary , at the point of a gun , they can never be fair unless the tax rate is 0% . <p> In the US , twenty-one states and eight cities are home to major professional sports teams like Detroit , Kansas City , and Philadelphia which tax visiting players , coaches , trainers and others working for the team on the road . <p> California collected $163.8 million in 2011 from resident and nonresident professional athletes for MLB , the NBA , NHL , NFL , WNBA , golf , tennis , and soccer , according to the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city of Pittsburgh stole $3.1 million from pro athletes in 2013 . <p> Athletes are sitting ducks for the taxman . They have no control over where they play , and a sector of the public views them as spoiled millionaires who get to play children 's games . <p> California started the tide of tax when it used income tax laws there to tax Chicago Bulls players , who had beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA championship , according to Robert Raiola , a New Jersey accountant representing athletes . The State of Illinois took notice and instituted its own taxes on out-of-state athletes in what 's called " Michael Jordan 's Revenge . " <p> The cities do n't even offer credits for the taxes they force players to pay . With executives , states generally give them some time before they have to start paying local income taxes . Ohio law says nonresidents who work in a city for 12 or less days in a year do n't have to pay anything . Here is an example about how football 's Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.5 trillion stolen by the federal government for the federal income tax , $3 billion is paid by athletes ( 3,000 individuals ) .

" The first check I ever had to write was like $300,000-plus in taxesI did n't even realize I had that much money , and now all of a sudden I 'm writing a check for it . It was almost like it was Monopoly money . I was 18 and I did n't even realize I had that much . It 's all fake . " <p> The problems are n't confined to the top three US sports . Manny Pacquiao has dominated boxing , and a recent win over another boxer Timothy Bradley earned him $20 million , bringing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na need that much . The IRS and Philippine tax authorities want a piece of his fortune , as if it was them who were taking the punches . <p> Pacquiao is a nonresident alien , which means he does not owe US taxes on money earned in other countries , but his tax bill on money earned in the US is huge . The Philippines is after 3.3 billion pesos , or $75 million . <p> In the US foreign athletes have to file US income tax returns and face special withholding rules . They usually have to pay US income tax on their US-based income even if they are only there for a few days , for a fight , like Pacquiao . <p> WHY MANY ATHLETES GO BANKRUPT <p> Many athletes in the US , particularly in the NFL and the NBA come from poor areas and have no idea how to handle money . Many , if told they just got a contract for $1 million per year would instantly think they were super rich . Millionaires ! As Cuddyer found out , though , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal governments . Especially when you add in all manner of other taxes such as property tax and sales tax on anything they buy . <p> So , pretty much from the start they are really making $500,000/year . Of course , the sports agent , which usually takes between 5-10% of the gross salary , also . So , at 10% of $1 million , that is $100,000 for the agent . The player is now down to $400,000 . <p> Of course , many of them will still think they are wealthy because they make $1 million per year . As Chris Rock points out here , there is rich and then there is wealthy . <p> As he says , " Shaq is rich the white man who signs his cheque is wealthy " . <p> Getting back to your average $1 million/year athlete , he is now down to $400,000 but where is he going to live ? And what is he going to drive ? All his friends and family think he is rich now and so to lease a Honda Accord and rent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forgetting for the moment the poor players who play in a city like San Francisco where , as of September , 2014 , average apartment rent within 10 miles of San Francisco , CA was $3,437/month . <p> And that will generally get you a fairly non-descript one bedroom apartment . A starting inside receiver for the San Francisco 49ers ca n't live in a place like that his friends and family would ridicule him . He 's rich now . So , he 'll likely rent a 2 bedroom , quite nice condo , for about $10,000/month . <p> So , now he is down to $280,000 per year . But what is he going to drive ? He ca n't afford a really nice sports car for $280,000 as he 'd have no money left for food for that year so he 'll likely lease one for around $1,500 per month . He 's now down to around $250,000 and still owns nothing . <p> But , of course , having become a rich star athlete his friends and family all expect him to pay the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to estimate an average monthly restaurant and bar bill of around $10,000/month . He 's now down to nearly $100,000 per year . And that 's before gas , electric bills , phone bills etc etc . <p> In other words , for your average athlete , by the time all is said and done , their actual disposable income is probably pretty close to $100,000/year after expenses . <p> Now , if he wisely " invests " that $100,000 per year and goes to your typical " investment advisor " they would likely suggest he put quite a large amount of that in the stock market . A market that has never been so highly valued in terms of revenue/price ( the amount of revenue a company earns compared to its current stock valuation ) . There is an incredibly good chance he will lose money there over the next few years . <p> And even if he does n't , he 'll more than likely just keep pace with inflation . For safety , his advisor will recommend putting some into " risk-free " US Treasury bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . <p> In other words , even if he manages to play for five years and manages to sock away $100,000 per year after all taxes and expenses , he most likely would have $500,000 in savings . If he had put most of it in Treasury bonds he will actually have the equivalent of about $200,000 in today 's dollars and that is if the dollar even still exists at that point . <p> Of course , after having lived the " high life " for the last five years it is really hard to ratchet down on the lifestyle you had , especially when you have a wife in tow who was initially attracted to you because you were famous and " rich " and now you are neither . <p> And so , now left with no income and less than $500,000 in savings ( which are only worth about $300,000 in today 's dollars ) he ca n't even afford to rent a basic , one bedroom apartment in San Francisco anymore . His wife leaves him usually entailing a messy legal battle and loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed he decided to kill himself and leave the small amount remaining to his child . <p> His last thought is that at least his son will have $500,000 . But the government takes 40% of it as a death tax lowering that amount to $300,000 which is worth about $150,000 in today 's dollars . <p> That $150,000 , if his son wants to live in San Francisco , will pay for about two years of living expenses . <p> So , the next time you hear someone saying how many athletes today are paid too much remember that they too are mostly impoverished by the government and even more so than your average person . And many have ongoing health issues for the remainder of their lives on top of it . <p> The owner of the team , however , will often receive huge tax subsidies , massive tax write-offs and keep the majority of their wealth structured in offshore entities that are legally non-reportable and non-taxable ( these are services that TDV Wealth Management offers and you do n't have to be wealthy today to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can structure their affairs to that they do n't end up destitute like the poor pro athlete who can not use these forms of structures due to the nature of their work ) . <p> Even for those athletes who have made massive amounts of money , like Felix Trinidad , the boxer , who made $90 million over his career he ended up bankrupt and with $18 million in debt all by not structuring himself properly and by " investing " the majority of his earnings in government debt instruments ( read more here : " Want To Lose All Your Money ?

The city and county of Los Angeles recently instituted a law requiring that all pornographic movies made in their territory have to use condoms . <p> This , in turn , has the porn industry fleeing LA to places where they are not forced to do such things because their consumers do n't like seeing condoms on the male actors and using condoms ( instead of relying on testing ) would hurt the industry . <p> In typical government fashion , California is considering " tax credits " for those who make movies in the state . Of course , all this does is transfer the tax burden to other industries , which will also then flee . <p> The state is a large , violent , blind monster swinging wildly in the dark in a room full of hand grenades . Even if it wants to help , it ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and response . It just continually tries to transfer wealth from one group to another until one group nearly dies or leaves and then it reverses its course to " save " those it has damaged reverting the damage to other people . This goes on and on until every industry is dead or has left . The politicians and their friends always seem to do well in the process , however . <p> We always recommend getting completely out of the US and going to a jurisdiction where the tax environment is much less oppressive . Or , becoming a permanent traveler/prior taxpayer ( PT ) something we regularly talk about in the TDV newsletter and adjusting your affairs worldwide in such a way that you legally do n't  pay any tax . <p> Or , if you can not or will not leave the US you have to pick your poison . If you have to do that pick the best poison of the lot . In this case , head to Florida like everyone else .

In the meantime , Russia has sent troops to the border of the Ukraine in what are being called exercises . <p> Turkey is experiencing protests and violence due to corruption by the government , and Venezuela is also experiencing protests and violence . The " global political awakening " has gone hot on multiple continents . <p> Although one week ago mainstream press worldwide spoke about the Ukraine as if it were in the midst of a popular uprising , a different picture has become clearer , as communist and fascist sympathizers seem poised to gain the most out of the chaos . " Conspiracy " aside , it is a no-brainer that major powers can have the most influence in these sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ european-stye bank policies are being implemented in the unstable region . <p> 7 percent of deposits were drained from Ukrainian banks last week amid bloody clashes between diverse protestors and the state . Now , in a bid to " protect savings , " the Ukraine is mulling restricting cash withdrawals as reports of pending default loom . <p> Withdrawals peaked at 30 billion hrynias ( $3.1 billion ) from February 18-30 as police and anti-government demonstrators fought in the center of Kiev . The interim government has told the world Ukraine is bankrupt , and seeks $35 billion in financial aid . <p> In other words , Ukraine is going to the highest bidder , and the European Union , US and Russian taxpayers will guarantee the funds . The EU wo n't be able to match Russia 's standing offers , but an alliance between the US and EU could certainly bring Ukraine further under European Union influence . On the year , the hryvnia is down 16 percent . <p> The International Monetary Fund is already ready to move in . Managing Director Christine LaGarde told Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engageWe will probably shortly send some technical assistance support to the country because this is our duty to a member , if that member asks , " which is " clearly what is likely to happen . " <p> The Ukraine remains on the brink of default without " significantly favorable changes " in its political crisis , according to Standard &amp; Poor 's on February 21 . It cut the nations credit raiting to CCC eight levels short of investment grade . <p> As Ukraine picks its new government , Russia has apparently ordered tests of its combat readiness in the central and western parts of Russia . Protests in the country ultimately led to the disposal of Russian backed leader Viktor Yanukovych . Russia has pledged to protect " the health and life of its compatriots . " The Russia foreign minister has warned the US and EU to stay out of Ukrainian affairs , as media the world over highlights US and EU interfence in the Ukraine and their potential support of far-right , neo-nazi groups . " It is dangerous and counterproductive to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are either with us or against us , " Lavrov told a Moscow news conference . <p> Moscow has already stopped a bailout package he reached with Yanukovych for refusing closer ties to Europe . <p> The US and EU have been quick to pledge support . US taxpayers are in the dark about what 's going on so they wo n't get the chance to approve or disapprove . Plus they are used to funding brooding totalitarian states the world over . In fact , it might just be so that the hardworking people of Detroit , recently bankrupted , are chomping at the bit to send money to Russia 's borders and invest in infrastructure , education and science . ( read : bribe corrupt politicians ) <p> On the ground in Ukraine , this will appear as a devaluation of the country 's currency and privatization by EU and US interests of Ukrainian agricultural land . A push to bring the Ukraine into the beleagured EU will recommence , and eventually Germans will be the direct lifeline to Ukraine . And , as the second largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for western nations to prop up . And with Russian troops amassing on the border , tensions akin to the Cold War have reared their ugly head . Talks have already swelled regarding the Ukraine joining the NATO , which would bring a US-steered world organization to Russia 's border . What 's likely is western nations will now prepare to aid the Ukraine . Some combination of Americans , Europeans and Russians will pay for it . <p> If the Ukraine moves closer to the European Union , this will result in a power shift in the EU , favoring nations like Poland and the Czech Republic . Partly for this reason I am currently en route to the Czech Republic looking into new opportunities during the turbulence .

The Capitol is home to the dictator and several of the film 's main characters . It is generally regarded as where the rich and elite live . Far removed from the suffering and oppression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parties , depravity and entertainment , including the Hunger Games themselves . <p> The Capitol 's citizens are depicted as clueless of the suffering in the Districts or unconcerned by it . The Capitol , very different than the Districts in its style , culture and even accent . Many of the people have been given names of ancient Greo-Roman derivation , and the city is decorated by a modernized version of Roman architecture . <p> The Hunger Games themselves are a cause for celebration among those in the Capitol , since they can not be chosen for the Games and serves as a sort of NFL of today , but with less rape and wife beating . The Hunger Games are a punishment for the Districts attempted rebellion . Citizens gamble on the tributes and sponsor their favorites in the arena , providing water , food , weapons , and other provisions , despite that in all likelihood they will die terrible , brutal deaths . <p> I wish I could say this is not anything at all like our current reality . But , unfortunately , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DC , increasingly , I see The Capitol depicted in the Hunger Games . As the chart below illustrates , DC leads the way in the US for federal public corruption convictions . <p> The inhabitants of DC are getting richer than those in the 50 Districts ( formerly known as " states " ) . In recent years this has increased to a dramatic degree becoming painfully obvious especially when you consider that DC , unlike San Francisco ( and its Silicon Valley ) has almost no natural , wealth building industry . <p> It should be noted that Washington , in the District of Criminals , rarely exceeded other areas of the country in terms of Median Household Income until just after the epoch moment that occurred in 2001 , centralizing more power to Washington . And then the gains were much more dramatic since the financial crisis of 2008 which gifted the banks even more freshly printed Federal Reserve Notes ( they call them dollars in most of the districts ) and centralized even more power to DC . <p> IT HAPPENS IN EVERY EMPIRE AND EVERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a metaphor for the " capital city " of any country or empire .

Those that lust for its power always gravitate to its core usually making the capital city of nearly every country one of the worst places in the country at least in terms of the vibe . <p> No one goes to amazing places in Mexico like Acapulco ( or as I call it and will be hosting an event here called Anarchapulco ) , or Playa del Carmen , and says they 'd much prefer living in Mexico City ( located in Districto Federal , of course ) .

Just like in The Hunger Games , all it took was for one girl who was particularly good with a long bow to stand up and fight it to , potentially , bring it all down . <p> The heroes of today 's real life Hunger Games , are those who want to break away from the system the plebes from the Districts outside of The Capitol , who do n't want to continue to be oppressed . <p> Those in The Capitol hate us and despise us , as do even the plebes in the poverty stricken districts , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system are hurting not only The Capitol , but those barely surviving in the system itself . <p> It 's an age-old plight , from those defecting from the Soviet Union , to the fictional accounts of Galt 's Gulch in Ayn Rand 's Atlas Shrugged to today , where the amount of businesses and people trying to defect from the US are reaching epic proportions . <p> And its only going to get worse , much worse , from here as the world has nearly totally shunned its power source now , the US dollar .

( Many actually do and believe they do n't , but I will save that topic for another article . ) <p> For those who want to live in Mexico , and who know they will need to work to stay here , this is for you : Some ideas on how to make a living south of the border . <p> Before I discuss ideas for businesses and jobs that can and have worked for other expats in Mexico , let 's talk about what wo n't work : Competing with Mexican nationals for semi-skilled jobs . They barely make enough to survive . You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3 dollars an hour . <p> Which leaves a lot of vocational options that have merit , depending on location , and which includes starting your own business , or working for an existing business here in Mexico . <p> Here are a dozen businesses/jobs that a motivated American with the right experience and skill sets could begin and realize their dream of disconnecting from Amerika : <p> Real estate agency This business is perhaps the most common startup among expats . It can be established with relatively modest capital and if you can list and sell property , you can make a living . Unfortunately , it is late to get into this game in most Mexican cities where Americans and Canadians are prevalent . Unless you can bring a model to market that no one else has thought of that will cause real estate that has n't sold to sell , you will be one of a large pack in a currently depressed Mexican residential real estate market . Going to work as an agent for an existing agency is also a possibility if you have experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another business that many expats have tried and some have actually succeeded . But , in San Miguel de Allende where I have lived the past 11 years , the city seems saturated with opportunities to buy your morning fix . That said , there is always room for a coffee shop with a new twist in a new area . Just be ready to take on the likes of Starbucks , who are taking Mexico by storm . <p> Restaurant Most restaurants fail regardless of which side of the border you are on . But there are notable exceptions . One young couple from the northeast with restaurant experience came to San Miguel a few years ago and opened an Asian-fusion restaurant with a creative menu and an even more creative bar . They have done well . <p> B&amp;B Buying a property that lends itself to offering rooms and breakfast can be a good , if low volume , business . They key to success is to buy the property at the right price after evaluating demand and location . <p> Tours Bringing in tourists from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive in the right market , meaning a location in Mexico deemed safe and desirable by tourists from north of the border . <p> Employment agency We went through several maids after we moved to San Miguel , not finding one that had the full set of skills we were seeking . One enterprising entrepreneur started a company called : " Maid In Mexico " . They came in , determined what we were looking for and trained our maid to service our home and two casitas to a high standard . The same thing could be done training gardeners and handymen . And , for sensitive positions or those with rare skill sets , one could open an agency that conducts background checks , civil , criminal , and confirms experience , for a fee , of course . <p> Health club/gym Finding a modern , state of the art health club or gym is difficult except for Mexico 's largest cities . While capital intensive , if you have several hundred thousand dollars to invest and experience in the fitness business , there may be opportunities in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to own your own fitness business , consider becoming a personal trainer , Yoga teacher , or Pilates instructor . I even know one woman who made a living here for a period of time teaching other women to pole dance ( not training to be strippers but because pole dancing is , apparently , great exercise . ) Just know you will be competing with certified Mexican nationals doing the same thing and that keeps a lid on potential earnings . <p> Import/Export Importing into Mexico is highly regulated by the Mexican government and the same is true when exporting good from Mexico to the United States . Someone who can help individuals and businesses leap the legal hurdles might just find a successful niche business . <p> Non-profit support services The number of NGOs ( non-governmental organizations ) in Mexico is substantial . Someone who has had experience and success in writing grant proposals , for example , may do very well servicing the many US non-profits that operate in Mexico . <p> Organics Organic produce and meat may be bigger in Mexico than in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living growing green and selling at various farmers ' markets and restaurants . <p> Accountants and tax preparation professionals US citizens must pay tax on their worldwide income , causing a need for US licensed accountants and tax preparation professionals in areas of Mexico favored by expats . <p> Medical case management This is a service I have n't seen here yet , but is needed . It might include evaluation of medical insurance alternatives in Mexico for expats , case management for those hospitalized or in nursing or hospice care , including treatment , hospital/doctor selection , and billing . Someone who has a medical and business background might do well managing the healthcare of expats in Mexico . <p> Those are a dozen ideas . There are dozens more . <p> Just know that starting and becoming successful in a business here in Mexico or anywhere for that matter requires skill , preparation , market analysis , and hard work . All businesses require , or at least are best-served in Mexico with bilingual owners . So , if you do n't speak Spanish , do n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take now . And , it goes without saying , but I will say it anyway , businesses require money to open , oftentimes as much as a similar business in the US and Canada . Do n't come down on a shoestring and believe you can crank up a successful business . It does n't work that way . If you want to work in Mexico as an employee , determine what you can add . <p> Either way , if you are serious , come to Mexico , not as a tourist , but with a view to finding and evaluating opportunities that are in demand which can be serviced by your skill sets and to meet the people who can help you leap the hurdles . <p> Jim Karger is TDV 's legal correspondent and the TDV concierge for San Miguel de Allende , Mexico , where he and his wife have lived for 11 years .

Paypal has frozen many of our numerous Paypal accounts that we have worldwide on an ongoing basis . This should n't come as news to any merchants who use Paypal as the company is notorious for constantly freezing funds and accounts for all manner of reasons . In one instance , as part of operations in our hotel in Acapulco ( Las Torres Gemelas Private Suites ) they froze our account until we could show them proof of numerous very small denomination transfers . The transactions were for room rentals that had occurred weeks or months prior and Paypal would demand that we show proof that the person had stayed with us and approved the transaction . Often these were past guests who had just booked for a few nights , who we had no other relation with , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother them to supply Paypal with their information and approval of the transaction ! <p> No Cuba For You . In another instance , just a few weeks ago , another Paypal account we had was frozen after we paid for a flight from Havana , Cuba ( ironically I had just stopped there for one night because I wanted to avoid the pain and risk of flying through the US ) via Paypal because it was nearly impossible to purchase a flight to or from Cuba by any other means . Because we denoted the payment done was for a flight from " Havana " the account was frozen . The total dollar amount was for just a few hundred dollars . <p> No Brokerage For You . Last year , a brokerage account I use in Luxembourg threatened to close my account . When I asked why they said that the brokerage had recently been bought by a Canadian brokerage and there is a Canadian law that says that no Canadian can deal with a brokerage owned by a Canadian company outside of Canada . Luckily they accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . US citizens are not so lucky . The SEC has made it so hardly any brokerage outside of the US will accept US citizens effectively locking their accounts inside the US as a capital control . <p> And , we are most definitely not alone . At TDV Offshore we hear dozens of stories per week from people scrambling to find a way to have international bank accounts after their accounts have suddenly been shuttered . The great majority are US citizens who receive a notice that their accounts will be immediately closed due to FATCA . FATCA is essentially creating capital controls for US citizens on banking making it harder and harder to hold funds outside of the US . <p> In short , it is getting more difficult all the time to transact in the traditional banking system . And it seems to just get worse by the month . There appears to be a worldwide effort underway to make it harder and harder just to transact financially . <p> THE OPTIONS <p> Luckily there is still options for getting around many of these issues but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any easier . <p> Passports . For Americans the only way to really be able to internationalize your assets and get out from the unbelievably egregious US tax system is to get a foreign passport and then to renounce your US citizenship . This may seem extreme to some but it seems like the most rational thing to do to us . We foresee the US continuing to devolve , further capital controls to be erected and the US not being a place anyone will want to go for an extended period of time as it completely collapses so why not get yourself and your capital out while you can ? The US government , as we have reported , has even gone to lengths to make it harder for US citizens to get foreign passports which should be a big hint as to their intentions . Just this month they have attacked probably the most arduous , respectable and legitimate " citizenship by investment " program in St. Kitts . And the US government has pressured the Dominican Republic to increase the time to get a passport from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this continuing and by the time many do see the writing on the wall and want to get a second passport to get away from the US it will be too late . The demand will be too overwhelming and the supply will continue to dwindle which will drive the cost through the roof if it is even possible at all . You can contact TDV Passports for a consultation on what your current options are . <p> Foreign Trusts . Another option that is still available but may not be for much longer is to transfer your assets into an offshore trust thereby getting around FATCA rules and giving US citizens the ability to bank , have brokerage accounts and to do business internationally . This is not easy or simple and our FATCA experts at TDV Wealth Management have a fulltime job trying to help US citizens to internationalize their assets . Citizens of other countries may feel that they do not need to do something like this as their country does not currently have FATCA controls nor taxes them on worldwide income . We expect this door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devolve into the Greater Depression and as tax revenue for their governments decline . <p> Bullion . One of the best ways to retain your assets is to have them in hard assets like precious metals outside of the financial system and preferably geopolitically diversified to make it harder for any one government to seize . This , also , is getting harder and harder but is still possible even though it is now nearly impossible for Americans to ship gold outside of the country and have it insured as we know of no companies that will now do that for US citizens . There are many ways to international precious metals though and you can read more in the Getting Your Gold Out Of Dodge report . As well , precious metals should rise tremendously as the modern banking and financial systems collapse during The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) . <p> Bitcoin . Bitcoin offers not only a safehaven from the financial system and ability to transact worldwide in seconds for free and with no chance of any government or bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that as more people awaken to the serious capital controls and inability to transact internationally easily that more will move to bitcoin as a way to hold their assets as well as to transfer them easily . This alone could see bitcoin go up 1,000% in the next 1-2 years in my opinion , if not more . In fact , bitcoin has surpassed Western Union and is now close to surpassing Paypal in terms of transaction volume which is no surprise to us here at The Dollar Vigilante ( where we have been following bitcoin since $7 in 2011 at The Dollar Vigilante newsletter ) as it is a much easier , better , faster , safer , more private and cheaper way to transact . <p> MASSIVE CHANGES IN THE WORLD MONETARY AND BANKING SYSTEM <p> The perfect storm is developing and it is all going as we have predicted over the last five years . The Western world will continue to inflate their currencies to keep the system alive as almost all governments are bankrupt . Governments will continue to make it harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be further grabs on all manner of assets including retirement and pension funds and more bank bail-ins , like in Cyprus , as government bonds collapse and the currencies hyperinflate . <p> Luckily , as mentioned above , there are still options but the doors are closing at such a rapid pace now that if you have n't begun to protect yourself from the coming collapse you had better start doing it yesterday . 
@@99475326 @3675326/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> The Gringo Motorcycle Diaries &amp; The Income Free PT Lifestyle <p> The following post is written by Director of TDV Offshore , Paul Seymour <p> It occurred to me , as my new wife pointed it out to me , that I had n't  published anything for quite a while . First , I 'd like to remind you that , in my last , or maybe two articles ago , I urged you all to move some over-valued USD to a safe jurisdiction , and while you were at it , get some Swiss Francs instead . <p> With a move of only USD 10,000 into CHF , your profits from the revaluation of the CHF would have covered the fees to move your funds to safety , and get diversified . Very few took heed . Hate to say I told you so , but .. <p> Secondly , yes , while on the road throughout South America , while I was in in northern Per to be exact , I was contacted by a new client . Nothing new about that , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our clients are like-minded freedom-lovers , and I 'm blessed to be able to work with such intelligent , refreshing people . <p> This client , however , turned out to be a bit different , and over the course of a few months , we made plans to meet up in Buenos Aires to see how traveling together might go . Over a couple of months in Argentina and Uruguay , as you can see by the result , it went very well . Although she has returned temporarily to Europe to fulfill a modeling contract , the return visit to South America in the near future will be a permanent move . Another former US citizen in South America leading a better life outside the curtain . <p> That 's just an aside , though , if such a change in ones life could be referred to so lightly . There are a couple of reasons why I have n't written for a while , and therefore needed some prodding . First , it seems that quite a few North Americans had time during the holidays to finally do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a portion of their assets to safety . No Europeans recently , for some reason , although they have every bit as much to gain by doing so . <p> In fact , what I 'm hearing from up there sounds progressively more like real fear . I have n't stepped foot behind the curtain since before 9/11 , and did n't  really need any reassurance that I 'd made the right call on that one . I 'm just continually amazed at how far people can get pushed before they 've had enough . Seems like more and more have gotten to that tipping point . Therefore , I 've been spending much more time establishing new trusts , LLCs , IBCs , and bank or brokerage accounts than ever before . I do all of that personally , by the way . That in addition to all of the conversations and correspondence it takes to get these new clients on board , and start moving with the due diligence requirements , etc . <p> In addition , and as I alluded to above , I 'm on a two-year tour of South America by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind on that project , and have been playing catch up . The trip was borne out of a long-time dream going back to my first trip to Colombia about twenty years ago . Back when everyone assured me that I 'd never get out alive . Instead , what I discovered was a country and culture that would obviously become a place of choice for many to emigrate to . I was simply amazed at how inaccurately my new home country had been portrayed . Back then I was still a suit-wearing corporate geek , but it started a lot of wheels to turning . The seeds of the PT Lifestyle were sown . <p> When I started out on this motorcycle journey , it was strictly for pleasure , and a way to try out the true perpetual traveller ( PT ) lifestyle . Just for fun , I published three or four blogs about my first three to four legs of the journey , on a far less significant website . To my surprise , the response was incredibly loud and positive . Therefore , the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . The title being inspired by a book I became aware of many years ago down here written by Che Guevara . <p> When I set out , I truly thought the journey would take 5-6 months . Now , 16 months later , and a little over half way , I realize that was wholly unrealistic . Happily so , as it turns out . It has been a life-changer , which is n't any surprise to me . I fully expected that based on past life-changing experiences . <p> My parents , and grandparents , were typical middle class Americans of their times . They worked , slept , ate , and raised their kids . They took a family vacation every summer with the measly two weeks allotted to them , and never had passports . Why would they ? With two weeks a year off work , international travel was pretty much out of the question . Back then we could cross into Canada without all the paranoid machinations . I 'm not sure if that 's still possible or not . I 'm making that all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail . I was in the same rut in my twenties . Graduated from college , got married , had student loans and credit card tabs from putting myself through school , mortgage , two car payments , etc etc . <p> Luckily , what seemed at the time to be a very unpleasant sort of business with the government , got me my first international post in Saudi Arabia . So at age 33 , I had that first passport , and would never look back . First thing I learned was how wonderful it was to not pay income taxes , as taxes are forbidden by the Koran it seems . I was still paying the FICA with the US companies , but no income taxes in Saudi Arabia . <p> Also , I was given 8 weeks of paid leave per year , and airfare . For the first time in my life , I was actually getting ahead , while seeing the world at the same time . Trips to Egypt for a Nile Cruise , Hungary and Malaysia for the F1 Races , a several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , Christmas at the coffee farm in Colombia , etc etc . <p> I also once had to leave Saudi Arabia in order to get my work visa , so was paid to spend about twelve weeks meandering around Thailand back in 2002 . Let me assure you , that if you 've ever been stuck in that rut my grandparents , parents , and the younger Paul were in , that a few months of paid vacation in a free country like Thailand , after a life-time of slavery behind the curtain , it will change your life , and whole manner of thinking about it . <p> Therefore , I was fully expecting this journey to be yet another life-changer . Why ? Because after all of those earlier travels , and several more years spent in South America , I had become convinced that South America is the place to live . I also know that there are double-digit millions of people in both North America and the EU who have a similar gut feeling . Many of those , however , are absolutely clueless about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Latin American culture which also includes Central America and parts of the Caribbean . <p> CULTURAL IGNORANCE <p> A couple of quick stories on that point . When I made that first visit to Colombia back in 1996 , I had been living in Florida for many years . Sometimes while driving around the back roads of north-central Florida I would stumble across migrant Mexican farm-workers making homemade tortillas , and rolling up some sort of homemade food , and selling it for a buck . <p> I noticed how different it was from Chi Chis or Taco Bell . I was therefore looking forward to getting down to Colombia to see what the Chimichangas were like down there . When I inquired , they crinkled their foreheads , and got in a huddle to ask about Mexican restaurants . Back in those days , Medellfn did n't  have any , so I was out of luck . I could have sancocho , chicharr=n , papa criollo or even a tamale , but chimichangas ? Medellfn has changed a bit over the past twenty years , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an American who I respect completely as an intelligent guy , and like-minded freedom fighter , said that he had spent some time in Tijuana , and that was enough of Latin America for him .. Wow . Therefore I know there 's a need to she 'd a lot of light here for those who know its time to leave , but do n't  yet know where to go . <p> From 2004-2011 I rode around Colombia on a small , very non-descript bike making 1 or 2 week trips here and there . Back in 2004 many Colombians were still afraid to travel from Medellfn up to the coast , but I considered that fear to be unjustified , and went on my merry way . Meeting some great people along the way , who seemed to truly appreciate my courage , or lack of sense , as their perspective may have been . What I learned was that even within the country of Colombia , the cultural differences were quite immense , and that I could n't begin to imagine what all of those differences would be like throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a cultural anthropologist instead of an accountant . Many of the personality tests indicate that I 'm cut out more to be an analytical scientist , and I truly love traveling around and observing , comparing and contrasting cultural differences . I cant begin to tell you the differences Ive noted throughout Colombia , Ecuador , Per , Chile , Argentina , Uruguay and now Brazil . <p> Mind-blowing , and with Paraguy and Bolivia still yet to come . I wont be telling you about my personal opinions , nor presenting dry charts with cost of living data in them . Instead , I 'm just laying out my real-life experiences , and observations so that the reader can put themselves in that same situation , and judge for themselves whether its a good , or bad thing . Those experiences cover the gamut regarding the people &amp; culture , the governments , the police , weather , prices , everything . <p> THE PT LIFE IS INCOME TAX FREE <p> I get a lot of inquiries about how to legally live tax-free . First of all , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expertly brainwashed into thinking that income taxes are the only taxes which matter . Personally , I 'm paying a shed-load of taxes , but thankfully no income taxes . The biggest tax I pay as a PT is the IVA ( VAT or sales tax ) . That has ranged from 12% to 22% during my ride-about . Also whenever I buy gas , which has ranged from USD 1.50/gallon to $7.15 , I know there 's a lot of tax in there . <p> Whenever I rent a cabin or apartment , I 'm paying the owners real estate taxes , and taxes on the utilities and wifi etc . Although some countries do n't  charge motorcycles a highway toll , others do , and that 's certainly a tax . Some countries will have additional " sin taxes " on the beer and wine . Others prefer to make such items cheap , and keep the populace stupefied . Let 's not forget obligatory contributions to the bankrupt social security scheme . <p> I realized 20 years ago that I 'd never see a dime of that . But then , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just took even more guts to talk about it then . I guess now there 's an obligatory tax to cover your " free " healthcare ? If you do n't  pay it you lose your house ? Unbelievable . Yeah , that sounds like freedom . Trust me , that 's not gon na be happening down here . The people have too many stones for that . <p> Even worse is that all along the supply-chain , governmental fees are being added to the prices you pay before the IVA gets added on top . In Colombia , there 's a tax of .4% on every bank transaction if you use a Colombian bank . Do n't  get me started on Argentina . Those people really need our services just as bad as the Yankees . Then there are tangible and intangibles taxes . You get the point . <p> Therefore , not paying income taxes is a minor victory , at best , but if you only spend three months or so at a time in any given country , on a tourist visa , you 're not a resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could make a day trip to a bordering country when your tourist visa expires , and cross the borders again , and renew your tourist visa . There 's a whole industry in Thailand for people who regularly do that . They 're called border runs . Some countries will even give tourists relief on the IVA , too . When I was paying with my international credit card ( issued by a private jurisdiction bank ) in Uruguay , I was sometimes automatically refunded a large percentage of their 22% IVA . <p> Not paying taxes in countries where you do n't  live just makes basic common sense . Something which long ago went by the wayside in tax-and-spend nations . Taxes are not the right of governments , and their functionaries . They are payments made by citizens , and hopefully permanent residents , for services provided . That 's the huge , and valid objection to the USG stance that people not living in the US must still pay income tax . For what , I ask ? So that the MIC can fund its scheme of global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangering the lives of US citizens who are smart enough to leave , by creating great animosity towards them ? Or maybe to fund my own surveillance , again in the name of national security ? Please sign me up for that immediately . <p> GETTING STARTED <p> As you can see , none of my current lifestyle happened over night , nor is it for the majority . The worn out expression about good things taking time , is almost always true . First I liquidated everything , and got my money to a safe jurisdiction . Then I obtained citizenship in a free country . Basically any one , other than the US , EU or Canada , and Australia . That took several years , and postponed this trip , by the way . Now I feel like I 'm reaping some reward , although living in , and riding around Colombia for a few years was n't exactly a big sacrifice , I have less material possessions , that 's for sure . Much less , in fact . How much is your personal freedom worth ? I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . <p> Where will we end up ? That 's uncertain . We both know we do want a home base . Possibly three . There goes the lack of material goods , but when in safe jurisdictions , one feels less stress about having , and therefore keeping them . Maybe one on the coast , or an island , one in the mountains , and one on the outskirts of a nice city . All three in separate South American countries . <p> Were far from rich , but that 's doable down here . None of them would be lavish . Just cozy , and perfectly located . The sale of just one McMansion would easily buy and furnish all three of the places I 'm thinking of . Possibly with a bit leftover as a cushion . You 'll want that cushion too . It might take years to find a decent income stream , and do n't  ask me what thatll be . <p> Probably something you never thought of before . Easiest option is buying , and renting out local real estate . <p> Contact me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin at TDV passports to take step number two . Based on what I 'm hearing , your USD may drop to a level whereby you wont be able to afford to leave . Suddenly the sale of your McMansion will get you much less house denominated in a stronger currency , like the Colombian peso , or Brazilian real . Maybe that 's the plan ? You need to be diversified , and in a jurisdiction which still respects due process of law . <p> If you 'd like to start on web-based business , we can do help with that as well . We can : <p> Establish the company in a tax-free jurisdiction Design , construct , and host the website itself Set up a company bank account in a privacy and due process respecting jurisdiction , and Establish a merchant account so you can accept credit card payments for your goods and services via the website .

But those were n't his only ideas Other ideas include shooting that guy while duck hunting and Haliburton 's selling nuclear technology to Iran . In fact Haliburton does not care whatsoever about which countries the US bans trades with . They 'll trade anyway with them . But Dick Cheney has only just recently had his best idea yet .. and he 's only on his second heart : <p> This is a brilliant idea which shows a true evolution in the man of Dick Cheney . 7 out of 10 Americans today believe the Iraq War was a bad idea but I think in ten years 7 out of 10 Americans will think this new Cheney idea was not such a bad one . He might even get a statue built for him . Once Americans know life without the District of Criminals ( DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all turn libertarians . <p> In order for someone to pull it off though they might need Dick Cheney as he acted like President on 9/11 when he pulled off the devastating terrorist attack and even caused the first building in recorded history to collapse at freefall speed from structural fires ( WTC Building 7 ) . To blow up DC the most evil minds are needed and Dick Cheney has proven himself . But 9/11is not the only feat Cheney has pulled off . <p> The War In Iraq was brought to us in large part by Dick Cheney 's work . Cheney gets things done . He undercut the CIA while in the White House instructing subordinates to stovepipe raw intelligence directly to his office . His intelligence agency at the Pentagon setup by himself and Donald Rumself helped gather and release much of the disinformation which led to the Iraq War . In December 2008 Dick Cheney admitted what most already knew : he was instrumental in initiating the Bush Era torture of waterboarding . He made up excuses in his book to make himself look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying on innocent Americans . Barton Gellman wrote in Time Magazine : <p> Cheney had devised , and Bush approved , an NSA operation to monitor the phone calls and emails of U.S. citizens without a warrant , part of which later became known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program . After more than two years of going along with " the vice president 's special program , " the Justice Department concluded that parts of it were illegal . Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey later told Congress , and authoritative sources confirmed privately last week , that Ashcroft decided on March 4 , 2004 to stop certifying the surveillance as lawful unless the White House scaled it back . <p> It is undisputable that Dick Cheney 's urged the federal government to spy on millions of non-terrorist Americans without a warrant . Cheney wanted the program to continue even after it was declared illegal . <p> Dick Cheney also worked for decades to bring unprecedented new powers to the White House with no respect for the limits the founding fathers placed on the Presidency ; that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gerald Ford Cheney Cheney worked dilligently to expand the powers of the President . <p> REDEMPTION <p> Dick Cheney is a self-aggrandizing criminal who should have been waterboarded and thrown in a cage many years ago . He used his knowledge and positions of power to undermine the public and start a war that has cost millions of lives . His manipulation of presidential decision-making sometimes even angered George W. Bush . While Cheney worked for Haliburton he did business with autocrats and even with enemies of the United States . By consolidating power in the White House , and going against the founders , spying on innocent Americans , encouraging war by disinformation and becoming directly complicit in torture Cheney has proven himself as one of the most evil and power-hungry reptile-humans on the planet . And that 's before we consider that he is one of the main suspects of in 9/11 . <p> But let 's forget his unpopularity as he left office in 2008 . Let 's forget the psychopathy . Just for a moment . <p> Mr. Cheney , if you read this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed planning a false flag attack much like the events of 9/11 ( which you and your cronies planned ) , I support your efforts . Nuking DC very well might be the only way for you to redeem yourself ( probably not ) and for the world to be liberated from the US war machine . We encourage you to use " precision strikes " on key players in DC , however , instead of a nuclear bomb , as this would be a much more humane way of going about the War on DC . Alternative press outlets have done a fansastic job in the 21st century identifying main criminals among those in DC and I believe we can spare many , many innocent lives , of which yours is not yet and probably wo n't ever be a part .

The reason why is simple . No other entity has the ability to take significant portions of your income and assets often over 50% and use it against you through well funded propaganda programs . It also uses your money and all of the fiat money it prints to infect nearly every avenue in society for its own gain . <p> The sciences have been completely infected . That is why , for example , " Global Warming " research is so well funded because it is a state-created crisis tailored to get even more of your money by taxing you on CO2 . Not many have pointed out the sheer arrogance of the state to not only come up with this scheme but to try to convince tree huggers and bleeding heart liberals that the air we breathe out of our bodies is dangerous and must be taxed and controlled ! But , thanks to the state , any scientist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get funding while anyone who contrasts the theory will never see another dime . <p> The education " system " is , as everyone knows , completely controlled by the government in most western countries . Theyve been doing this so long now that most people believe that we need the state to " educate " our children for the first 18 years of their life and beyond . And , again , we pay for our own indoctrination . <p> The media , as well , is usually one in the same with the state and even if it is n't , it is the recipient of large amounts of money again , your money from the political system to promote government programs and every election period for campaign ads . Not to mention the fact that most of their other advertisers are tied in one way or another to the state , like the pharmaceutical companies who are tied in with government to make sure no natural , cheap remedies ( marijuana etc. ) are ever allowed . This ensures that media never offers an anti-state message or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , the utmost in gall to take your money and then use it to make propaganda videos in order to deceive you into believing the state is necessary . The fact that so few people get angry about this is proof that people have now been so brainwashed they cant even see it for what it is . In fact , many people , upon seeing a propaganda video will actually feel thankful that they have the state to create these videos to help protect them . <p> Take for example this Department of Homeland Security propaganda video that has been making the rounds on the internet the last few days . <p> The video is laughable on almost every level ( if you have n't seen it , you must but do n't  drink anything while watching it or you 'll be spurting up your beverage through your nose on numerous occasions ) but very few people , upon seeing it , will be outraged that their own money is being used to directly control them even if they see that it is propaganda . <p> Is There Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing can become depressed that we will never be able to declare victory for the people . <p> There are reasons to be optimistic , however . <p> First , nearly every western state is on the verge of insolvency something that they will never recover from and , at the very least , any state that survives the coming collapse will be much smaller , by necessity . <p> And , secondly , thanks to the internet more and more people are awakening to see that they are just slaves in a tax farm and are either expatriating ( taking their assets and income earning potential to a place more accommodative ) or finding other ways to starve the beast . <p> Ghandi once said , " withholding of payment of taxes is one of the quickest methods of overthrowing a government " .

I absolutely despise being here but much of the media is here and if I want to get out the TDV message to the American masses I have to come here from time to time . <p> My trip could n't have started more apropos . My driver dropped me off at Acapulco airport one of my favorite airports because it is small and normally incredibly laid back and easy . But , I had never taken a direct flight from Acapulco to the US ( Houston ) . In the past Ive always flown through Mexico City or Tijuana and then onward but the best flight available , last minute , was a United flight direct to Houston . <p> I winced , as United is one of my least favorite airlines but decided to book it .

But , still quite happy to be in Acapulco , I took it off and gave them a bit of a stern look . <p> I then walked through and the metal detector did n't even beep but they wanted to use their metal detecting wand on me and were patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person came up and rubbed some cotton swabs all over my clothes and even my palms . I just stood there in confusion still . I have been in about 50 airports in the last month and continued to look around just to make sure I was in Acapulco . Because this was not normal at the Acapulco airport . <p> I shrugged it off and then went to the gate and began to board when I was stopped by another woman with some sort of machine that looked like a dustbuster . Another man told me to sit down and take off my shoes . Now I had had enough . <p> I said , " Is this the US or Acapulco ? " <p> The young man just shrugged as I kicked off my shoes and threw them in his general direction . <p> " Enjoy looking at my dirty shoes , " I said . <p> As with most Acapulquenos he was non-confrontational and quickly looked over my shoes . <p> Finally realizing what was going on that they do this when there is a US direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Acapulco , why are you doing the bidding of the US government ? " <p> He shrugged nicely again and I continued , " This is sad . Acapulco is a beautiful and amazing place are you going to let it turn into the USSA ? " <p> He handed back my shoes and nodded . <p> As I walked onto the plane I looked back and said , " Get an honorable job . Do n't let this happen to Acapulco . " <p> He nodded and smiled embarrasingly . <p> I then boarded the United flight and the difference between it and any other Mexican airline was immediately obvious . The plane was about fifty years old and the overweight flight attendant was sweating and looked incredibly stressed . She went up and down the aisles telling people what to do , in English , despite the fact that more than half the passengers were Mexican and obviously did n't speak English . <p> When one mother of two children did n't understand what she was telling her , the flight attendant just repeated in English louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to put her 3 year old son in a seat with seatbelt and not on her lap . I was just about to interrupt and help the situation when three other Mexican passengers who spoke English all got up and explained to the mother what the flight attendant was saying and tried to calm the flight attendant down as she was almost going into a nervous breakdown that this woman was not complying to her commands that she did n't understand . <p> We finally took off and I closed my eyes and just tried to forget I was on United and going to the US when , only two minutes after take-off the flight attendant started running up and down the aisles in some sort of frenzy . We were still ascending and so this was quite unusual . And , she had her cellphone out and appeared to be taking photos something I found strange as she had just spent the last 20 minutes admonishing everyone with a cellphone that they had to turn it off ( which , actually , the FAA has finally overturned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did n't feel like informing this insane woman of the news earlier . <p> Then the plane did a 180 turn and it was quite obvious we were heading back to Acapulco . I cant say I was overly unhappy about that . I was not looking forward to going to the US despite the business I needed to do . They then instructed us to sit near the gate as they said we may be going at any minute . That minute turned into five hours and I called my wife and asked her if I could just come back home and be happy . <p> My wife is also an anarcho-capitalist and she said , " No , Jeff , you have to go . Its for business . " <p> So I sat and waited . Finally I noticed people filtering off and decided to ask the United attendant what was going on . <p> " Oh , we cancelled the flight . The plane needs maintenance , " she said . <p> I again called my wife and got the same response . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business at 10am and it was already midnight and I had n't even left yet . She told me to find a way . And , being an anarcho-capitalist myself , I knew I had to find a way . <p> I checked with the other Mexican airlines if there was any way I could make it to New York before 9am and the AeroMexico attendant was eminently helpful . I explained my situation and she spent 30 minutes calling people and on the internet looking for a way to get me there and finally found a way I could . <p> She pulled every contact and string she could and we had a nice conversation in between phone calls . She finally , on one phone call , gave me the thumbs up . <p> She handed me my boarding passes for a way to get me to NYC by 8am and I said , " Thank you so much for all your help . I think , after all that , I am going to go have a cigarette . " <p> She said , " After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if she wanted to join me and she laughed , " I do n't  smoke but that was stressful ! " <p> I arrived at New York at 8am and after my taxi driver got into a shoving match with the hotel bellboy over something I did n't  understand I had a 1 minute shower and put on some fresh clothes just in time for the Fox driver to pick me up . <p> I was then on with Stuart Varney at Fox . I have to defend him somewhat . Every time I am on with him in the YouTube comments everyone says he is an ignorant fool . Having spent enough time with him now I can say he may have no idea about technology nor even money but it is no great sleight against him . What he is , really , is just an actor . I see him before and after each interview and he is just joking around he does n't  care . Then , the teleprompters come on and he just reads off it . <p> In general he is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but understand , is he really does n't  let his guests talk for more than about 5 seconds at a time . But , that 's fine , it is just a show and I understand that . <p> He said the same thing he always talks when discussing Bitcoin with me . He always strongly states , " So , you expect me to give you my HARD , REAL money for a virtual currency ? " <p> And he always cuts me off before I explain that US dollars are as virtual as bitcoin . But , I was happy to see this meme circulating on the internet that someone made after the interview . <p> I then headed to Central Park to film another edition of Anarchast with liberty rocker Jordan Page and then made my way to Bloomberg for another interview . <p> This time I was very happily surprised ! I was unfamiliar with the host , Mark Crumpton , despite him being with Bloomberg since 1992 . He was different than Varney . He really seemed to understand what I was talking about . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the things I was saying he took negatively or positively . Then the interview appeared to end very abruptly and I thought to myself , " Here we go again , they are cutting me off for saying too much truth . " <p> The lights dimmed and he sat silent . I thought for sure he was going to tell me to get out . Then , after all the cameras were off he handed me his business card and told me , " I wish we had an hour to talk about the things you were talking about . " <p> I have to say after decades of being on a multitude of media around the world I really like the Bloomberg people . They are n't  just talking heads for the most part and actually are quite capitalist and think about things . Its too bad that Nanny Bloomberg turned into such a fascist dictator . <p> He invited me back and I will be happy to accept the request . <p> THE POSITIVES <p> I 've talked quite negatively about my short excursion to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as happens almost anywhere I go in the world , a number of TDVers made it out for some drinks . And , I got to hang out with one of my heroes again . We hung out at Galts Gulch Chile a lot last week but he was back in his home town and took me out for an interesting night . <p> The person I am talking about is Luke Rudkowski , the founder of what is fast becoming a global media empire , We Are Change . <p> I have to say that he is one of the most impressive young men I have ever met . If you are not familiar with him he is this generations top investigative journalist . While most journalists just read off of teleprompters and government press releases , Luke confronts all the " untouchables " , from Henry Kissinger to the Rothschilds , Dick Cheney and countless others and has a large network worldwide , including in Chile , of other people like him who hunt down the aggressors and point a camera in their face and ask the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have my first protege Luke . He is full of massive potential but does n't  necessarily understand how to monetize what he is doing something that Ive known how to do for the last 20 years . <p> Luke , like me , seems to have a worldwide network wherever he goes . I was invited but could n't make it to the We Are Change mansion party in Santiago last week but got to meet many of Lukes inner circle of freedom fighters last night in NYC . <p> They took me to their anarchist hangout , Circa Taba , in Soho . Its the only bar in NYC where you can still smoke and about 20 of Lukes colleagues joined . It felt very much like sitting in a smoky backroom in East Germany planning the resistance or like we often do at Mangos in Acapulco , discussing anarchist philosophy . Or , like we did at Galt 's Gulch Chile last week , plotting our plans to use jury nullification and the advent of the Just Us movement to remove unjust laws . <p> As well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judd Weiss , was in town . I will likely be seeing him again later tonight in Brooklyn for a libertarian party . He snapped this photo of Luke and I from the streets of New York . <p> I have been sitting at a typical chain restaurant bar , Ruby Tuesdays , in Times Square as I wrote this and have just come back from the bathroom . On the way up the steps to the bathroom were numerous homeless people sleeping . And a homeless person who looked scared in the bathroom . I then walked outside for a cigarette and numerous homeless and crazy people asked me for cigarettes , which I provided . <p> This place is really going downhill fast . I am about to step off into the night and walk through the garbage strewn streets and sidestep most of the homeless people and gangsters . I 'll be back in Mexico soon , hopefully all my Mexican friends and family are worried about me being in a dangerous country like the USSA . <p> Until next week , love your friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy each day like it is your last . Everytime I see Luke I shake his hand like it may be the last time because it just might . Unless he moves to Chile or Mexico , which he has told me is his plan and I have told him I 'll do whatever I can to help when he needs it . <p> Not that everything is negative here or anywhere in the world but I see dark clouds gathering and it may be a thousand black swans darkening the skies in this region . In the end , however , if more people awaken to what is really going on we can mostly survive intact and move on to a world more peaceful and prosperous than we can imagine . 
@@99475331 @3675331/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Charles Schumer Tells Americans They Ca n't Leave So Easily <p> We wrote about Facebook co-founder , Eduardo Saverin , defecting from the US last week ( " The Great Defection From The West " ) . Apparently we werent the only ones to notice . <p> Today , Lyin Chuck Schumer held a news conference to unveil the " Ex-PATRIOT " " Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy " Act to respond directly to Saverins move , which they dub a " scheme " that would " help him duck up to $67 million in taxes . " <p> Parasites do n't  like it when their host can leave so quickly and easily . Schumer plans to use violence to re-impose taxes on expatriates like Saverin even after they flee the United States and take up residence in a foreign country . Their proposal would also impose a mandatory 30 percent tax on the capital gains of anybody who renounces their U.S. citizenship . And , perhaps most importantly , the plan would bar individuals like Saverin from ever reentering the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US , this proposed legislation frightens me more than all of the USs previous , rapidly escalating police state moves combined . " <p> We agree . This bill , if passed , would take the state of affairs between the US Government and the people they deem to own to an entirely new level . To say the least , Schumers financial terrorist attacks today show the US Government for what it really is and shows US citizens as the tax slaves that they are . <p> Even that old refrain from brainwashed patriots that , " If you do n't  like it you can leave , " would no longer be sufficient . It would have to be amended to , " If you do n't  like it , we will rob you and you can never be allowed to return here under threat of violence . " Not quite as snappy of a comeback . <p> But , as with all government programs it will have the opposite effect of its intention . You do n't  think many wealthy people are n't  looking at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill is enacted ? And furthermore , now the government is saying that they will tax you more and you can never return the next logical step once tax revenues decline even further after more wealthy Americans defect will be to not allow people to leave at all . Schumers bill has it right in the title , " Expatriation Prevention " . You cant get much clearer than that . <p> This is how all socialist-styled systems end . You did n't  think that fence on the border with Mexico was to keep Mexicans out , did you ? At this rate , it wont be too much longer until Americans are washing up , straggly and malnourished in makeshift boats on the shores of caribbean islands begging for asylum . <p> THE GOVERNMENT OWNS YOU <p> The US Government considers its citizens as their property . Their tax slaves . And the assets of their citizens are also deemed to be theirs that 's why Charlie Schumer is outraged . One of his best tax slaves just got away . Its like a farmer losing a prized cow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US . After the Facebook IPO hed have a massive capital gain and a hefty amount of it would be absconded by the Government . With what he had left hed have to pay heavy taxes on any income he earned from his assets over the course of his lifetime , surely billions more in tax payments . And then , even when he dies , a death tax ( estate tax ) would take another 35% of his assets . <p> Saverin , who was born in Brazil and who has lived in Singapore since 2009 , would have been a very lucrative tax cow for years to come . Poor Schumer and the rest of the US Government henchmen must have been thinking , " We cant allow this to continue . We need that money . Those innocent women and children over in Afghanistan are n't  just going to bomb themselves . " <p> WE TOLD YOU SO <p> We hate being the guys who always tell you we told you so but we told you so ! We 've said for years that the western nation-states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive people to leave the country or get their assets outside of the country . <p> Today should be a massive wake-up call for anyone who has been considering those options but has been on the fence . The US Government showed its true colors . They own you and your assets . <p> We know your spouse does n't  believe what you are telling them . Most people are programmed to believe their nightly news and what their friends tell them . They may even think you are crazy for wanting to get some of your assets outside of the country . <p> People who prepare for rare events seem crazy until it happens . Then they seem pretty smart . <p> WHAT CAN YOU DO <p> It is absolutely critical for all those who live in the western world and who own assets to get a significant percentage of their assets outside of their own country now . And it is also highly prudent to get a second passport to give yourself options should your own government begin to restrict travel and expatriation . We expect that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be too long before the US disallows dual citizenship meaning they wo n't allow you to get a second foreign passport . So get one now before it is too late . <p> Here is what any reasonable person in the west should be doing today : <p> Close out retirement savings accounts and move the assets outside of the country ( see more on why here , " Forget Retirement and Retirement Savings " ) . If you do not wish to close out your retirement accounts there may be options . In the US you can move your IRA assets outside of the country via a self-directed IRA ( see more on getting one here ) . <p> Start the process to get a second passport . There are ways to get a second passport in less than a month ( contact TDVPassports.com for more ) . <p> Start up an International Business Corporation and get a bank account in an offshore jurisdiction ( see more at TDVOffshore.com ) . <p> Do n't  delay .

@@99475333 @3675333/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> The Unbearable Lightness of Leaving 28883 @qwx888883 <p> Memories are a moveable feast . <p> The thought occurred to me last week while I was walking my dog down the gravel road at the end of my driveway . The trees were a festival of color , the air was crisp , the road was idyllically quiet . I tried to memorize the scene and the feeling . <p> When I move to the Newer World , I will miss aspects of Canada . My willingness to say goodbye is an indication of how deeply I believe North America has become a careening danger to the freedom and well-being of those who dissent . <p> And , yet , it does n't seem that way . Yesterday , I watched the first snow flutter onto my fields , making everything the same white and clean as it has been for winter after winter . It seemed impossible to believe my life has changed dramatically . Especially since the change comes from intangible things like the rule of law and the protections of due process that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , America has raced to become a police state and Canada is being pulled along with it . <p> I realized a key reason why people did not leave Germany in the 1930s , but chose to ignore the warning signs instead . They did n't believe the warnings . Not in their hearts . Not in the gut . They were like me , watching the snow dance on the wind . They woke up in their own homes under familiar blankets , they ate the same cereal for breakfast , and drove down well known streets to the job at which they 'd worked for years . Everything was as it had always been . The fact that the legal structure , political protections , and other institutions that guarded freedom were going , going , gone was not as real to them as their daily routines . As trite as it may sounds , many people simply did not notice the erosion of freedom on a daily basis . Germans in the early Nazi years were like current Americans . <p> There is a remarkable memoir entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haffner ( a pseudonym ) after he emigrated from Germany to England with his Jewish wife in 1938 . In it , Haffner explores how a highly cultured and civilized nation could slip so quickly into barbaric totalitarianism . The book parallels my own amazement at a nation like America with a track record of freedom could slip so quickly into a police state . In a 2002 review of Defying Hitler , Steven Martinovich commented , " The process of statism was so slow that one could almost understand how one day Germans walked the street as members of a shaky democracy and the next were prisoners . Between those two days , the Germany Haffner grew up in both figuratively and literally disappeared . " <p> From one day to the next , North America is disappearing . Even to me , it sometimes seems to be the same place in which I grew up because everything is so familiar . But the political and institutional framework that supported rights and enabled peaceful individuals to simply live their lives is gone . Freedom of speech has been replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most personal of communications . Due process has been gutted by an administration that executes Americans without trial and promotes torture . The militarized police are indistinguishable from regular armed forces who occupy their own nation as though it were a conquered one . The school system is a blatant propaganda machine with buildings that look like penitentiaries . Rights have become state-granted privileges with the basic human right to travel becoming more restrictive at every step . <p> Institutions either work to maintain freedom or to establish tyranny . Why ? Because human beings are not born good or evil ; they are born with a capacity for both . Social institutions exert a powerful influence on which tendency prevails . <p> Those who fear that human nature is prone to evil often argue that state control is necessary to ensure a peaceful society . But the state causes the worst aspects of man to flourish because it richly rewards the criminal within man while discouraging what 's peaceful and harmonious . The state is a thief and an arrogant bully who is given free rein to steal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable laws , even for having a disobedient attitude . The state becomes a ' legitimized ' vehicle for criminals to impose organized force upon a society that would otherwise function through trade or other voluntary exchange . <p> The state nurtures what is bad within man . The more powerful the state , the worse the human beings . Friedrich Hayek explained , " Advancement within a totalitarian group depends largely on a willingness to do immoral things . " The economist Frank H. Knight added , " The probability of the people in power being individuals who would dislike the possession and exercise of power is on a level with the probability that an extremely tenderhearted person would get the job of whipping master in a slave plantation . " <p> The institutions in America which promote the best within man , such as the free market , have been replaced by those that promote immoral criminality . In Defying Hitler , Haffner noted how the rise of the total state began to change the very nature of the individuals in society . The best of human characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the state . Neighbors were more likely to report each other to authorities , sometimes to settle a petty grudge ; people did not speak freely in public places like restaurants and hushed companions who did so ; strangers suspected and watched each other . In short , the state changed the character of the people , of the nation itself . A cultured people like the Germans descended into barbarism . A free people like the Americans are being reduced to chattel slavery . And as the process occurs , the nature of the American people will change . <p> I have no quarrel with those who believe the sound institutions and character of North America can be restored . I wish them well . But there is a point when the Haffner solution of walking away may be necessary . It is the unbearable lightness of leaving . " Unbearable " because so much is being left behind that it can feel like abandoning your life . " Lightness " because a great weight falls away and possibilities fill a new future . <p> Editor 's Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do n't you wish you could too ? Why ca n't you ? <p> We 're so happy to announce our first gathering of current and future Gulch members , October 30-November 4 at our on site location in Curacavi , Chile . <p> Our Team has so many things planned for you to experience the best of what Chile and Galts Gulch have to offer .

More specifically , how do they earn enough money to eat out , drive , shop , and support the collateral damage of all that relentless fucking evidenced by the plethora of strollers found at every restaurant , shopping center , and gas station ? <p> With a keen eye , an open mind , and enough caffeine running through my veins to awaken a Celebration of hibernating polar bears , I have triangulated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's general public are reasonably pleasant , if inauthentic , zombies , who work in various service industries , standing behind counters and tables and bars with plastic smiles and no interest in serving anyone and who make little effort to hide their unmitigated despise of what they do for $8- or $9- or $10-an-hour . To that conclusion , I just left my second Exxon gas station where the attendant , in this case , Missy , could not figure out how to turn on the gas pump . <p> Most in the " do you want fries with that " sector of the economy are uneducated like Missy , poor and stupid , but not in that order .

The only way I could delay having to pay back my student loans was go to law school . If I do n't get a job when I graduate , I am fucked !

This is not hard at all and the easiest way to change your attractiveness level . This does n't mean you have to become Arnold Schwarzenegger ( although that would n't hurt at all ) , it means , if you are quite fat or incredibly skinny , do something about it . <p> If you are overweight , try different diets . Many different ones work in terms of reshaping your body . As example , when I had put on a bit too much weight once I tried the Atkins diet ( no carbs , essentially ) for about three months . As with everything I do , I did it to the extreme and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I dropped about 40 pounds of fat in a few months . I mostly did it as an experiment but it just goes to show what you can do if you want to . <p> Then there are things like steroids . When I was 21 , and still a virgin for obvious reasons ( see photo below ) I decided I had had enough of being a virgin and despite going to the gym every day I could n't put on any muscle gain . <p> So , I did steroids . Two months later I looked like this . <p> Steroids have all kinds of positives and negatives so you should definitely do your research . But , again , this just goes to show how quickly you can transform your body . I gained forty pounds in two months and went from being the weakest guy in the gym to the strongest in that time period . <p> Once you have your body looking good then turn to other features about yourself that can be improved . As example , I got Lasik eye surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a large mole on my face removed and fixed my ridiculous hair situation . <p> So , very quickly , I had gone from very physically unattractive to reasonably physically attractive and ANYONE can do this . <p> That is just the first step , however . <p> To finish off with physical things , before we get to the more important things , dress well ! This does n't mean you have to be wearing tuxedoes everywhere you go like Jeffrey Tucker and look like you walked out of a fashion magazine ( although that can work too , as Jeffrey shows ! ) . <p> It just means finding something relatively fashionable and well fitting . The easiest way to do this is to find a female to go shopping with you . I know , it 's painful . Most guys hate to shop , but it is worth a few hours , believe me . <p> I discovered this decades ago and for a period of time I found one woman who ran a fairly exclusive store and I would go in once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was an expert who new style and fit and she knew exactly what would work for my bodystyle and lifestyle . Since then , I just got my girlfriends or now , my wife , to buy all my clothes for me . They actually love it . Women love to shop , from what I can tell , and they will spend all day finding you the best clothes to make them feel proud to stand beside you . <p> Once you have your body and clothes sorted then we can get on to the most important part about being attractive to women . <p> You have to DO something and be PASSIONATE about something . If you work at the mall and come home and smoke weed and play video games you are not doing anything and certainly are n't passionate about anything important . <p> You probably do n't even like yourself if you do that so why would anyone else ? <p> And reading and memorizing Rothbard and Mises books is n't a passion . A passion is what you DO with that knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it . It does n't even matter if you fail ( in fact your failures will make you into a stronger/better person through the experience ) . <p> If any of the above is a problem for you to do then you have mental/emotional issues ( we all do ) which are holding you back and you need to focus on those . Focus on finding out your own issues and work on repairing them . If you are shy then find out why and work on fixing it . When I was in my teens I was so shy that I could n't talk to anyone . I decided that I needed to fix that and I decided to become a rapper to force myself to go on stage and interact . I failed as a rapper , only becoming the #2 white rapper in Canada in the 1980s but I had rid myself of most of my shyness through the process . <p> If you can achieve some or all of the above you will find that women will come to you , instead of vice-versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not go on Facebook and whine and complain that you ca n't find women . Nobody finds that attractive . <p> WOMEN <p> Not being a woman I will keep this very short . But , I have known many women in my life who complain that they just ca n't seem to attract the kind of man they want . <p> Here is a short but crucial tip . You attract things due to your energy . If you are constantly attracting scumbags over an extended period of time then you are giving off the wrong energy . <p> Worse , though , when I try to point this out to some women they get very angry at me for having said they are not perfect as they are . This should be the opposite response that they should give if what they truly want is to find a happy relationship . That response shows , in a way , that they are not willing to improve themselves and many , in my estimation , seek a certain satisfaction and comfort in their unhappiness . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complain about men rather than look inward to find out what it is they are doing wrong to attract the wrong people into their lives . <p> This is the most important factor I see in female unhappiness . <p> Of course , everything I said above for men applies for women as well . If you are overweight then fix it . Although , a woman with a few extra pounds is not unattractive to most males . But , women constantly obsess about it , which makes them more unattractive . If you are not happy with yourself why do you think others would be ? <p> If you are dramatically overweight , however , then fix that . If you are 100 pounds overweight you do n't need to get down to being a bikini model it may not even be possible . But if you can get down to a healthy weight , even if it is 20-30 pounds of fat still , you will be far more attractive to others . <p> IT IS NEVER TOO LATE <p> You may be a woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your 60s who is lonely and unhappy . Snap out of it . Change it . <p> I 've known men in their 80s who have beautiful middle aged women fawning over them due to their passion and style . And there are now women in their 60s and 70s who are still very attractive . <p> It is never too late . If you blame the opposite sex for your problems you already have lost . Everything that happens to you is your own fault . Ca n't find decent men ? You are giving off the wrong energy , have n't worked on yourself enough or are looking in the wrong places . Fix that . <p> Ca n't get the women you desire ? Same answer . <p> Just because we are libertarians or anarcho-capitalists does n't mean we are perfect . We are still human beings . We may be more philosophically and morally sound than most others but that does n't mean we do n't all need to improve ourselves . <p> Make yourself into the person you want to be and the world will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you just have to do it . <p> Even if we eventually reach our goal of a free and prosperous world , if you have not worked on yourself and are still lonely then you wo n't be happy and fulfilled . It all starts with you . <p> Everything that happens to you is your own fault ? Not sure how you worked that out.So you build up , get in perfect shape , only to find attractive women are still completely unattracted to you because you have an ugly face , i.e inherited the wrong genes.Natural inborn looks are vastly more important than being in shape or dressing well.If your ugly , getting built and dressing well will boost your SMV from say a 5 to a 6 , maybe . <p> I See Dead Trolls <p> I 'm certain that at least a few libertarians have " hooked up , " but those hookups normally involve prostitutes or lonely pornography . Some get imbecilic breeder wives . Does that count ? 
@@99475339 @3675339/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> America : In Memoriam <p> Editor 's Note : The following post is by TDV correspondent , Christopher P. be , totally dissolved . " Richard Henry Lee , June 7 , 1776 <p> This proposal was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 2 , 1776 . So technically speaking , July 2nd is Americas true Independence Day . Certainly John Adams fully expected it to be celebrated as such : <p> " The second day of July , 1776 the great anniversary festival . . . It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade . . . from one end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " <p> July 4th is the day in which the Declaration of Independence was adopted as the rationale for the separation which had just occurred . The fact that Americans started celebrating the 4th , and not the 2nd , means their Independence Day was not the celebration of an act , but the acclamation of an underlying reason . It means Americans recognized that while many nations have been birthed in revolution , few have been reared in principle . It was perhaps the proudest distinction of Americans as they recognized this holiday far before the Federal government codified it as such . <p> And what is this principle ? The recognition of individual rights derived from natural law , including the right of revolution . Amazingly , this discussion in the Declaration accounts for a fairly small portion of the document because late 18th-century Americans readily accepted and agreed with these ideas . But they did not all agree that separation from King George was warranted , so most of the document is devoted to proving a conspiracy theory against the King : " when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism . " The Declaration is primarily an indictment . <p> Todays citizens of America are no longer late 18th-century Americans . By this statement I refer not to time , but to temperament . Few Americans today embrace the philosophy contained in the Declaration . Today in America , the exercise of individual rights is more alien than inalienable . <p> When did this change ? While there are certainly many steps , both large and small , but I believe the definitive end can be marked by the Supreme Courts reversal of Hepburn v Griswold ( February 7 , 1870 ) . Hepburn found the issuance of fiat currency by the Federal government to be unconstitutional . Incredibly , the opinion was written by Chief Justice Chase the very man who issued the " greenbacks " as Treasury Secretary . The reasoning behind his majority opinion was well stated : <p> " . . . to make notes a legal tender . . . carries the doctrine of implied powers very far beyond any extent hitherto given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes an end within the scope of a general power , whether , in the correct sense of the word , appropriate or not , may be done in the exercise of an implied power . . . It would convert the government , which the people ordained as a government of limited powers , into a government of unlimited powers . It would confuse the boundaries which separate the executive and judicial from the legislative authority . It would obliterate every criterion which this court . . . established for the determination of the question whether legislative Acts are constitutional or unconstitutional . " <p> 447 days later , the Supreme Court reversed this ruling with Knox v. Lee ( May 1 , 1871 ) . With Knox , every criterion was obliterated . All it took was the appointment of two justices by President Grant . Such was the fragility of American liberty . <p> Knox did not inflict the first damage on the Constitution , for it had previously sustained Marbury v. Madison and endured McCulloch v. Maryland . It was not its last breath , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the last chance to restore restraint . Knox was the mortal wound . With this power , the Federal government could inflate the currency at will . It could transfer wealth from the populace to itself , facilitate proliferate spending , and create the recessions so commonly used as a pretext for government encroachment on American liberties . <p> This Thursday , while most Americans will be celebrating with " pomp and parade " , I urge American readers to mark the day with a somber reflection of how much their society has changed , a fond remembrance as to what made America great , and a firm resolve to never abandon the principles of the Declaration . <p> The best way to honor America , the principles of the Declaration , and the concept of independence ( both colonial Americas and yours ) is to protect yourself from the United States government through TDV services , like TDV Passports or TDV Offshore . It is what a true patriot would do . <p> 1Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) promoted the theory that the Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers between the federal government and the states . McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) asserted the primacy of the federal government over the states . <p> 2Korematsu v. U.S. ( 1944 ) condoned the internment of innocent Americans of Japanese ancestry . Wickard v. Filburn ( 1942 ) excused unlimited power by the federal government through the Commerce Clause . <p> Christopher P.

Using Austrian economic theory , Mr. Casey advises wealthy individuals on their investment portfolios to maximize their returns and minimize risk in todays world of significant government intervention . Mr. Casey can be reached at 312-650-9602 or at email protected . <p> It 's fascinating to read about the specific instances that degraded the Republicbut I think it 's vital to remember that degradation of liberty is the inevitable result of having a State at all . The State is congealed aggression . Its very nature is theft and force . Never mind the " services " it claims to provide with the stolen money or by pointing guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract to limit itself and defend liberty is like locking a fox in your henhouse in order to keep your chickens happy and healthy . <p> Americans will be spending the day celebrating freedoms they 've come to hate . But many liberty-minded people will mark the day by lamenting how far the Republic has fallen . I advise them not to bother . The Revolutionary War was a violent coup that established the new ruling elite . A relatively benign thug was replaced by a new master that would grow into the greatest monster the world would ever know . The Constitution itself was a con job to convince the people that their freedoms would be protected . The Constitution gave the political class the perfect cover to get to this point . <p> We will not be truly free till humanity outgrows its pathological need for masters in the form of a State . Any State at all . 
@@99475341 @3675341/ <h> The Weekend Vigilante September 22nd , 2012 <p> We are just wrapping up a great and eventful conference here in Bocas . Last week we were talking with Doug Casey and he mentioned that because the conference is in Panama , where the US Government has a decent size foothold , to expect " at least one or two spooks " in the audience . <p> I did n't think much of it , but as I arrived on the first night I had an experience that was certainly unusual and slightly circumspect . You tell me what you think of this . <p> We were standing beachside on the opening evening of the conference enjoying some " rum punch " and each other 's company when an attractive , blonde woman approached . She stated that she had flown half way around the world just to meet me . I asked her where she lived but she did n't really respond with anything concrete . I then asked her what she did for a living again , no real concrete answer . So I thanked her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and she became more and more flirtatious until at one point , it was pretty clear what else she wanted . <p> Now , not to sound big-headed , but this actually does happen a fair amount . So up until this point I had no reason to think she was anything but a TDV " groupie " . The night went on and many more rum punches were consumed and things get a bit hazy after that . But here is where it gets strange . The next day the conference begins and I was the first to speak . About 3 hours into the conference the organizer of the event , Bobby Casey , noticed a very high tech recording device hidden behind a pillar . He checked it and it was recording so he turned it off , pulled out the memory card , erased it , kept the card and waited to see who would eventually come to pick up the device . <p> Finally , up comes the blonde girl and Bobby asks her , " What exactly are you doing ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay to record the conference . Bobby was on rum punch the night before , too , but he definitely did n't remember that . So then she said , " It was your partner , Steve , who said I could record . " Steve was standing right there and immediately told her that he definitely never said that . She then grabbed her recording device and stormed off . <p> This is where the speculation begins . Was she just some girl who likes to record audio at these conferences with a discretely placed high tech recording device ? Or was she something more worrisome CIA ? IRS ? <p> We spent many more rum punches thinking this over and many people at the conference either have first or second hand experience , either from the inside or the outside with the CIA and we eventually ruled out the CIA . Why ? If she was CIA , she was far too clumsy and , according to most people at the conference , true CIA is very good at what they do . So , many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just likes recording expatriation based conferences ! <p> One person said to me , if she was sent by the US Government to try to " seduce " me and get dirt on me , that it was a scary thought . I replied , it 's not really all that scary . I do n't say anything in real life that I do n't say in public , or in writing and nothing we are doing is illegal , even in " everything is illegal " USA . And , despite our belief that taxation is a criminal act , we do n't even advise Americans to evade them what we say is , just get out , if you can . Run away . So , they are n't going to get anything on me . Therefore , by the US Government sending girls to conferences to try to seduce me , I just consider it a state based outcall escort service and it 's free ! I have no complaints about that .

@@99475342 @3675342/ <h> Do n't  Worry About Buying Local <p> Like every well-adjusted human being , I love getting stuff . I love being able to shell out the money I 've won or earned and participate in the market system that keeps producing all sorts of goodies that constantly improve the quality of material life . <p> And now the time of year has rolled around when buying stuff becomes something between sport , spectacle , and duty . Whether religious or not , the holidays are outright magical , especially in those climates that spawned the reverent observance of winter and the cold , dark part of the life cycle in the first place . The much ( and stupidly ) maligned commercial aspect of Christmas can be seen as the struggle to make life comfortable even when the reminders of life 's ultimate nature and ultimate results are closest . <p> It 's the marriage of the sacred with material acquisition . And as usual you can count on the politicians and their economically muddle-minded enablers to kill the buzz . A few days ago The Daily Caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly annoying annual National Defense Authorization Act which would seek to add a sales tax to online sales . That 's annoying enough . But it 's the federal government and economic illiteracy should be as expected as spectacular hypocrisy and violence . What caught my eye and my ire was this passage : <p> " A recent poll indicates that the majority of Americans support the idea , describing an online sales tax as ' common sense ' . They also feel that a tax for online purchases would encourage people to buy local and keep tax dollars in their community . <p> " ' Local retailers invest in their communities and play a significant role in the overall quality of life in the places we call home , ' said Betsy Laird , senior vice president of global public policy for the International Council of Shopping Centers . " <p> Jiminy Christmas , I am sick of this " buy local " nonsense . And I am sick of how incredibly economically illiterate and pro-tax Americans can be . <p> First of all , let 's dispense with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an attempt to influence behavior , to force people to make economic decisions that create winners not decided by the market but by government policy . This tax , like all taxes , is theft with the intention of politically influencing an outcome instead of letting individuals ( the market ) sort out the winners and losers . <p> But in this particular case , the tax is an attempt to eliminate one of the great powers of the Internet . The Internet has allowed people to make connections that transcend the old models and the state itself with its usual confiscations . <p> The " buy local " stuff is a fallacy born of short-sightedness and midwifed by a gullibility for trite phrases like " buy American " and " support our troops " . First let 's look at the argument taken to the absurd levels . Why limit economic transactions to within a certain arbitrary perimeter , like the nation-state or the township ? Imagine if your local car dealer only " bought local " , if he refused to buy a car whose materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafted and put together in the local factory . Same goes for your grocer . What if he only ever bought animal meat or milk or produce from farmers within 10 miles of his shop , even if buying from another 10 miles out allowed him to provide similar quality for lower prices ? Or maybe the " buy local " people and the politicians would be okay if the materials gathered where in the same county , or state , or country ? Where does it stop ? How many economic bad decisions have to be made to satisfy the arbitrary notion of local-ness ? How much higher pricing do we put up with ? And what counts as " local " , anyway ? What the politicians or your dumb neighbors decide . Why not let the individual consumer decide where and with whom he should spend his money ? <p> There is room for the local merchant alongside the online one . And turns out neither your neighbors nor local or federal government has to get involved . It comes down to basic economic factors of consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your local merchant stocks the kinds of things he calculates local folks will want immediately at the quantity and price that will attract enough business to make him a profit . He wo n't stock those items that people would rather buy online at lower prices and for which they do n't mind waiting for shipping . The online merchant is just another competitor in a sea of competitors and it requires no special legislation to deal with . Just the usual business sense . The consumers and the merchants can work it out themselves . Some things make less sense to buy at the store in the age of the Internet merchant . There 's nothing to fix here . The market adjusts itself . <p> Does this mean that there may be smaller and fewer Main Street businesses ? Maybe . But this need n't be a bad thing ! People apparently eat up the tear-jerking primetime drama of the mom-and-pop going out of business because some corporate chain moves in . But those evil chains provide good jobs and benefits to hundreds and thousands of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selections and lower prices . Thanks to the mom-and-pop-killing chain , consumers in a given community are left with more money to spend on other things , like physically improving their local surroundings . Mom-and-pop can stop overcharging their customers for a limited selection and instead contribute their labor to something that serves everyone better . Maybe they can get a job with benefits at the new corporate chain . <p> We must remember that no form of business is sacred and impermanent . And we should be glad about that ! Thank god refrigeration has transformed the open air market . Thank heaven for climate-controlled centralized indoor shopping in the dead of winter and heart of summer . And we should be glad that certain businesses are no longer needed and have died like the ice delivery man who provided ice for the ice box , or the urban horse carcass-removal service . And we should n't mourn as certain businesses contract and die . It 's a part of the process as the technology and the markets lift our lives to higher levels of convenience , efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nostalgic people who are also economically illiterate weep at the idea that the brick and mortar bookstore will become a thing of the past . Congressman and dunderhead Jesse Jackson Jr . made quite the stink last year about this very thing when he blamed the e-readers for killing brick and mortar bookstores . You can download just about any book into your PC or electronic reader , or if you still like the touch and feel of physical books , you can order the physical version online and usually for cheaper than the bookstore downtown will have it . Plus , it will be delivered right to your door . <p> But there will still be a market for people who want to go downtown and get their books immediately instead of waiting for them to ship . Just as there will be a market for people who rather rummage around a bookstore than shop online . No need to create choice-altering tax policy to punish evolution . People will act according to their innate preferences and the market will adjust the supply of brick and mortar bookstores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as outrageously stupid as providing tax breaks to horse-riders over car-drivers to satisfy some romantic notion that cities full of horses are horse-drawn carriages are what everyone would or " should " prefer . <p> It 's a matter of letting the market be free to do its thing , which is an economist 's way of saying let people make their own choices with their money without the political pressure of prohibition or sales taxeslet things shake out as they will in response to consumer demand . That does n't mean corporations buying regulatory favors from the state to reduce competition . It merely means letting people choose what 's best for them in their own estimation . <p> Quite simply , maybe it 's time for there to be fewer mom-and-pop shops . <p> Look around your house right now . Look in your garage . Look in your refrigerator . Ask yourself how much poorer your life would be if you could only buy things bought locally . Perhaps there are some things that honestly make more sense for you to go to a store and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are for yourself than have your neighbors and their political hacks decide for you ? Why on earth would you support taxation that funneled your money toward businesses that do n't serve you as well as others could ? Are you counting on those businesses recycling your money into a civic tax base ? Without getting too dogmatic and preachy about voluntary funding as opposed to taxation , let me just point out that the hope of recycled tax money is the hope of un-guaranteed positive outcomes arising from theft . You might be a lot better off paying for local improvements with a pool of like-minded neighbors than sending the money to city hall and hoping for the best . <p> Makes me wonder what are they going to say as 3D printing vastly reduces then eliminates the need for centralized manufacturing ? Are they going to tax 3D printing so as to make buying from manufacturers more attractive and thus save unnecessary manufacturing jobs ? Actually , yeah , they probably will . <p> In any case , enjoy the Shopping Season to the fullest and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may be the last Christmas you can do so until the inevitable collapse of the inefficient and ever-violent state . <p> And by the way , just as your purchasing dollars should n't " stay local " , neither should your purchasing power .

Bob Quinn , president of the Scranton and Lackawanna County Taxpayers Association explains , " The silent majority would like to see bankruptcy . Basically , its down to a point where people can not afford to pay the taxes and are moving out of town . " <p> In a Reuters article ( August 23 , 2013 ) , financial analyst Cate Long explained a key reason taxpayers were fleeing Scranton . The city 's unfunded " pension benefit obligationis $113 million , or more than a full year of revenues.This is coupled with $21 million of accrued workers compensation claims , $177 million in long term debt and $225 million of unfunded future retiree health care costs . This adds up to about $536 million of future liabilities " <p> Bankruptcy is attractive to taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector pensions and other benefits . But public sector unions have a death grip on the power politics of many , if not most , American cities . <p> What happened in Scranton should be a cautionary tale . Similar battles are erupting across the continent from Stockton , California in the West to Heartland cities like Pittsburgh and to Trenton , New Jersey in the East . The reason is the same . The enormous unfunded liability of public sector wages and benefits makes taxes and fees soar even as government ' services ' , like garbage collection and street lights , decline . People flee if they can . But property values plummet , and so many must endure . This is especially true of Scranton in which an unusual number of residents are elderly and on fixed incomes . <p> HOW SCRANTON BECAME A BOTTOMLESS PIT <p> Scranton has been off the financial rails for over 20 years . In January 1992 , it joined the dozens of other Pennsylvania towns that are now declared to be " financially distressed " under Act 47 ( The Financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the designation means revenue from nonresident taxpayers became available ; instead of cutting back city expenditures , tax-money was imported into the city and poured out . <p> That was n't enough , so Scranton hiked its own taxesagain and again . But that still was n't enough to fund the public sector liability , to pay interest on debt and to continue basic city services . <p> That 's why Chris Doherty , who was mayor of Scranton in 2012 , proposed hefty new taxes on the private sector . For example , he wanted a 78 percent property-tax increase over three years . The Scranton city council rebelled . Its President Janet Evans placed the blame for the proposed increases on " Mayor Doherty 's unbridled spending , borrowing and financial mismanagement . " Doherty did not react well . A four-way conflict spun out of control between the mayor , city officials , public sector unions and the incredibly stressed taxpayer . <p> But something had to be done . The city had $133,000 in cash-on-hand and $3.4 million in vendor bills , including health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered one day of municipal expenses but only if payroll was excluded . Doherty cut every city worker 's salary to minimum wage $7.25 an hour . It was a rash gesture in which Doherty ignored a federal judges injunction that had barred him from imposing the pay cuts . The push-back was powerful . Doherty blinked . And , lest anyone make a private-sector hero out of a politician , Doherty almost immediately sought a $16 million loan from the public employees ' pension fund , which the municipality ( aka the taxpayer ) would have paid back at 8 percent interest over 10 years . <p> Fast forward to 2014 , and Doherty is out . A new mayor faces a $20+million deficit . In November 2013 , Moody 's threatened to cut Scranton 's rating , which would weaken its ability to borrow more or to issue municipal bonds . The solution ? Moody 's recommendation was bankruptcy . Scranton made a different choice ; its 2014 budget hikes taxes into the stratosphere . Property taxes and trash fees increase by almost 60% ; rental registration fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $4-million deficit . With a 5% amusement tax already imposed on live entertainment , a 10% drink tax is being considered . <p> A Los Angeles Times article ( Jan. 11 , 2014 ) entitled " For Scranton residents , bankruptcy is an inviting option " explains the impact of what may seem to be a modest increase in taxes . " Bar owner Mert Gavin says'I am one of the last two bars that 's still downtown . Tink 's is gone . Whistle 's is gone , Banshee 's is gone , Molly Brannigan 's is gone , ' said Gavin , who runs Mert 's . ' Do they expect I 'm going to bail the city of Scranton out myself ' ? " <p> Politicians and public sector workers probably think precisely that . The private sector can be drained forever , as history has proven . But , in this case , the past is not prelude . The state 's foremost public policy research firm Pennsylvania Economy League ( PEL ) advised the mayor and the city council Scranton would need a 117% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans a 50% hike in 2014 and is rumored to be eying a 125% one in 2015 . The Reuters August 23rd article reported " the median household income was $28,805 in 2011 . " The " median total compensation for a police officer ( public sector union ) was $71,250 . " The well is dry . <p> Meanwhile , Council President Evans maintains , " We are in a different situation than Detroit . We were willing and able to do everything within the scope of our authority to continue the recovery of the city of Scranton until it sits once again on sound financial ground . " It is the willingness and ability of politicians " to do everything within the scope of our authority " that has the residents of Scranton on life support . <p> But Evans is correct about one thing ; Scranton 's situation is different than Detroit 's . As financial guru Mike Shedlock explained , " Detroit is better off . In bankruptcy , Detroit has a chance to dump union contracts and onerous pension promises .

@@99475350 @3675350/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Freedom : A Moving Target ( Reflections From A Dozen Years In Mexico ) <p> Editors Note : The following post is by TDV legal correspondent , Jim Karger <p> I love living in Mexico . The " live and let live " culture here works for me . When I arrived a dozen years ago , I felt free . I felt the joy of being left alone , of not fearing making an inadvertent mistake that might cost my money or my freedom . Except for physical violence , there was n't much that was really prohibited here . <p> Most of Mexico 's laws at that time fell under the headings of " Suggested " or " Optional . " Government in Mexico seemingly could get nothing done , and for the most part did n't try . Government here reminded me of the Keystone Cops , totally incompetent but who knew they needed to look busy and so stamped papers with their " official " imprimaturs , usually many times . The only exception was CFE , the government-owned electric company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show up and physically disconnect the power line to your home until you paid up . Then , at some point , they would come and reconnect you . <p> The Mexican government seemingly had no interest in what you drank or smoked , how much , or even where . They shared none of the US governments stated objectives to spy , monitor , debase currency , or fight unnecessary foreign wars . Like all governments they stole with impunity , but since most bureaucrats here could n't find the doors to their own offices , they could take a few pesos here and there but had no chance tapping into , or even finding , the real money flows . <p> Being twenty-one years old to get into a bar was , well , a suggestion , one laughed off with impunity . Dogs in restaurants were , if not welcomed , common , as long as they did n't take a dump on the floor . Expired license plates , or no license plates , were , well , as common as license plates . Seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since no one wore them . Credit cards were handy , but unnecessary , since almost everything , was purchased with cash , pesos or dollars , which interestingly are termed " effectivo " in Mexico if for no other reason than cash was always effective . Few I knew paid income taxes . The federal government here had to rely on " IVA , " the 16% value-added tax collected on the sale of most goods , while local governments seemed to do what they did ( which was not much ) with the meager real property taxes collected each year . <p> Anarchy it was n't but it was close enough to feel free . <p> But that was then and this is now . In the dozen years I have lived here , which often seems only two or three in the rearview mirror , much has changed , and most of those changes have come at the hand of government . <p> In today 's Mexico , cash is no longer king . Indeed , Mexico 's recently-enacted capital control laws prohibit the exchange of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , and you must certify , the source of wired funds into a Mexican bank account . <p> Mexico , like most other countries , has rolled over and agreed to be an agent of the US Internal Revenue Service as required by FATCA , a crude , hubristic institutionalized extortion plot by the only industrialized state in the world that taxes its non-resident citizens on foreign source income , another in a long list of threats by its thuggish cash-strapped northern neighbor that displays the attitude of a pit bull on a gunpowder diet . Unfortunately , Mexico has in large part hitched its wagon to the falling star north of the border and is seemingly mute when it comes to seriously contesting even the most outrageous violations of its sovereignty , e.g. , Fast and Furious . <p> " Mordidas , " what some would call " bribes , " and that others ( like me ) call " propinas " which means " tips , " were once commonplace . Traffic violations were almost always settled by paying the " multa " ( fine ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the court offices and pay it for you , immediately before he ripped up your ticket and pocketed the money . The system was , in a word , efficient . And , for the most part " tips " still work . A friend recently got a Mexican driver 's license without the red tape of a written exam , driver 's test , or physical examination . Actually , that is not completely true . His written test was taken by one of the good and friendly employees of the driver 's license bureau and he was pleased to report that he scored 27 out of 30 on questions he could neither read nor understand . But today with a highly-publicized federal campaign to stop " mordidas , " one must now be very careful to whom a " tip " is offered for fear of being imprisoned for bribery , if not by Mexico then by the United States if one is a US citizen . See " Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . " <p> Cars registered in other countries now must be " nationalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tax on a car on which you already paid sales tax to your former state . I just finished that process two days of relentless government bullshit and that was two full days with a paid fixer . I am confident that no one without help or knowing the right person inside the Mexican government could walk that minefield without exiting on their knees . <p> Notarios , quasi-public officials that must legally approve many transactions , including every real estate sale , have been threatened with heinous penalties by the Mexican government should they permit any land transactions to be settled in cash and are now required to report every transaction to Hacienda , Mexico 's IRS that , like its US counterpart has aspirations of collecting ( at the end of a gun ) everything it needs , everything it wants . <p> Most cars can no longer be purchased with cash . Neither can precious metals over small amounts , among other things the Mexican government would like to track and tax . <p> What 's next ? More taxes , of course . Proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVA tax on the sale of real estate , including one 's home . Expressed rationale ? A direct wealth transfer to the poor from the not-so-poor after it passes through the pockets of the political class . If this law is passed , it will stomp a slowly recovering real estate market like a narc at a biker rally . Thousands will be thrown out of work , to include ( poor ) construction workers who can then thank government for the peanuts they will receive in place of their jobs . There was even talk of an IVA tax on food , as if the poor can afford one more peso for their dietary staples . After that was declared dead on arrival , the proposal was revised to tax " pet " food on the theory that only the rich can afford pets and the rich can afford to pay tax on their dogs ' food , which only proves just how out of touch Mexico 's political class really is . <p> After that , who knows ? My guess is they will tax prostitution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tolerate are cash businesses that can evade the taxation/theft net . To date that has n't happened , but the directive is clear : if it moves or breathes , tax it . And now , with computers , even bureaucrats who ca n't find their own offices can find the money . Mexico is taking its turn at moving toward full-bore statism . <p> That said , I do n't want to overstate the case . Compared to the violent police states to the north , Mexico 's humble incursions to seize control of its tax donkeys may seem rather mild , but from the perspective of one who has actually been free , even if for a relatively brief moment in time , the changes are significant and disturbing . <p> The taste of freedom , like good tequila or the waft of a fine perfume , is unforgettable . <p> Freedom is addictive . I am an addict and will always need a fix . I do n't want a 12-step program . I want the drug itself . I want freedom . <p> Moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Staying here , however , could prove to be problematic depending on ever-changing circumstances , government and its increasing limits on freedom , which in large part depends on how Mexico responds to the neighborhood bully who lives next door and whether it elects to become a " first-world country , " which translated means " police state . " <p> The lesson I take away from this experience and transition is to never become emotionally-invested in any decision , specifically including decisions involving one 's geography . A good decision can become a bad decision , thus requiring frequent revisits to weigh one 's fundamental rationale for leaving and whether , and at what point , changing realities leave that rationale unserved . <p> For now , Mexico still feels right . <p> Editor 's Note : Proximity or rather the lack of it to the US is going to matter in coming years . That 's why as much as we love Mexico , we looked farther south for a home for our community of like-minded , liberty-loving individuals .

Soon after it went to $30 and then ground all the way back down to $3 over the next year amidst many hoots and hollering of how crazy I was . <p> I carried on and spoke about it regularly both here at the TDV blog and newsletter . Bitcoin slowly rose back up to $30 over the course of the next year . <p> Then in early 2013 I had already begun to get involved in numerous bitcoin ventures including the world 's first bitcoin ATM machine and the price went from $30 to $250 . People finally began to take notice and I was regularly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But then bitcoin fell back down to nearly $50 and the world was awash in laughter at how crazy I was and how bitcoin had " crashed " . <p> Then , soon after , bitcoin went to over $1,000 and all of a sudden everyone was interested in bitcoin . We were indulged with interested people who all of a sudden thought I was some sort of prophet . Wired magazine even sent a reporter down to Acapulco to follow me around to get the scoop on this " bitcoin kid " . <p> As per its pattern of the last few years , however , it has since slid down all throughout the year to where it is today near $350 and , once again , the scowls and laughter have come out about how crazy I am . <p> It 's a good thing I do n't care what dogmatic , news watching robots think about me ! <p> Especially because , once again , I am saying for the record , this is just the beginning .

There are those who have realized its potential in the past and who are , like me , even more emboldened now after hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding have come into it , countless large companies have begun accepting it ( Overstock.com , Expedia , etc. ) and after seeing all the innovations popping up . <p> And then there are those who have felt for years that they have " missed the boat " . <p> For those who feel they have missed the boat on bitcoin I am here to yet again state that you have n't .

@@99475354 @3675354/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Is America a Police State Yet ? 28883 @qwx888883 <p> If you need to ask the question , then the answer is " yes " . But that is a glib response and I do not feel glib about America 's slide through the nine rings of political hell . <p> A police state is generally defined as a totalitarian government that exerts extreme and pervasive social , political and economic control over peaceful citizens . Ayn Rand called it " the ultimate inversionthe stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases , while the citizens may act only by permission . " <p> There are various ways to measure where a nation sits on the police-state axis . <p> One way is to compare what you see in America with the following standard description of a police state . A police state maintains its control through the pervasive surveillance of peaceful citizenry , through a vast number of laws with draconian enforcement , and by converting rights into privileges that can be withheld for example , the ability to travel . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Stasi , that operates with no transparency and few restraints . The special police do not address violent crime ; instead , they exert social control and enforce the law whatever the law may be . <p> This describes America . Surveillance of daily life has soared ; even the Supreme Court has consistently expanded the " right " of police to perform warrantless searches . A vast array of laws now dictate the minutia of life , from what you may not eat to the light bulbs you may not use as well products you must buy ( e.g. health care insurance ) . On one day in January alone , Obama issued 23 executive orders to start the process of gun control . Enforcement is becoming every more draconian , with police departments pursuing militarization of their procedures and attitudes . A special police force called the Department of Homeland Security has spearheaded this military zeal ; the DHS functions without transparency or accountability . Travel , formerly a right , is now a privilege granted by government agents at their whim . <p> Does the foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another way to judge the degree of totalitarianism is to answer yourself four questions : <p> How many peaceful activities would make you a criminal if you did them ? In his book Three Felonies A Day : How the Feds Target the Innocent , civil rights attorney Harvey Silverglate. argues convincingly that , " The average professional in this country the US wakes up in the morning , goes to work , comes home , eats dinner , and then goes to sleep , unaware that he or she has likely committed several federal crimes that day . Why ? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws , which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague . " You are a felon whether or not you have done anything wrong . <p> How much of your life is spent working to pay taxes and other government fees ? According to the watchdog Tax Foundation , in 2012 Americans worked " 107 days into the year , from January 1 to April 17 , to earn enough money to pay this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . " The figure hardly captures the scope of economic enslavement . The problem is not merely the taxes that consume a third of your life , it is also the unseen costs . For example , compliance with labyrinthine taxes and regulations costs small to middle-sized business 1 in every 3 dollars . This expense gets passed along to consumers while the benefit goes to the government . <p> How freely can you relocate your assets and person outside state jurisdiction ? There are at least three stages in the relocation of the most simple asset money . You must establish a foreign account , get the money under your control and , then , transfer it . The easiest step should be to get your own money ; after all , banks should be merely holding it for you . That step is far from easy . In an article entitled " Get Your Assets Out of the US NOW " , a relocation expert warns that the bank will " make a federal case out of it . Literally . " You will wait from five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager will " begin to ask you a lot of questions . She 's required to do it . " He adds , " Here 's the scary part . When you tell them you want to withdraw $100,000 in cash or wire it to a foreign bank , they are REQUIRED to file a SAR . They are PROHIBITED from telling you that they are filing it.They can freeze your account until they are satisfied that what you want to do with YOUR money is legitimate . " Those are just some of the problems arising at one stage of what should be the simplest part of relocating assets . Editor 's Note : This should help you realize how urgent that it is to relocate your assets while you still can . <p> How freely can you use your assets and person within state jurisdiction ? Circumstances vary so widely that everyone must answer for themselves . <p> America is now a police state . How did this happen ? <p> There are no simple answers , and it has happened over a long course of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be : " War . " The war on drugs , the war on poverty , the war on womenbut , most of all , the war on terrorism . Since 9/11 politicians have kept America in a whipped up-state of fear because it allows them to walk past the traditional protections of liberty that restrain the state . Authorities have been able to gut the institutions of society that shielded individual freedom and to replace them with institutions that promote the state instead . <p> An institution is " a well-established and structured pattern of behavior or of relationships that is accepted as a fundamental part of a culture , such as marriage . " Institutions can be roughly broken into two categories . Private sector institutions reflect the interactions and choices of individuals ; they include the marketplace , the family , the press , and religion . Public or state sector institutions reflect an attempt to control the interactions and choices of individuals ; they include today 's legal system , public education , regulatory agencies , and the current banking monopoly . A deep tension exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of the other . For example , regulatory agencies grow by draining away control from individuals in the marketplace ; public institutions feed on private ones until there is nothing left . They are able to do so because frightened people will surrender liberty for the illusion of safety . <p> The war on terror is an engineered hysteria . In its wake , the institutions of America have changed . Public ones have swelled in size and appetite ; private ones have retreated . Some of the changes are so glaring that people noticed immediately . It is difficult not to notice the militarization of law enforcement when your children are lined up at airports and touched by uniformed strangers in a manner that would be called child molestation elsewhere . But the dehumanizing process is accepted in the name of security . <p> The foregoing scratches the surface of " how " a society becomes a total state . It does not explain the " why . " Why do Americans who pride themselves on rugged individualism stand by and watch the triumph of totalitarianism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as obedience ) tends to become character traits not only of individuals but also of society itself . And , so , society becomes closed rather than open ; insensitive to brutality by authorities , and afraid of dissent . Rewarded by the authorities for doing so , people even come to spy on their neighbors as a civic duty of which they are proud . <p> Another common reason : people do not or prefer not to notice . Because they wake up in their own homes , eat the same breakfast cereal , work at the same job , they have a sense that everything is normal . They do not notice that the legal structure and other institutions that guarded their freedoms are going , going , gone . People who are accustomed to liberty can be blithely unaware of how important mechanisms like rule of law or due process are to their freedom and true safety . The daily erosion of freedom is far less real to them than their daily routines . <p> The difference between America and a communist regime lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That difference no longer exists .

FATCA has been making it harder and harder for Americans to open international bank accounts . And FBAR , the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts , has made it a highly punishable offense for any American with a foreign account worth over $10,000 if they do not file an FBAR each year . <p> The problem with FBAR is that countless Americans with foreign accounts and US expats are completely unaware of its existence . And , despite the fact that there are literally tens of thousands of rules in the US tax code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not excusable . <p> We have stated in the past that FinCen , FATCA and FBAR are all intermingled to essentially put in capital controls on the US populace and , as well , steal most of the money from those with funds abroad . In the past many said that we were being too alarmist and surely the US government would not do something like this . <p> Well , think again , it just happened . And it was even worse than we thought . <p> CARL ZWERNER JUST GOT FBAR'ED <p> In a court decision just released a man who ignorantly did not file an FBAR had not only all of his funds seized by the US government but , unbelievably , even more than he had in his account . <p> Carl Zwerner , an 87-year old Florida man , must pay the US government a 150% penalty on the value of his Swiss bank account , amounting to the biggest penalty by percentage on record , according to his lawyer . Carl Zwerner will pay more than $2 million " for willfully failing to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Financial Accounts , or FBAR . Prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service use FBAR penalties , which sometimes are worse than criminal fines , in order stamp out " offshore tax evasion . " <p> As we 've discussed in The Dollar Vigilante Blog , individuals have flocked to the IRS amnesty program which purports to allow holders of undeclared offshore accounts avoid prosecution . Over 43,000 Americans have joined the program since 2009 , shelling out $6 billion to the US . <p> In Zwerner 's case , the IRS sought to seize 50% of the value of his account compounded over each of four years where he was deemed in non-compliance . With Zwerner 's case a new precedent has been set . " As this jury verdict shows , the cost of not coming forward and fully disclosing a secret offshore bank account to the IRS can be quite high , " Kathryn Keneally , the head of the tax division , said in the statement . <p> " They can get 50 percent for the non-filing of one piece of paper , and 200 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zwerner 's lawyer Martin Press said in a phone interview . " The question is whether such a massive penalty is appropriate for simply a disclosure form which carries no tax . " <p> Zwerner 's Swiss account at ABN Amro Group NV , the Netherlands third-biggest bank , was valued at $1.48 million in 2004 , when his FBAR penalty was $723,762 ; the value in 2005 was $1.49 million , when the penalty was $745,209 ; and the value in 2006 was $1.55 million , and a $772,838 penalty . The total penalties were $2.24 million . <p> Many naysayers said that the US government would not come after the total value of an account deemed in non-compliance . In a sense they were right the US government came for nearly double the amount held in the account ! <p> But Zwerner 's is n't the biggest FBAR penalty in terms of size on record . H. Ty Warner , the billionaire founder of Beanie Babies , pleaded guilty last year on evading taxes on secret Swiss accounts that held as much as $107 million . He paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zwerner , he got off easy with only 50% of his funds stolen . <p> Mary Estelle Curran , a 79-year-old widow from Palm Beach , Florida , pleaded guilty last year for not disclosing $43 million at UBS AG . ( UBSN ) She paid a $21.6 million FBAR penalty . Ms. Curran fell for the IRS 's " limited-amnesty program " in 2009 , where they said they would not fine her if she came forward . But the agency simply rejected her and fined her anyway . In her case it is even worse as she was indicted in late 2011 and faced up to 37 months in prison . <p> Zwerner testified , telling jurors that he tried to enter the IRS voluntary disclosure program , and that he did n't  know until 2008 that he must file FBARs . " Zwerners original tax returns for 2004 to 2007 did n't  report any income from the Swiss bank account , " reads a US complaint filed in June 2013 .

Kudos to you guys for getting the scoop first . And since Luke has Polish ancestry , this is a perfect segway into what I have seen in Poland visiting relatives every year in the 90s . I remember around 1990 Poland still had hardcore Socialism , long lines , shortages , etc Then in mid 90-s there was hyperinflation with 100-Zloty notes blowing in the wind as they were so worthless , people did n't  even pick them up . My relatives lost their life savings to Hyperinflation , but at least there was no violence and no serious Hunger . Still life was dire . Fast forward 20 years and you would n't believe this was the same country . Poland kicked Socialism to the curb , instituted free-market reforms and has been the strongest-growing European economy for a decade . They just elected a right-wing Conservative government into power and the boom continues . Some have even suggested that Poland could become the leading Great Power in Europe , with a youth and dynamism ( mostly due to catholic-inspired pro-life policies that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking Germany clearly lacks ( it is a land of armies of rich pensioners driving BMWs and a much smaller and ever-shrinking pool of poor , over-taxed young people who ca n't afford to raise children and get around on bicycles and public transport ) . Unless you 've been there recently , you just would n't believe how good most Polish cities look nowadays , you would think you 're in Scandinavia , if you did n't  know any better . That is also the good news for Venezuela , if you implement pro-market reforms , even a Socialist basketcase can be turned around in less than a generation . <p> ElVarto <p> I cant belive you guys actually came here lol crazy gringos <p> Sophia Welsh <p> I cant believe that you cabrones used Venezuelas situation not to make it known by the rest of the world but for you to throw shit to Sanders .

Just think of the loaded term " democracy " and the poisonous vitriol spewed at anyone who points out the utter immorality of a governing system where the majority is able to trample over the minority . Then there is " capitalism " which was not originally a term of simple description but of scathing critique to the uninhibited market . Or consider what the term " liberal " means in context of contemporary politics . What once described those who advocated free trade , peaceful foreign relations , and a laissez-faire approach to the economy means , today , the exact opposite . " Liberal " is now used to describe social democrats who seek to use the state as a force to compel more equitable outcomes in all private matters . <p> And then there is " anarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anarchism is typically invoked as synonymous with destruction and mayhem . Famous labor movement leader Emma Goldman incited strikes and assassination plots in the late 19th and early 20th century under the pretenses of anarchism . She openly opined for the overthrow of capitalism by insisting " the only demand that property recognizes is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth , because wealth means power ; the power to subdue , to crush , to exploit , the power to enslave , to outrage , to degrade . " <p> Fast forward to today and the same violent tactics are being carried out by self-labeled anarchists . In Greece , adopted austerity measures that is insignificant cuts in government expenditure matched by crushing tax increases and no real labor reforms- have led to a barrage of protests and violent clashes with police . These " leftist anarchists " are by in large protesting the threat to entitlement programs . <p> Spasms of violence hijacked attention from mostly peaceful May Day social-justice rallies Tuesday as black-clad vandals left downtown Seattle littered with shattered glass and put police and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aimed at financial institutions , recalled for many Seattleites the 1999 World Trade Organization ( WTO ) riots . Mayor Mike McGinn , citing lessons learned from that chaos , issued an emergency order giving police power to preventively seize anything that could be used as a weapon . <p> The order , imposed after a noontime vandalism spree by about 75 apparent anarchists armed with poles , contributed to arrests and later clashes between police and protesters . <p> This war on " Niketown " was fought by black-clad capitalism haters dawned in North Face jackets and Levi jeans . It was highly reminiscent of last falls Occupy movement which saw many socialists attempting to bring down the market economy by coordinating marches on their smartphones . <p> The violence carried out by Goodman , Greece rioters , and Seattle protesters is not a consequence of their supposed anarchism . Anarchy does not advocate coercion . Adherents to the philosophy see the state as illegitimate as a protector of " rights " and that institutionalized force is antithetical to peace . <p> In point of fact , anarchism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no institutionalized coercion . Its the watercourse way , where everything is allowed to rise or fall naturally to its own level . An anarchic system is necessarily one of free-market capitalism . Any services that are needed and wanted by people like the police or the courts would be provided by entrepreneurs , whod do it for a profit . <p> Destroying private property while calling for the end of the state are two diametrically opposed positions . Being that the state functions solely on violence , to carry out acts of aggression on those innocent of crime or that which is n't yours is oppressing behavior . Destroying property acquired by contractual means in the name of " anarchy " is not an act of philosophical dissent but of criminal defacement . It should entail all the lawful consequences that acts of aggression would normally receive in a truly just society . <p> The fact is that many of these self-identified anarchists openly seek an end to capitalism and private business . Their end goal is a world defined by communalism and egalitarianism . Since the free market allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , it is the enemy of these syndicalism proponents . <p> Because these so-called " leftist anarchists " really do n't  seek the end of capitalism , their goal is n't the abolishment of the state at all . It is even further domination by a ruling class . Murray Rothbard explains : <p> And I very much fear that the same can be said for the other varieties of left-anarchists : communal , syndical , or whatever . Beneath a thin veneer of libertarian rhetoric there lies the same compulsory and coercive collectivist that we have encountered all too often in the last two centuries . Scratch a left-wing " anarchist " and you will find a coercive egalitarian despot who makes the true lover of freedom yearn even for Richard Nixon ( Arghh ! ) in contrast . <p> The property destroying anarchists are not anarchists at all , they are vandals and hoodlums . Unappreciative of the risk business owners take to simply transact with willing consumers , these destructionists have their sights set on the wrong target . Rather than mindlessly destroy property , their goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its good qualities and bad , did not spring up overnight . It took nearly a decade for a minority to carry it out . <p> This is a lesson for real anarchists as well . People will not wake up one day and instantaneously recognize the state as the looting entity it really is . It will take decades and perhaps lifetimes to give the public a good idea of what a free society looks like and the prosperity and well being such a social order brings . <p> Those protestors in Seattle masquerading as anarchists must realize the only thing throwing a patio chair through a Starbucks window accomplishes is showing the world how childish and disrespectful they are to those who have done them no harm . <p> James E.

Immediately following the International Monetary Fund 's censure over fudging its economic data , the government has frozen prices on every item in the nation 's supermarkets . This just begs the question of why the Argentinean government needs to lie about its economic statistics . The answer is simple really . Like any state , it wants to paint itself in the best light by presenting a Potemkin village of happy citizens and a booming economy . In reality , the people in Argentina are suffering under a brutal bout of inflation . Private economists estimate the inflation rate has reached 30%- the very definition of hyperinflation . <p> Try as they might to deny it , this is the Keynesian wet dream playing out in living color . To finance government spending , the Central Bank of Argentina has been putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under Keynesian theory , the economy should be taking off like Bill Clinton alone with a White House intern . Instead , there is panic in supermarkets as people are trying to ditch the peso in favor of , well , just about anything . <p> This is not the first time Argentina has wrecked its economy . In fact , it 's the fourth time in forty years . President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner has merely adopted the tried-and-true method of using increased government intervention to undo the mistakes of previous policy . Critics have called her administration corrupt , deceptive , and eager to assist big business with favorable regulations . In other words , she is pulling the reigns of government as any other president would . The only difference is that Kirchner has managed to destroy a national currency faster than the rest of the developed world . <p> But do n't count the United States out of the global race toward monetary self-destruction just yet . With over a trillion dollars floating around the banking system and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy , there is no telling when the whole convoluted scheme will blow up in his face . We are already in " uncharted territory " according to Julia Coronado , chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas . The day of reckoning for the US dollar could come any day now . <p> Americans should start looking at Argentina as a sign of what 's to come rather than a possible vacation destination . And they should start looking at gold as a safe haven instead of their bank accounts . <p> Redmond Weissenberger is the Managing Editor of The Dollar Vigilante and the Founding Director of the Ludwig von Mises Institute of Canada , the centre for the study of the Austrian School of Economics within Canada . <p> Redmond founded the LvMIC in 2010 to address the lack of knowledge about the true cause of our booms and busts of the last 100 years and the need for sound money and sound economics to be applied to the Canadian and global economy . <p> I am trying really hard not to make any clichTd comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm also trying hard not to make any jokes about Argentina 's economy and women drivers . Because economies do n't do well with people trying to control them , period . It 's not President Cristina 's type of genitals or her inherent lack of spacial reasoning and parallel parking ability that is causing the Argentinian economy to head into a hyperinflationary crash . It 's that she 's " managing " the economy at all , and " managing it " good and hard . <p> Your sentimental editor read about Argentina years ago and started making plans to expatriate to it . Back then I only dreamed of being an Internet writer and loudmouth who could live wherever he wanted to ( as long as it had a reliable Internet connection and could chemically support human life ) . But when I was free to go , I told myself , it would be to Argentina . This was more than ten years ago and the latest financial collapse had resulted in firesale prices on property . I imagined myself in a trenchcoat and hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking the gangway in the foggy night onto a boat bound for South America . There was even a foghorn ! I 'd show up in Buenos Aires and by some colorful property in a down at the heels but character-filled neighborhood like La Boca and while away my days by writing in cafes and taking long strolls in the evening . <p> As luck would have it , my new writing career would bring me into contact with the granddaddy of anarchist soul himself : Doug Casey . Doug graciously invited me to come visit him and check out his real estate development in the northern reaches of Argentina . Part of the trip included a tour of Buenos Aires , destination city of my youthful dreams . The trip was one of the best times of my life , not least of which was because I got to meet Doug in person for the first time and share a cigar with him ! <p> But I like many others wondered only half-jokingly when Argentina would be coming undone again . That country seems to have made a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to read about how regularly there is a political or currency crisis or both ! you 'd think they were putting all of us on . I 'm sure Doug and his La Estancia development will be fine because the place is removed enough from Buenos Aires that geography and distance will force the politicians to look for easier pickings nearby . <p> But there is another South American country that struck TDV editor-in-chief Jeff Berwick as destined for a brighter economic future , and as a great place to build a Galt 's Gulch of his own . So it is that TDV 's Galt 's Gulch , Chile came to be . Thanks to Jeff and the efforts of TDV 's development manager Ken Johnson , Galt 's Gulch , Chile , just an hour or so outside of Santiago , is going to be the premiere destination for those who want to live a lot freer , and in a country whose best economic times are still ahead of it . If you 'd like to learn more about the project , be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my heart for Buenos Aires and my too brief time in Argentina , but Santiago and its environs are looking like an awfully good choice these days .

There have been individual or even entire nations of people who have been wiped out in the past but never before has there been such risk to assets across the entire globe . <p> In the past , a few savvy Zimbabweans have converted their Zimbabwe dollars into US dollars to sidestep the complete annihilation of their currency and savings . Or residents of the Weimar Republic were able to salvage their wealth and savings by stepping across the border and converting their marks into francs . <p> But what happens when the US dollar , the worlds reserve currency , and with it all fiat currencies collapse ?

But now there is no where to run . And to make matters worse almost every western nation state is colluding with the other states to limit your ability to escape . <p> US citizens have it the worst of anyone . The US Government has been closing as many doors as possible . It has been years since a US citizen has been accepted in any other country as a stock brokerage client as the SEC has used the threat of their black helicopters to ensure that no one dare accept those with a US passport as a client . And now , with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act , or FATCA passed in 2010 and some of its legislation coming into effect this year , it all but ensures that soon no bank anywhere in the world will accept US citizens as clients its just too risky as even not reporting one client , even if it is by accident , gives the US Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that banks business . <p> Now , with almost every western nation state and their socialist systems beyond bankrupt and desperately reaching with its outstretched claws to take more of their citizens assets to keep the system alive a little longer there is almost no where to hide . <p> The US and almost every country on Earth is preparing for this and already checks everyone leaving almost every country to divulge whether they are taking more than $10,000 with them . The US has even put cash sniffing dogs at many of their international airports and accosts you as you walk to the plane to make sure you do not leave with more than a pittance of money . The next step will be to disallow you to take that money from the country altogether . <p> At that point many western countries will have no problem pushing through legislation to confiscate gold or at least tax it at some obscene level . No one except " rich people " the 1% own gold as far as the public is concerned and the fascist media always likes to portray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposed dictators fleeing from their countries .

Your government wont tell you how to do it and your financial advisor wont either . Its up to you to do your own research and be one of the few with a store of wealth in which to rebuild the worlds economy post-fiat currency . One of the best strategies for doing that is to own precious metals AND to keep them out of the reach of the western nation states as they and their manmade currencies become history .

No , not our anarcho-capitalism , but our announcement of the worlds first BitcoinATM . <p> So , is Jeff just a patsy so that the New World Order can bring in a digital currency ? I began wondering this myself , and I came to what I think is a reasonable conclusion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World Order with its global governance , fiat currencies and so on has already , for the most part , been implemented on a global scale . Especially economically . For instance , 95%+ of fiat money today is digital , and it 's all based on the Federal Reserve System , thus creating one worldwide currency with lots of different designs on the actual notes supposedly representing the various cultural backgrounds of nation-states . <p> Despite nearly everything being digital already , there are mainstream technologies that go above-and-beyond , aiming to rule out the need for cash . <p> One particular app for this cashless society , above-and-beyond credit and debit , is called Square , and was developed by Jack Dorsey , Twitters co-founder . According to CNN , " this is a telltale signs that the mobile-payments revolution has arrived . " CNN writes , as anyone who has studied American consumers know , " changing the way Americans pay for stuff is going to be really hard work . " <p> But Bitcoin is turning out to be a force to be reckoned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberty movement , gold and silver , Bitcoin seems to have been the play to make over the past six months and beyond . For months , besides today 's drop from $150-$115 , after running to $150 from $105 , our charts over at Gold Silver Bitcoin have shown a bimetallic standard precipitously dropping relative to Bitcoin . <p> The CNN article surmises that , <p> " Paying by phone will be as transformative as the advent of the credit card in the 1950s . It will change the way we shop and bank . With powerful smartphones and tablets taking center stage on both sides of the checkout counter , it will reshape the relationship between buyer and seller . Not only will the phone or the tablet become a wallet for consumers , but it will also turn into a credit card reader and a register for merchants . Shoppers will use their mobile device as a coupon book , a comparison-shopping tool , and a repository of those unwieldy loyalty cards they carry from everyone from giant retail chains to the corner bakery . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailer when you walk into its store so that it can recommend products , show you reviews , or direct you to aisle five , where that beanbag chair you did n't  buy last week still beckons and you can now have it for 10% off . You wo n't even need a few singles to tip the valet or pay the dog walker , because theyll take mobile payments too . " <p> This basically explains the Bitcoin experience . One big difference ? While CNN assumes a central authority , Bitcoin does not . With big players like AT&amp;T , Verizon , Visa , Mastercard , Google , Microsoft , and eBays PayPal unit investing in billions in digital payment solutions , it is no surprise that the mainstream media is serving the idea to the public domain in kind and uncritical ways . One of their assumptions is a monopoly on the technology by some corporation friendly to compromising . While the mainstream press has been unable to ignore Bitcoin , it certainly has been critical of Bitcoin being prone to hackers . Sure , a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general population had to become their own banks . Most of them would get eaten right away by sharks in the economic waters . <p> The CNN article champions the ease of digital transactions , and the time saved . Bitcoin is surely faster : <p> " While this revolution will be powered by complex technology , its ultimate effect will be to greatly simplify things for consumers . Think about my experience at Grumpy . While I had to fiddle with my phone ahead of time to upload my credit card to the Square app and to authorize it to talk to the Grumpy register once there , the phone never left my pocket . All I had to do was order my cappuccino . " <p> The article portends that " a cashless future is more real than many suspect . " According to the global head of mobile at Visa , " financial institutions are going to have a big role to play . " <p> " We are , I think , on a precipice of some fundamental change in the way money is exchanged between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-W.Va. , said as she opened the first of a string of hearings one year ago on cashless ways . <p> The Federal Reserve found that 12 percent of cell phone users had already made a payment through their phones , and almost two-thirds of technology experts surveyed by the Pew Center on Internet and American Life said they expected mobile payments to eclipse cash and credit cards by 2020 . <p> But , Square and similar technologies are different from Bitcoin . Bitcoin has caught on with a younger generation that , as Trace Mayer once put it to me ( to paraphrase ) , " grew up in a digital sea . The younger generation are fish in a digital sea , whereas the older generation are snorkeling tourists . " In other words , p2p technology is a concept in-and-of itself for the Internet-literate . That goes a long way to explaining its popularity . <p> As the late Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster asked about gold and silver relative to fiat , " where else are you going to go " in a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've coined a " rebels portfolio " already heavy in silver and gold . <p> The pseudonymous nature ( read : not totally anonymous ) of Bitcoin does associate IPs with wallets . But , the paper-trail is a more obtuse alternative to the traditional bank account . The Powers That Be focus intensely on record-keeping , the historical record shows this , and so any added time-cost for their zeroing-in on you acts as the new privacy . <p> The popular appeal of Bitcoin its p2p foundation is as simple as first-language to the younger generation . Trace explains this well . Max Keiser recently said that he called gold in 2008 , and people asked " What if the government confiscates my gold ? " To which Max Keiser responds , " What you should have been asking yourself is , ' What if the government confiscates my bank account ? ' " He then goes on : " Since $5 per BTC I 've been recommending Bitcoin and many of you asked , What if the government shuts off the Internet ? " Max Keiser answers thus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if the government shuts down the banks ? " <p> And so , there are fundamental differences between the digital payment technologies pursued publicly by TPTB , and Bitcoin . This is what caught the eye of so many tech-savvy and Austrian-minded individuals across the world , but largely concentrated in the US and greater North America . Now , with Bitcoin skyrocketing from $9.31 last Fall to $150 today , the power of the Internet has never been clearer . <p> Bitcoin is a bet on the Internet . And , if you read our recent TDV Homegrown issue , you might have learned something about the Egyptian experience with a government using the " internet kill switch . " I wrote : <p> " Over one year ago , the Egyptian government cut off approximately 88% of the countrys internet access . Here is what happened : The government owned the biggest Internet provider in the nation , and only had to contact a few other companies to make this happen . The government ordered the shutdown of nearly all Internet access within Egypt . Ninety-three percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections to the Internet that was not blocked belongs to Noor Data Network , the ISP used by the Egyptian ( stock ) Exchange . " <p> I then went over some of the ways Egyptians worked around this Internet shutdown , as well as the likelihood of it happening in the US . The conclusion of the article was bullish for the Internet , for the Internet is a vibrant and evolving system . It is crucial to everyone 's way of life , and we see this with centralized and decentralized payment solutions . The Internet will continue to be defended by its users and impinged upon by its self-appointed overseers .

If they think to consult a tax adviser at all they 're usually told that so long as they spend less than 183 days per year in the USA , they can rest assured that they will not be triggering any tax consequences . A brief reading of the US tax code would appear to verify this statement ; however there is a nuance that threatens to trap snowbirds in the IRS 's web . <p> It 's called the substantial presence test and it 's a second layer of the standard test performed by the IRS in order to determine residency . Not only can you not exceed 183 days in USA for the current year , but after adding in one-third of the prior year 's days , and one-sixth of the second preceding year 's days that total is not allowed to exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day allowance is not 183 , but 122 . <p> Many snowbirds thinking they 're safe and not triggering any US tax liabilities could be in for a rude awakening come March 2015 when Canadian banks send their first FATCA reports to the CRA for them to forward along to the IRS . Because of FATCA , Canadian banks will now report anyone with ties to the USA and the likelihood of being deemed a US taxpayer rises substantially . <p> Being deemed a US taxpayer can quickly become a nightmare . Penalties , interest and professional fees come at a substantial cost and the IRS is far more aggressive and unforgiving than the Canada Revenue Agency . Furthermore , differences in how the two tax systems treat your RRSP 's , TFSA 's and other tax-sheltered accounts in Canada can rob you of the advantages of using them . Foreign tax credits can be claimed to keep your overall tax liability close to what it has always been but they 're typically a clumsy way to do this and do n't relieve you of the obligation and costs associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil gaze of the IRS ? It 's getting quite easy with FATCA . If you have a US address , phone number or any other US-based information on your Canadian accounts it could likely trigger a report and put you under greater scrutiny .

But I hope that you , especially if you are a regular TDV reader , pay your taxes only because you fear being kidnapped by the state and not because you enjoy it or feel you are morally obliged to do so . Is there anything more perverse and pathetic than someone who actually enjoys paying their taxes ? I run into these deranged types all the time : those brainwashed toadies who enjoy the feel of their master'swhip . They say nonsense like , " I love how things are where I liveso I 'm happy to pay my taxes to keep them that way !

Just because it 's nice on the human farm where you happen to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay taxes . Human tax cows pay tax on their incomes in both Vancouver and in Detroit . They pay taxes in Camden , NJ , as well as in Singapore . In fact , the gleaming city-state of Singapore has notoriously low and uncomplicated income taxes compared to the burnt-out nightmare of Detroit which has several layers of tax that can get very complicated at the state and federal levels . ( Note that I 'm not praising Singapore as a model of taxation ; taxation is theft and the model tax is zero ) . <p> What makes a place great to live is the people , not the government and its theft . If the people are industrious , respectful of the rights and property of others , and just overall happy ( and they tend to be happier the less government is on their backs restricting personal choice or stealing their money ) , then odds are that will be a pleasant place to live . People who are quick to associate the taxes they pay with their quality of life exhibit both a flawed understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify political authority and theft at the hands of their abusers . They are bowers and scrapers , in love with the feel of the boot on their necks , aroused at the notion of yelling " yes , sir ! " and doing what they 're told to do by the psychopaths willing to use force . While they disgust me , however , I do n't wish them any harm . I just hope I do n't have to listen to them while I 'm eating . <p> Regards , <p> Gary Gibson Editor , The Dollar Vigilante <p> P.S.

@@99475378 @3675378/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> The War Is OverAnd We Won 28882 @qwx888882 <p> The war I 'm talking about is the war between individuals and the state . You see , governments have already lost . They just do n't know it yet . There has been a war going on between collectivizing , coercive government and the allied forces of individualism , freedom and markets for quite some time . Exactly how long is hard to say because for most of history it seems that the governed more or less accepted that they need to be governed and accepted the brutality of politicians , whether those politicians were tribal chiefs , pharaohs , princes or presidents . So there was n't much of a fight going on between the forces of coercion ( the state ) and the forces of cooperation and peace ( the market ) for the first few thousand years of human civilization . <p> But something started to shift in the last few hundred years . Maybe it was by accident and maybe it 's the result of countless fortunate accidents ; scientific discoveries coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Age of Enlightenment and an Industrial Age . Standards of living began to rise for the masses , and people started to realize that being free was much , much better than being property of the king . Later , at the end of the 20th Century , they would also realize that being free was also better than being property of the collective . Not only was it better for individual happiness when one was not owned , but it was also better for material progress when a bunch of free individuals were left alone to use their talent and resources to satisfy their desire to create and to make a profit . <p> So it 's hard to pinpoint when the war started exactly , though it 's almost certainly within the last few hundred years ; and it really picked up steam with the colonization of North America . But I can suggest a definite period for the end of the war . <p> The End of the War : 1913-1994 <p> The beginning of the end of the war between government and the individual was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most powerful , most murderous , most indebted government the world has ever seen ( and likely will ever see , if we 're lucky ) sowed the seeds of its own guaranteed collapse . That was the year the latest incarnation of a US central bank was created to do what central banks do : provide the government with limitless purchasing power stolen from the productive individuals through currency supply inflation . <p> The end of the end , so to speak , was in 1994 . That was the year the Internet gained widespread public knowledge and use . Governments have always thrived by controlling education of the young , controlling the currency and controlling information . In other words : indoctrination , inflation , misinformation , and propaganda . The governed vastly outnumber the governors so force was never enough to keep control . Sure you could make an example out of a couple of the slaves by using violence on them . But to efficiently control a bunch of humans and use them as tax cows , you have to convince them that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became impossible for the governed not to find out the truth of their condition . <p> I understand if when I say that government has lost the war , you might think I 'm crazy . After all , things look pretty bleak . Yes , the government is out of control in the US and in many other countries . But their actions are more like death throes . Like a big , mortally wounded beast , the state is lashing out with the strength and ferocity that comes from panic . It senses death approaching . And that may make it temporarily more dangerous . But the end is in sight . All their actions are actually reactions to the fact that they 're losing . They are trying to close the doors , control the flow of information and restrict the flow of capital , but people are finding ways around everything ( especially people like us and the people who read publications like this ) . <p> The blatantly obvious and rather pathetic attempts at information control keep coming . Like the latest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the recent State of the Union address . The order will expand the power of the Department of Homeland Security to " share " information with private industry . In other words , it will be easier for the government to gather information about you from the electronic media you use . And of course , there is the much-talked about " internet kill switch " that Obama and his fellow heads of state are dying to make a reality . <p> Even if the various states all over the world manage to find a way to shut off the Internet , they 'll find out who really won if they do shut the internet down . The entire world is online now . And they all love it . Imagine if we had no email , no Facebook , no Craigslist , and that our smartphones just became plain cell phones again I make no exaggeration when I say that there would be far more people revolting over the loss of these things than over the loss of their right to own firearms . Plus much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic loss at this point would be staggering . You wonder if governments are really and truly that willing to cripple the economies they parasitize in order to maintain their last bits of control . <p> So do n't worry . We won .

@@99475379 @3675379/ <h> Proof that Paying Federal Income Tax is Voluntary <p> Over years of studying government tyranny , monetary reform and freedom , Ive run across a lot of information about how unconstitutional the US Income Tax is , how the 16th Amendment was never ratified by the requisite number of states , and how there 's really no law that compels citizens to pay Federal Income Tax . One of the best documentaries on this topic was the late Aaron Russos film " From Freedom to Fascism " . At one of Ron Pauls early campaign rallies in the Bay Area in July , 2007 , I even arranged for Joe Banister , a former IRS enforcement agent and whistleblower living locally in San Jose to speak about the topic . A lot of the arguments seemed very convoluted to me , and for sure nothing seemed clear enough that you could take on the IRS and a heavy-handed judiciary and expect to come away unscathed . <p> Along comes a fantastic new e-book , " Taxation by Misrepresentation " , by John W. Benson , which I now believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional aspects of our income tax system , as well as the origin of the laws and processes involved in compelling citizens to pay it . Far from being convoluted , it is an extremely logical , sound and extraordinarily well-researched book . The engineer in me can connect all the dots and see where all the legal facts and foundations lie . The book lays out the definitive case that US income tax is absolutely a " voluntary " tax , which can not be made compulsory by virtue of its unconstitutional nature , and which requires a great deal of fraud and outright intimidation on the part of the IRS to convince people that what can only be voluntary , is instead a lawful requirement . <p> The thesis of this book by John Benson is that the US Constitution explicitly disallows a tax on ones labor , and that the 16th Amendment took " Income " to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 . Current Treasury regulations explicitly state exemptions from " gross income " include " those items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxable by the Federal Government " , without ever enumerating such . But our treacherous overlords engineered a legalistic workaround for this thorny dilemma . Such a tax could be implemented if it was in accordance with " due process " according to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution , requiring that such due process does not differ in principle from the statute law of England for the King to collect revenues at the time the Constitution was formed . <p> As a result , all IRS processes and procedures are , in substance and effect , simply the ancient English revenue processes and procedures employed by the kings revenue officials in the Exchequer ( Treasury ) in 1791 dressed up in modern garb . To be sure , the author claims , the words used are different and not easily understood . In fact , these procedures and the laws relating back to them are deliberately shrouded in complexity in order to avoid the populace gaining any real insights to the foundations of our tax system . <p> Therefore , John claims , in order to understand todays tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed by the Exchequer , some dating back in time before King John was forced to sign the Magna Charta , the Great Charter of Liberties , on the Plains of Runnymede in 1215 . If you knew that the foundations of our tax code relate back prior to the Magna Carta , you are in a very small minority . <p> A precedent-setting Supreme Court tax case in 1856 cited several English treatises as authorities on the ancient processes used by the kings Exchequer . John and his associate , Glenn Ambort , spent over a year hunting down the four principal treatises , as they are all long out of print , and read through each of them . They traced the tax processes and procedures employed by the IRS today and laid them side by side with the English processes . By this process , John demonstrates a compelling case that the income tax process used today by the IRS must be based upon one of the only two processes used by the king in 1791 , both of which are cited in the 1856 Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aka an inquest of office ( administrative hearing , in todays terms ) , or a " statute staple " process ( an ancient form of contract enacted by Parliament for the benefit of merchants ) . <p> His conclusion as to which of these two processes apply to the Form 1040 tax return is both startling and has consequences that bring into question the convictions of countless Americans imprisoned for alleged tax crimes , not to mention the billions , perhaps trillions , of dollars collected by force in the name of tax laws . Essentially , the statute staple process is a voluntary contractual process used in merchant law and not common law . The result is that IRS taxation is a voluntary contractual process between consenting parties and can not be compelled on an individual . Much of the IRS code and procedures today are therefore designed to both conform to this fact , while insidiously hiding its significance from the populace , and doing everything in their power to intimidate tax payers to " volunteering " payment , even if at gunpoint . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revealed . In another blog post/book review I wrote , I covered how U.S. Citizens " volunteer " themselves into the status of " U.S. citizen " under the definition of the 14th Amendment . As I pointed out , this new " Federal " citizenship was initially intended for the recently freed slaves ( rather than making them citizens of their states as most citizens were at the time ) . John points out in a blog post on his site how Chief Justice Fuller described the 14th Amendment citizenship rule in United States v.Wong Kim Ark : <p> The rule was the outcome of the connection in feudalism between the individual and the soil on which he lived , and the allegiance due was that of liegemen to their liege lord . It was not local and temporary , as was the obedience to the laws owed by aliens within the dominions of the Crown , but permanent and indissoluble , and not to be cancelled by any change of time or place or circumstances . <p> And it is this rule , pure and simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the entire period prior to the passage of the act of April 9 , 1866 , and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment , and governed the meaning of the words " citizen of the United States " and " natural-born citizen " used in the Constitution as originally framed and adopted . I submit that no such rule obtained during the period referred to , and that those words bore no such construction ; that the act of April 9 , 1866 , expressed the contrary rule ; that the Fourteenth Amendment prescribed the same rule as the act , and that , if that amendment bears the construction now put upon it , it imposed the English common law rule on this country for the first time , and made it " absolute and unbending " just as Great Britain was being relieved from its inconveniences . <p> In other words , if you are a 14th Amendment " citizen " , you are a serf on the land , a liege to your lord , in this case the Federal Government . The Federal Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your labor and can rightfully take your income now ( the compensation for your labor ) as it deems reasonable according to the contractual benefits you " applied for " when you " volunteer " or " contract " yourself into this status . Remember that under the Constitution , we have unalienable rights and are Citizens ( cap " C " ) of the United States of America ( the country , not the corporation ) . How do you " volunteer " yourself to become a 14th Amendment citizen-serf , under the definition designed for freed slaves ? Well , by " voluntarily " submitting your IRS Form 1040 , you annually assert that you are a 14th Amendment citizen ( small " c " ) . The 13th amendment prohibits involuntary servitude , but does not prohibit " voluntary " servitude according to contract law . Ergo , you have been had . This is less the Home of the Free and Land of the Brave , than the Home of Fools and the Land of Liars . <p> So , what do you do now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disclaimer " at the very opening of his book that this is a political battle . Do NOT stop filing the usual tax returns and paying the usual taxes that the IRS and the courts require . This would be like going to a Mafia crime boss and telling him there 's no law allowing him to extract his " security " payments . You will not come out better for the conversation . But realize that we have become a nation of thugs and corruption , and not laws , despite your education to the contrary . John pleads with his readers to unite to overturn the entire system and replace it with a fairer and more transparent tax system for all , rather than for a small number to try to win a few battles in courts that , in his view , are simply not going to allow any victories , truth and justice be damned . <p> John has made this a very easy read for the layman , but provided enough references that other researchers will be able to verify facts for themselves . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesters that will be far more detailed based on his 30+ years of research . Finally , you will be amazed at the personal tribulations that John Benson and his colleague , Glenn Ambort , have been through , as detailed in the final chapters of the book .

@@99475381 @3675381/ <h> The Final Days of Fascist Italy <p> TDV has done an excellent job of defining fascism of late , especially with Pete Kofods article , " Fascism For Dummies " . <p> Fascism was originally founded in Italy , and I can tell you first hand , Italy is still an extremely fascist country . And , when it is not fascist it is communist . As example , there are still laws in place that require a person to notify the authorities when they travel and stay elsewhere and hotels are legally obliged to notify the Carabiniere of the people staying with them . Italy still has it big syndicates . Confindustria is the main business syndicate in Italy , it has considerable influence in Italian politics which is rivalled by the communist unions . <p> Following this philosophy for so long , has created a deep intellectual and social malaise which is evident in two very dangerous beliefs that saturate all Italian thought . The first belief , is that all success and wealth come through the state ; if one does not work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone within the state . The second belief , perhaps the most dangerous , is that wealth is finite . Therefore many believe that wealth only comes from theft ; if others have made their wealth from theft they are entitled to liberate their wealth from others ! <p> Everything else follows from this , government regulation to make the world fair , taxes to make society fair . Unfortunately the business community believes the same lies ; companies want laws to get their fair market share , professionals want fair professions without unfair competition . Everyone wants someone else to pay for their failings , or to have their grand fantasies of societal change subsidised . <p> This is why it will be impossible to save Italy in its current form ; these ideas have been festering since it became a country . One hundred and fifty years of bad ideas are very difficult to change . The only chance for change is when this system finally collapses but it will not be pleasant . The ruling political caste , the unions and syndicates do not want change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> Montis " Save Italy " legislation tries to accomplish this by changing nothing ; there were no major changes to labour legislation , no simplification of the tax system , or tax reductions for individuals and no reduction of government Red Tape . Instead a few bones were thrown to the public ; pharmacists would have to compete with supermarkets for the sale of some medicines . The professional cartels would have been opened up to more competition . This legislation went to parliament ; afterwards all traces of liberalisation were removed with only the most odious legislation remaining . <p> So what is this grand plan meant to save Italy ? <p> First , capital controls . Restrict the use of cash to absurdly low levels , then force everyone to have bank accounts , then tax what is left . Payments in cash , of greater than 999 euros will be illegal with very large fines to those who do not comply . All payments coming from the state , with a value greater than 500 euros must be cleared through a bank . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation . <p> Second , increase government theft . They have changed their tax collection strategy to make sure that everyone pays their fair share . They will increase VAT to 23% and have added stealth taxes to petrol , diesel , gas , electricity and cigarettes . Due to local custom of tax evasion , they will start targeting people whose names are in property registers . There will be a tax on all real estate with extra waste taxes included and kindly calculated by the state on inflated property values . <p> These new emergency measures in Greece , Portugal , Spain , United Kingdom , United States and Italy are part of a wider campaign between the parasitic State and wealth producers . The way for us to win this war , is to stop feeding the monster ; remove your consent by not voting , teaching your own children , use all legal means to avoid paying taxes and finally , by moving your wealth from these fascist countries . <p> Alexander JousseBio : Alexander Jousse has been an anarcho-capitalist for eight years , learning through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stefan Molyneux .

Alexander has lived in Italy for the last six years and writes about the country to counter the mainstream media who appear to get their information from the propaganda wing of the old communist party . Their solutions are always the same ; tax , spend and regulate ! Historically Italy is a perfect example of the despotism of democracy ; before the nation state period , the cities , kingdoms and republics of Italy were wealthy and free .

The boom-bust cycle <p> While he makes good points for each , we take exception based on historical precedent , common sense and factual data . <p> 1 . The Temporary Nature of the Payoff <p> Gary North states : <p> " Hyperinflation lasts only a few years . People in the hard-money camp ought to know this , but they tend to forget . <p> Those economic forecasters who keep telling us the dollar will fall to zero forget the obvious : big banks are creditors . Bankers lose when a currency falls to zero . " <p> And , yes , that is correct . The bankers ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market financial system ) would lose everything if the currency goes to zero . <p> However , that has never stopped them before . In fact , during many of the hyperinflations of our time , including Weimar and the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina , the last people to see the causes of the hyperinflation ( money printing ) are the central bankers and the economists of the banks . <p> Remember , theyve all been brainwashed with modern day Keynesian economics , which is witchcraft and delusionary . They actually believe that inflation is caused by prosperity and not money printing . That 's why the following quotes were made during the Weimar Republic hyperinflation after they had already had thousands of percent gains in prices : <p> And , even when the US dollar goes to zero , it does not mean the banks are out of luck . Not if they were like the French banks in the beginning of the 20th century . In a book published in 1912 , called " Fiat Money Inflation in France " , Andrew White recounts how the government changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuance of further currency , so that for every so many additional assignats printed , ones debts increased by 25% . <p> The US Government owns all the guns . It would not be beyond them to state that all debts held in dollars are now held in the New Dollar . Or , what they will likely name , the " Patriot dollar " . <p> Here , Gary North states that thanks to the internet and Ron Paul , too many people understand what the Federal Reserve does and they wo n't allow them to go into hyperinflation . <p> He makes a good point here that the public is more aware than ever about the Federal Reserve criminal enterprise . <p> However , in order for Ben Bernanke to stop he would have to admit that everything he has focused on for his entire life and achieved has all been a lie . Not many people have this kind of ability to admit complete error in their ways after having their entire persona based on the false information . <p> Plus , the entire US media propaganda organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve until its dying days . Paul Krugman at the New York Times has been wrong for years and years about absolutely everything yet he is still thought of by many people as being a " smart " economist despite his calling for a housing bubble after the tech bubble and now having resorted to stating that the best way to get the American economy on track is through a massive , fake alien invasion . <p> Remember , that almost every US economics PhD , every major economist at most banks and people like Bernanke and Krugman will all have to admit they were all fools in order for them to stop with their Keynesian witchcraft . Most white , older men who look in the mirror and see they are monsters rarely admit their flaws they tend to take us all down into hell with them rather than , as the Japanese say , " lose face " . <p> In Japan , at least , when a finance minister realizes his policies havent worked he usually kills himself . We can only hope for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cycle <p> Here , Gary North states that because of the boom-bust cycle , the US will be forced to stop printing money before entering hyperinflation . As example , he states how Volcker was forced by rapidly rising prices to slow money printing and allow T-Bill rates to rise to 22% to stop the inflation . <p> There is only one problem with this . The US Government debt in 1979 was hardly anything as it had only been 8 years since Nixon delinked the dollar from gold . Today , however , the US Government ( and most western governments , ask Greece ) have had plenty of time to build up mountains of debt . <p> Today , as we showed here , an interest rate of only 11.1% will effectively take all real income of the US Government just to pay for the interest alone . <p> In other words , raising the interest rates to even 11% this time around will destroy the US Government . <p> That 's why Paul Volcker , who was on a " panel of experts " advising Barack Obama already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took out his calculator , punched in a few numbers , looked around and decided it was time to retire . <p> Greenspan left on similar premises right before his housing bubble burst . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Gary North makes some good arguments . And he very well could be right . But historical evidence , common sense and the amount of current US debt makes stopping this train towards hyperinflation a lot tougher job than it looks . <p> We are n't  counting on it . Even if all we have is " mass inflation " our portfolios , heavily laden with gold and gold stocks will do very well . If we do get US hyperinflation , many dollar vigilantes are also prepared for that as well , having left or in the process of moving assets outside of the US , getting a second passport ( like here in the Dominican Republic ) or expatriating outside of the western world . <p> Hyperinflation is n't fun . And we are n't  as convinced as Gary North that it is so impossible .

It appears in it 's entirety in this week 's edition of TDV Newsletter <p> The Ukraine is a cesspool of geo-political posturing , and it poses a great danger to our society . What is going on in the Ukraine is openly admitted by mainstream media to be largely helped along by US taxpayer money via government . This involvement by the US , on Russia 's border , is really an act of war . As The Guardianwrote in 2004 : <p> " the campaign Orange Revolution is an American creation , a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in western branding and mass marketing that , in four countries in four years , has been used to try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavoury regimesThe Democratic party 's National Democratic institution , the Republicn party 's International Republican Institute , the US state department and USAid are the main agencies involved in these grassroots campaigns as well as the Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The US-NATO military and intelligence chimera was not supposed to expand at the end of the Cold War . But it did . And this poses a problem for everybody , especially the children and unborn . The battle for the Ukraine leaves room for error and escalation , of this there can be absolutely no doubt . None . <p> Of course , the worst case scenario is World War III . The Pentagon and NATO for sure does not see this as an " abstract concept , " as many researchers point out . <p> What Might World War III look like ? <p> As the US prepared to invade Iraq , there was a famous exercise by NATO and the US named TIRANNT , standing for Theater Iran Near Term . At that point , the media was going haywire over the military threat of Iran , and threatening pre-emptive war . TIRANNT placed Russia , China and Iran and North Korea as the foes of the west . In other words , this is who the western military alliance saw as the theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . That scenario was leaked to the Washington Post . Suffice it to say World War III would n't be pretty . <p> The Ukrainian Minister of Defense has been replaced as have key commanders of the Ukrainian forces , many of whom were dismissed . This seems like a classic coup . It must be said large sectors of the armed forces and the police there are loyal to President Yanukovych . These are the ingredients for a civil war , as many in the Crimea apparently feared from the beginning . And , of course , the purpose of the coup was to install puppets . Word of Neo-Nazi 's being placed in powerful positions is betokening of Brussels and the US desiring a political apparatus in the Ukraine which obeys orders . <p> The impoverishment of the Ukrainian population via western creditors and the IMF is a sure thing . This is what the IMF means by offering aid to countries . The aid always comes with certain conditions IMF reforms and any aid offered to a country like Ukraine is typically needed right away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be inheriting more debt is all . This debt will come with conditions such as frozen wages , austerity measures and the like . Economic collapse of the Ukraine is already underway . The Ukrainian people will be totally bankrupted . And passionate fascists are in power <p> Failing Diplomacy <p> As I type this , diplomacy is failing over the Ukraine . Already the US Department of Energy has announced that it would sell crude from the US strategic petroleum reserve . This move is geared towards undermining Russia for which high energy prices are more important than the performance of the Russian stock market . Bloomberg also reported that the US , according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , " has claimed that in the case of an escalation of unrest in Crimea , the US Army is ready to back up Ukraine and its allies in Europe with military actions . " <p> The Gold Factor <p> Other strange news is coming out of the Ukraine as well . This story is specious at best , but interesting nonetheless . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded onboard an unmarked plane , which subsequently took the gold to the US . From the source : <p> Tonight , around at 2:00 am , an unregistered transport plane took off took off from Boryspil airport . <p> According to Boryspil staff , prior to the plane 's appearance , four trucks and two cargo minibuses arrived at the airport all with their license plates missing . Fifteen people in black uniforms , masks and body armor stepped out , some armed with machine guns . These people loaded the plane with more than forty heavy boxes . <p> After this , several mysterious men arrived and also entered the plane . The loading was carried out in a hurry . After unloading , the plateless cars immediately left the runway , and the plane took off on an emergency basis . <p> Airport officials who saw this mysterious " special operation " immediately notified the administration of the airport , which however strongly advised them " not to meddle in other people 's business . " <p> Later , the editors were called by one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who reported that , according to him , tonight on the orders of one of the " new leaders " of Ukraine , all the gold reserves of the Ukraine were taken to the United States . <p> The folks at GATA looked into this . They asked the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about Ukraine 's gold , to which the Fed replied : " Any inquiry regarding gold accounts should be directed to the account holder . You may want to contact the National Bank of Ukraine to discuss this report . " <p> What 's for sure is that tensions over the Ukraine have made the best case for gold in years . In fact , gold rose to a six month high on Thursday due to global economic concerns ( slowdown in China ) and of course worries about Russia and the US 's Ukraine standoff . Gold began to rise when Russia launched military exercises near its border with Ukraine , and data of US involvement in the Ukraine started surfacing . This trend has n't slowed .

In one town , as you 'll learn below , it 's already started . <p> THE ANSWER <p> Question : How long has police brutality been around ? <p> Answer : Ever since there was police . <p> Sure , some places its better and some places it is worse . <p> But , have you ever noticed when you have a problem and you keep trying to fix it and it never works then , what you realize , was that you had the wrong concept ? As a simple example , when you try to remove the lid off a jar of pickels and you try and try but just ca n't ? Then , finally , you realize you were trying to turn it the wrong way ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . <p> It 's the same with the police brutality question . You keep trying to fix it and fix it but never can . Why ? Because you 've got the wrong concept . <p> You may laugh or even feel rage at what I just said . That 's because you 've been programmed through government schools and television programming to think there is no other way . <p> Read just a few paragraphs further and you will totally get it . I will show you that you are turning the pickle jar lid the wrong way in the next few seconds . <p> Question : What do most people think police are for ? <p> Answer : For protecting the public . <p> That is not what they are for . They are there to protect the system which enslaves you and us all . The people of Baltimore , and everywhere in the world , should be able to see that clearly after all these centuries . <p> What happens when you privatize the police ? You get better service . Way better service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " service " anyway , it is oppression , as most in Baltimore can see daily . <p> You may think " private policing " is impossible . And , in one sense you are right . When it is called " private policing " what is meant is " private security " . The police are paid with stolen money ( taxes ) and are paid to mostly extort ( give tickets/fines ) to people who never hurt anyone or to kidnap ( arrest ) mostly people who also never hurt anyone . <p> So , you do n't want " police " at all . <p> What you want is security . How do you get security ? <p> Two ways : <p> 1 . Protect yourself . Of course , with all the anti-gun legislation that is difficult . But , without " police " those laws would disappear and you could protect yourself . That 's exactly what happened in Ferguson and Baltimore as some armed citizens actually protected their own property . As well , technology is bringing solutions . There is an app called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves . If you have a problem , just hit a button on the app and your entire community will know about the problem and many will come to your aid . <p> 2 . If you do n't want to or ca n't protect yourself then hire a security firm . They certainly could n't be worse than the " police " who mostly badger people . If you were paying a security firm , at say $20/month , they would offer the best service to make sure you always had the best protection . And if they did n't , a competing firm would pop up and offer you better service for the same price or the same service for cheaper . <p> Do n't think it 's possible ? In Detroit , due to the fact that the city was so broke they could barely keep up a police force , luckily , private security firms became popular . If you want to see the difference between a private security firm and the public police , just watch this short video and your eyes will open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if police were privatized . <p> That private security firm has been in business for 20 years and has the goal of always reaching the most " non-violent outcome possible " . In those 20 years none of their clients , none of their security team nor even any of the criminals have been hurt . <p> And , before you say , " what about people who ca n't defend themselves or pay a security firm ? " . That Detroit private security firm makes such good profits from its corporate and private clients that it offers its services to free for those who ca n't afford it . <p> It is really this simple . Just privatize the police . <p> HOW TO PRIVATIZE THE POLICE <p> This is the harder part , but definitely not impossible . <p> All you have to do is spread this information widely . Share this article , share the video above . Once enough people understand that the simple , easiest and best solution is to privatize the police then there will be enough momentum to start privatizing police forces around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understanding that the system as it currently is was never designed to protect the people and can never be fixed . How many more decades do you want to go through this ? <p> Start locally in your communities and spread this information . And , that is all it is , information . <p> Just like the key to opening the pickle jar was just a misunderstanding in your own mind of the way it worked and once you understood how it worked it was easy this is the same . <p> The answer , always , begins within you . And , the answer , always , is a peaceful answer not a violent answer . <p> You do n't need to burn cars and beg or yell at politicians to try to change things that never works . <p> Outstanding !

The only way to remedy this situation will be with much higher prices , either through a higher spot silver price , higher premiums , or both . As of now , buyers must pay huge premiums for immediate delivery , or wait for the item to hopefully come back in stock . That is the textbook definition of what happens during a shortage . And yet , paper ( ie. not bullion ) quoted silver prices continue to fall , not rise . <p> A year ago , spot silver was $19.50 per oz . With a 5% premium , that equates to a price of $20.48 per oz of 90% junk silver one year ago . Today , the spot price of silver is $14.60 . <p> However , with the premium at 40% instead of 5% , each ( silver ) ounce of 90% junk silver now costs $20.44 . Contrary to media reports , and the depressed paper price , you actually pay just pennies below 52 week highs for 90% junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do not buy into the lies of a " falling " silver price . The downside to silver here is extremely limited , and the upside nearly unlimited . If the price heads any lower , premiums will shoot even higher , or physical metal will simply vanish until prices head higher . <p> 90% junk silver still has a face value that is recognized in the USA , and is easily recognizable and divisible . It is often called " survival money " due to these factors . A 1964 dime is the same size and design as a 2015 dime . The only difference is the silver content . People recognize it and it is nearly impossible to counterfeit . It is ideal for small purchases . <p> To summarize Peter Schiff from a recent interview : Silver is like a lifeboat .

Better to be a few months too- early , than even a microsecond too late , when physical silver supplies dry up for real . <p> And here 's a timely statement from the SilverInstitute.org : " In recent years , fabrication demand has greatly outpaced mine production forcing market participants to use existing stocks to meet demand .

This is nothing new and in previous years it has not been a reflection of overall supply so I 'm going to make the prediction this year will be no different . <p> ozlanthos <p> I think it may be a little different now .

I think there is n't really a shortage of gold and silver , just a disconnect in price so producers are holding on rather than sell at a loss or cheaply , hence the high premiums . The premiums are just making up for the price difference , not a reflection of true scarcity .

What do you think will happen when corporations such as shale oil producers or even countries such as Greece , Italy , Spain etc. start defaulting on loans in a big way , maybe triggered by a Fed interest rate rise ? A massive banking crisis will occur as banks stop lending to each other . You will have multiple banking failures across the world due to derivative blowups etc . European and American banks are particularly vulnerable .

If you cant understand this then you have a severe problem . <p> retiredsandman <p> There are very few primary mining companies that can break even at these spot prices ( First Majestic and Tahoe Resources are the only I know of ) . High-Grading to go after the rich deposits is an inefficient way of doing things since it makes it impossible to subsequently go after the lower grade ore without rendering the mine unstable and subject to cave-in . Needless to say new exploration is completely shut-in . You 're going to see more and more mines go on " care and maintenance " , those who watch those things are reporting its happening now . Furthermore , the majority of mined silver comes as a result of byproduct mining . However , since prices for those commodities ( copper , gold , zinc primarily ) are at multi-decade lows and are in even worse shape than silver , there wont be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low prices . <p> Robert McCann <p> We knew this day would come .. <p> blue bear <p> yup <p> Howhow <p> Silver and gold will b the last things that break , the people behind the scenes are manipulating the price down so they can buy phizz on the cheap duh , once they create the " shortage " they allow the physical market to default , once that happens all ur silver dreams will ce true . The sheep will run to physical bullion as paper dies , panic/greed sets in . When this happens is anyones guess . <p> retiredsandman <p> There will be no default because the futures markets do n't  trade physical metal at all .

Anthropology , linguistic analysis and sociology now serve the police state . <p> One program is called the Minerva Initiative after the Roman goddess of war . A June 12th article in the Guardianexplained , " A US Department of Defense ( DoD ) research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics , risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world , under the supervision of various US military agencies . " Note : Minerva funding is typically channeled through less controversial agencies such as the National Institutes of Health . Established in 2008 , Minerva was budgeted to fund approximately $75 million worth of behavioral research over a five year period . It is now six years later . In 2014 to date , Minerva has distributed approximately $17.8 million . <p> A typical project : over the next three years , Cornell University will model " the dynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will locate the tipping point in uprisings such as the revolution in Egypt of 2011 . Then the data can be extrapolated to make observations about uprisings in general . The Minerva site states , <p> The Department of Defense is interested in better understanding what drives individuals and groups to mobilize to institute change . In particular , models that explain and explore factors that motivate or inhibit groups to adopt political violence as a tactic will help inform understanding of where organized violence is likely to erupt , what factors might explain its contagion , and how one might circumvent its spread . <p> In practice , Minerva makes little distinction between violent and non-violent dissent . In 2013 , one of funded projects asked and answered the question " Who Does Not Become a Terrorist , and Why ? " The primary researcher , Prof Maria Rasmussen of the US Naval Postgraduate School , described the project 's mission , " In every context we find many individuals who share the demographic , family , cultural , and/or socioeconomic background of those who decided to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militancy , even though they were sympathetic to the end goals of armed groups . The field of terrorism studies has not , until recently , attempted to look at this control group . This project is not about terrorists , but about supporters of political violence . " <p> In other words , a person who is sympathetic to the justice of a violent group 's goals is an integral part of terrorism even if he is a pacifist . A belief , not an action , is what makes him a terrorist supporter . For example , a weaponless writer could sympathize with gun owners who defend the second amendment by drawing weapons on their own property . A commentator might argue for the release of free speech activists who are imprisoned for resisting arrest . To sympathize with dissent and to argue against authority suddenly becomes part of political violence . <p> Nafeez Ahmed , a journalist on international security , authored the June 12 article in the Guardian . He asked Rasmussen why non-violent activists were lumped together with violent ones , and precisely which people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US Department of Defense consider political movements aiming for large scale political and economic change as a national security matter ? If so , why ? " <p> No reply . Finally , the programming director of Minerva sent what amounted to a form letter from the press office that used many words to say nothing . <p> Minerva is not the first program to militarize social scientists . The Human Terrain System ( HTS ) , for example , was launched in 2005 . Through it , social scientists provide the military with an understanding of a population and culture with which they are interacting . Roberto J. Gonzalez , an Associate Professor of Anthropology at San Jose State University , is a prominent critic of HTS . He traces the origins of the project back to " the perceived threat of the Black Panthers and other militant groups . " In short , it sprang up from a perceived need for domestic social control . <p> Last month , Ars Technicareported on the Social Media in Strategic Communications project run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social media . Another project went further . Funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory , the study " Containment Control for a Social Network with State-Dependent Connectivity " explicitly aimed at manipulating the " end " toward which ideas flow electronically . Ars Technica explained , " The research demonstrates that the mathematical principles used to control groups of autonomous robots can be applied to social networks in order to control human behavior . If properly calibrated , the mathematical models developed by Dixon and his fellow researchers could be used to sway the opinion of social networks toward a desired set of behaviors " <p> These and other programs will almost certainly be applied domestically , if that is not happening already . On the Civil Arab site ( June 18 ) , human rights lawyer Zaha Hassan commented , " This research is unlikely to be limited to understanding uprisings and large-scale protests overseas , in some distant corner of the planet . In a post-9/11 world , the borders and contours of US national security are more fuzzy and fluid . Activists in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that they will fall under Minervas radar whenever they share a Facebook posting on Palestine or tweet a catchy little diddy on Twitter supporting other political activists in Syria , Egypt , or Iraq . " <p> The drift toward social and ideological control is inevitable . In fact , that has been a key goal of Minerva since it was first established . Then-Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates signaled it in an April 2008 speech in which he announced Minerva . " Eventual success in the conflict against jihadist extremism will depend less on the results of individual military engagements and more on the overall ideological climate within the world of Islam . Understanding how this climate is likely to evolve over time , and what factors including US actions will affect it thus becomes one of the most significant intellectual challenge sic we face . " <p> Minerva will also be used to impose unpopular political agendas against which the public might revolt . For example , in 2013 , a three-year $1.9 million project with the University of Maryland was tasked to assess the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People do not rebel because of a rise in temperature ; they rebel against government measures that ' respond ' to climate change . <p> Government officials will never admit Minerva is being used or will be used domestically and for social control ; they will deny it as the NSA did with its mass recording of average Americans . They will do so until denial is no longer possible . And , even then , they will continue to hide the scope of their attempt at thought control . They will do so because their fear is mounting . <p> On July 18 , Vice President Joseph Biden spoke to a conference in Detroit about the social crisis sparked by the Obama administration 's cynical use of illegal immigrants , especially children . ( That was n't Biden 's take on the situation , of course . ) Addressing the perceived problem of immigrants stealing jobs , he paid faux homage to the middle class , which was " the glue that has enabled us to be the most stable political and stable social system in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of civil unrest in America . " When that the middle class begins to fray , much more will fray than the loss of economic opportunity . " <p> Biden is correct to fear . Americans are increasingly aware that politicians are the enemy and widespread revolt is becoming more likely .

Civil liberties are suspended . In the United States , a pivot point that signals martial law is the suspension of habeas corpus the right to a hearing on whether an imprisonment is lawful . In practice , habeas corpus means a person can not be imprisoned without legitimate charges and due process . The U.S. Constitution recognizes the suspension of habeas corpus as an identifying feature of martial law in Article I Safety may require it . " <p> Obama is preparing to declare martial law in America . He may decide not to do so but it is a prepared option that requires nothing more than the say-so of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The National Defense Resources Preparedness grants Obama power over " resources and services needed to supportplans and programs " in " the event of a potential threat to the security of the United States . " The grant of authority is so complete that it includes the ability to commandeer technology , industry , and the nation 's other resources down to its " food resources , livestock resources , and the distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer . " <p> The legal framework for martial law is in place . <p> The signs are unmistakable . They include : Homeland Security recently purchased $1.6 billion worth of ammunition for domestic use by its 100,000+ armed enforcement agents ; it also acquired thousands of military-style armored vehicles . <p> The clearest sign , however , is the National Defense Authorization Act the federal legislation through which the budget and expenditures of the Department of Defense are specified each year . In 2012 , Sec. 1021 of the act allowed the military to arrest and imprison an American on American soil without habeas corpus if he was deemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces " ( e.g. the Taliban ) . The 2013 act included the same provision . In short , the NDAA authorized indefinite detention without due process . The 2014 act is currently under debate . It would expand the military 's power over the civilian population through Sec. 1061 which is also known as Enhancement of Capacity of the United States Government to Analyze Captured Records . It authorizes the surveillance of an individual solely on the basis that he is or has been hostile to the United States . In short , the new NDAA would authorize indefinite surveillance . <p> The enforcement mechanism for martial law is in place . What would it look like ? <p> There is no need to speculate . The police response to the Boston Marathon bombings provides a glance into what Americans can expect in the event of another terrorist attack or domestic unrest . Or , rather , it provides an example of a kinder , gentler martial law than is likely to occur . It is kinder and gentler because the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian population ; they had the specific goal of capturing a fugitive rather than the general one of policing the population ; no one resisted ; and , the agents could have faced consequences such as lawsuits if they had inflicted injury . Most martial law scenarios are likely to be more brutal . <p> On April 15 , 2013 , three people were killed and hundreds injured when pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon . Two brothers named Tamerlan and Dzhokhas Tsarnaev became suspects . Tamerlan died , Dzhokhas escaped . An unparalleled manhunt occurred on April 19 . <p> The Boston Globe ( June 8 ) explained why law enforcement 's response was so coordinated . " The police training scenario had been carefully planned : A terrorist group prepared to hurt vast numbers of people around Boston would leave backpacks filled with explosives at Faneuil Hall . But two months before the training exercise was to take place , the city was hit with a real terrorist attack executed in a frighteningly similar fashion . " <p> The mainstream media reported that " officers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and checking out homes to find the fugitive . ( Los Angeles Times , April 19 ) The unreported reality was more disturbing . <p> Watertown , a bedroom community of Boston , was one of the areas put on " shelter-in-place " an emergency procedure that is most often associated with chemical spills . The procedure involves people staying indoors , mostly in their homes , while the danger is handled by authorities . It is a form of martial law with law enforcement replacing the military as actors . Civil liberties are suspended , of course . <p> When the fugitive was spotted in Watertown , agents in riot gear descended on 20 blocks of the town , accompanied by armored personnel carriers . The civil liberties of residents were suspended by the pronouncement of one word : " manhunt . " Two syllables that 's how quickly totalitarianism descends . <p> With dogs and without warrants , the agents went from house to house and forced people to vacate at gun point . Residents in robes were driven into the street and not allowed to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab a cell phone . No questions were permitted . One video shows an agent violently slapping people 's elbows upward to force hands behind their heads . Another shows a soldier in a tank pointing his rifle at a photographer . The following video entitled " MSNBC Host Caught Lying About Watertown Martial Law " describes typical encounters . The lies ? No tanks were used , no guns were pointed at families . <p> In the end , Dzhokhas was apprehended only after the lock-down of Watertown ended and the agents had departed . A resident discovered Dzhokhas hiding in his backyard and reported him to the police . The agents had overlooked the fugitive 's presence . <p> The lock-down of the Boston area is not an isolated incident . It is part of a well-funded , coordinated federal program called Operation Urban Shield . ( The Boston training exercise received a $200,000 grant from Homeland Security . ) The Urban Shield website states , " The overarching goals of Urban Shield include striving for the capability to present a multi-layered training exercise to enhance the skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those responsible for coordinating and managing large scale events . " Law enforcement is being trained to impose martial law . Americans are being trained to obey without question . <p> People sometimes marvel over how a civilized populace like the pre-Nazi Germans were blind to the approach of totalitarianism . How could they miss the signs ? Most Americans are missing the hint presented by armored personnel vehicles rolling into a peaceful community . They prefer media lies to the sight of agents aiming their guns at typical American families . That preference will also facilitate martial law . <p> Wendy McElroy is a renowned individualist anarchist and individualist feminist . She was a co-founder along with Carl Watner and George H. Smith of The Voluntaryist in 1982 , and is the author/editor of twelve books , the latest of which is " The Art of Being Free " .

I think the ease with which he ( and his wife ) did that suggests that the answer to your question is Yes ! <p> In case anyone who has experienced the door-unlocking effects of various substances can confirm my understanding and is interested in exploring the issue I present below , I figured I 'd write my latest thoughts here . <p> I imagine that when these doors are unlocked , one realization is that the universe has desire , and to the extent we align ourselves with that desire , we " feel good " . I guess I 'm defining the experience of " feeling good " as " aligning oneself with the desires of the universe . " On heroin ( I 've never been ) , one feels pretty good right ? Or maybe not . Maybe what heroin does is prevent us from feeling it numbs us . To the extent that we are willing to feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate with it . <p> In a Youtube featuring Ken Wilber , I read a comment distinguishing between consciousness ( which is related to a specific piece of the universe , generally called " you " ) and awareness ( which is not related to any specific piece of the universe ) . I like the distinction . Awareness can be used by consciousness to help maintain the health or happiness of the host body that supports that consciousness , but it does n't  have to . It is possible to simply be aware of things that are not related to ones own self . <p> When I saw the second plane hit one of the twin towers , I realized that there was intent behind the disaster , and this made me cry . I was in California , so it had nothing to do with me , but I was aware of this intent .

In move-after-move , Russia and China have become closer allies . There are numerous examples of this . For brevity 's sake , two recent examples catch the eye . Gazprom issued bonds in the Chinese Yuan and Russia and China also signed a gas deal . There are many more examples . 40 central banks have even placed bets on the yuan as the future reserve currency . <p> Until 2014 tales of dollar collapse seemed to be for conspiracy nuts , as geopolitics only faintly reflected this seeming reality . This year , that all has changed . It seems nation-states the world over are making moves towards a post-US Dollar world . It is not a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't understand this coming-to-pass you will be in for quite the shockand awe . <p> Once Russia , along with numerous allies , makes the fateful move , you can be sure many nations will follow . They already are trying to do so . Why ? Because the US is the most destructive force on the planet , and it 's achille 's heel is its " exorbitant privilege " known as the US dollar by most , and the Federal Reserve Note by those " in the know . " <p> This will spell hyperinflation , social chaos , civil war , among other dislocations . Think this is hyperbole ? It 's not . To know that all one needs to do is look at the history of socialist banana republicsand then imagine something much , much worse . Why much worse ? Because none of those banana republics were issuer of the world 's reserve currency . The US does n't produce a thing except the US dollar which are extremely easy to print as one man in Canada proved . He printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , Canada chose not to extradite him so he is a free man . <p> And so major nation-states are joining together to move beyond the dollar system . A " de-dollarized " world , as it is called in Russia , will change the lives of millions of Americans . <p> RISE OF RUSSIA &amp; CHINA <p> According to Voice of Russia , the Russian Ministry of Finance is looking to significantly increase the role of the Russian ruble in export operations while reducing the share of dollar-denominated transactions . The Russian banking sector , believe many , is " ready to handle the increased number of ruble-denominated transactions " . <p> The Prime news agency reported that , on April 24th , the government organized a special meeting dedicated to finding a solution for getting rid of the US dollar in Russian export operations . Top level experts from banks , government and the energy sector came together as a number of proposals were put forth as a response for American sanctions against Russia . <p> This " de-dollarization meeting " was chaired by First Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how serious Moscow is when it comes to moving beyond the dollar . <p> A subsequent meeting , chaired by Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev , reviewed how " the amount of ruble-denominated contracts will be increased . " According to Moiseev , none of the experts and bank representatives polled found problems with the government 's plan to increase the share of ruble payments . <p> The dollar , of course , has been in an elongated freefall , of course , since the invocation of the Federal Reserve and the income tax act in 1913 . <p> But what little remains appears to be hanging by a thread . <p> RUSSIA 'S NOT ALONE <p> Russia would n't be so bold if it did n't have support . Other nations want to engage in a de-dollarization of the world . Both China and Iran , for instance , have been vocal about their interest in moving forward with such a plan . Many other leaders have expressed such interest , only to meet Washington 's notorious bullets and eternity . <p> Vladimir Putin is scheduled to visit Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts will be signed between Russia and China and denominated in rubles and yuan , not dollars . <p> In just one week , we could be living in a significantly different world . <p> The West is out of control , with russophobes in control of US foreign policy . This means the US will antagonize Russia and other nations . This will only quicken the abandonment of the US dollar by Russia , China and the world . <p> The world is setting up the financial and economic infrastructure to simply ignore the United States entirely . What can the US do about it ? Bomb more countries . But I am not so sure that is entirely possible for the US like it was just one decade ago . Humanity has awoken and already one war ( Syria ) was stopped by public outrage . There will be more such wars stopped by popular opposition . <p> The US 's compromised position means one thing : China and Russia will make their moves , playing chess while Obama plays checkers . <p> Japan and India signed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs are planning alongside China , Russia , Japan and France to end dollar dealings for oil , using instead a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar . <p> THE END OF THE MONETARY SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT ( TEOTMSAWKI ) <p> We are on the cusp of a massive paradigm shift in the global monetary system and hardly anyone is aware of it . Businessmen in the US are making plans and expending capital as though we are in a recovery . Americans continue to spend money and save little with the same expectations . And investors continue to invest as though everything is perfectly fine . They have difficulty conceptualizing the truth about the US economy , which is that it is as mired in debt as it possibly could be . The US is in so much debt that the numbers are mind-expanding for humanity . <p> Trillions of dollars in capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western world into something that may be written about for centuries as one of the darkest periods in human history and labelled the Great Collapse .

Even if its not true , shipping is still nearly dead in the water according to other indices. - The Baltic Dry Index , an assessment of the price of moving major raw materials by sea , was already at record all-time lows a month ago . <p> In the last month it has dropped even more , especially in the last week . <p> Factories are n't buying and retailers are n't stocking . - The ratio of inventory to sales in the US is an indicator of this. - The last time that ratio was this high was during the " great recession " in 2008 . <p> Hey , Ms. Yellen , what recovery ?

Interruptions in goods and services , most critically food , almost happened in 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis . - For three days worldwide shipping was stranded- due to shipping companies not knowing whether or not the receivers bank credit was good . <p> That crisis was staved off due to a massive amount of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like bailing out the Titanic with coffee cups , however , and one that may reach much larger proportions in 2016 . <p> Sailors watch the weather to see if it is safe to set sail . - Investors should be watching the economic climate with the same- intensity . <p> It is not ture to say that there is no ship in transit . In website like Marine taraffic , you will not get ships position when ship is not in port . Only ships near port will be shown in that , because the position of ship is shown from AIS ( automatic identification System ) data transmitted . The antennas to receive AIS signals are only near land . Also none of the ships ( oil tankers ) in my company is at anchorage/waiting .

Then you have the audacity to proclaim yourself as Christ the Lord ? <p> You are not willing to DIE FOR IT as He was .. <p> You can continue your work of deception . The author was quite honest when he claimed that he was not a shipping expert . <p> So I employed the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . <p> And what I found is that only 15% of the Cargo Ships and Oil Tankers are in the ocean . <p> And the Baltic Dry Index is plummeting . And you deceive yourself that you are saved . <p> Just because you think that it is about making money , about Mammon , does not mean that others have the same motivation . <p> I know there is no imaginary sky god universe creator for the same reason I know there is no Santa Clause , the tooth fairy , Zeus , Athena , Thor , and Wotan . <p> Maccalusso <p> Correlating a God/Creator with a known fictitious character like Santa Claus is hardly a legitimate comparison . I can understand someone having doubts about a supernatural entity that is all-knowing and omnipresent ( even though the evidence to support is everywhere ) , but to state emphatically that such a force does n't  exist is absurd . <p> Surely you believe the Infinite Universe exists , even though you ( or no other mortal ) have ever witnessed its vastness . Since it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason you should at least accept the possibility of existence . <p> Perhaps disassociating God with Organized Religion ( a human construct designed for profit/control ) would help you achieve a little faith . Nothing to lose much to gain . Do n't  let the Antichrist horde make a monkey out of you . <p> " My attempts to demonstrate Evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed . " Bacteriologist Dr. Nils Heribert-Nilsson <p> Since it can not be proven or disproved a Santa Clause or a tooth fairy exists , it stands to reason you should at least accept the possibility of their existence . <p> Do n't  let the religious anti-scientists make a hominid out of you . <p> Maccalusso <p> Hominid ? Isnt that a part of an evolutionists delusional world as well ? Okay , so your comeback was a bit lame but no matter . <p> Atheists claim they use sound logic and reason to theorize . That 's something easily disproved . Richard Dawkins , the Saviour of the Atheist congregation has argued about where the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the the mid-point is on a string of infinite numbers . Only a fool would attempt to apply finite knowledge to something infinite and expect a rational result . <p> Sound logic and reason can only conclude that the size of the universe is incalculable and infinite in dimension , with no beginning , no end , no borders , and definitely no center . Correlate that with an omniscient , omnipotent and omnipresent Being a God infinite in wisdom , understanding , power , and scope . It explains why Christianity reigns supreme over any other religion , belief , or scientific hypothesis . <p> In closing , its evident you 've made your God-given choice to put your faith in what you believe to be righteous and true . Good luck with that . As Bob Dylan accurately wrote , " It may be the Devil or it may be the Lord , but you got ta serve somebody . " <p> Maccalusso <p> By the way , its easy to disprove Santa Claus . Reindeer cant fly and no fat man could ever fit down my chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just mirrored your argument for a supernatural entity that is all-knowing and omnipresent , and applied it to Santa Claus and the tooth fairy . <p> So when you use your argument it is sound , but when I use your argument , then it is lame . Ok <p> And how do you know the universe is infinite ? What evidence do you have for that . The answer is we do n't  know . Ca n't speak to Richard Dawkins as to his claim where the center of the Universe is , you are probably misquoting him . I bet he referred to the observable Universe . <p> Oh and " good luck with that " ? So you are implying I will be tortured forever because I am an atheist , and you have no moral qualms about it . Typical moral thuggery from a Christian . <p> Mad Pierrot <p> Those are ALL bogus . Except for the Flying Spaghetti Monster ! <p> EdMSmith <p> said the man who knew everything ! Do you imagine you know everything ? or can you admit you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know is that you are an adult who believes in a magical , universe creating , sky god . Grow up . <p> Tall Tom <p> Well then tell me the Mathematical Odds of this particular Universe manifesting as a chance event . <p> Now you can bring up Membrane Theory and Infinite Universes if you want . The problem is that no EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE exists for that . It actually be a violation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to suggest that Empirical Evidence can be measured . <p> Yet the Empirical Evidence for the existence of this Universe is apparent . <p> So do tell me the odds that this Universe manifested itself by chance . They are quantifiable . <p> I will give you a hint Lookup Roger Penrose as he quantified them . <p> Then tell me the Mathematical Definition of an ABSURDITY . <p> Then tell me how many multiples of Absurdities there are in those odds of a Chance Manifestation . <p> Please continue <p> Steffen Frost <p> Are winding up to make the fallacious God of the Gaps argument ? The origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the license to plug in " Therefore God created it " for an answer . Besides , then you would have to tell me the odds that this God manifested itself by chance , a God for which you have no evidence for other than your childish fantasy game of make believe . <p> mava <p> WTF ? R u 4 real ? <p> ExpatRiot <p> good to see you back Mava , have missed your posts <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> You are an idiot Tom , Christos is a name ; similar to Christian or Christopher . He is not claiming to be Christ . <p> Christos Kurios <p> Holy jumpin , Tom Jumpin to conclusions , that is . CHRISTOS KURIOS is a saying from the early church , meaning that Jesus CHRIST IS LORD . Not the Caesar , nor anyone else . Please dispense with the rant . BTW , who are you shilling for ? <p> Mad Pierrot <p> lol ! <p> Yah Saves <p> Good grief people . You are both wrong and what I tell you here is verifiable . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refute it . Please crack a book before responding . The Messiahs name is NOT Jesus . That would be impossible and thus stupid . The letter " J " was invented in the 17th century . The first time " Jesus " was EVER written was in 1629 . Now then , the God of Abraham supplied His name 7000 times to us- it is Yahowah . He NEVER referred to Himself as " Lord " -not once-not ever ! ! And that 's because Lord is Satans title-look up " baal " in any Hebrew dictionary-it means Lord . BTW , " Church " is another word not found in Scripture- its the name of a pagan sungoddess . Christianity is DRENCHED in sungod worship . He also never called Himself Christos Kurios . <p> Quentin Ledford <p> Most of what you say is quite correct , and yes , Lord is a title , not a name . In Germanic Languages Y is often renders as J and was pronounced the same . The same goes with v and w . So , in ones respective language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Hebrew , vowels were not included in their written language ; so no one can say with 100% certainty how Yahoweh was actually pronounced . As to the rest of your comment ; good work . People need to be aware of the corruption which has permeated mainstream Christianity since Emperor Constantine ( a pagan ) established the Catholic church , giving himself the title of Pontifex Maximus , and ordering the death anyone called Christian who refused to accept his new faith . Constantine essentially took horse manure and called it a rose ; but in doing so , he did n't  change its substance one iota . <p> Yah Saves <p> Thanks for taking the time to comment , Quentin . Sadly , truth has become an obstacle . Thanks for showing me that there are still a few thinking souls out there . <p> Jeff : you are fear-mongering . Please take this to faux news so I can laugh my ass off when they go with it . You do not know how to use the vessel tracking software . I just went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both directions . Maersk has not tied up all their ships . <p> Paul Hamm <p> Boy , you libs love living in Utopia , don ; t you . <p> Expat <p> Just back from Singapore . Many hundreds of ships at anchorage awaiting cargoes . According to the locals its many more than usual . As to no ships in transit , well yeah that 's bogus . <p> I do n't  know about these Shipping graphics . I DO know that Industrial Copper just fell below $2.00 per pound . There was a time before 2008 when the world was somewhat more normal that when Copper fell below $3.00 per pound , we would then be permitted to expect a major recession . In the new normal , Cu below $2.00 means that is it time to use the defibrillator on the Zombie economy once again . One of these days , maybe soon , the defribrillator will stop working . You cant restart the heart of a dead body . <p> Mava <p> " If true , this would be catastrophic for world trade . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for near-shore use . Also , on both of these maps , if you cared to zoom in , you can see that about 97% of all ships are on route somewhere . Those are the ones marked with the arrows pointed in the direction the ships are heading . If you mouse over , you 'll see a pop-up with the last reported speed in Knots . For instance , 15 knots is NOT an anchored drift speed . The ships actually anchored are marked with rhomboids ( diamonds ) and should should speeds ( i.e. difference from last reported coordinates ) in range of 0-0.3 knots . <p> Paul Hamm <p> Wow ! 97% at sea ? Can you post that web site . I 'd like to see for myself . <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> marinetraffic.com like Jeff posted above but apparently could n't manage to work the filters.another reason I called him a noob in the realm of analysis.even high school kids know how to filter a pivot table my friend . <p> I Love Pakistan <p> This world wide halt we were expecting it around March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Job Jeff Superb <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> How can you give any advice on investments when you clearly lack the skills of the most basic first year analyst ? The tiniest bit of research would reveal how abjectly inaccurate you are regarding the movement of goods ; not just shipments over the ocean but also your assessment of manufacturing output and retail inventories as well . A cursory google search would reveal the amount of traffic moving daily through global ports , I 'll give you a hint , it is not zero , we are in a downcycle at the moment , but that 's how capacity in transportation works . Its demonstrably and predictably cyclical . Here are a couple of places you could check your facts prior to writing an entire fallacious , inflammatory , fear-mongering article like the one above . logisticsmgmt.com ( Logistics Management ) , joc.com ( Journal of Commerce ) , mhlnews.com ( Material Handling &amp; Logistics ) , the logistics section of the WSJ , and logisticsbusiness.com ( Logistics Business Magazine ) . Lastly , for some interesting reading about the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Jones Act " also known as the " Merchant Marine Act of 1920 " . After you do some cursory research I hope to see this article removed . <p> Paul Hamm <p> I did some research , and came to the conclusion that liberals like to live in Utopiaville . Most every lib on here voicing rhetoric has nothing but their own theories and opinions no sites or anything backing up why its not happening . I have made the majority of money ( and its been a lot ) over the last six months by shorting the market . If I would have listened to the dreaming liberal sect , I 'd be bankrupt . <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> Not sure what you 're comments have to do with what I said.but you live in your strange little world and I 'll live in reality . 1 ) I do n't  know who you 're referring to when you say " liberals " , or " every lib on here voicing rhetoric " has to do with shipments moving via ocean carriers all day everyday . For the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to dispute the false claims in the article , what any political agenda has to do with how many ships are in transit at this moment escapes me . Oh and for the record , I 'm an agorist . FAR from a " liberal " in the classic definition of the concept . 2 ) Which of those links in my post did you miss ? You clearly did n't  go to any of them to see that goods are moving just like they have for thousands of years . Notice I did say that we are in a down cycle , but again like the historical record shows , transportation ebbs and flows in a cyclical fashion and after a period of about the last five years where it was a carriers market , its now a shippers market . That will change again . 3 ) I cant comment on any internet warriors claim regarding making a fortune on playing the market . Ca n't confirm or refute your claims , do n't  want to , do n't  care . 4 ) People writing articles like this are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying all air traffic has stopped . Its false and its easily refuted . <p> stealthman5 <p> Copper fell below $2.00 per pound today . What is the historical impact of the worldwide price of copper below $2.00 per pound ? How should we analyze that stat ? ? Or better yet , how should we SPIN that stat ? <p> Has there ever been a time in modern history when the target interest rate of central banks has been stuck on ZERO% for 7 years before one Central banker braved the Brave New World by daring to raise target rates to 1/4 of a percent ? ? <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> All I can say is wtf does this have to do with whether ships are in transit ? Commodities across the board rise and fall in price and availability , all the time , one single component ( copper ) is not a leading indicator of the market as a whole . But you do you man . <p> Stuart Trusty <p> You need to drill down farther in marinetraffic.com , there are thousands and thousands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting this , anyone who can use a pivot table should be able to work marinetraffic maps . I love that you drilled it down to one small area and only one type of carrier , and you clearly show there are thousands of shipments in transit . It boggles my mind how anyone can think a global stoppage of ocean transportation would n't be worldwide news . <p> Paul Hamm <p> I did some research , and came to the conclusion that liberals like to live in Utopiaville . Most every lib on here voicing rhetoric has nothing but their own theories and opinions no sites or anything backing up why its not happening . It is happening . The world markets are coming unhinged . I have made the majority of money ( and its been a lot ) over the last six months by shorting the market . If I would have listened to the deranged liberal sect , I 'd be bankrupt and trust me , most of the lib blowhards posting are broke . <p> Shipping is largely sex-trafficking . Even the billionaires who OWN the shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently purchased to COVER the real cargo . Without human cargo , there is no reason to ship the goods . <p> You might want to inform the shipping billionaires the above . Feel free to contact me for more information . <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> No , shipping is not largely sex-trafficking . Its not . I suggest you go down to a port near you and watch them unload the ships and containers in broad daylight and see that there are no smuggled peoples in them . Can it happen yes , its a probability and possible but the chances are VERY , VERY , VERY , slim . Infinitesimally slim . To quote a current commercial " that 's not how this works , that 's not how ANY of this works " . Seriously . <p> No but I 've loaded and unloaded containers before and there were no live humans being shipped . <p> DelmarJackson <p> I worked on oil tankers and RO/ROs and never ran across any sex trafficking . Also , as a sailor , I think I would have noticed or heard it brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping prices is an increase in ships and a huge increase in the size of ships and cargo capacity . Regardless if we are going to have a depression or not , it is prudent to have extra food and supplies and self sufficiency skills and a network of friends and family to weather social/economic storms . prepare for the worst , hope for the best and enjoy life as much as you can while you may . <p> I would hope you 're right , but the slave trade is a very underground , secret thing . <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> But the point you are missing is that the contents of the containers are NOT underground , secret things . Not at all . <p> Ziggy Martin <p> Jeff , I 'd love to know what your take is on all of these comments here . Some say you do n't  know how to use software on these cargo sites , others say you 're spot on . I seriously mean no offense when I ask this , but have you further researched these ship-tracking sites and found that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use them or did you consult with others you trust and find out that cargo ships are indeed halted world-wide ? I think its important to follow-up after posting an article like this so that your subscribers ( as well as casual listeners ) know how to plan accordingly . Thanks for all you do . <p> -Ken <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> Dude do n't  you think this would be world wide news if there was a stoppage of work in the ocean transportation world ? ? Ports are unionized , you think the longshoreman would sit idly by with no work ? ? Have you heard one peep from anywhere , manufacturing , retail , warehousing or transportation that is bemoaning the lack of carriers moving anywhere ? No you have n't . Because ships are sailing right this very moment and every moment of every day . <p> It seems to be a matter of some people expecting a slow down in shipping , and then too quickly seeing what they expect to be seeing . I was told by an online friend who claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid of researches around the world " ( I could n't confirm that at all though , but who knows ) , that the currencies today are enormous and that therefore a crash will develop slowly , and even that all the money printing could be absorbed by the economy without hyper inflation . To be honest I got the impression that there is some unwarranted hope and trust in the system with this person , who even wished to deny that war with Russia would be on the agenda and she was wrong about that because we are already on the brink of it out of nowhere , but it is a fact that the economy today is vast and that therefore it behaves more like a super tanker then an ordinary boat . Sorry Im just guessing . It seems that nobody is entirely sure about anything , which is understandable given the complexity of it all . What do you think will occur , how and when ? <p> Ziggy Martin <p> " Dude " , youve already aggressively more than made your position clear where you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not talking to you . I 'm talking to Jeff Berwick , the guy who posted this article in the first place . I know he s " busy " but you know if he s going to take the time to post something like this , I think it owes it to his listeners ( that he riles up ) to follow-up and post a response as to whether he jumped the gun or not . I 've already read your posts and the others though . I 'm waiting for a reply for Jeff , if it ever comes , regarding all this . I do n't  need anymore replies from you . As I said , your position is VERY clear . <p> Due to the ancient metaphor of cars as vessels/people , that photo of cars in the UK is quite disturbing . <p> Supply Chain Professional <p> You seriously degrade your credibility with statements like the above ; cars are only a little over 100 years old . They do n't  even come close to qualifying as " ancient " . Let 's overlook that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? Perhaps it is n't widely known ? <p> Not sure what the percentage of ships that exist , to those at sea is but this link shows a huge amount of activity all over the world and you can see the shipping lanes are LONG ... And the English Channel is pretty active showing the destination if you click the LONG ... Granted a lot of ships will not be on the move , being in loaded or unloaded , but if they are all at a standstill where are they ? We would be seeing them all at anchor offshore somewhere as happened in Nigeria some years ago . <p> Dan Keown <p> Looks like Dollar Vigilante got this one wrong but to be fair he does say he s not an expert on shipping . <p> Michalis Michalopoulos <p> This is non since the sea never dies sea trade is a cyclical business Pure non since <p> gman <p> " You ca n't print your way to prosperity . " <p> sure you can , if you are the printer . <p> " All you are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> no , you 're hollowing out your economy , you 're hollowing out the workers economy . the plowhorses work , and you buy their work with the money you print , and the plowhorses own none of it . that 's the purpose , that 's the plan , that 's the point . <p> " And sooner or later it 's empty and you have to start over after a good deal of crisis and chaos . " <p> no , sooner or later its crisis and chaos for the plowhorses , while the money printers wait it out in their secure retreats . when the plowhorses finally recover , clean up , and rebuild , the money printers will reappear , offering their debt money and starting the whole process of stealing the wealth of the nations all over again . <p> sampsonbrass <p> The slump in the Baltic Dry Index is because of over-supply of massive cargo ships coming into operation in 2015 , coupled with a slight downturn in trade . The result is an over-abundance of space on ships , hence the fall in price . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sortinghat <p> Git rdy for the 2016 election shut downs ! Obama will be emperor for life and not a damn thing we can do about it either unless you fancy getting your door kicked in and house being gassed up and I do n't  mean from too many Taco Bell burritos either <p> The source of this article superstation95 is a fake news website . There is no such radio station . Always check into new websites before you quote them ! <p> George Campbell <p> The local Wal-Mart was jammed , and that stuff does n't  come from Peoria anymore . In fact , the worlds largest cargo container ship just docked in L.A. Maritime traffic is down slightly due to the Chinese slow down , but to purport that it has stopped completely is just B.S. <p> jazzgare <p> hi there , <p> being a TDV subscriber for a couple of months now , i noticed that the conclusions Jeff Berwick jumps to are often based on misinformation or on rather biased interpretation of data . Of course , if you look at world economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found it annoying though , that TDV lacks objectivity and interprets every shred of information according to its bias : totol economic collapse . Which might be well under its way , we never knowbut as long as is is n't there , keeping an obtjective look at it is the least you can do for your paying subscribersthe principle of someone predicting economic mayhem is just like a broken clock : twice a day it will show the right time .. so at some point , hell be right . but the attitude of TDV is very much like that of a jehovas witness : so convinced of their own righteousness that all information is used as evidence for the bias of economic disaster <p> mava <p> Jeff is a pioneer in nature . You cant expect him to go very deep in the details of everything he looks at . For if he did , then he would lose his gift of being a pioneer , of being able to see the world in the way that most people will never see it . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am coming to read here . I am coming here for great ideas and lightning insights that Jeff posts , as a general thought seed material , not a financial advice . Jeff is more of an Oracle than a bean counter . <p> And as far as oracles go , Jeff has a good record ( as compared with what one could reasonably expect from the profession ) . So , he was wrong on this. ? So what ? It worked exactly as it should have . He gives me an idea and I do my own homework on it . I do n't  expect him to dull his senses pre-chewing everything for me . <p> jazzgare <p> hi mava , <p> feel free to think about it however you want . I do think that when you make such convincing claims about global economic collapse , they have to be supported by facts , not by assumptions.There were a lot of errors in the article above , leading to the wrong conclusion that almost no ship is at sea at the moment <p> Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , december , etc , etcso it becomes a little bit like the guy with the sandwichboard in the street , predicting mayhemone day hell be right .. but you never know when = <p> best <p> Kailey Scott <p> I think that if the president can say that 90% of Americans have health insurance then Jeff can over exaggerate about the decline in shipments . <p> Rwederfoort <p> Nice posting here in our area we have the same thing all this Tankers Oil/Gas tankers and ships are waiting or drifting around the island as they are waiting for a event to happen and new instructions . Very funny indeed <p> if you zoom in on the ship map you 'll see plenty of ships in transit it appears that they are in port from 100,000 foot view because the green shows up when more than one boat is in a 1-4 mile radius .

Now they are saying China is slowing down pertly because of too much debt in the system . The first great depression ( 1930 and 40s ) is said to have been caused deliberately by these power players , we would n't have had the poverty that caused the Nazi situation in Germany that lead to WW2 would we .

@@99475418 @3675418/ 28882 @qwx888882 <p> Last week a story began circulating that appears to have begun with a video by Future Money Trends ( see here ) , which was then picked up by the SHTFPlan prepper blog and then picked up by others including Infowars indicating Mexico is looking to back the peso with silver . <p> While I respect and read/listen to those sources often ( and personally know many of them ) , in this particular case the rumors are completely unfounded , unfortunately . And , I say unfortunately , because if Mexico did back the peso with silver it would become one of the richest countries on Earth in a matter of years ( especially if they completely decriminalized all plants or what most slaves call " drugs " ) . <p> I was personally shocked when I kept hearing this story being repeated because of my intimate knowledge through a number of sources of the activities of the Bank of Mexico ( as I will explain below ) . So , I was shocked because I had heard no such rumor or inkling whatsoever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Acapulco near-neighbor , Mr. Salinas Price . <p> Hugo Salinas Price , founder of Mexico 's Elektra retail chain , Azteca Bank and multi-billionaire , told TDV Thursday that there are no concrete plans among Mexican elites and politicians to back the peso with silver . He used some rather candid language to state in no uncertain terms that this latest rumor is nothing but that , a rumor . <p> He furthermore reminded me that he has never been trying to " back the peso with silver " as he saw that as being an impossibility . Mr. Salinas Price ' idea was to have a silver coin issued by the monetary authority with no engraved monetary value , and for that authority to give that coin a monetary value through a quote which will always be superior to the peso value of the silver in the coin ; to achieve that , the monetary authority will issue new and higher quotes for the coin , in pesos , as the price of silver in pesos rises . But never diminish the quote , if the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to save within the current statist monetary/financial system . <p> He also reminded me of what he said in our last interview that , " Neither the Mexican government nor ANY GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD will ever swear off of inflating the money supply and expanding credit when it can be done . That 's why we need the alternative money , which can be said to be " indexed " to the market price of silver . " <p> He stresses that while some politicians mean well and understand the true value of silver , most will remain silent . " Besides , the Banco de Mexico is effectively a branch body and soul of the Fed . So talk of silver with them is like proposing a Black Mass in St. Peter 's , Rome , " Mr. Salinas Price continued . <p> Salinas Price also told me that , " If things proceed as they are going , Mexico ( from the waist up ie. the Northern parts of Mexico ) is going to be a sort of Puerto Rico within a generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monetary and political front getting worse for Mexico rather than better in the coming years as far as those who care about sound money and liberty are concerned . Although , interestingly , he seems to feel similar to myself that the Northern parts of Mexico may become more " Americanized " but there still may be hope in the South where Acapulco resides perhaps insinuating some sort of future secessionist movements . <p> And , as a final statement , Mr. Salinas Price also reminded me that he thinks bitcoin is total BS . That , though , is just something that we will just have to agree to disagree on but I did promise him that I would include that statement from him . <p> Now , speaking of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies , however , I then contacted my high level connections with the rapidly growing Mexican bitcoin community who I know have been meeting with Mexico 's central bank numerous times on how bitcoin can be adopted into the Mexican economy . In fact , they asked me to come to one of their meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like to consort with criminals . <p> I spoke with good friend , Jose Rodriguez , CEO and founder of Altis Altcoin Investment Services and a partner in the Latin American bitcoin exchange , Unisend , who is a leader in bitcoin advancement in Mexico about his talks with the Mexican Central Bank . <p> He cautioned that the bank has asked him to keep most of their talks confidential but told me that the Bank of Mexico is actually much more interested in cryptocurrency than it is in backing the peso with silver . <p> But , before you get your hopes up , they are n't looking at making bitcoin a legal currency in Mexico just yet . They point out the same stupid Keynesian " problems " they see with bitcoin such as the fact that it can not be controlled by the central bank and manipulated and inflated nor deflated to " help " the economy or , as Hugo Salinas Price said above , no government nor central bank will swear off inflating the money and credit supply whenever it can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an interest in creating an E-Peso . <p> The bank is interested in creating the most efficient payment system , but that does not mean they will be adopting the most efficient payment system , bitcoin . The bank instead hopes to build upon and integrate the best of bitcoin and the blockchain , ultimately making the same mistakes that the Royal Canadian Mint did with the now failed MintChip. ( i.e. , overlooking the fact that bitcoin works because bitcoin is decentralized . ) <p> Interestingly , however , despite their statist , Keynesian misgivings with bitcoin , bank officials believe bitcoin could become increasingly adopted as more major players enter into the space , which the bank envisages would bring more price stability . So , in that there is good news , at this point the Bank of Mexico actually looks at bitcoin in a good light and are interested in seeing if it can add value to the Mexican monetary and banking system and for that , people like Jose Rodriguez are doing good work and calmly trying to explain to them how bitcoin can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great majority of Mexico 's " reserves " are in the US dollar which , of course , spells eventual disaster for the Mexican peso .

That is a much better way to speculate on gold and silver in Mexico than buying the Mexican peso . <p> The peso , like the dollar , will reach its full instrinsic value at some point likely this decade . For those who do n't get what I mean by its " intrinsic value " , I mean zero . <p> Its not so hard to use silver as a transactional currency . Its actually already being done .

Either Britain leaves the EU on June 23rd or it does n't  . <p> But we look at these issues from the point of view of Jubilee 2016 . As much as we would like to think this is a- straightforward sociopolitical event , we can not . It is part of a larger story , one- that involves increasing chaos as this year moves forward . <p> Of course , we hope for the best . And here at The Dollar Vigilante we are huge proponents of secession . <p> In fact , we 'd like to see secessionist movements continue until all seven- billion people on Earth have seceded from forced ownership by a violent and thieving cartel called government . <p> But whether pro or anti-Brexit forces win , there will be- difficulties emerging from this vote . For instance , with a Brexit , the inter-Irish border would have to harden . Police and border guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as- an external EU border . <p> As the UK Telegraph notes , " After a successful Brexit , the atmosphere could be nasty . " <p> If Brexit loses , a large portion of British voters may feel considerably alienated . And if- Brussels continues its heavy-handed ways , Britain may fall prey to considerable anti-EU violence , not just right away but over time as the EU advances and consolidates even more power . <p> Chances are this second scenario could- play out. - While there is a chance Brexit will succeed , most secession movements in recent memory have failed . <p> I remember watching the Canadian/Quebec secessionist movement lose by 0.1% when I was younger . - Since then we 've seen many others fail , with the most recent being the Scottish secessionist movement from the United Kingdom under very , very suspicious circumstances . <p> An excellent crowdfunded documentary was recently released which does an excellent job of showing why Britain should do everything it can to escape from the clutches of the European Union . - I highly recommend everyone watch this documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technocracy the European Union has become but I did n't  even realize just how bad it had gotten until I saw this film . - You really just have to see it to believe it . <p> No wonder the British want to secede . <p> If every Briton really understood what was at stake by staying in the European Union I am positive none would want to remain in the EU. - However , the British government is doing everything within its power to make sure most people do n't  have access to this information . <p> In fact , one mainstream media program in the UK , who regularly republishes our content told us to make sure we do n't  post anything on their site regarding Brexit. - According to them , if they even mention the word Brexit they will be shut down by the UK government . - So much for freedom of speech ! <p> But , do n't  get too excited . - We do n't  actually believe Britons will get a fair chance to decide if they want to be perpetually owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - In fact , its possible the whole thing could be a ruse . <p> It never made much sense that David Cameron would allow a vote . But perhaps Londons bankers were interested in a renegotiation with Brussels that would yield more financial flexibility . If that 's what they wanted , they achieved at least some of their goals . And now Britain will have to stay in the EU to activate the new agreement . And there will be considerable bitterness , some violence , no doubt , and other more lingering ramifications . <p> By hook or crook , Britain will probably stay in . Cameron will cook the vote if he has to , just the way he probably did in Scotland . <p> You see , the globalists have an agenda . - And the European Union is a big part of their agenda . - They will do almost anything to keep it in place and morph it into a worldwide government that employs the same fasco-communist tyranny on the entire world . <p> We do n't  know who is going to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic unrest no matter what . It could impact stocks , bonds or world currency markets . Or everything all at once . And for those in Britain , especially , the changes could go on a for a while . - Expect a false flag event to scare people into wanting to stay in the EU or , if by some miracle the vote is n't rigged and Britons vote to leave the EU , expect a massive false flag in Britain soon after as repercussion . <p> Well be covering all of this in upcoming issues of our TDV newsletter . Its a very important vote and the ramifications could be considerable . Please subscribe HERE . <p> And make sure your friends see this movie , Brexit. - Because if the elite have their way , the fasco-communist technocracy that is currently destroying Europe under the EU banner is what they have planned for their one world government agenda . - Just watch the movie it is n't pretty . <p> Another good example of EU problems might be the European Arrest Warrant issued by a Swedish prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This arrest warrant might not succeed under UK common-law . <p> Michael Mallal <p> Magna Carta 1215 was not celebrated much in Australia but rather who celebrated the military debacle in Gallipoli led by Sea Lord Churchill . There was some MC celebration in Canberra for legal big-wigs but not for the volk . <p> Michael Mallal <p> The Swedish prosecutor claiming to want to interview Assange refuses to interview Assange in London or by video link . Obviously the prosecutor is lying and wants to hand Assange over to US for water-boarding in Gitmo . <p> Ingrid <p> All the countrys in the EU should be independent . I live in the Netherlands and I wish we could vote to leave the EU . But then again , the people of Holland and France voted in 2005 in a referendum against a Europian Constitution . The government claimed that it would be very bad for the country if we voted against .

People of Brittain : please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door for other countrys in Europe to leave . <p> Diego Gonzalez <p> I want out of the EU too . <p> Angie Miesner Blake <p> Texas has tried to secede several times , also . I do n't  understand . Why does the state have to beg the federal government to leave ? ? ? They will never voluntarily allow us to leave . <p> The governments ( all of them ) are trying to stop YOU from seceding , personally , by relying on your own conscience instead of the authorities . <p> That is why smaller governments act " on your behalf " to " try " to secede . They do n't  really matter . Make friends with the people who enforce the laws , and urge them to enforce poorly whatever laws they judge as stupid . Then encourage them to see stupidity in all the laws , and the development of conscience as the most important thing .

" <p> Angie , I 'm going to place as a reply to your quandary what was intended as my comment . Your observation shows you to be more perceptive than most . <p> I am a sovereign state . I believe you can be sovereign also . In order to be sovereign , you must recognize the enemy and refuse to join forces with her ( forgive the sexist pronoun English offers few elegant alternatives ) . <p> First you must come to see that you have no " contract " with what are deemed by the chronically enslaved to encompass " the-powers-that-be " . " They " have no power other than firearms . Of course I always believe a man with a loaded gun while its pointed toward me . It never is , but a major stratagem in the science of rulership is to convince me that it is . <p> Second , you must change the language that resonates between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People exist . Land areas exist . Do n't  wait for " Texas " to secede . The people who claim that title will never be successful . But even if they did succeed , they would proceed to mark fictitious lines in the sand , call them " borders " , then try to prevent you from crossing without their permission , with threat of violence if you choose not to " voluntarily comply " . <p> I grew up in the place they 're calling " Texas " midway between Houston and San Antonio , near Old Hwy 90 ( before I-10 was built ) in the general location they like to call " Fayette County " . But those are political designations , and I am sovereign ( a-political ) . Once again , the only thing that binds me to " the-powers-that-be " ( in the minds of the enslaved ) is the loaded guns they carry . " Jurisdiction " is force of arms , nothing more . <p> Third , I treat all " authority " in the same manner that I treat rattlesnakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , watch where I step and where I reach . Hows that for " voluntary compliance " ? ? ? <p> I respect rattlesnakes . Like agents of state , their only " jurisdiction " is fangs and venom . But they can be dangerous . They want no truck with me , usually slither away without confrontation . Self-proclaimed human " authorities " are a little more dangerous . But they , too , will slither away when they see I am not one of their " citizens " that I have no intention of " voluntary compliance " . <p> I can be free . Here . Today . Where I 'm " at " . So can you . <p> But I see that Dave , " Voluntaryist Webmaster " has said what I 've said , only with much fewer words . Thanks , Dave . Sam <p> Fred Bastiat <p> " Jurisdiction is force of arms . " well said Sam , well said indeed .

Those two guys are like the old man , but they got hurt . Guess how many are like the old man and do n't  get hurt , and do n't  get saved either ? Plenty .

Among some of the groups of adults unfazed by his authoritarian temper tantrum , would be people like me , discussing the events of the past few years , with a recognition that the guy up there talking has some power , and he uses it in a way that exposes his puny self-esteem .

It just takes a little courage and a little doubt that the story they want us to believe ( " you will be first to be cooked by Obamas extermination drone " ) . Your use of the term " underestimation " in the next sentence suggests that you might be on " their " side . <p> But maybe that 's only because you 're in their thrall . Fear is the killer .

It is the least data dependent Fed in history . This is the longest deviation from historical norms in terms of Fed dovishness than I have ever seen in my career . " <p> He warned that people should get out of the stock market and buy gold . <p> We agree with him , of course . - But , it got us to thinking about how many Americans , or other Westerners , own gold at this crucial time . <p> Its impossible to know what your average Westerner personally owns in precious metals . - Certainly , the amount of Americans that hold stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher . - Some estimates are that nearly half of Americans own stocks in one way or another . - But , estimates of the amount of Americans who own precious metals seem to range between 1-9% and from my estimation , the number is likely much closer to 1% than it is to 9% . <p> If you were to ask average Americans , coming from an- NFL game , or on their way to work , whether they- owned precious metals , I think itd be a rare person who says yes . <p> Most do n't  even seem to recognize things like silver as having any value or at least , in this part of California where Mark Dice offered people a 10 ounce silver bar ( current value over $150 ) or a chocolate bar ( $1 ) and had no takers on the silver . <p> " I personally have never held gold , nor advised any of my clients to hold it .

Meanwhile , your average financial advisor probably took some government courses " educating " - him on Keynesian economics and then went to work for a big corporation , like Goldman Sachs .

" <p> How is " reasonable suspicion " ascertained ? The key section seems to be the arcanely named Chapter III : " Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria " ( p.33 ) . It states , " To meet the REASONABLE SUSPICION standard , the NOMINATOR the nominating agency , based on the totality of the circumstances , must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which , taken together with rational inferences from those facts , reasonably warrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting , in preparation for , in aid of , or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES . " Capitalization in original No definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even if the reasonable suspicion standard is not met , family members of those on lists can be nominated as well . Associates are vulnerable even if they have no obvious involvement in terrorism . Perceiving them as " a possible nexus " to terrorism is all it requires . Also , if they are linked with a " terrorist group , " whether or not the group has been designated as such by the government , then the associates can be listed . They do not need to be members of the group . As long as the associates are considered " representatives " as a defending lawyer or a sympathetic journalist might be then they can be placed on a watchlist . <p> What Happens If You 're Listed ? <p> There are many implications , from police officers who match your I 'd to the obstruction of passports or visas , from foreign airports turning you away to domestic ones interrogating you . <p> The guide deals explicitly with the latter . Chapter V is entitled " Encounter Management and Analysis . " It opens by defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who is a " positive match , " " a potential match " or an " inconclusive match " to the TSDB list . ( Confusingly , the guide later states " Chapter 5 is concerned only with positive matches " ) <p> The information is then shared with TIDE . In short , the government will have massive and intrusive data with which to monitor and further restrict you , your family and your associates . The consequences can be non-trivial <p> Consider the case of Gulet Mohamed who is currently bringing a lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder . Mohamed is a teenager who is a naturalized US citizen .

Mohamed refused . A few weeks later , his family arranged for his release and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from boarding the flight . After judiciary maneuvering , Mohamed departed Kuwait only to be interviewed for hours at Dulles Airport without recourse to a lawyer . <p> The list of people vulnerable to similar treatment grows in size daily . According to the Business Insider ( July 23 ) , the Mohamed case " revealed that the watch list had grown dramatically in the wake of the Detroit plot 2009 , with the government adding 1.5 million names since then . " The Guardian article adds , " In 2013 , the government made 468,749 nominations for inclusion to the Terrorist Screening Database , up from 227,932 nominations in 2009 ; few are rejected . " <p> What Is Your Recourse If Listed ? <p> Appendix 8 of the guide is entitled " Memorandum of Understanding on Terrorist Watchlist Redress . " Nevertheless , a blacklisted person currently has no way effective method to reverse the listing or to discover why it occurred . Inclusion in TIDE or no-fly lists is rarely even disclosed . <p> Another article in The Guardian ( July 24 ) explains , " Travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a redress request through the Department of Homeland Security , but that process does not challenge inclusion on a watchlist or database , nor will even successful requests guarantee against future travel restrictions . " <p> The situation may be slightly changing due to developments in a recent lawsuit . In June , US District Judge in Oregon , Judge Anna Brown ordered the government to confirm that 13 Muslim plaintiffs were on a no-fly list and the reasons for their inclusion ; none had been charged with a terrorist-related offense . Moreover , the government was ordered to provide an effective means by which the plaintiffs could appeal their inclusion . The lack of it was deemed to be a violation of due-process , which is a rejection of the government 's argument that there is no constitutional right to travel . <p> Nevertheless , the government is bound to fight in court for years in order to maintain secrecy and control . Even if the plaintiffs ultimately prevail , the federal government is notorious for ignoring court orders . Most significantly , the Oregon decision does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@99475444 @3675444/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> The Road From Capitalism to Socialism and Why The US is F**ked <p> It is perhaps the saddest story ever told and it has been told over and over again for millennia . It is the never-ending urge to dismantle capitalism after it has created great amounts of wealth . <p> This has been going on since Roman times as can be seen in this quote from Cicero Rome become bankrupt . People must again learn to work , instead of living on public assistance . " <p> Sounds a lot like what needs to happen in the US today , no ? In Rome they had economic freedom and it created a massive amount of wealth and innovation . The Government that grew up around it , however , slowly drained and warped the economic climate to the point where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproductive and dependent upon the state for their survival . Soon after , it completely collapsed as will the US . <p> CHINA FROM COMMUNISM TO CAPITALISM TO SOCIALISM AGAIN <p> China has been the most modern case-study of this reversion from communism , back to capitalism and again back to communism . Under Maos " Great Leap Forward " ( government program names never cease to amaze in how egregiously opposite they are to the stated goal ) tens of millions of Chinese died of starvation and the once proud Chinese culture was decimated to the point of subsistence living . <p> Finally , by 1976 , it collapsed . Since then the Chinese Government has had to allow some economic freedoms . Either that , or starve the entire country to death . <p> The magic of economic freedom did its work incredibly quickly in China just as it did with Japan and Germany after World War II where it rebuilt two completely destroyed nations into the powerhouses they became by the 1980s . <p> Within the span of a few decades China went from being a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the biggest creditor to the US who has been going in the exact opposite direction . <p> But , now that so many Chinese have become so rich comes the backlash . The outcry that they need to spread the wealth . How quickly they forget what " spreading the wealth " did during Maos time . <p> A flashy gold car in ChinaAccording to this news article , too many of Chinas new rich are driving around in flashy cars and have nice things . This makes other people who have not been as productive " feel bad " . So , once again , the Government has to come in and play Robin Hood . Steal from the rich and give to the poor . <p> The Chinese government has even announced plans to implement a " seniors pension scheme " along with improved social health care services by the end of 2015 . <p> If history is any indication , China will keep treading back to socialism until all the wealth has been shared and it will collapse yet again . <p> THE US FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , the most dynamic and productive country of the last century . Nothing comes close . The main reason being that more than any other country during the 20th century , the US railed against socialism . It was n't perfect in this regard . Not at all . But it still held more true to capitalism in the 20th century than any other country . <p> The creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 ( central banks are one of the main tenets of communism ) began the long , slow road down , however . By 1933 the US had already gone bankrupt and had to confiscate gold to survive . Then , again , by 1971 they were bankrupt again and broke off any link from gold in order to survive a few more decades . <p> Policies such as FDRs " New Deal " and LBJs " Great Society " helped to bankrupt the nation along the way . And today easily the most socialist President in the history of the United States presides . <p> Not that it even matters that much . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong direction steadily for decades . <p> After decades of the government ( which destroys wealth ) becoming a larger part of the economy while the private sector ( the one that creates wealth ) shrinks , this graph is about to complete what dirty minded technical analysts refer to as a " phallic " chart pattern . The " shaft " part of the formation began in the 1960s and things turned even worse after the " head " formation began to be traced out after the 1990s . <p> Now with government spending about to cross over and become more of the economy than private spending it will complete the phallic formation . Its only fitting that this chart has drawn out the shape of a penis after all these decades because now , due to all this government involvement in the economy , the US is good and truly f**ked. 
@@99475448 @3675448/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Profiting From The Rising Chinese Yuan <p> The following post is written by Director of TDV Offshore , Paul Seymour <p> At TDV , we are n't  fans of holding a significant amount of your assets in fiat currencies . However , as those holding the Swiss franc recently found out , as it rose 30% overnight , there is a time and place for everything . <p> One good option for such diversification is the Chinese yuan , also known as renminbi . Since China got into the WTO in 2001 , after starting to boom economically , the US government has clamored , from time to time , for the Chinese to allow the yuan to " float " in the exchange market . Instead , and like many other governments around the world , the Chinese have opted to peg that exchange rate as a set relationship to the USD . The Saudi Riyal for example , has had the same peg for decades , but we do n't  hear anyone clamoring for the Saudis to revalue the riyal . <p> Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had held steady at that rate since 1995 . There was a lot of talk at that time coming from failing US manufacturers , especially within the electronics industry , of the unbeatable " China price " . The Chinese were simply manufacturing products at good quality , and at a lower price . What we might call " competition . " Maybe it was time for the people in the US to realize that they did n't  really deserve 40 bucks an hour for doing work that a robot could do better on an assembly line . <p> So in 2005 , the US Congress , as stooges for their special interest patrons , began talking about unfair trade practices . Many taking the view that Chinas " suppressed " currency was a form of government subsidy , and prohibited under WTO rules . More than a dozen pieces of legislation were then pending in Congress to try and pressure China to allow the yuan to " float " in world currency markets , letting free-market forces establish its value . <p> That 's a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies are traded in a " free market , " I mean . As the Chinese government has adeptly pointed out in its response to this call to control its currency by the imperialistic oligarchy " There is no free market in currencies , as there is in wheat or bananas . Currencies trade in global markets , but their supply is controlled by a cartel of central banks , which have a monopoly on money creation . The Federal Reserve controls the global supply of dollars and thus has far more influence over the greenback 's value than any other single actor . " <p> Steady Appreciation of the Yuan <p> The Chinese , though , under this growing pressure back in 2005 , increased the relative value of the yuan , by reducing the peg rate from 8.3 to 8.1 , which seemed to temporarily appease the world market manipulators . The yuan has since appreciated , slowly , steadily , and year after year , to the current rate of 6.2 yuan to the dollar , or 25% ( an average of between 2-3% per year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the USD , has not appeased the market manipulators completely , however . <p> In 2010 , the subject popped up yet again . Same old arguments followed with the call " China , please help us deal with the predictably negative results of our fiscal mismanagement , by mismanaging your own economy " was essentially the plea . The Chinese studied the option , and decided not to create even more problems for their own beleaguered people , and by extension their hold on power . <p> In 2010 , when Obama started calling for the Chinese to help out by damaging their own economy , the Chinese embassy in Washington released this thought-provoking response . Ill quote some of it , but urge you to read the full text here . <p> It starts out with " As if the world economy was n't fragile enough , politicians in the U.S. and China seem intent on fighting an old-fashioned currency war . The U.S. is more wrong than China here , and it 's important to understand why , lest the two countries send the world back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like a free-willed bureaucrat , to me . How refreshing . <p> Then moves along " A fixed exchange rate is also not some nefarious economic practice rare in human affairs . From the end of World War II through the early 1970s , most global currency rates were fixed under the Bretton-Woods monetary system created by Lord Keynes and Harry Dexter White . That system fell apart with the U.S.-inspired inflation of the 1970s , and much of the world moved to " floating rates . " <p> " By maintaining a fixed yuan-dollar rate , China has subcontracted much of its monetary discretion to the Fed in return for the benefits of exchange-rate stability . For more than a decade , this has served the world economy well , leading to an explosion of trade , cheaper goods for Americans that have raised U.S. living standards , and new prosperity for tens of millions of Chinese . " <p> It finishes strongly with " It 's especially dismaying to see the same U.S. and European economists and columnists who peddled Keynesian stimulus as an economic cure-all now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the yuan-dollar price were different . Because their own ideas have flopped , they now want to make the yuan a scapegoat and risk a trade war with China . Have n't they done enough harm already ? " <p> What 's Coming Next , and How to Play it <p> Therefore , full-fledged release of the yuan to the wind , like the recent CHF move by the Swiss , does n't  seem likely . It is , though , an almost 100% certainty that the yuan will continue its steady appreciation against the USD . It could , at this point , be viewed as a safe haven currency from the demise of the USD . Thereby taking the USD one step closer to the land of **32;935;TOOLONG status . Good riddance . <p> In 2012 there was around $3.8 trillion conducted in global trade . Of that 380 billion was settled in Chinese yuan , or 10% . Since then , the pace of international deals being traded outside the USD has been picking up exponentially . For example , here in Brazil it was recently announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local currencies without passing needlessly through the USD . <p> Brazil , 7th in global GDP , does a lot of trade with its BRICS partner China as well . Japan , Australia , and New Zealand , all trade with China through their local currencies . Russia , just behind Brazil in GDP at #8 , obviously will never do anything in the USD , ever again , and is doing huge energy deals with China . <p> That thanks to the war the US has declared on Russia in the past few months . Announcing economic sanctions is a declaration of war . Its tantamount to parking battleships in the harbors . To call it anything else is just nanve . I 'm watching the Russians new payments system with interest , as they have already set up a domestic payments system to compete with SWIFT , and potentially get us all out from under the sanctions of the USG , and its failing currency . <p> As the yuan is looking like a safe haven , you should strongly consider moving a portion of your USD or EURO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold , and therefore also not the upside potential . It is a fiat currency , and therefore certainly has some risk , but relative to all other fiats , the least of any out there . Almost like going into Chinese government bonds , but with more liquidity . We should note that there are some who believe the entire Chinese economy is extremely overheated , and unstable . I think that instability is true of the US economy as well , though . <p> Chinese bonds are also now on the radar , yielding 3.6% vs 2.3% for US treasuries . As noted recently on Bloomberg " There 's going to be a big shift when that currency ( yuan ) opens up , when it goes into everybody 's indexes , noting this week 's opening of the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect allowing cross-trading of equities on the two exchanges is a big step to internationalizing the Chinese currency .

They did n't find anything and were about to let him go when they popped the trunk . Some of the agents flipped . Others thought the discovery was cool and began asking Justin questions .

( Justin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of that much wealth was a red flag ) <p> Justin produced his business card and the Border Patrol agents made some phone calls , likely to Phoenix police to find if any silver had been reported stolen .

Justin assured him this was not the case , as he had Googled this before making the trip . <p> After an hour or so , they let him go . <p> What 's likely is , if Justin had been wearing $100k in jewelry , he would have escaped handcuffs .

" and he responded , " Well , yes , I invested in the country to become a citizen " he was turned away and not allowed into the UK . <p> Last year , around the same time , the US and Canadian governments both insinuated that ANYONE who had invested in the St. Kitts " citizenship by investment " program was considered to be a possible terrorist and Canada changed their laws so St. Kitts citizens had to undergo a rigorous process to be allowed to even visit Canada . - In another instance , a famous bitcoin entrepreneur , originally from the US who attained a St. Kitts passport was denied a visa to visit family in the US with no explanation given . <p> I could recount story after story like this . <p> It has become so difficult that I officially got out of the business of trying to help people get second citizenships years ago and turned over the business to a good friend who was willing to put up with the never-ending headaches . <p> However , I still try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly easily and cheaply attain residency and citizenship . <p> And the best , cheapest and easiest country that I currently know of is Peru . <p> PERUVIAN RESIDENCY &amp; CITIZENSHIP <p> Peru has an interesting history in offering citizenship . - Back in the 1990s Peru was so broke that they offered citizenship for an easy , flat rate of $25,000 and you did n't  even have to go to Peru to get it ( New York Times/1993 : " Peru Citizenship Sells for $25,000 " ) you could just pay at a local embassy and receive your documents . - In retrospect it was a great bargain . <p> Unfortunately , as often happens , the deal did n't  last very long and either due to ineptitude or under pressure from the international community as well as Peruvian citizens ( who felt it was shameful how easy it was to become Peruvian ) it faded away . <p> However , in recent years , Peru has been economically rising and has realized that attracting wealthy ( or at least reasonably well-off foreigners ) to come to their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lima , Peru <p> Now , Peru , in my opinion , offers the best option with the greatest ease and price of any other option currently being offered by any other country . <p> here 's why . <p> Quality passport . - Different people want passports for different reasons but if what you are looking for is a second passport that is easy to travel with then Peru is and will soon be one of the best outside of passports like EU , UK , Swiss , US and Canadian passports . - Just with the residency card alone you can travel visa-free throughout Mercosur ( Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Paraguay , Uruguay and Venezuela , Chile , Peru , Colombia and Ecuador ) . - You cant even do that with a US or Canadian passport as both Brazil and Paraguay require US and Canadian citizens to apply for a visa to visit . - As well , it was announced in May and expected that in December Peruvian passport holders will have visa-free travel to the EU. - And talks are in progress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the US sometime in 2016 or 2017. - Many other countries like Canada and Australia often follow the US lead on visa requirements and so visa-free travel to places like Canada and Australia could soon follow . <p> Ease of acquiring residency and citizenship . - To start the process you just need to work with a specialized agent who knows the process to help you apply at a local Peruvian embassy . - The residency applications are generally approved within 45-90 days and once approved you have six months allowable ( although you can go at any time ) before you go to Peru to finalize your residency visa . - Once you have that you then can live wherever you like and after 24 months from the time of receiving your residency visa you can apply for citizenship . - This is much faster and much easier than most other countries where a certain amount of time is required ( sometimes many years ) of living in the country is required and often it is 4 years or more of residency before you can apply for citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few countries in the region that constitutionally allows you to hold more than one passport so you can keep your other passport(s) all legally as well . -

Most other legal citizenship programs where you can attain citizenship in two years or less cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions . - Currently this program is being offered for only $25,000 USD and installment payments are an option . -

Can u advise please <p> Claire <p> Hi , no I have not . I arrived relatively recently on a 6 month tourist visa . Something that is very important for people to know is that the regulation just changed in Peru ( literally 4 days after I arrived ) , effective tentatively Jan 1st , 2016 , which now states that a person can only stay here as a tourist for a maximum of 183 days out of a 365 day period . That means no exiting and re-entering to refresh ones status , as was previously possible . This is going to affect me greatly , as I had expected to only need to refresh once to give me a year to get on my feet here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant and I am quite concerned about how I am going to pull it all off . This is a perfect example of how things are going to get stricter over time in many cases , especially with world troubles escalating , and if a person is thinking about establishing themselves somewhere new or just getting a second residency , they ought to get right on it and not wait . I found out about this 2 days ago . <p> Huss W Farhat <p> So shall we forget the hope of getting citizenship in future there ? <p> Claire <p> Not at all ! I would just recommend acting quickly and utilizing services like Jeff mentioned to expedite the matter , if one is able . <p> Huss W Farhat <p> We should come then and stay there right ? but need someone like lawyer to help in this I think <p> Claire <p> Utilizing services that specialize in facilitating people with residency options tends to be the fastest and easiest way to go about it , if one is able . Jeff mentions in the article that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TDV Immigration and he gives a link . <p> IMMIGRAPE <p> Send us an e-mail to : email protected to send you complete information on the Peruvian program ! <p> I was lucky to travel to Peru as a small child and then again , as a teen ( when my brother &amp; I won a dance contest in Cuzco , when we slipped out of the hotel , with our mother asleep ) . Back then , you were seriously " roughing it " , and also quite daring to travel there , during the height of the now-irrelevant but then-violent guerrilla Communist insurgency movement , " Shining Path " ( Sendero Luminoso ) . So , I 've been to Lima , Cuzco &amp; Macchu Picchu , not once but twice . Although Lima had sophisticated neighborhoods , such as Miraflores and Los Olivos , where there were many homes with very cool " Mid-Century " , Modernist architecture , as well as the ( then ? ) -artist district of Barranco ( which looks to have since become more-developed and may be the area pictured , here ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , when I was there ( speaking as a Brazilian and having traveled extensively in the Third World , all my life ) , I was recently shocked to see that Lima has grown to become one of the Top 5 most populous cities in the Western Hemisphere and is today larger than Chicago ! I will note that I did not see any sunny days like the one in the photo , in Lima . Like many areas on the Pacific Coast in both North &amp; South America , Lima is more often swathed in a pea-soup-like fog yet , it only experiences an annual precipitation of little over 1 ? so its quite arid , yet foggy at the same time . Its very strange . Peru , as a country is fascinating with its own highly-developed cuisine , with deep roots in ancient indigenous traditions , as there are a few very strong Native American cultures in Peru , making it somewhat akin to Mexico but possibly even more mysterious , due to the monumental Andes Range and its increased distance from " Western " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are stranger , still which I wo n't get into , here , as this is not a forum for such topics ) . There is so much to be discovered and understood by outsiders in this country . Landing in Cuzco is one of the most humbling ( and terrifying , to some ) experiences that can be had , as your standard , commercial airliner cruises for at least half an hour , with the peaks of the Andes as high above your head and the floor of the valley beneath . The mountains are massive and your large airplane may as well be an insect ! Along the way , you see many other " Macchu Picchus " at very high elevations , covered in snow , waiting to be explored , that would be nigh impossible to access , except perhaps by parachute ! I could go on and on . Peru is definitely an intriguing land of mystery , form the point of view of archeology , ancient history beyond the economic boom that its experiencing today . <p> kookaburra <p> thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism should give you a job <p> Maher , I think that Peru is a much more dynamic and international place than Paraguay , which is landlocked , isolated and which has a military dictatorship at this time . Paraguay is in the middle of the jungle . 98% of the population there speaks Guarani , which is the most influential indigenous language in Eastern S. America ( most place-names in Brazil are Guarani/Tupi-Guarani ) . I think that your being Iraqi-born , the climate of Peru would also suit you better ( along the coast , where it is arid and more like what you 're used to ) . However , Brazil has a massive Syrio-Lebanese community ( and some Iraqis who call themselves that ) . This group arrived mostly around WWI , with the fall of the Ottoman Empire . They immigrated with Ottoman passports and were colloquially called " Turks " by some Brazilians in the 20th century but theyve become so integrated into Brazilian society ( including their food ) , there is no negative whatsoever in having Middle Eastern ethnicity in Brazil . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrian-Brazilian . It is important to point out that the vast majority of these " Turkish " immigrants were/are Christian and of a branch of Christianity that is recognized by the Catholic Church ( not Eastern Orthodox ) . Brazilians are never going to switch from their bikini into a chador so do n't  hope for , or expect that ! It is an extremely Liberal and accepting society . You might want to see if you qualify for refugee status in Brazil . I believe that there are established Arab communities in all 3 countries , which you may try to track down as well , to help you with your decision . If you have a professional skill ( lawyer , dentist , etc. ) you can get a job , especially with the support of the local Arab charities , who will help to orient you . The Brazilian language is a heavily-Africanized Portuguese , which many new Syrian migrants now are finding very difficult to learn which you need to do , to get a job . Brazil , even with its current , non-violent political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy than either Peru or Paraguay ( I think bigger than all other S. American countries put together and perhaps many times over ) . Knowing both languages , I do think Spanish is a lot easier to learn ( I 've never even taken lessons , Portuguese is so much more complicated , making any other Latin language easy by comparison . All subjunctive tenses are used , etc. , etc . ) . Hope this helped ! <p> Of course , you understand that when I say " Arab charities " in S. America , I do not mean anything about the Saudis , who have an almost non-existent presence ( in Brazil , at least ) . I 'm speaking about the Arab countries , in general , such as Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , Jordan . As I 've said , Arab-Brazilians tend to be very successful and well-off . They occupy a similar space in Brazilian society as the Ashkenazi Jews do in the US : professional , successful , rich , respected . Historically , Brazil imported most of its crude petroleum from Iraq and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Iraq to instruct Iraqi crews on techniques for poured concrete construction , in particular . Even though Brazil made the largest discovery of oil reserves of the 21st century , its refineries are set up for Iraqi crude and Brazil exports all of its oil . I can speak most knowledgeably about Brazil because I am 1/2 Brazilian and I 've lived there for over 5 years at a time and I go there often , as my parents live in Rio for half of the year . <p> I 'm pissed because I 'm a Cuban national by birth but this is one of the most useless passports in the world , I could probably also get a Spanish passport because my grandfather is a Spanish national by birth , but its too much paperwork and will probably be a dead end as Jeff mentioned . However my wife is a Mexican national , so I only have to live in the country for two years to get a passport , and my children get automatic citizenship , I think marrying a Latin woman is the easiest way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban citizenship and go start a tourism business . <p> bonestabone <p> No thanks , its a hell hole , and you generally do n't  want citizenship in the same country you live , especially with a dictatorship , its the first rule of being a permanent tourist .

A dictator . Some would say a king . <p> Obama has denied both claims . In 2013 , he told CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jessica Yellin , " I am not a dictator , I 'm the president . " By this he meant he could not bypass Congress to unilaterally impose his will . In a 2013 interview with the Hispanic network Univision , Obama explained his immigration policy with the words , " I think its important to remind everybody that , what I 've said previously , I am not a king . " A president who persistently denies being a dictator or a king is worrisome . It is like a stranger who tells you , " I am not a thief . " It makes you wonder why the question arises . <p> It arises because Obama has both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in last month 's State of the Union address , he declared an intention to speed up the process . Obama stated , " America does not stand still and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislationthat 's what I 'm going to do . " Translation : he will use a myriad of executive means to assume the legislative powers of Congress . It will be rule of the executive , by the executive , for the executive . <p> In the past , Obama has blithely ignored the Constitution , Congress and statute law in order to impose his own widesweeping policies . In June 2012 , for example , he bypassed a rebellious Congress to impose an immigration policy that won him crucial support from Hispanics for his re-election bid . The New York Times ( June 16 , 2012 ) explained the impact that executive directive had on up to 800,000 illegals , " Under the change , the Department of Homeland Security " would no longer deport those who entered the US " before age 16 " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enact that immigration change . <p> More recently , Obama has unilaterally rewritten key aspects of the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) . He has done so even though Obamacare is existing law and duly approved by Congress . He has done so even though Congress must approve all changes . And his method of altering the law has sometimes been cavalier . For example , through a Treasury Dept. blog post in July 2013 , the Obama administration announced " it will provide an additional year before the ACA mandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin . " That 's illegal on its face . <p> The issue is not whether established laws deserve respect or compliance ; most do n't . The issue is not whether the current political structure of America should be preserved ; it should n't . What 's happening is a dramatic shift in power between the three branches of American government so that one-man rule is becoming the reality . In his last term as President , Obama will try to cement the Presidency into a dictatorship under another name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifies that spending bills must originate in the House of Representatives . That 's why recent warfare between the House and the President , the Republicans and Democrats has revolved around budget issues . If Obama can bypass the Constitutional requirement , then nothing obstructs his path . <p> Executive authority and a competing Congress <p> Article 1 , section 7 of the Constitution as on other Bills . " <p> The Houses monopoly on raising revenue was designed to be a powerful brake upon the executive . The president can sign executive orders and create executive agencies ( like the Department of Education ) with administrative policies that regulate the minutiae of society . Without funding , however , the measures and agencies falter . <p> Unfortunately , there is some legal grounds upon which Obama could challenge the authority of Congress over revenue bills . Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment ( shall not be questioned . " This Reconstruction amendment was adopted in the wake of the Civil War ( 18611865 ) in order to guarantee Union loans while repudiating Confederate debt . Nevertheless , the United States Supreme Court later ruled that the sections language had broader application . How broad ? Constitutional attorneys point out that the section refers to honoring current debt , not to creating new debt . But during a national emergency , when the president assumes extraordinary powers , will anyone make that distinction , or care about it ? <p> Section 4 was undoubtedly what ex-president Clinton referred to during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis . According to the New York Times ( July 25 , 2011 ) Clinton had " identified a constitutional escape hatch " for Obama : the Fourteenth Amendment . If he were still president , Clinton claimed he would invoke the amendment " without hesitation " and " force the courts to stop me . " Courts are slow ; an executive order goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court ruled against an executive order , political realities would favor it . <p> Obama 's chances of grasping control are enhanced by the current Democratic strategy of weakening the Supreme Court through " popular " or " democratic " constitutionalism . An essay entitled " Popular Constitutionalism and Relaxing the Dead Hand : Can the People Be Trusted ? " by law professor Todd E. Pettys offers a general sense of the approach . " Popular constitutionalists argue that the American people , not the courts , hold the ultimate authority to interpret the Constitutions many open-ended provisions . " In other words , if Obama violates the Constitution 's budgetary restrictions , he should answer to the American people perhaps through a vote rather than be overruled by the Supreme Court . <p> Can Obama 's executive onslaught be stopped ? <p> The honest answer is " no one knows . " But Obama 's power is now so great that some question whether his current stint in office will be his last term . The iconoclastic financial advisor , Zero Hedge commented , " So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . " This is an improbable scenario but not impossible . <p> The improbability : after Franklin D. Roosevelt won a successive four terms as president , the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution was passed . The relevant passage states , " No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice . " To seek a third term , Obama would need to repeal the Amendment or to nullify it in some manner , such as through " popular constitutionalism . " <p> Nevertheless , rumors of a third run are spurred on by increasing discussion of the possibility . For example , the Washington Post ran an op-ed entitled " End presidential term limits . " A House Judicial Committee hearing on Presidential Constitutional Violations was held in December 2013 . Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy pointed out to the committee that Obama violated other laws and Constitutional requirements ; why would n't he violate election laws ? <p> A third-term run remains unlikely .

@@99475462 @3675462/ <h> The Decline and Fall of the Roman Denarius <p> History repeats itself , so the scholars say . But according to Mark Twain it just rhymes . Literary quips and hair-splitting aside , I 've found that one of the most valuable things anyone can do to advance their knowledge and understanding of the world is the study of history . Now I 'm not talking about the kind of history you get in grade school and university , where all you 're told to do is rote-memorization of people , dates and events . To get any value whatsoever out of studying history , you have to be able to discern cause and effect . What causes civilizations to grow to greatness , and what causes them to collapse ? <p> There are few collapsed civilizations that have been studied in quite the depth as the Roman Empire . Many theories have been offered , some with more merit than others . Ludwig von Mises argued that Rome was eroded from within and that economics played a huge part in it . This is too big of a story for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will focus on one of the most important aspects ; the currency . <p> For hundreds of years , the Romans were on a bimetallic standard , not unlike the currency system of the early United States . There was a gold coin , the aureus , which was popularized by Julius Caesar . There was also a silver coin known as the denarius , which was what most Romans used in their day to day transactions . It was on a solid gold and silver standard that Rome ascended to the height of its development and power . <p> One of the greatest enemies of mankind is hubris , and the Roman Empire was certainly not immune to this . The phrase " bread and circuses " refers to the massive welfare spending that occurred in Rome during the height of its power . With the treasury filled with gold , spendthrift politicians quickly used the money to buy influence , votes and curry favour with neighbouring states . <p> When Julius Caesar first began minting large quantities of the aureus it was 8 grams of pure gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the beginning of the fourth century it was replaced by the 4.5 gram solidus . The purity of the coin itself was never debased , but the ever decreasing weight was a sure sign that government spending had been outpacing revenues for centuries . <p> All of this however , pales in comparison with the devaluation of the denarius . The denarius was the backbone of the Roman economy . Citizens earning their income in gold were a rarity given that a days wage for an average labourer at the time is estimated at a single denarius . Thus it also became the target of severe abuse by the Roman authorities . <p> The denarius began as a 4.5 gram silver coin and had stayed that way for centuries under the Roman Republic . After Rome became an empire , things began to turn sour for the denarius and , by extension , the Roman economy . Base metals , such as copper were blended in with the silver and so even though the coin itself weighed the same , the amount of silver in it became less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century the denarius contained over 90% silver but by the end of the second century the silver content had fallen to less than 70% . A century later there was less than 5% silver in the coin and by 350 AD it was all but worthless , having an exchange rate of 4,600,000 to a gold solidus ( or nearly 9 million to the original aureus ) . <p> The economic chaos the hyperinflation of the denarius had on Roman society was very real . The population of Rome reached a peak of about 1 million inhabitants during the first century BC and maintained that level until nearly the end of the second century . At this point it began to slowly decline throughout the third century and precipitously throughout the fourth . By the fifth century , only about 50 thousand people remained . <p> Now compare the collapse in value of the denarius to some modern-day currencies and see if you notice any similarities : <p> Further reading in to the events that unfolded in Rome ( links below ) will reveal that as the denarius was debased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for desperate legislation as the fabric of society was slowly torn apart by inflation . I urge my fellow readers to gain a firm grasp of these events because they will be instructive as to what we can expect for the future . The destruction of the Denarius is only one example of currency debasement , of which there are hundreds . Romans that held on to their gold coins fared well in the hyperinflation and if history is any guide , they will serve us well in the coming years . <p> Chris Horlacher , CA is the Founder and Managing Director of Maple Leaf Metals Exchange Inc .

They spend money on things that are outrageous like hotels that cost $10K a night and anything else they can find just so they can say they have something the rest of us cant possibly access . <p> In the end , an economy and economics is a fantasy a story we weave that allows us to coexist . There is no God given , natural economy . When the facade crumbles , so do we . <p> I do n't  think so , Randee . Youve exhibited a few fundamental errors here . 1 ) " If you want your economy to expand , you have to put your hands on more of those precious metals . " Actually , what you have to do is ascribe more value to each unit of precious metal you already have . That is a natural side effect of production alongside a stable amount of metal . 2 ) " Wealth is dependent on how much of these precious metals an individual can gain control of . " Actually , wealth is dependent on ( actually defined by ) the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a medium of exchange and its value ( not its amount see #1 ) therefore generally controls the speed of growth . This is another natural effect of everyone who receiving metal finding that , over time , the goods and services they can purchase with it become irresistible . The amount of the medium of exchange any one person holds is largely immaterial , as its highest value is realized through exchange . 3 ) " There is no God given , natural economy . When the facade crumbles , so do we . " As I explain in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the " natural " economy ( I make no argument about Gods involvement ) results from a limited amount of the medium of exchange growing in value over time because individuals keeps exchanging it to encourage each other to create more stuff , which is the wealth . Anything can serve as a medium of exchange , though the most useful substances for this purpose are durable , generally immutable , fungible , divisible , and rare , as these qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of stuff . Finally , the facade of which you write is a danger in an economy that uses fiat currency , meaning a medium of exchange whose amount is governed by arbitrary political decisions rather than the work of producing it from the Universe . However , when the amount of the medium of exchange is not subject to such human manipulation , no facade is necessary and therefore there is no danger of crumbling . <p> If you study Austrian Economics , you may understand these things better than you can from my explanations above . It is a large field full of useful insights that will help dispel the errors you 've made . 
@@99475463 @3675463/ <h> OBAMA CAN KILL AMERICANS ON US SOIL WITHOUT DUE PROCESS ? <p> On March 5th , a headline in the left-leaning Mother Jones declared , " Obama Administration Says President Can Use Lethal Force Against Americans on US Soil . " A letter from Attorney General Eric Holder to Republican Senator Rand Paul was the cause . ( A screenshot of the full letter is here . ) Rand had written to John Brennan , the current nominee for Director of the CIA , to ask whether the president can kill American citizens through the drone strike program on US soil without due process . Brennan requested Holder to address legal aspects of the question , which Obama and his administration have hitherto refused to answer . Holder 's March 4 letter may have broken the silence because Rand threatened to filibuster Brennan 's nomination if there was no response . ( Indeed , Rand was filibustering as I wrote this article . ) <p> Conservatives and libertarians are enraged by Holder 's letter ; liberals offer a mixed reaction . An admin at the left-leaning Daily Kos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others claim the Presidential power is nothing new and Holder 's comments are unexceptional . Teasing out the truth means deconstructing the letter . <p> DECONSTRUCTING HOLDER <p> This letter was written and vetted with meticulous care . Holder did not misstate his position . The letter 's vague and non-responsive nature is deliberate and its few specifics are revealing . <p> Holder opens with an assurance : " The US government has not carried out drone strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing so . As a policy matter moreover , we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat . " All words in bold are emphasis added <p> Obama did not even disclose the existence of a drone program on American soil until his hand was forced ; the memos upon which the program 's legal authority is based remain secret . This non-transparency makes it impossible to assess Obama 's intentions , and reduces Holder 's position to " trust us . " The words " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military force instead of law enforcement is dismissed strictly as policy , not on grounds of law or the Constitution . Policies change constantly and often without notice . Moreover , given the extreme militarization of US law enforcement , complete with police drones , it is strange to reassure Americans that they would be killed by law enforcement and not the military . The distinction does obviate some legal questions , however . For example , it bypasses any lingering shred of the Posse Comitatus Act , which limits the power of a President to use the federal military to enforce law . <p> Holder continues . The administration has " a long history of using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals located in our country who pose a threat to the United States and its interests abroad . Hundreds of individuals have been arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our federal courts . " Again , this is a policy statement . Moreover , various federal agencies , including the Department of Homeland Security , have identified broad categories of law-abiding Americans as potential terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently high on that list . By broadening the focus to include America 's " interests abroad , " Holder also signals that the Americans targeted need not be violent but merely a threat to US interests . It would be difficult to be more vague . <p> Holder now approaches the meat of the letter . " The question you Rand Paul have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical , unlikely to occur , and one we hope no president will ever have to confront . " The statement is entirely incorrect . On February 20th , Paul asked whether Obama had " the power to authorize lethal force , such as a drone strike , against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without trial . " This is a specific , real world question ; it asks an Attorney General to comment on a point of federal law , which he would be or has been instrumental in forging . Holder 's dismissal of Rand 's question as theoretical , however , allows him to rephrase it in a form he wishes to address . <p> Holder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States . " The rephrasing allows Holder to avoid the key issue of due process . Unfortunately , few people deny the authority of a President to kill violent Americans who threaten national security . But they balk at his signing secret orders to kill Americans without arrest or a trial . Due process is being reduced to Obama 's signature on a piece of paper that will never be seen . <p> Nevertheless , Holder is at least and at last rendering a legal opinion . Yes , under " extraordinary circumstances , " it is legal " under the Constitution and applicable lawsfor the President to authorize the military to use lethal force " on American soil . <p> It is impossible to know what constitutes " extraordinary circumstances . " America has been in a state of war and militarization for almost 12 years since 9/11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , so , the military becomes necessary . In reality , " extraordinary " will mean whatever the administration wishes . The national emergency could be nothing more than a grassroots refusal of Americans to voluntarily surrender guns . At that point , Obama could bypass both Congress and the Constitution by invoking the War Powers Act and declare martial law . <p> It is also not possible to decipher which " applicable laws " are referenced . Perhaps Holder is appealing to " War on Terror " laws such as the Authorization for Use of Military Force . The latter is a joint resolution passed by Congress in 2001 to authorize the President ( then Bush ) to use " necessary and appropriate force " against anyone who " planned , authorized , committed or aided " those responsible for 9/11 . Indeed , the words used by Holder " necessary and appropriate " echo the wording of the AUMF . It is equally unclear which part of the Constitution is referenced . Certainly , it is not the Bill of Rights . This means that neither Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which President believes it is appropriate to kill Americans on US soil . <p> The two specific examples of " extraordinary circumstances " only confuse the issue further . He states , " the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7 , 1941 , and September 11 , 2001 . " <p> The examples are the bombing or Pearl Harbor and 9/11 . They are bizarre . For one thing , neither incident was perpetrated by Americans . Moreover , Holder endorses the Presidential execution of Americans after a crisis has occurred and not to prevent one . This differs sharply from the administration 's justification for torture ; namely , that information extracted in a " timely manner " may prevent the loss of American lives . <p> The " timely manner " aspect becomes all the more bizarre in light of Holder 's concluding sentence : " Were such an emergency to arise , I would examine the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his authority . " Pearl Harbor occurred literally out of the blue in the early morning hours ; 9/11 was equally unexpected and swift . Does anyone believe Holder thinks there would be time to " examine the particular facts and circumstances " of a surprise attack that hits like a lightning bolt ? Does anyone believe Holder does not know what the administration 's response would be down to the color of Obama 's underwear ? <p> CONCLUSION <p> The Obama administration is profoundly secretive and dishonest . Holder 's letter is an exercise in obfuscation which , nevertheless , does assert the President 's authority to kill Americans on US soil under undefined circumstances . <p> Certain other circumstances have been defined , however . Obama has already asserted the unprecedented power to kill Americans without due process when they are on foreign soil . Anwar al-Aulaqi was an American by birth and upbringing . He was executed by a drone attack in Yemen on September 30th , 2011 . The grounds : suspicion of joining al Qaeda . No evidence of guilt has been presented because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the Obama administration is unwilling to explain the details or scope of the President 's authority to kill Americans on US soil . At some point , when people consistently and persistently refuse to answer a question with " no , " a reasonable person realizes the answer is " yes . " <p> On March 5th , civil libertarian Glenn Greenwald summed up the situation . " There is a theoretical framework being built . " It " posits that the US Government has unlimited power , when it comes to any kind of threats it perceives , to take whatever action against them that it wants without any constraints or limitations of any kind . <p> This week in the comments section a troll accused your notoriously brown-skinned editor of being a " useful idiot " of the racist , right wing corporatists because we do n't let Obama 's race prevent us from heaping much deserved criticism and scorn upon his wooly head . We get these kinds of comments every now and then . And they usually provide a good laugh around the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama 's race is clearly serving as a smiley , politically correct cover for casually murderous dictatorshipthen these messages disturb and sadden us . <p> While we are sad to see these events unfold thuswe would be shocked if they had n't ! Did we really expect the US to stick to economic collapse without a healthy dive into totalitarianism ? Of course not ! They are going to assume more and more control of the lives of their human chattel . They consider all your money to be theirs ( they just let you keep some of it ) and now they are making it crystal clear that you get to keep your lives strictly at their discretion . 
@@99475464 @3675464/ <p> An internal passport refers to an identity document that people must produce to move from place to place within national borders . It allows a government to monitor the movement of its own people and to control that movement by granting or denying I 'd . In the past , governments have used internal passports to isolate ' undesirables ' , to regulate economic opportunities , to reap personal data , to intimidate and command obedience , and to segregate categories of people ( like Jews ) for political purposes . It allows a government to bind anyone it chooses to his or her place of birth . The upcoming Real I 'd requirement targets only air travel . But that 's how it begins with airports . <p> After people became numb to years of I 'd demands , questioning and searches at airports , those tactics spread to train stations and subways . Then highway check-points were established in areas that lay within 100 miles from an " external boundary , " including coasts . U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents now have the authority to stop a traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation or other crime . Although the agents do not currently have authority to demand I 'd from American citizens , they often do so . <p> The ACLU has repeatedly cautioned that " in practice , Border Patrol agents routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of their legal authority in the course of individual stops , resulting in violations of the constitutional rights of innocent people.These problems are compounded bythe consistent failure of CBP to hold agents accountable for abuse . Thus , although the 100-mile border zone is not literally ' Constitution free ' , the U.S. government frequently acts like it is . " <p> Recently , highway checkpoints have occurred well outside the 100-mile " exemption " range , with agents demanding to see I 'd . They detain and threaten those who refuse the illegal demand : <p> The total control of movement always begins with airports . Real I 'd will be reality in the US by the end of the decade and , perhaps , long before . And it is not likely to be limited to air travel . <p> Real I 'd Walks In Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , state driver 's licenses and other I 'd needed to conform to federal standards . The IDs were to be used for " official purposes " as were defined by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) . Examples of explicitly defined " purposes " include for entry into federal buildings and for boarding commercial air flights . But the law also provided the DHS with the authority to require Real I 'd for other undefined purposes , apparently at its discretion . <p> To be compliant , the state IDs must incorporate specific personal details about each bearer and link that information to a unique identifying number . The minimum information required consists of a front-facing photo that is compatible with facial recognition technology , a full legal name , signature , birth date , gender , and main address . ( RFID chips were not mandated but the Act left the future possibility open . ) <p> The issuing state must verify the information and encode it in a machine readable manner such as bar codes . Then , the data must be linked to every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy data-merge with federal databases such as the FBI 's Next Generation Identification system . The latter is a national facial recognition system , which serves other functions as well . <p> The Real I 'd Act experienced a huge backlash from privacy and fourth amendment advocates , as well as from states ' rights ones . The states themselves rebelled because the federal government hoisted the cost of implementing the program onto their shoulders . Some states for example , Idaho , Hawaii , New Hampshire , and Maine flatly refused to comply . DHS estimates that somewhere between 20-30% of Americans live in non-compliant areas . This means the states have to scramble to abide by federal standards by 2016 . The Real I 'd will have a white star inside a gold circle in the upper right corner to indicate that the data has been verified . <p> The verification process is not a simple one for the state or for the individual . The Marietta Daily Journal ( Oct. 23,2012 ) reported , " Many drivers in Georgia were surprised when they attempted to renew their drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer . Federal requirements for the Real I 'd Act , now require drivers to visit a Department of Driver Services office if they do n't  already have DDS secure license marked by a white star in a field of gold in the upper right corner of the license . <p> +G- " Many Georgians havent renewed their licenses in many years , so naturally , they were caught by surprise when they had to produce , in person , proof of identity , Social Security card and proof of residence . But there is more . You have to prove your citizenship as well . How ? According to the DDS , either with a ' valid , unexpired U.S. passport ' , an original or certified copy of a U.S. birth certificate/amended birth certificate filed with the State Office of Vital Statistics . Birth certificates issued by hospitals ' are not acceptable ' . " <p> This is nothing less than the federalization and standardization of all identifying documents throughout the United States . Those who are unable to document such niceties as their existence ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will be unable to fly and excluded from entering into federal buildings , which may be necessary for them to obtain government permissions or fulfil legal requirements . Joining the ranks of the second-class will be the holders non-compliant licenses ; these lack a white star and are stamped " Not for Federal Official Use " instead . " Not for Federal Official Use " holders will need a traditional passport or to apply for alternate DHS documentation if they wish to fly . <p> What To Expect <p> Many states and , so , many individuals will not make TSA 's January 2016 deadline for Real I 'd . Some hope the humanitarian TSA will push back the deadline as it did last year . And a delay may happenfor logistical reasons . If it does , those who wish to escape a nation with internal passports may have another year to do so . <p> But the main hope of delaying Real I 'd is a confrontation between the federal and state governments . In 2012 , the governor of Montana declared , <p> " Montana will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a national database , nor bear the exorbitant cost of building such a database . Furthermore , the Act tramples on our state 's right to determine our own licensing procedures and protocols , and would interfere with our state 's work to improve drivers ' license security . Montana is in no mood at all for another heavy-handed play by the federal government , such as what transpired in 2008 when the homeland security director threatened to prevent Montanans from boarding an airplane unless we complied with the REAL I 'd act . We refused , and will refuse again . " <p> Brave words . But Real I 'd is coming . When it arrives with both feet , Real I 'd will make it much more difficult for freedom-loving people to avoid the federal behemoth . Of course , that is its purpose . FATCA and related global measures gave the feds access to every cent that any American possessed in the world . Now Real I 'd wants to ensure that no American can avoid federal detection within domestic borders . <p> Editor 's Note : Contact TDV Passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat of coercion from the TSA , in another country . <p> With OhBummer and his vision of jacking the cost of electricity into the stratosphere by raising the cost of coal generated electricity , there will be far reaching ripples . Ripples very few are willing to look at . Such as businesses going under due to the high cost of energy to make products , ship raw materials , even just keeping the lights on in an office building or home will be cost prohibited . There will be other knock on effects also , but the cost of power and the inability for the power plants to keep on running , cranking out electricity due to extreme losses of revenue , will be the main ones to focus on . These scanners , readers and computer networks will not work without electricity that is supplied via the power grids . So it will be a case of having all these wonderful toys for the maggots to play with , but they will all sit idle with no power going into them ! And PLEASE do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on batteries ! ! Who will be able to afford the cost of a plane ticket even into just the next State at that point , or even have a need to get on a plane for an internal passport to be needed ? Who will there be manning the checkpoints if they can not be paid because the bank and government computers do n't  work without electricity ? This is just some simple extrapolation along the lines of logical thinking . Society is a fabric in every sense of the word . Remove or cut too many of the threads , and all that you have left is a tattered old rag . We will see wide ranging effects going on , all across the boards , not just a few isolated events here and there and business as usual . This will be the broadest brush stroke possible , nothing will escape it . It will be a game changer . If you can sit down for five minutes and think about these things , you will see how true my observations and predictions are . The electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed before any internal passports are issued to anyone or are inspected at a checkpoint . Do n't  forget that electricity will be needed to make those IDs too ! ! <p> Randy <p> Bobbie Jo Justice <p> remind me who created the department of homeland horse manure . It was created by gwb the terrorist . <p> Randy <p> Why do I need to remind you when you already know who the maggot inbred retard GWB is and what he did ? If you were even one tenth as smart as you like to think you are , youd see that politics is one of the major reasons for these societal problems that we have today as well as societies had many thousands of years ago . And then like me , youd completely abandon any false ideas that more politicians and their politics can be used to solve the problems that previous politicians and their insane politics created before . All that politicians can be counted on for is to create more and bigger messes than the ones they inherit from previous politicians ! THIS is the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inept and stupid people become their leaders because they 're slick and smooth talkers who promise them all manner of " free " stuff which then sucks the productivity right out of the society like any other parasite .

REAL I 'd is a set of rules to make drivers licenses work better , not a whole new I 'd . They apply to states , not to you . And every state except for American Samoa , Louisiana , Minnesota , New Hampshire , and New York is already cleared for REAL I 'd . <p> We live in a very scary world . We are supervised by the move .

That 's one thing that excites me most about the conference : it is to be highly personalized . That means we are n't offering a one-size-fits-all solution . We are tailoring the program to each individual 's needs , and this is where the value truly is . <p> 2014 may be the last year to salvage your assets . Judging by all the phone calls we 've been receiving over the last few weeks , I have no doubt this is a serious possibility . FATCA will already be implemented in just a few short months . <p> The ways and means by which to export wealth out of respective countries have been shutting down for quite awhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paperwork is daunting , and it 's likely to be outright illegal . The difficulties with moving gold around is one of the main reasons we thought up the Crisis Conference . There was clearly a need for this type of service , and we knew TDV had the resources and connections to make something special happen . <p> If you 're familiar with our work , you know what we are about , and you 'll also know that diversification is key to surviving the new economic system ( abject poverty for nearly all ? ) as it 's final pieces fall into place . History might not repeat itself , but it certainly rhymes ( as Mark Twain once wrote ) , and we 've seen the wealth of nations wiped out time-after-time . <p> Take note that the conference is for people with around $1 million in assets and up . If you are not sure if this conference meets your needs , feel free to call TDV Wealth Management at +1-646-568-5518 Ext. 516 or email email protected for a short , free consultation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn more about the very serious issues that we have discussed above , click here .

@@99475470 @3675470/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Actor Donald Sutherland Confirms Hunger Games is Allegory for the US <p> Here is a short clip featuring Donald Sutherland , who acted in The Hunger Games movie series , to learn in some detail what he thinks about them . He says flatly , it is an allegory pertaining to the United States , which is just what I wrote about a year ago . <p> That is quite outspoken and courageous of Donald Sutherland to say . - If it gets too much exposure hell likely see his Hollywood roles begin to disappear . <p> Here 's a quote from our article on The Hunger Games , which you can see here . <p> When I think about Washington DC , increasingly , I see The Capitol depicted in the Hunger Games DC leads the way in the US for federal public corruption convictions . The inhabitants of DC are getting richer than those in the 50 Districts ( formerly known as " states " ) . In recent years this has increased to a dramatic degree becoming painfully obvious especially when you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley ) has almost no natural , wealth building industry. - - <p> It should be noted that Washington , in the District of Criminals , rarely exceeded other areas of the country in terms of Median Household Income until just after the epoch moment that occurred in 2001 , centralizing more power to Washington. - And then the gains were much more dramatic since the financial crisis of 2008 which gifted the banks even more freshly printed Federal Reserve Notes ( they call them dollars in most of the districts ) and centralized even more power to DC Truthfully , however , The Hunger Games could be a metaphor for the " capital city " of any country or empire. - <p> Why would Hollywood make a movie about a dystopian future that is obviously critical of the US ? Tinseltown does it all the time . The idea is to make people ( and teenagers in this case ) familiar with this sort of future . Robocop , many of the Schwarzenegger and Stallone movies and many other movies as well , foretell various kinds of dystopian futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their implementation is not so severe because people have seen it already . <p> It is a very cynical ploy , but it surely works . These movies also add to the psychological burden that most of us carry in these waning days of freedom . Such movies in foretelling the future are intended to give us a sense of hopelessness , that a dystopian future is preordained . <p> In fact , it is not . Those who are interested in imposing this sort of future on us have made plenty of mistakes in the past century and even more in the 21st century . Anyone who knows about the globalist timeline , knows that it has slipped considerably as they continue to run into difficulties with implementing every part of it . <p> Additionally , the internet has caused havoc with their plans because tens of millions " hundreds of millions " are intimately aware of what is taking place . <p> It is very hard to keep a conspiracy secret when thousands of websites are tracking its expansion on a daily basis . TDV does its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shemitah videos not only went viral , they predicted with uncanny accuracy the late August stock market crash , the decline and fall of the European Union as a viable open-borders region and , generally speaking , the Paris attacks/crisis as well . <p> There is more to come unfortunately , and you can learn all about it regularly " and what to do to stop it from happening to you " when you receive our bimonthly TDV newsletter . It 's crammed with more than 100 pages of insights , news and freedom-solutions , as well as profiles of like-minded individuals and a worldwide community of dollar collapse survivors . <p> The society Donald Sutherland describes " and which I wrote about a year ago " is not here , but it 's getting closer all the time . <p> I predict that the video will be removed . So I used a video-download site ( " Just add -saver between youtube and . com ' " ) to save a copy . I looked around Youtube to see if I could find the original or the full interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in which Mr. Sutherland is obviously struggling with the philosophical issues involved . He is speaking out about them and encouraging others to do so as well . He has n't  yet gone full anarchist like his younger coworker Woody . <p> There is a need for control , but there is also a need to respect individuals and autonomy . It is rare to find someone conscious of the fact that nearly all of us are nearly always relying on the consciences of other people ( not external control ) to keep us safe . Yes , control is necessary , but for a prosperous and healthy species , that control has to be internally developed by the will of the individual , not externally motivated by punishment and reward . <p> That is for Mr. Sutherland and anyone else who can benefit from it . <p> OldeSoul <p> Re : Donald and Woody , why do you suppose these two actors , who supposedly recognize that The Hunger Games is dystopian predictive programming , would be willing participants ? <p> They may recognize it as predictive programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that both feel famous enough to be able to do more good by participating than by refusing to participate . <p> This is such a good question for us to ponder . If you discovered that you held a job which supported abject evil , would you quit ? Would you thereby simply allow your position to be filled by someone who probably does n't  recognize the problem , and would n't do anything ti alleviate it ? I do n't  think I would quit . Rather , I would probably get fired for pressuring others to use their conscience , like Joe Bannister did . <p> Woody and Donald may very well be doing just that . Let 's follow Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Hutcherson and Ms. Moore and Mr. Tucci and the rest of them and see if they use their skills to program others or to educate them , whether by acting or simply by injecting a bit of philosophy into their answers when they are interviewed . <p> OldeSoul <p> Those are excellent points . I know what I would do in the hypothetical situation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to imagine what they would do . I rarely watch movies anymore because once you recognize the squirmy , smarmy sensation that you are being programmed to create the reality they want us to create , movies no longer qualify as entertainment . Perhaps that 's my small way of " quitting a job that supports abject evil . " Thanks for your response . <p> Your inner rebel deserves CPR . That rebellious part of the human psyche is the Achilles Heel of authority . Once you recognize an attempt to brainwash or program you , that attempt backfires to the extent that you understand it . I encourage you to subject yourself once more to those attempts for a couple reasons , the first being to enhance your understanding of them and thereby strengthen the backfire effect . <p> I imagine that if you take the approach of detecting and then discussing the attempts with others , in as entertaining a way as you can , you 'll end up turning the parasites efforts against them , just like they do to all those who get tricked into paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've got that down , it seems , as this comment thread shows . <p> OldeSoul <p> Hahaha busted ! I 've spent this entire lifetime rebelling against authority in all forms . Turns out , after some experience with talking to friends and coworkers about the subconscious mind programming in movies and teevee , hindsight reveals this is the same as offering them the red/blue pill . Once they take that step , they can not go back to unseeing , which is why this awakening process , while seemingly slow to our time-bound minds , is proceeding apace and can not be stopped . I think they know this . There are some current thinkers who have connected dots that show movies oftentimes contain multi-level messages , not just to the public but to opposing forces . Miles Mathis makes a compelling case that the Bond movies are the " Old Intelligence " poking a stick at the " New Intelligence . " I believe Jay Dyer makes similar observations . Its all fascinating . The world is a much more compelling planet from a multi-dimensional POV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff you should meet my friends if you have n't already they will have your back when you need it most <p> Zipinparadise <p> I was starting to go along with your analysis until I read your self-description of yourself as " anarcho-capitalist " I would suggest you learn some history particularly about the honorable Mr Sutherlands Father-in Law , the legendary Canadian democratic socialist , Mr Tommy Douglas . No doubt Donald received important lessons from that great man . <p> Dan <p> The world will only become what we the people allow it to , You do n't  want a hunger games type society then it is up to us to fight there plans at all costs . <p> xyz <p> 1000% rite . Impossible to do tho , considering 99% of the inhabitants of this prison planet are retarded in more ways than one . <p> Dan <p> All you need is a shepherd with the right words and attitude and the sheep will follow . <p> There is no need to fall prey to the trap of violence in resisting the STATE . The means to peacefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the Political Class fall into obsolescence . <p> Dan <p> I did not say violently , We just have to fight back anyway we can , Unfortunately the " peaceful " option is n't really an option , Many have tried and all have failed . Assange , Snowden , JFK and many many more all tried and failed to peacefully bring them to justice . <p> " Resolve to serve no more , and you are at once freed . I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over , but simply that you support him no longer ; then you will behold him , like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away , fall of his own weight and break in pieces .

" - And by shielding his assets he is helping to protect his assets . - Those assets , or capital , can then be used to invest . - Savings ( capital ) and investment are the only way to create a wealthier , and healthier society . <p> As well , by shielding tens-of-billions of dollars from tax ( aka. extortion/theft ) he is keeping a large amount of money out of the hands of the largest terrorist organization in the world today , the US government . - This literally saves lives . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lies of WMDs that no one has been held responsible for to date ) , since 2003 is estimated at $2 trillion . - The total amount of civilian men , women and children who have been killed since that time is estimated at around 150,000. - That is a total cost of about $13.3 million per person killed in Iraq . - By keeping $20 billion out of the hands of the US government and the Department of Offense , Zuckerberg could have , or will , save 1,500 lives . <p> Admittedly , saving only 1,500 out of 150,000 lives is not a massive amount . - But to each of those 1,500 who wo n't be killed by drones at wedding parties or in " shock and awe " terrorist attacks it means a lot ! <p> Getting back to the New York Times , and the economically-ignorant who read it , they think the " philanthropic " part is that Zuckerberg is giving his money to " charity " . <p> They are so clueless about how the wealthy ( and even not-so-wealthy ) can tax-shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Buffet , did , they think that by Mark Zuckerberg doing this that he is " giving his money away " . <p> In fact , by giving to the great majority of large charities you are destroying capital . - Not to mention , when you give to things like the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) you are actually giving them more resources by which to keep cures from the public as the ACS has it in its every interest to ensure no cure is ever found ( plenty already have been found and shut down in the US as my interview with Rick Simpson of Phoenix Tears discusses ) . <p> If Zuckerberg wants a better world for humanity then he should continue to invest his funds to create more wealth . - And that appears to be what he is doing . - You can argue on whether many of his ideas on what the problems of the world are , are correct or not and I would certainly disagree with a number of them but he intends to invest in technology which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between today and decades ago is that even the not-so-wealthy can afford to use these same practices to gain the same advantages now . - An offshore LLC can be as little as a few thousand dollars and you can minimize taxes , gain confidentiality and protect your assets from lawsuits or government seizure . <p> And , its all legal . <p> I suggest , if you are interested in gaining these benefits , that you contact TDV Offshore which offers a wide variety of jurisdictions and easy set-up that does n't  require travel . <p> Of course , if you do n't  know anything about offshore incorporation or banking you 'll need to do some learning . - We can help you with that as a subscriber to The Dollar Vigilante ( Subscribe here last month we featured an excellent way to get incorporated , banking and even residency in Costa Rica , as one example ) . <p> And if you structure your assets with an offshore LLC or Trust to minimize taxes and secure your assets you get the added benefit of being able to tell everyone how philanthropic you are like Mark Zuckerberg.

You are not going to take on a platoon of Marines with state of the art automatic weapons and the best body armor you can not buy protected by armed personnel carriers and attack helicopters unless you choose to die that day for nothing . <p> You will either be in the country or out , and if you are in , you will stay in and you will comply . <p> And , even after all the recent saber-rattling in response to Obama 's threat to ban certain semi-automatic rifles , I still believe every word of that article . Most Americans will give up their guns when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are afraid to die , although most are , but because they are so used to giving up what the government mandates be turned over . Guns may just be the next takeaway in a long list of takings by the State . <p> Others will come to the conclusion that guns no longer serve a purpose vis-a-vis protection from government tyranny because they have already given up all the rights that matter . From free speech to freedom of the press , all that which was once held sacred has been fully abridged . Even Bill Maher , a liberal 's liberal , gets that irony . <p> From a government that once complied with the requirements of due process down to dutifully reading one 's Miranda rights , we now suffer under a Leviathan that openly claims ( and exercises ) the right to arrest , indefinitely detain , sequester , jail , and even kill its own citizens without charges , an attorney , or a trial . <p> From cops who used to fear violating a citizen 's rights , we have morphed law enforcement into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share only one commonality : they do n't care about the law .

And , if you get in the way or do n't do exactly as you are told , or in some cases do n't intuit what it is they want you to do , you can end up face down on the pavement like this poor bastard . <p> From a simple rap sheet on felons that might be available in the past , the State and all of its appendages can and do have access to your most personal information that can be used to construct vast dossiers that are widely shared through new institutions like Joint Terrorism Task Forces , fusion centers , and public-private partnerships . ( That information , by the way , includes the fact that you are reading this blog online . They know . They will remember . Forever . ) <p> Free speech that was once revered is now also in the ashcan of history . The Patriot Act , as only one example , makes it a crime for an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any group designated as a " terrorist organization . " And who gets to define " terrorist organization " ? The Secretary of State who reports directly to the President . Even organizations like PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) has been characterized a " terrorist threat " by government . And , of course , anarchists who by definition do not believe in aggression against others , including aggression by the State , are set aside for special condemnation as " terrorists " by the U.S. government : <p> " The FBI has described anarchist extremists as typically being " event driven , " meaning <p> they show up at political conventions , economic and financial summits , environmental meetings , and the like . They usually target symbols of Western civilization that they perceive to be the root causes of all societal illsi.e. , financial corporations , government institutions , multinational companies , and law enforcement agencies . They damage and vandalize property , riot , set fires , and perpetrate small-scale bombings . Law enforcement is also concerned about anarchist extremists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incendiary devices . " ( Source : Congressional Research Service ) <p> Freedom of the press has likewise been shit-canned , and now subject to the whims of government . Of course , government need not take much action against the press , not anymore , since most mainstream press organizations are merely mouthpieces of government . But in the rare event a reporter or a publication wants to expose the incestuous relationship of government and big business , to reveal the State for what it is , they are shut down under threat of law . Good example : agricultural gag laws that provide prison for reporters that reveal animal abuse in industrial agriculture are an in-your-face violation of the First Amendment , but few care anymore , even the courts . <p> So , what 's the point ? Just this : the Second Amendment which prohibits the federal government from abridging the freedom to possess firearms , a right ostensibly provided by the Founders in order to prevent government from stripping away other freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution , is arguably unnecessary now , to-wit , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stripped away . Indeed , other than the right to shop and go out to eat ( neither specifically mentioned in the Constitution ) , there are few rights that most Americans seem to care about anymore . Instead , they have been gamed by bread and circuses without firing a shot . <p> I would opine that under these circumstances government would care little whether Americans are armed or not . However , the Feds must suspect civil unrest is coming when the dollar collapses , and hungry people with guns probably is n't what they have in mind as an endgame , which brings us full circle back to government , per Congressional directive or Executive edict , one day going door to door asking not-so-kindly for your weapons which will leave you asking what liberties you have left worth dying for . <p> Jim Karger is a lawyer , and frequent contributor to The Dollar Vigilante , who has represented American businesses against incursions by government and labor unions for 30 years .

Congress is considering imitating the theft in Cyprus and letting troubled banks " bail-in " depositor money in order to make themselves solvent . <p> Jim Sinclair , chairman and chief executive officer of Tanzania Royalty Exploration Corp. , and whose family started Goldman Sachs , Salomon Brothers , Lehman Brothers , and others , has been warning of this for a while . <p> " Bail-ins are coming to North America without any doubt , and will be remembered as the Great Leveling , of the great Flushing .

In fact , US banks presented the Federal Reserve with a bail-in plan to pay for large banks ' restructuring in the event of a future crisis , The Wall Street Journal reports . The plan was presented to the US Federal Reserve in an attempt to preempt tougher rules from the regulators . <p> The private meeting was reportedly attended by officials from Wells Fargo &amp; Company , Bank of America Corp , Citigroup Inc. and several other banks .

@@99475485 @3675485/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Should Americans Emigrate or Defect ? 28883 @qwx888883 <p> Anyone planning to permanently leave the US should give deep thought to whether they are emigrating or defecting . <p> The two concepts have so much in common that they tend to blur together . They may be best viewed as two extremes of the same axis upon which people can ' grade ' themselves . But there is a significant difference between the attitude , motives , and actions of a straightforward emigrant versus a defector . And where you stand on the axis affects the most important aspect of who you are : How do you evaluate yourself ? <p> Both emigrants and defectors physically leave a nation to relocate permanently elsewhere . But the key difference between emigration and defection is the motive . Emigrants usually relocate to be with family or for economic reasons . The motives can have political overtones ; for example , some portion of the family may have left due to religious persecution or the homeland may have a disastrous tax rate . By contrast , defection is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . It is an active shunning of citizenship that is independent from family or economic concerns . Emigration focuses primarily on arriving to embrace something ; defection focuses primarily on leaving in protest . They are not mutually exclusive , however . <p> Another key difference is that emigration is generally a lawful process . Or , at least , the emigration does not require an active challenge to the laws of the deserted nation . Defection is flatly illegal . <p> Typically , laws against migration are meant to discourage people from leaving , especially people who enrich the nation in which they reside through their wealth , productivity and skills . East Germany is an example . After WWII , the Soviet Union dominated the Eastern sector of Germany , with Western nations ( mainly America ) dominating the West ; the city of Berlin was split in two . Emigration became an immediate problem for the Soviet sector . In his book Closed Borders : The Contemporary Assault on Freedom of Movement ( Yale , 1989 ) Alan Dowty estimated that almost 20% of East Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young , professionals and skilled workers formed a disproportionately large part of the migration . The words " brain drain " were spoken . In the early 1950s , a Soviet-style shutdown killed migration to the West . But Berlin remained a problem . The complex division and politics of the city served as a migration loophole . In 1961 , East Germany began stretching the barbed-wire that would be extended to include the Berlin Wall . <p> From one day to the next , East Berliners who walked westward ceased to be covert emigrants and became defectors to be shot on sight . East Berlin was not merely determined to forcibly retain the best , the brightest , the most productive . It was tired of the political embarrassment of the best , the brightest , the most productive renouncing the communist state in a visible , tangible manner . Thus , the choice between emigration and defection was yanked from individuals and placed into the hands of the state . It is the tendency of totalitarian governments to slam shut the exit door . And it sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door has not yet slammed . But America punishes the act and it is proposing legislation to punish it more . For example , a bill called the Ex-PATRIOT Act is in the Senate . Its full name is the Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act , and it would ban anyone who expatriates from ever setting foot again on American soil . As the law stands today , the " exit tax " for those who emigrate without renouncing citizenship is to be saddled with a US tax liability in perpetuity ; in short , double taxation . The " exit tax " for those who renounce citizenship is the complexity of the process and a confiscation of wealth from those who have it . This is a fiscal Berlin Wall . Those who quietly leave and " stay gone " without notifying the U.S. state are similar to pre-wall East Berliners . They fall somewhat between emigrants and defectors , with their main reason for silence being to escape notice . Hopefully , the door for them to do so will remain open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we really ca n't blame you if the thought has crossed your mind requires you to have a citizenship someplace else . Sadly , you can not be stateless in this worldyet . So as part of your own " permanent exit strategy " , make sure to look into other citizenship and passport options , particularly if you are a US citizen . TDV has options in countries that will be much kinder to you and your capital than the US ever was . Click here to learn more . <p> The two categories of escapees differ in another important manner : the attitude expressed toward them by the abandoned state . This is a key indicator of whether the door " out " is preparing to close . When emigration is considered to be an act of political rebuke and embarrassment , the emigrant is viewed as a defector . <p> Mexico does not care if its citizens go to California or Texas and send money back home to relatives . Mexico ignores these emigrants because they entail no political embarrassment or economic cost . America cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who emigrate even without vocally defecting are exploding the myth that America is the land of opportunity and freedom ; they are a political rebuke . Second , the US is losing the best , the brightest , the most productive by losing businessmen , the wealthy , the skilled and the educated ; the escapees are an economic and intellectual drain . Words like " traitor " and " unpatriotic " are being attached to high-profile emigrants like Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin , who fled for economic reasons . In the eyes of America , emigration is becoming defection . And totalitarian states do not tolerate defectors . <p> America has spent trillions of dollars to establish Homeland Security guards at entry and exit points , to build barriers across its borders , and to process anyone who wants in or out of its jurisdiction . This is not an accidental act . Any state powerful enough to shut people out is powerful enough to shut people in . <p> America is like the postwar city of Berlin . Borders are still open and they offer relatively free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being built to close that porous border . Those who are planning to leave should decide if they are an emigrant or a defector . Otherwise the decision may be taken out of their hands and decided by the state . <p> As a TDV-hating detractor or two has pointed out , you do not " need " a second citizenship and passport in order to flee the US . You can just sort of wander off and melt into the Latin American jungleor continuously hop from place to place as your visas expire on your existing US passport . It 's entirely doable . But a second passport increases the ease of travel because if you choose well , you can vastly expand the number of countries where you could just show up and get in without any rigmarole . And it also gives you an " out " in case you want to step out of your US shackles completely and for the rest of your life . <p> I remember when I first got a taste of the power of a non-US passport . It was during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anarchist soul , Doug Casey , at his impressive spread in Cafayate . Argentina had imposed an entry fee for American visitors as a way to retaliate for a similar policy the US had imposed on Argentines visiting the States . So there was a line for US visitors ( most of the people on the plane ) where they had to pay the extra money . We non-US passport holders were free to go straight to customs without further extortion . <p> But it 's like the lessons of economics . There is the seen and the unseen . You do n't " need " a second passport to travel now . But as a US subject you will very likely need a second passport when the US government finishes lacing up the jackboots and starts stepping on necks with vigor . When those leaving the US suddenly go from emigrants to defectors , a second citizenship and passport will suddenly be revealed to have been one of the wisest possible investmentssort of like loading up on silver bullion in the ' 90s . Seemed a little superfluous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartest move you could have possibly made . <p> Before US emigrants become US defectors , get yourself ready by clicking here . <p> Regards , <p> Gary Gibson Editor , The Dollar Vigilante <p> Shares <p> Filed Under : Uncategorized <p> tom <p> I 'm trying to defect from Australia to Russia right now .

But that sad eventuality is best avoided not by doing what you hate until you simply ca n't do it anymore , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to contribute , what you want to change , what you want to build , finding the best place in the world to do it , and then making the leap of faith . <p> Now back In San Miguel de Allende , I look forward to what tomorrow will bring . <p> Your itinerant TDV editor is continuing his US tour , vigilantes . Jeff could n't stand more than a couple of days in the USSA , but I 'm still kind of sweet on the place . Sure the government is absolutely unbearable and many of the people are a bunch of easily led statist sheepbut it is so nice to have all the comfortable surroundings I am used to plus many more people speak the same language as me here than in Acapulco . <p> Today I 'll be leaving heading back to Minneapolis for a spell . I developed quite the crush on San Diego in my short time here , however . I 've even given some thought to doing a monthly foray from Acapulco direct to Tijuana and skipping across the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to . But , well see how I feel about that as time goes on . Every time the US Government arrests an anarchist for a Facebook post my toes curl just a little bit more . <p> I 'd be risking government theft , kidnapping and extortion by living within easy reach of the greediest , most dangerous , violence-prone government in the world . Where 's the sense in that ? In fact Justin , the TDV crew member with whom I stayed in San Diego , is himself planning to join me in fleeing to Acapulco . He asked me what it would be like for him down there . I told him that the living is relatively cheap and incredibly easy . <p> Jeff had set me up in one of his condo suites . The wall facing the balcony was made entirely of glass . I woke up every day to the sight of the Pacific and every night I went to sleep to the sound of the waves hitting the rocks 15 stories below . I would like to say that my days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to my laptop and so my days were usually spent someplace I could use the laptop comfortably and for long periods of time . That could mean lounging in my very comfortable condo with its marvelous viewOr it could mean relaxing in one of my favorite local bars or restaurants . I 'd order food and drinks for about half or less what they cost in the US and make the occasional bits of small talk with the always extremely friendly staff in my limited Spanish . <p> It 's great to have a vocation that allows you to live where you want and spend your day where you want . In bed and glancing occasionally at the oceanin a nice restaurant and sampling very affordable and tasty dishes all day longor in a bar along the beach , enjoying the view and getting ever so slowly drunk , which can be a great boon when your livelihood depends on getting flashes of inspiration <p> And do n't forgetyou can get even more information about Acapulco , as well as San Miguel and other cities around the world directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid TDV newsletter get access to our new TDV Group forums where they can interact with other TDV newsletter subscribers from around the world .

@@99475490 @3675490/ <h> Speaking Laughter to Power <p> " Instead of keeping silent in the face of obvious official lies and the effrontery of elites , this body breaks into laughter . And by laughing it drains officialdom of meaning and sometimes obliges it to function empty and powerless . " Achille Mbembe , " On the Post Colony " <p> Last month , Turkish women broke into the laughter of protest . Turkey 's Deputy Prime Minister Bnlent Arinc castigated them for the immoral act of being too happy in public . Tens of thousands of women flooded twitter and instagram with gleeful selfies under the two hashtags #kahkaha ( laughter ) and #direnkahkaha ( resist laughter ) . They were laughing at Arinc . The women 's campaign caught the imagination of global media and , as the Huffington Post explained , " the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister has become the laughing stock of the world ! " <p> Ridicule has been used as a weapon of protest and resistance for centuries . ( Ridicule is defined here as laughter at the expense of another . ) For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Athenian playwright Aristophanes savagely satirized Athens ' policy on the Peloponnesian War . <p> In America , one man perfected the art of ridicule as political commentary : Mark Twain ( Samuel Clement ) . Although best known as a humorist , Twain ardently opposed imperialism , slavery , racism and much of the other popular politics of his day . He stated his view of politicians bluntly : " Suppose you were an idiot . And suppose you were a member of Congress . But I repeat myself . " <p> It is precisely because of his humor that Twain 's political views are still quoted today , 104 years after his death . His article " A Presidential Candidate " ( June 1879 ) is a prime example . In the article , Twain explains , " I have pretty much made up my mind to run for president . What the country wants is a candidate who can not be injured by investigation of his past history " Thus , he chronicles the history of his moral turpitude . " I treed a rheumatic grandfather of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inexpert in climbing trees.I ran him out of the front door in his nightshirt at the point of a shotgun and caused him to bowl up a maple tree , where he remained all night , while I emptied shot into his legs . I did this because he snored . I will do it again if I ever have another grandfather . " <p> He admits to another ' relative ' concern . " The rumor that I buried a dead aunt under my grapevine was correct . The vine needed fertilizing , my aunt had to be buried , and I dedicated her to this high purpose . Does that unfit me for the presidency ? The Constitution of our country does not say so.Why should I be selected as the first victim of an absurd prejudice ? " <p> As to the poor a question every candidate encounters Twain states , " I regard the poor man , in his present condition , as so much wasted raw material . Cut up and properly canned , he might be made useful " <p> The Dark Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The Marxist Saul Alinsky ( 1909 1972 ) exemplifies the former . Alinsky exerted a defining influence on America 's current political scene . For example , in 1969 , Hillary Clinton ( then Rodham ) wrote her senior thesis for Wellesley College on the Alinsky model of strategy in creating a social state . The New English Review aptly observed , " President Obama worked for Alinsky organizations and taught seminars in Alinsky tactics and methodology during his ' community organizing ' period in Chicago . Michelle Obama echoed Alinsky 's words in her speech at the Democratic Convention . " <p> The fourth rule is : Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules . You can kill them with this , for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity . <p> The fourth rule carries within it the fifth rule : Ridicule is man 's most potent weapon . It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule . Also it infuriates the opposition , who then react to your advantage . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your people enjoy . If your people are not having a ball doing it , there is something very wrong with the tactic . <p> Hold up an opponent 's life and compare it to what he advocates ; mock him unmercifully for any disconnects ; make sure that fellow-travelers are having fun in the process . The ridicule is key to all three . An example of the 3-part process would be to compare the Obamas ' diatribes against " the rich " to their own ultra-lavish lifestyle , and to do so in a manner that elicits laughter from the public , happiness from fellow travelers . <p> Alinsky describes the secret of ridicule 's power , " it infuriates the opposition , who then react to your advantage . " He maintains , " The enemy properly goaded and guided in his reaction will be your major strength . " In short , the effectiveness of ridicule is not in the mockery but in the enemy 's reaction . The goal is to make the target lose his composure and start slinging mud or sputtering . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually predictable . To the world , the ridiculer seems glib and amusing ; the target looks angry , defensive and foolish . <p> There is added benefit to having the world laugh with you , not at you . John Cleese of Monty Python fame once said , " If I can get you to laugh with me , you like me better , which makes you more open to my ideas . And if I can persuade you to laugh at the particular point I make , by laughing at it you acknowledge the truth . " As the target is discredited , the ridiculer rises in status . <p> The best protection against ridicule is to take Alinsky seriously . Do not give the knee-jerk response that the mocker wants ; assume the moral high ground instead . Either ignore the jeering or calmly point it out as unworthy e.g. " can we start an adult conversation now ? " Or insist upon returning to the real issues . Use reason against ridicule , and never go on the defensive because that lends credibility to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite have always been afraid of ridicule . Augustus Caesar ( 63 BC 14 AD ) banned the telling of jokes at his expense . In April 2014 , the People 's Bank of China banned April Fool 's pranks because they might destabilize " the governments ability to effectively communicate . " <p> They are correct to be afraid . The political power of ridicule was revealed in 2005-2006 when protests swept Islamic nations in response to cartoons depicting Muhammad in an unflattering manner . For example , one showed Muhammad with a bomb in his turban , which was inscribed with an Islamic creed . <p> Laughter is a political laxative . Ridicule the political system because it is a joke and at politicians because they can survive anything but ridicule . Imagine a campaign speech at which every audience member pointed a finger of derision at the candidate and giggled . Nothing could disconcert the candidate more nor make a better public statement . Guffaw at election promises , snicker at spin , and belly-laugh at claims of achievement . And if politicians hit back , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Activists imprisoned for Laughing . " In his essay " Ridicule as a Weapon , " Professor of Communications Michael Waller summed up the reason for radicals to laugh . " To the enemy , ridicule can be worse than death . At least many enemies find death to be a supernatural martyrdom . Ridicule is much worse : destruction without martyrdom : A fate worse than death . And they have to live with it . " 
@@99475495 @3675495/ <h> A Man In Denmark Fleeing Persecution For Hurting a Politicians Feelings <p> I was contacted today by a Dollar Vigilante subscriber with an urgent situation . <p> He lives in Denmark and , as many TDV subscribers are , is not a fan of government . As such he had said some things about some politicians on Facebook that " hurt their feelings " and he now fears that he may have to spend six months in jail . <p> Surely hurting someone 's feelings ca n't be illegal in Denmark , can it ? Yes , it is illegal to hurt the feelings of a " public servant " in Denmark ! <p> Penal Code 121 , in Denmark , states , " Any person who with scorn , epithets or other insult assaulting any of the 119 persons mentioned in the execution of his office or function or in respect of the same shall be punished by a fine or by imprisonment up to 6 months . " <p> The people referred to as 119 are , " public officials , the performance of the Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal way seek to prevent such person in making a lawful act of service or to force him to make an act of service . " <p> In the case of the man from Denmark who contacted me today he has decided he 'd rather leave the country than stand for this prosecution/persecution . He wanted to go to Mexico but told me he did n't currently have a passport . <p> This is why I admonish everyone , no matter where you live , to always have a current passport . You never know when you may " hurt the feelings " of a government bureaucrat and be subject to imprisonment or any myriad of other laws . In the US today almost everything is illegal . People have been imprisoned for collecting rainwater on their own property or even just trying to live off the grid or feeding homeless people ! Virtually everything can be deemed illegal in the US . <p> Besides not having a current passport this person was rapidly scanning the world map looking for a place where he can go for refuge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we have TDV Groups ( http : //tdvgroups.com TDV Groups is free with a subscription to TDV ) . It is a worldwide group of libertarian expats who are also TDV subscribers who can help fellow TDV'ers . I immediately added him to some of the TDV Groups in Mexico so he could figure out where he wants to go as he defects from Denmark . <p> The moral of the story here is : <p> 1 . Always have a passport that is current and up-to-date . Oppressive countries around the world are getting more oppressive and you never know when you may find yourself being persecuted for all manner of innocent deeds . Also , if your passport is nearing expiry , renew it earlier rather than later . With my own passports I try to renew as early as possible . That way if I get stuck in a situation where I need to use that passport and ca n't renew it , for whatever reason , I have a longer period of time by which I can find other options . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is even better . If you have a family heritage for another country contact its local embassy and ask them if you qualify to apply for citizenship based on heritage . It is NEVER easy to do but it is worth your time to try as that gives you another option should your home country deny you a passport . If you have the means ( ie. a fair amount of money , as it is not cheap ) you can look at investment citizenship options in numerous countries around the world ( TDV Passports can help with many of those ) . <p> 2 . Even if you do n't intend to expatriate it is good to be connected to a worldwide network of like-minded expatriates should you ever end up on the run from ridiculous persecution . This is something that TDV Groups can be of incredible value should you find yourself looking for somewhere to go on a moment 's notice . <p> 3 . Expect the unexpected . This person had just " insulted " some government officials . Now , while you may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not too bad " , you may feel differently when they come for you . In this person 's case he had already been wanting to defect from Denmark so imminent incarceration just prompted him to do so more quickly than he planned . <p> As we get further into The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) there will be countless dangerous situations people will be faced with as economies , financial and monetary systems collapse . Prepare for anything to happen now rather than later as it will be much more comfortable to do so while already being prepared rather than being caught off guard and being like this person looking for last minute solutions . <p> This person 's experience is minor compared to what many people will be facing in the coming months and years as TEOTMSAWKI progresses . Take the time now to get your affairs in order so if/when you find yourself having to run from a bad situation you are n't left without options . <p> trying to contact you on site and can not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following as a premium subscriber : <p> what is up with premium subscriber area ? It does n't  load anything except the title . <p> I also asked a question quite some time ago about whether there was an update to GYGOOD as it is over 1 year old . <p> I have heard from Jeff in his posts that there are tdv groups of users but when I look into locations there are no current posts or active communications that are not several years old in the places i wanted to look up . <p> No current info about places in the world to visit and live . <p> I have only been a subscriber for a few months but the offering for the cost is actually pretty slim . <p> I know you have a private Facebook group but was hoping for a more secure private group than Facebook .

Maybe there is more happening on Facebook but I do n't  like that place much . <p> All of this is too bad . TDV could be a great place to exchange info about how to " live free in an unfree world " . Moving to an entirely different country/continent is for me not the first thing I 'm considering . But the decline of the Western Empire seems to speed up by the week and then staying here may not be an option . <p> Hi Gerald , can you send me an email to mbach @ tdvmedia.com please ?

If you did anything out of order or that he did n't  like , " No soup for you ! " <p> Sadly , thanks to the upcoming Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) in the US , banks around the world are turning away US passport holders , " No bank account for you ! " But you do n't even have to do anything wrong other than having been born a US citizen . <p> Decades ago holding a US passport was a ticket to worldwide opportunity . Today it is nearly the opposite . First it started with the erosion of the US 's reputation as a bastion of freedom . Then , **29;1002;TOOLONG made it nearly impossible to do business with US persons as the nation became increasingly paranoid and fixated with raising funds . <p> Faced with draconian penalties on foreign banks who accept US citizens countless banks worldwide are deciding it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Not to mention much cheaper . <p> NO INVESTMENTS OR BROKERAGES FOR YOU EITHER <p> This has been the case for a long time in regards to investments and brokerages . The SEC has made it clear to anyone worldwide that if you even offer investment opportunities to US citizens they will come after you with the full power of the US government . The reason , they say , is to protect the fragile and gullible American citizens from losing money in foreign investment opportunities . What it really does is limits the investment options of Americans dramatically at a time when the US economy is tanking and other economies around the world have been booming . <p> One such example is at Peter Schiffs EuroPacific Capital in St. Vincents . EuroPacific has a great option you can actually hold gold with them and have an ATM card where you can withdraw fiat dollars from your gold holdings . He opened up operations there because opening it within the US would have been too difficult regulatorily ( sound familiar ? ) . But , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American clients . In fact , they go so far as to not even answer the phone if it comes from a US area code ! <p> BANKS RAPIDLY SHUTTING DOWN US CLIENTS <p> With thousands of banks in the world it is impossible to keep track of the changes taking place . But it will probably become a rule-of-thumb that international banks simply do not accept US clientsin fact , most banks we deal with at TDVOffshore do not accept US clients . <p> Most information we receive just comes from US passport holders who have recently had their accounts closed down or were denied application . The future is clear : banks are no longer accepting Americans because of FATCA . From Europe to Asia to the Caribbean the same is true . <p> The decision is simple for banking institutions . In fact , it is merely an issue of the bottom line . It is not worth it to track and report the data they are now required to under FATCA . <p> Bobby Casey , a good friend of TDV who deals with international banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meeting with bank representatives , " I asked if there were any changes to the banks policy on accepting American clients . The answer was yes . They no longer accept Americans as of March 1st , 2014 . The reason FATCA . We have another Caribbean bank we work with that has , as of February 1st , stopped accepting American clients . Just this week one of my business partners walked into a local bank in Latvia to open an account and they rejected him . Why ? He is American . " <p> OVER-LEVERAGED US BANKS <p> By hemming in Americans to keeping their money in US banks it creates a number of serious risks to their capital . <p> The US banking system is leveraged at 13-to-1 , which means that an 8% drop in asset values will destroy all US equity . It 's worse elsewhere : Japans banks are leveraged at 23 to 1 . Frances are 26 to 1 . Germany is 32 to 1 . But the US 's own Federal Reserve is by far the most over-leveraged at 53 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has bailed out the world to the tune of trillions of dollars , is more over-leveraged than many of the institutions it is supposed to help . <p> That is twice as over-leveraged as the European Union banking system , which , as you may remember , housed the Cyprus banks , which ultimately collapsed . It is no wonder why they want to keep all their money domestically ! All the easier " bail-in " when the time comes . <p> Either that or they will have to print a torrent of more money to keep the system alive leading to hyperinflation and destruction of the dollar . <p> FATCA GOES GLOBAL <p> At the same time , many nation-states all over the world are drafting legislation to put them on a par with US post-FATCA . To comfortably bank anywhere in the world is steadily becoming a thing of the past . Yesterday we reported ( " Governments Worldwide Adopting FATCA Style Legislation " ) that Russia has introduced its own FATCA style legislation . <p> It is all a nefarious form of capital controls that is descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that you cant take your money out of the country ( straight-up capital controls ) they just pressure banks around the world to not accept your citizens as clients or to report all transactions back to them like an unpaid tax collector which most banks do not want to go through the trouble to do . <p> There are still ways to internationalize your funds and protect them from the prying eyes and outstretched claws of your government but it is not looking good in the near future . As governments around the world continue to implode under record-breaking amounts of debt they will continue to take their own citizens wealth at ever-increasing levels . <p> There are still legal and viable options to protect yourself from that as I have personally done nearly a decade ago but if you still have n't begun to prepare I 'd be running not walking to do so .

Moreover , many of the people who helped Satoshi re-write the code have been open about their contribution . And in the spirit of open-source , all these individuals are " the creator of bitcoin .

After receiving an engineering degree from the California Institute of Technology , Hal became the second developer hired by the PGO Corporation , working alongside Phil Zimmerman .

I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin . I mined block 70-something , and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction , when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test . I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days , mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them . <p> He mined bitcoins with CPUs , when this was possible .

That 's when everything went wrong . <p> My body began to fail . I slurred my speech , lost strength in my hands , and my legs were slow to recover .

@@99475503 @3675503/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Open Letter to Canadian Libertarians from Walter Block <p> I begin this essay of mine , which is an attempt to promote the libertarian philosophy in Canada , with a quote from this editorial : - - " Why Canada needs more election debates- from the April 23 , 2015 edition of Macleans Magazine ; Editorial : It-s time for civic-minded organizations to start proposing all kinds of debates . Maclean-s would be happy to host the first one. - " <p> Why this insulting oversight ? Of course the main reason is that the powers that be ( Macleans , other major media ) are not exactly in sympathy with the libertarian philosophy . But another cause is that high profile libertarians in Canada , and yes , yes , there are many , simply do not run for office on the Libertarian Party ticket . So I ask you , I plead with you , please contact the Canadian Libertarian Party and offer to run for Parliament in the next election- ( If you are an untenured assistant professor , and reasonably expect doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course do not do this ! Ditto for those who would lose their jobs in any of Canada-s supposedly free market think tanks ) . - Editors Note : You can apply to become a candidate for the party in just a few minutes here- and no action beyond that is needed from you until September <p> This insult , and insult it was , simply could not occur in the U.S. There , of course , the Libertarian Party is much stronger than in Canada , and can not as easily be totally ignored . True , libertarianism in the U.S. has been fueled by the Ron Paul phenomenon . ( Rand Paul , too , is keeping the flame alive. ) - Yes , Ron Paul garnered most of his popularity by running for president on the Republican ticket , but he did so for the Libertarian Party as well , in 1984 . There is no such phenomenon in Canada at present , unfortunately . But , there wasn-t always one in the U.S. either . It always has to start somewhere . If not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not be an arduous task . A paper candidacy , where you do absolutely nothing but lend your name for this purpose , is better than leaving any ridings completely uncovered. - Of course , the more you do in this regard the better for promoting liberty , and running for MP will give you a megaphone otherwise unavailable to you . Murray N. Rothbard , Mr. Libertarian , used to say that the average guy was mainly interested in beer , pizza and bowling ( substitution for Canada : hockey ) most of the time . But , whenever there was a national election , this man in the street could sometimes become interested in politics at least for a brief moment , and that we could best acquaint him with our philosophy on these occasions . No truer words were ever uttered . <p> Of course , of course , politics is far from the only way to promote our beloved libertarian philosophy . There are many other roads to this end . But , the political system is surely one of them . Ron Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to our camp than any other person now living , and he did it all though the ballot box ; I rest my case if anyone really doubts that political action , too , can promote liberty ; hey , the first step , surely , is to announce that we-re here and not going away . <p> There are some highly credentialed libertarians who believe voting , let alone running for office , is incompatible with our perspective. - They are entirely wrong , if libertarianism is defined as adherence to the non-aggression principle ( NAP ) . Is voting a per se violation of the NAP ? Of course not . Is running for office and losing , necessarily an uninvited border crossing onto someone else-s person or property ? Of course not . Is winning and actually taking office incompatible , if the MP becomes a Dr. No like Ron Paul and votes against every bill incompatible with our philosophy ? It is really difficult to see how this can be the case . <p> But , do we not give - " sanction- " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No more so than when we use a government road , its post office , carry its currency in our wallets , visit a public park or museum , go to a public school , etc . This applies even to those of us who eat food , wear clothing , live in housing , etc. , since the omnipresent state is involved in all of those things. - My book on Ron Paul is almost entirely devoted to making the case that politics and libertarianism , correctly understood , are not logically incompatible . <p> So , please , Canadians , if you value liberty at all , seriously consider running for office on the Libertarian Party ticket . <p> Speaking of other roads to liberty in Canada , I am myself involved in several libertarian gatherings , conferences , seminars , etc. , in the next few weeks and months . I would dearly love for you to join me in any of them you can . <p> As you can see , I-m a pretty busy boy , trying to promote liberty and good ( Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a launching pad for these efforts the fact that I have a Ph.D . and am a college professor . Most libertarians can not rely on such a background . BUT ANY CITIZEN OF CANADA CAN RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE IN THAT COUNTRY .

Presumably they 're not talking about the content <p> Jeff Berwick <p> Haha , yes , we have just switched over to a new redesigned site today and on mobile phones we get that error , it is being fixed now . = <p> Ron Paul ran on the Libertarian ticket in 1988 , not 1984 . Other than that , great article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream party on a Libertarian platform a la Ron Paul ? <p> Freewilly <p> Greetings , <p> While I agree with the Libertarian points made by Mr Block such as , limited government , private property rights , legalized victimless crimes and non intervenionist forereign policy . I have a bit of confusion assocaited with the contention that taxes are theft . Now please allow me to provide a brief example , before beating with a wet noodle , and correct me where the example breaks down . Let 's say that myself and nine associates come up with this brainy idea to open greenhouses in the near abandoned town of Ocean Falls , BC . Since there is an excellent available water source to provide irrigation and power for heating the greenhouses and powering business and homes . So , to pay for the investment in water and power we incorporate , or not , create a water advisory board and charge taxes to pay for this common resource . How is this theft ? Does an independent body have to own the resource and then charge everyone , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in agreement with Libertarian principles ? I am thinking that if Walter and Jeff came to Ocean Falls to open a needed hotel , they would run away in horror , because the water and power system is paid for through taxation and the only cure is to privatize . I await the flogging . <p> You can solve the problem by finding someone with enough money to purchase the resource . However , it sounds like you discovered an unowned resource , in which case you can describe its boundaries and claim that its yours.If you take into account the effects you 'll have on those downstream then you 'll have a better chance of having others respect your claim . Perhaps you can include some maintenance of the amount and purity of the water that leaves your claim . You 're talking about home-grown water rights here , something traditionally ( unfortunately ) monopolized by organized crime groups that enjoy public sanction for their use of violence ( aka " governments " ) . If you do a good job , your efforts might be a model that peaceful people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Libertarian principles " everywhere will copy ! <p> You can solve your problem in other ways too , but if you want to be " morally acceptable and in agreement with Libertarian principles " then you have to avoid taxes . When you cant find a moral solution to a problem you have encountered , your duty is to keep looking or just accept the problem and suffer from it . It is not acceptable to decide that morality is no longer important . <p> gordon claycomb <p> Hey Waltergood thinking.Jeff B.has a strong tendency to dismiss old guys like myself ( 78 ) ; however , I read Atlas Shrugged &amp; The Fountainhead when they both came out ( 1957/1958 ) and was passing out jury nullification pamphlets when he was only 10 years old .

@@99475505 @3675505/ <p> One could make a case for all of them , given the likelihood of high inflation and the mainstream largely ignoring the industry . <p> But there 's one metal in particular that I think will deliver the most fireworks <p> Why The Silver Price Could Double Or Even Triple <p> Silver is selling at less than half its 2011 high , is ignored more than gold , and as you 'll see , has explosive fundamentals that point to a possible runaway price scenario . <p> To assess silvers potential , let 's first ignore short-term factors that you might see in mainstream headlines , such as net short/long positions , fluctuations in weekly ETF holdings , or the latest open interest . Data like these fluctuate regularly and rarely have long-term bearing on the price . <p> Let 's instead consider the big-picture forces that could impact silver over the next several years . Here are the data that tell me " there 's a pile of money sitting in the corner " <p> #1 : Monetary Abuse . The most significant catalyst for silver is the governments abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money printing and unsustainable debt , silver ( like gold ) represents a wealth protection against systemic risk . <p> At no time in history has a government printed this much money . And not one currency in the world is anchored to gold or any other tangible standard . This unprecedented setup means that whatever fallout results , it will be historic and affect each of us personally . Silver will be one refuge from that stormand given its higher volatility , could rise more than gold . <p> #2 : Inflation-Adjusted Price Has a Long Way to Go . One specific indicator of silvers potential is its inflation-adjusted price . I asked John Williams of ShadowStats to calculate the silver price in May 2014 dollars ( current data are not yet available ) . <p> Shown below is the silver price adjusted for both the CPI-U , as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ; and for ShadowStats data based on the CPI-U formula from 1980 ( the formula has since been adjusted multiple times to keep the inflation number as low as possible ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inflation-adjusted price of January 1980 , based on the current CPI-U calculation . If we use the 1980 formula to measure inflation , silver would need to top $470 to beat that peak . <p> I 'm not counting on silver going that high ( at least I hope not , because I think there will be literal blood in the streets if it does ) . But clearly , the odds are skewed to the upsideand there 's a lot of room to run . <p> #3 : Tight Production Margins . Producers have been forced to reduce costs in light of last years crash in the silver price . Some have done a better job at this than others , but look how far margins have fallen . <p> Relative to the cost of production , the silver price is at its lowest level since 2005 . Keep in mind that cash costs are only a portion of all-in expenses , and that the silver price has historically traded well above this figure ( all-in costs are just now being widely reported ) . That margins have tightened so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry . It also makes it likely that prices have bottomed , since producers can only cut expenses so much . <p> Although roughly 75% of silver is produced as a byproduct , prices are determined at the margin ; if a mine ca n't operate profitably or a new project wont earn a profit at current prices , output would fall . Further , much of the current cost-cutting has come from reduced exploration budgets , which will curtail future supply . Sooner or later this supply deficit will serve as a catalyst for higher prices . <p> #4 : Low Inventories . Various entities hold inventories of silver bullion , which were high when US coinage contained silver . As all US coins intended for circulation have been minted from base metals for decades , the need for high inventories is thus lower today . But this chart shows that little is available . <p> You can see how low current inventories are on a historical basis , most of which is held in exchange-traded products ( ETPs ) . This is important because these investors have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the market . The remaining amount of inventory is 241 million ounces , only 25% of one years supplywhereas in 1990 it represented roughly eight times supply . If demand were to suddenly surge , those needs could not be met by existing inventories . In fact , ETP investors would likely take more metal off the market . ( The " implied unreported stocks " refers to private and other unreported depositories around the world , a number that also has shrunk strikingly . ) <p> If investment demand were to repeat the surge it saw from 2005 to 2009 , it would leave little room for error on the supply side . <p> #5 : Conclusion of the Bear Market . This snapshot of six decades of bear markets signals that ours is near exhaustion . The yellow line represents silvers price action from April 2011 through July 11 , 2014 . <p> The historical record suggests that buying silver now is a low-risk investment . <p> #6 : Cheap Compared to Other Commodities . here 's how the silver price compares to other precious metals , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is further away from its all-time high than silver . <p> #7 : Low Mainstream Participation . Another indicator of silvers potential is how much it represents of global financial wealth , compared to its percentage when silver hit $50 in 1980 . <p> In spite of ongoing strong demand for physical metal , silver currently represents only 0.01% of the worlds financial wealth . This is one-twenty-fifth its 1980 level . Even that big price spike we saw in 2011 pales in comparison . <p> There 's an enormous amount of room for silver to become a greater part of the mainstream investment community . <p> #8 : Watch Out For China ! Its not just gold that is moving from West to East <p> Do n't  look now , but the SHFE has overtaken the Comex and become the worlds largest futures silver exchange . In fact , the SHFE accounted for 48.6% of all volume last year . The Comex , meanwhile , is in sharp decline , falling from 93.4% market share as recently as 2001 to less than half that amount today . <p> There 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-time high and exceed 250 million ounces this year ( between mine production , imports , and scrap ) . By comparison , it was less than 70 million ounces in 2000 . However , virtually none of this is exported and is thus unavailable to the world market . <p> Chinese investors are estimated to have purchased 22 million ounces of silver in 2013 , the second-largest amount behind India . It was zero in 1999 . <p> The biggest percentage growth in silver applications comes from China . Photography , jewelry , silverware , electronics , batteries , solar panels , brazing alloys , and biocides uses are all growing at a faster clip in China than any other country in the world . <p> Walk over to the Corner <p> Based on this review of big-picture data , what conclusion would you draw ? If you 're like the Hard Assets Alliance team and me , you 're forced to acknowledge that the next few years could be a very exciting time for silver investors . <p> I say its time to walk over to silvers corner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hard Assets Alliance can helptheir intuitive online trading platform let 's you buy , store and sell precious metals with the ease and liquidity of an ETF , they offer ultra-competitive pricing , and you can chose to take delivery or store in any of their six non-bank domestic and international vaulting locations . <p> Jeff Clark utilizes his knowledge of the gold mining industry , a family legacy , from prospecting and exploration to the financial and capital markets to produce Casey Researchs BIG GOLD investment newsletter .

By the time Kurt had become an American icon in 1991 , he was thinking of leaving the limelight and expatriating . He liked how other cultures did n't ask him for autographs like Americans did . The tabloid nature of media in the US , also , was too much for him . <p> His band had changed music 's culture . Punk rock went mainstream when Nirvana went mainstream . In the band 's video for their seminal hit " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " cheerleaders wear uniforms with the Anarchy " A " symbol on them . And this video was in constant rotation on MTV and around the world . <p> The events surrounding his death are murky . What most people do n't know is there were two investigations of his reported ' suicide . ' One by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you guess which one has been more fruitful ? If you read this article , and delve a bit deeper , you 'll find out the answer to that question . <p> Kurt left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey California on April 1st , 1994 . He was reported missing not long after , only to be found dead seven days later , on April 8th . <p> Tom Grant is a California state licensed private investigator and former detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department . He was hired April 3rd , 1994 , by Courtney Love to locate Kurt . While Tom went to Seattle to find Kurt , Courtney stayed in Los Angeles . From the moment Tom met Courtney , he began recording all of their conversations . Something seemed off about her to Tom . The very first thing she told him was a lie . ( Tom had no idea who Courtney Love or Kurt Cobain were when he was hired . ) <p> Although the police immediately concluded " suicide " , Grant was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days at this point , and had investigated the circumstances surrounding him in detail by that time . Tom Grant learned quickly after Kurt 's death that Rosemary Carroll , Courtney Love and Kurt 's own entertainment attorney , also did not buy the suicide theory . Not only did Courtney Love 's own private investigator conclude Courtney was implicated in the murder of Kurt , but so too had her own attorney , though the latter has done a good job of keeping her mouth shut after some initial recorded skepticism . <p> From the very beginning Tom recognized Courtney was a habitual liar . After several months of intensive investigation , Tom concluded that Courtney Love and Michael Dewitt , the Cobain 's live-in male nanny , who Courtney had known personally for some time , were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in Kurt 's murder . Tom was n't positive at first . He figured Kurt had probably killed himself , but he could n't help notice things did n't make sense , and that the Seattle Police Department 's investigation was lackluster at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally willing to speak out publicly . He believed he had investigated thoroughly enough . It took Tom seven months to conclude there had been a " conspiracy . " The police concluded suicide after five minutes . What did Tom have to gain by speaking the truth ? Not much . He was accusing his own client of murder . He could have gone to jail for doing that , not to mention the lawsuits , and the fate of his own PI firm . Ultimately , he chose to speak out , and thanks to him a trove of information has been made available . Many years later , it came out that this was n't the first attempt on Cobain 's life . It was merely the first to succeed . <p> The fact is Kurt was looking to divorce Courtney and to leave Seattle . He mentioned in interviews he wanted to expatriate , he simply " did n't want to live in the United States . " He had begun the process to change his will as he wanted Courtney taken out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " meanest , most vicious divorce attorney around . " <p> Tom points to numerous unanswered questions , such as who was using Kurt 's credit card after he is known to have been dead ? Someone was attempting to use it , but these attempts stopped when the body was found . The police also claim there were no legible fingerprints on the shotgun found on scene ! In fact , the Seattle Police Department did not even check the gun until May 6th , one month after Kurt was found . How 's that for shoddy police work ? <p> " Any publicity is good publicity , " Courtney told Tom , before Kurt had even been found , as she trumpeted over-and-over again how suicidal Kurt was . In his investigation , Tom would find Courtney was really the only one who seemed to think Kurt was suicidal . Even Kurt 's own best friend , before Kurt 's body was found , told Tom Kurt was in good spirits . Tom found it suspicious how obsessed Courtney was with her own career in the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one parading how suicidal Kurt was . <p> The police immediately determined the note was a " suicide note " written to Courtney and Kurt 's daughter , Frances Bean . But the note was not addressed to Kurt 's wife and daughter , nor does it say anything about " killing himself " . The note is clearly written to Cobain 's fans about his quitting the music business . <p> In fact , it later came out in an interview that Courtney had kept a second note private . It is a crime , mind you , to keep evidence from police . ( She read the public " suicide " note aloud to adoring fans over radio ) She did n't tell anyone about the second note until it slipped out in a Rolling Stone interview , which Tom read as part of his investigation of her . The second note clearly defines the first note . Kurt 's leaving Seattle and the music business . There 's no mention in either that he is leaving the planet . The public suicide note reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Handwriting experts say that it is inconclusive if Kurt wrote the entire note . If you look at the bottom of the note below , you 'll see the section in question . <p> Moreover , Cobain was injected with three times the lethal dose of heroin . Tom Grant wonders , IF Cobain injected three times the lethal dose of heroin , COULD he then pick up a shotgun and shoot himself ? He also notes most heroin addicts agree : they would n't kill themselves while they were riding a high . It would be too euphoric . <p> As Tom Grant writes on his website : <p> " THE FACT IS The police and the Medical Examiner have no forensic evidence that proves Cobain 's death was a suicide . On the other hand , there 's a substantial amount of evidence for murder . " <p> Almost immediately after Kurt 's death , Tom spoke with Courtney 's entertainment lawyer , Rosemary Carroll , who indicated that she was suspicious about Courtney 's involvement in Kurt 's death . " He was n't suicidal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deep sigh to Tom . Rosemary was also disturbed that Courtney would n't let her or anyone else see the so-called " suicide note . " Tom mentioned to Rosemary that Courtney could n't come to Seattle to find her husband because she " had business in LA . " <p> " She did n't have any business in LA ! " Rosemary snapped . On April 15th Tom met with the police , one week after Cobain 's body was found . He brought up his numerous concerns : <p> " Numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in logic <p> The missing credit card and continued activity on the card after Kurt 's death <p> The fact that Courtney specifically told Dylan ( Kurt 's best friend ) to check the greenhouse where Kurt 's body was found and yet he did n't even tell Tom about the greenhouse when they visited the Cobain home the night before Kurt was found <p> Doubts about Kurt 's handwriting on the so-called " suicide note , " especially the bottom portion <p> The electrician 's statement ( person who found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed <p> Courtney 's motives for possible involvement in Cobain 's death ? <p> She 'd get more money from a suicide than from a divorce . With a suicide , Courtney would inherit and control the entire Cobain and Nirvana estate . If Kurt divorced her , she 'd have to settle for half , at best , of Kurt 's assets <p> Kurt 's record sales would increase , leaving Courtney with even more income <p> And finally , based on what I 'd learned about her personality , Kurt 's death and the publicity it generated would help Courtney launch her own career . " <p> Tom continued his investigation . He studied media material and found lots of planted stories and misinformation . As Tom writes , " One story had Courtney grieving at home , while she was actually calling me from Canyon Ranch in Arizona and bragging to me that she was sleeping with Billy Corgan . This was only three weeks after Kurt died ! " Tom eventually sent Courtney a letter indicating his suspicions about Kurt 's death . <p> " Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my investigation has been somewhat more active than you might have been aware of . The purpose of this letter is to clarify my position regarding our working relationship . <p> You may recall our trip to Carnation on Thursday , April 14th . I mentioned during the drive that I was beginning to turn over some " rocks " that I was n't sure you 'd want turned over . I asked you if you wanted me to continue digging . Kat , who was in the back seat , said , " Oh yeah , she wants to know everything . " You responded , " Yeah Tom , do what ever it takes . I want to know everything that happened . " Your instructions were clear , so in the days and weeks that followed , I proceeded to " do whatever it takes . " <p> As the investigation continued , my attempts to get at the truth often seemed to be deliberately hindered . While reading some of the articles being written in newspapers and magazines , I discovered the information being released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I consider the circumstances surrounding your husband 's death to be highly suspicious . My investigation has exposed a number of inconsistencies in the facts of this case as well as many contradictions in sound logic and common sense . I 'm required to report findings such as these to the police , so on Friday , April 15th , I spoke with Sgt. Cameron about some of what I 've learned so far . <p> As I 've experienced in past cases , police detectives do n't often welcome the work of outside investigators . I 've learned it 's somewhat idealistic and naive to think the truth might be more important than professional pride . <p> I 've decided to continue working on this case until I see it to its conclusion , without additional charge . Attached you will find an invoice which accounts for the charges billed for our services , including time and expenses . As you can see , prior to my return to Seattle on April 13th , these charges exceeded the retainer amount . However , please consider your bill paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As I pursue the truth regarding the events surrounding your husband 's death , your cooperation and assistance will be appreciated , but not required . <p> Sincerely , <p> Tom Grant <p> THE GRANT COMPANY " <p> From there it only gets more interesting . Courtney kept Tom Grant on her payroll , giving her meaningless assignments for him to pursue . As soon as he finished one , she 'd give him another . The live-in nanny , Michael DeWitt , whom Tom implicates in Kurt 's death , has never been available for an interview , even though both Michael and Tom live in LA . Tom has tried to interview Michael , the only person at the Cobain home around the time of Kurt 's death , to no avail . Moreover , Michael received $30,000 from Courtney in the weeks after Kurt 's death " to go to rehab . " Tom could n't help but wonder if this was the payoff . <p> The April 1996 edition of High Times featured an article entitled " Who Killed Kurt Cobain ? " . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duce " are made public . El Duce played in the Los Angeles punk scene . He met Courtney Love in the late 1980s . In the article , El Duce claimed that in December 1993 , Courtney Love offered El Duce $50,000 to murder Kurt . The manager of the shop , where the conversation took place , remembers overhearing Courtney ask El Duce , " Can you handle doing this ? Can you get this done ? What do you want for it ? " <p> In March 1994 , according to the manager , Courtney contacted the shop asking for El Duce , who was out on tour at the time . Courtney was furious . " That son of a bitch , we made an agreement . What am I going to do ? " The manager went on to say after Kurt was found dead about 10 days later : " I was like Whoa ! I wonder if she actually did pay some sucker to blow off his head " ? El Duce said : " Maybe she got somebody else . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had to have him whacked right away so she could get the money . " <p> Tom Grant was skeptical of El Duce 's claims . He said : " Why did n't they come forward sooner ? At first I thought maybe Courtney put them up to it to set me up . I could start talking about these guys as proof and then they would come out and say they made the whole story up . I would then be discredited . " <p> On March 6th 1996 , however , El Duce underwent and passed a lie detector test administered by Dr. E. Gelb a leading polygraph examiner , who trains the FBI in polygraph . He administered a polygraph test to O.J. Simpson two days after the murder of his wife and said that O.J. failed the test quite badly . According to Dr. Gelb , El Duce 's story is completely truthful . <p> In reply to the question , " Did Courtney Love ask you to kill Kurt Cobain ? " Duce 's positive response showed a 99.91% certainty that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of deception " . Duce also scores the same when the question was repeated . When asked the question " Were you offered $50,000 by Courtney Love to kill Kurt Cobain ? " Duce scored a slightly worse 99.84% . <p> Following these tests Duce contacted the Seattle Police Departments Homicide division and also the Los Angeles Police Dept . He and the record shop owner have offered to take similar tests for the police , but both departments have declined to investigate . Of course , Tom Grant , the private sector hero in all of this , did investigate . However , about a week after El Duce did an interview with BBC , he was killed by a train in Riverside , LA . The events surrounding his death are murky . <p> Music journalist and friend of Duce , Al Bowman said : " There is something very , very strange about his death . Anybody who knew El knew that you could make friends with him by offering to buy him a drink . He had a problem with alcohol . " When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . He was all excited about his upcoming tour . He was in good spirits . He did n't kill himself . I 'm convinced this has something to do with Kurt Cobain . " <p> The fact of the matter is this . There are myriad more details about the death surrounding the US 's last great rock star than public police officers would like you to believe . And this means that a psychopathic murderer has been an American celebrity for the last twenty years ( surprised ? should n't be ) Instead , the private investigator hired by Courtney Love ultimately concluded just months after Kurt 's death that Courtney and the Cobain 's live-in nanny had conspired to murder Kurt Cobain . <p> He pledged to continue the investigation and let his doubts be known . Why ? Because , as a grandfather , Tom could n't stand the realities of the nearly more than 60 confirmed " copycat " suicides . He did n't want to do it , he " just had to . " In fact , Tom has noted how embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wished it was because he was a professional athlete or something else instead . <p> The public police officers , on the other hand , have no reason to solve the crime . Their jobs are safe . Apparently they also have no moral motivation to do so either . As Tom notes in an interview , oftentimes after prisoners on death row are acquitted based on DNA evidence , the original police investigators stick by their guns : their conclusion was right . " It 's just politics , " Tom says . <p> Why does this matter ? Well , it is pretty obvious the police did n't even really investigate this death , and it is quite obvious there are gaping holes in the official narrative of Kurt 's " suicide . " Tom Grant does n't argue for a coverup within the Seattle Police Department , though he does note that Courtney Love was friends with the coroner at the time in Seattle . About two weeks ago , leading up to the twentieth anniversary of Kurt 's death , the Seattle Police " re-examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no new evidence , " which is essentially a lie , since there is new evidence since the case was originally closed , uncovered by the free market . I imagine SPD did this in order to steer the dialogue away from Tom Grant 's narrative . The police department says once-a-week they receive a request to re-open the investigation . <p> One argument for a large government is so the police can keep us safe , but as this story uncovers , the police fail to do so , allowing possible murderers continue living their lives unhindered . The free market , in this case Tom Grant 's PI Firm , has alternatively sought justice , and the investigation continues to this day . Here is an interview with Tom : <p> Whoa ! This is way interesting and has captured my imagination , a 60s something citizen am I who never listened to this music .

How this could affect you today is illustrated poignantly in the following example . <p> Rapper/DJ Michael " mikeflo " Flowers has claimed he was removed from an Alaska Airlines ( a Delta Air Lines partner ) flight last summer because airline employees felt " uncomfortable " due to Mike 's tattoos on his face . Although Mike had a prior relationship with the airline , flying thousands of miles with them , he was still forbidden from flying . At the time of press , the airline had yet to make a comment regarding Mikeflo 's inconvenience . <p> Mikeflo planned to travel from Seattle , Washington to Portland , Oregon on July 14th for a performance , but , according to dead prez affiliates , a flight attendant told an unaccompanied child passenger next to Mike , " I do n't trust the guy with the tattoos so I am going to move your seat . " <p> Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit the plane by another member of the flight crew . He was told the attendant 's were concerned he would not comply with FAA rules . <p> " I was stunned and humiliated , " said mikeflo . " I am a platinum medallion with Delta and I fly thousands of miles a year . I feel like they violated my freedom of expression . " Mikeflo has consulted with legal representation and will likely sue . Another option , of course , is to boycott the airline . <p> " Mr. Flowers has religious and cultural tattoos on his face as an expression of his spiritual beliefs , " said his attorney Mawuli Mel Davis . " We are investigating the incident and considering all legal options . " <p> Mikeflo has launched the #itsartnotacrime social media campaign calling for fair treatment of all passengers by Alaska Airlines . Mikeflo is a member of the rap group Dead Prez , who have released such songs as , " Police State " and " Propaganda " : <p> A close personal friend of Dead Prez had this to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( &amp; Stic &amp; M1 ) from DeadPrez . In fact , I picked them up from the Portland airport the day this happened . Here , briefly , are a couple of my thoughts on this incident : <p> The Mike Flowers ( MikeFlo ) I know is an intelligent , gentle , talented , soft-spoken artist &amp; human being . Even though he was more than a little outraged by what had happened , he never raised his voice when he explained to me what happened . He even tried to consider ( rather charitably , I thought ) how this might have been a simple misunderstanding , rather than something more sinister . The idea that there is anything " threatening " about Mike is almost laughable . In addition to the decent and sensitive affect that Mike radiates , his tattoos are quite overtly cultural , religious &amp; political . They are not " violent " &amp; they certainly not " gang tattoos " . A person would have to be excessively ignorant or bigoted ( or both ) in order not to realize this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike was a high school music teacher at a prestigious private school in Atlanta hardly the resume of a threat to air safety ! <p> The fact that something like this can , and did happen is appalling . That there has n't  been some action to rectify this on the part of the airline is beyond appalling . Mikes account of this is not hyperbole , this really did happen . It was profoundly unjust act and whether it was racism , classism , or some other combination of bigotry , it is quite upsetting . The fact that a decent &amp; thoughtful artist is not allowed to practice peaceful &amp; artistic expressions simply because they make an ignorant person uncomfortable is not right . <p> For TDV , this does n't come as a surprise , and that 's why we are working with many of our readers and other clients on internationalizing their assets : so that , worst case scenario , if they ever find themselves unable to fly or even on a ' no fly list ' , they need not worry about their assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference .

And , to relieve the stress you will face , be sure to have another sort of homegrown on hand <p> It will likely over the coming years grow increasingly difficult for US citizens to fly without being harassed by TSA agents or flight attendants or men and women in uniforms of any kind ( not my type ) . TDV editor Redmond Weissenberger recently related a story to me in which his sister was not allowed to travel abroad because her passport had become too worn . The US makes this perfectly clear : if your passport is worn , you might not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've championed for many years getting out of dodge , and living a free life abroad . Maybe it is time for Mikeflo to consider doing the same . <p> As for you , if you really think that you can get out of the US now , no problem and every time , you are behind the times . Unfortunately , the future is upon those of you still in the US , and it might be smart to use your passport and fly from time-to-time , solely for the purpose of discovering if you still can , if you plan to stay there for much longer . <p> Next thing you 'll know , it just wo n't be face tattoos and Islam that disallow you from flying , but unpaid taxes , debts and criminal records ( do you enjoy plants ? ) just the same . <p> Good luck in there . <p> Do what you can to stay free .

In general , SWIFT provides a secure communication network for more than ten thousands of financial institutions around the world , approving transactions of trillions of US dollars . <p> Earlier this month Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov expressed confidence that Russia would not be disconnected from SWIFT .

@@99475512 @3675512/ <p> With all due respect to Mr. Twain , he did not extend the thought far enough government statistics trump all lies . But then again , the governments role as both preeminent statistical gatherer and manipulator is a phenomenon more applicable to our time . Today , various US bureaus and agencies monkey with every key macroeconomic indicator , most notably inflation , production ( Gross Domestic Product ) , and unemployment . To wit : <p> Inflation <p> Since the early 1980s , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) has engineered a lower " inflation " rate in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) with such maneuvers as : <p> Replacing items in the basket of goods measured with lower-price items ( " substitution " ) ; <p> Decreasing the impact of rising prices by any particular good within the basket ( " geometric weighting " ) ; and <p> Changing how rents are measured ( " imputation " ) . <p> The results ? According to ShadowStats , which calculates inflation with the previous CPI methodology , inflation has been understated by five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domestic Product <p> GDP , to the extent it is relevant at all , must be assessed in real terms ( discounting the effects of inflation ) . Otherwise , how else could you discern economic growth from a mere rise in prices ? Therefore economists " deflate " GDP statistics by the rate of inflation to determine real changes in economic output . Curiously , instead of utilizing the CPI in such calculations , the government utilizes a different price index entitled Personal Consumption Expenditures ( PCE ) . Why ? As the PCE index is chronically lower than the CPI , real economic growth appears higher than if the CPI was used . Not content with just this trick , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( there are a number of US agencies which compile economic statistics ) rolled out new guidelines for GDP calculation on July 31 , 2013 : henceforth , expenses paid for research &amp; development will be included to " capture " the benefits of intangible assets . GDP jumped 2.7% with the addition ( every little bit helps ) and future growth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As of October 2013 , unemployment stood at 7.3% . Notwithstanding the previous months rate of 7.2% , this represented its lowest level since December 2008 ( 7.3% ) which appears an impressive rebound given its peak of 10.0% ( October 2009 ) . But the Labor Participation Rate , the statistic which measures the actively employed percentage of an economys work force , stands at a mere 62.8% ( October ) a level not observed since 1978 . The discrepancy ? Literally millions of discouraged unemployed workers having ceased looking for work . In BLS calculations , if you do not have a job , you are unemployed . But if you have been looking for years and have become so disillusioned as to end your efforts , you are no longer unemployed but you still do not have a job . <p> We understand that many areas of the economy can not be measured with any precision .

How could this happen ? I did not receive any notice in the monthly energy bill ; no letter , nothing . The smart meter just appeared . <p> The next day , Monica ( my wife ) and I researched ways to protect ourselves from being spied upon and forced to have unwanted radiation spewed into our home . In that effort to defend our safety , health , and privacy we sent SWEPCO/AEP ( the power company ) a demand notice giving them 30 days to remove the smart meter , and replace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWEPCO/AEP received the notice they sent a young man to our home attempting to calm the crazy people . To them , obviously we were crazy and needed to be fed the companies talking points of how safe , secure , efficient , blah blah blah , and how they do not retain or gather personal information . After I escorted the robot to the door , he let me know that they will not change the meter and if we do so then the power to our house will be cut off . <p> 30 days expired and our default notice was immediately sent . To summarize the default notice , it made clear that we have never and do not ever intend to steal power , reminding them we had never being late paying our bill , among many other legalities , including informing them that a licensed electrician was going to replace our meter . <p> We sent the electric monopoly their meter back . Several days later my wife called explaining that SWEPCO/AEP had cut the power to our house without any formal notification . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1895 Victorian home off the small town square of Marshall , Texas , was dark . The darkness appeared to be a hole in the town inviting any thug , thief , vandal , or the like to come on in . There is nobody home here and certainly no operating alarm system . <p> Today was the first full day of no electricity , which means no hot water , our food will ruin in the freezers , and now the lack of light invites malcontents . All this evil occurred because we simply wished to protect ourselves from unwarranted and unlawful meters . <p> The local officials in government talked to the monopoly and their talking points worked well . The Mayor said , " Well Kevin , they said the meters are n't  smart meters and they 're safe . " So that 's the end of the help from the government here in happy roll over sleepy town Marshall , Texas , zombie land . <p> After sending the government the manufacturers website , which details how these meters are of the smart variety , the local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything . <p> These officials can ticket me , fine me for all sorts of reasons , give monopolies permission to radiate and invade my privacy . However , they cant , rather will not , re-enforce a citizens right to protect him/her self by opting out of having a dangerous spy attached to the citizen 's home . <p> So for now , we wait on unreturned phoned calls from every politician including Ted Cruz . Although US Senator John Cornyns office actually answered the phone telling me bluntly , " Our office ca n't get involved with anything like this . This matter is of a personal nature between a private person and another business . Unfortunately we cant help . " I think my tone was less than polite when I responded with something not suited for repeating even in this article . <p> Luckily we have wonderful family that has taken us in like wet puppies out of the cold .

The European Union is on board , pledging $700 billion to implementing the same in Europe . Smart meters are meant to " a ) save energy and thus the environment , b ) to increase power reliability and c ) to give you more control of energy use in your own home .

Symptoms include headaches , sleeping problems , ringing of the ears , problems focusing , fatigue , heart palpitations , nausea and statistically high recurrences of cancer . Courts and independent testing have uncovered that meters are transmitting between 10,000 to 190,000 pulsed microwaves a day . Moreover , data can be gathered about your habits via the smart meters , making them handy for surveillance . Today privacy is a vestige . <p> There might be some reprieve coming for Kevin and other Texans , though . At least for Austin , Texas residents , so far , a new opt-out program allows people to pay a fee in order to opt-out . One utility company in Austin charges $75 to opt out of the smart meters .

@@99475517 @3675517/ <h> Can Central Banks Go Bankrupt ? <p> A TDV subscriber forwarded us an article that said the Federal Reserve was dangerously close to going " bankrupt , " stating , " In direct figures , the Fed has $4.485 trillion in assets , but a whopping $4.428 trillion in liabilities , leaving only $57 billion , or about 1.28% " . <p> The article stated that , " if the value of the Feds assets drops by more than 1.28% , the Fed will be bankrupt . " It went on to paint a conundrum wherein if the government relies on the Fed , and the Fed goes bankrupt , who will bail whom out ? <p> Before we begin to show the trouble with this circular logic let us first preface that central banks are intentionally set-up to be incredibly confusing . Hardly anyone really understands how they work and Alan Greenspan even coined the term " Fed Speak " where he said that he would talk to Congress in plain gibberish because their goal was for no one to really understand what they do . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Henry Ford said , " there would be a revolution tomorrow " . <p> Analysts who understand what they do in detail are few and far between and include people like Jim Grant , Robert Murphy and TDV 's Senior Analyst , Ed Bugos . <p> Murray Rothbard ( 1926-95 ) , a Misesian successor in the Austrian School , speech writer for many Libertarian presidential candidates , author of many books about the Federal Reserve System ( and the evils of fractional reserve banking ) , and inspiration to Ron Paul , said this in his 1994 book , " The Case Against the Fed , " <p> " The Fed is in the rare and enviable position of having its liabilities in the form of Federal Reserve Notes constitute the legal tender of the country . In short , its liabilitiesFederal Reserve Notes are standard money . Moreover , its other form of liability demand depositsare redeemable by deposit-holders ( i.e. , banks , who constitute the depositors , or " customers , " of the Fed ) in these Notes , which , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gold standard , it is impossible for the Federal Reserve to go bankrupt ; it holds the legal monopoly of counterfeiting ( of creating money out of thin air ) in the entire country . The American banking system now comprises two sets of inverted pyramids , the commercial banks pyramiding loans and deposits on top of the base of reserves , which are mainly their demand deposits at the Federal Reserve . The Federal Reserve itself determines its own liabilities very simply : by buying or selling assets , which in turn increases or decreases bank reserves by the same amount . At the base of the Fed pyramid , and therefore of the bank system 's creation of " money " in the sense of deposits , is the Fed 's power to print legal tender money . But the Fed tries its best not to print cash but rather to " print " or create demand deposits , checking deposits , out of thin air , since its demand deposits constitute the reserves on top of which the commercial banks can pyramid a multiple creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I even admit that I do n't understand every detail of what the Federal Reserve does because a ) I do n't need to understand all the details to know it is a fraudulent system and b ) It 's not really that important to understand the fine details of what this criminal enterprise does once you realize all they really do are two acts that are illegal for anyone else i.e. , counterfeiting money ( quantitative easing ) and price-fix/manipulate the interest rate . <p> I 'll get into it further why the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet is unimportant in the grand scheme of things but the more we do understand things like this the more we can understand what is going on . <p> WHY CENTRAL BANKS DO N'T GO BANKRUPT <p> First , let 's look at the definition of bankruptcy : " Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or other entity that can not repay the debts it owes to creditors . " <p> So , the first question to ask is , what debts does the Federal Reserve " owe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , <p> " Demand deposits held by the commercial banks , which constitute the reserves of those banks ; and Federal Reserve Notes , cash emitted by the Fed . The Fed is in the rare and enviable position of having its liabilities in the form of Federal Reserve Notes constitute the legal tender of the country . In short , its liabilitiesFederal Reserve Notes are standard money . Moreover , its other form of liability demand depositsare redeemable by deposit-holders ( i.e. , banks , who constitute the depositors , or " customers , " of the Fe ) in these Notes , which , of course , the Fed can print at will . " <p> In terms of paid in capital ( real liabilities like other private companies ) , it has no debt . <p> That alone should answer the question on whether the Federal Reserve can go " bankrupt . " <p> But , by far the largest category of liability at the Fed is a deposit ' liability . <p> As Rothbard points out , this just means that if one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fed decides to withdraw its deposits then the Fed has to print up the notes . <p> Even Alan Greenspan , in a moment of truth , said why the Fed could never go under because it can print up any money it wants to cover any shortfall . <p> Going even further , the Federal Reserve is not a private company like other corporations ( which in and of themselves are a government fiction ) in the US . It has " shareholders " but they are n't like shareholders of a private company . Its shareholders are the member banks , led by Bank of America , JP Morgan and Citibank . But , they do n't own common equity . They only give participation rights , and do not include a right to share in profit . Outside of a small dividend all profits are turned over to the mafia ( government ) at the end of the year . No matter how many are owned , each bank only gets one vote . And only banks can own these shares , not individuals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President and Congress instead of the shareholders further proof this is not your typical company . It does not run according to profit/loss and consumers have no say in its survival . <p> The Federal Reserve is an entity created by legislation and protected by legislation with the legal right to counterfeit money . <p> Central banks are not a function of a free market/capitalism . In fact , central banking is a tenet of communism . It is central planning of the money system . <p> So , if its liabilities are the money it prints up , what are its assets ? <p> Its assets primarily consist of reserve bank credit , most of which is " securities held outright " ( government bonds bought in open market ) . Then there are relatively minor components like forex reserves , gold reserves and treasury currency . <p> Almost all of its assets were bought with money that it created . If that money was kept on deposit at the Fed then it becomes a deposit liability . Usually this means only the banks or government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability is called then the Fed prints up the notes and sends them out and they become currency in circulation . The entire money supply consists in commercial bank deposit liabilities . <p> Effectively the Fed creates deposit liabilities ( or bank reserves ) to buy those assets , and the liabilities simply obligate it to print up notes . <p> For these reasons no central bank created by government can ever really go bankrupt . <p> All central banks that have disappeared , for the most part , have disappeared because they printed up so much money that it became worthless and they , therefore , became irrelevant . <p> Central banks are a heinous , evil anti-freedom and anti-capitalist concoction that is only enabled through the violence ( laws ) of government . And they exist solely as an extra hidden tax ( inflation ) and to keep insolvent governments operating longer than they otherwise would . <p> CONCLUSION <p> While the article forwarded to us was the premise of this discussion it is just typical of the myriad of distortions and confusion caused by central banking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article , that the monetary and financial system as we know it is on the verge of collapse . The reasons given for it , however , are incorrect . <p> No central bank has ever gone " bankrupt " and no central bank will likely ever go " bankrupt " . Any proprietor of a central bank when given the option of going " bankrupt " or pressing a button on a computer to print up more money to cover the default will you guessed it press the button . <p> Either way , it does n't matter . The Western financial and monetary system is headed for collapse and at the end of the day only intellectuals or economics nerds will debate the reasons why it will happen . <p> In the meantime , the rest of us humans living in the real world will have to deal with the consequences . <p> Subscribe to The Dollar Vigilante newsletter to get insights from both the wise economic nerds on the reason why your life is about to change dramatically and from the open-minded and truth seeking humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to survive and prosper through this LONG ... collapse . <p> This is the most uninformed drivel I have ever come across . Except for the part about central bank operations being very hard to understand . <p> Since we are n't  pegging the $ to gold . Maybe we should , but we are n't  nor is anyone else , so that 's reality . Democracies seem to make a mess of their budgets . You can keep " kicking the budgetary mess down the road for 4 years " a long time apparently . <p> The Fed Reserve System controls the nations money supply . Normally via the FOMC trading in the repo market to bring the Fed Funds Rate to a new target . This short term rate affects loan rates , borrowing money expands the money supply with the multiplier effect , and they did n't  seem to be printing $$ . <p> Keynes sure as hell was n't a communist . He got rich in his pajamas reading the paper and making some trades . He recognized that an economic could sink into depression , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for the temporary lack of private aggregate demand and jump-start things back to normal . RUNNING MONSTER DEFICITS EVERY YEAR , UNTIL WE HAVE A REDICULOUS DEBT , MAKES KEYNES ROLL IN HIS GRAVE I GUARANTEE IT . <p> If we have an elected Government that controls what we spend ( always too much ) , I thank God Fed Governors , and the Chairman do n't  get elected to . Were not on the gold standard . Is there a need to monitor our money supply ? YES ! Supply and demand for $ vs other currencies determine its value . <p> Its illegal to " counterfeit " money , but did you know it asks illegal to destroy it ? THE FED DOES BOTH . PAUL VOLKER IN THE EARLY 80s , drive the Fed Funds Rate over 20% , mortgages were over 10% for years . Vast amounts of money were essentially destroyed , and inflation DIED , the international value of the $ did wonderfully . <p> With our current structure , we need a central bank . I fear our politicians paint them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more than they really can ( or should , or try a science experiment ) . QE was an experiment , and we do n't  even know whether it worked yet ! It appeared to work in the short term . <p> Not to sound like a commie , but an " overly deregulated " ( I know its a balancing act ) Wall Street can be trouble . Their INNOVATIVE Structured Subprime Mortgage Product ( you should know what that means to have a prayer of knowing enough to have a valid opinion ) was a DUMB idea . It made every banker in the country want to write subprime morgages , because they could immediately sell them at a profit , and make more loans . Wall Street was making money by restructuring cash flows , and selling " risk adjusted bonds " . Yields seemed good , the public was buying . A bubble guaranteed . Crawl into a bank naked , get a mortgage ! No regulation to prevent it ( my commie remark ) , and a bubble takes the economy down again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Point at Congress . They 're appointed for the same reason the Supreme Court is . So they can make difficult decisions , and not have to worry about the next election . Congress at times might have voted slavery back . Term limits would be great , but when hell freezes over , maybe well see that . <p> I think its a mistake to maintain faith in the US $ . There was a bible story about building a house , either on rock or on sand . Well , sand is made up of rock , it just does n't  have integrity . We should move to ground with integrity so that the weather does n't  threaten our lives , rather than spend our lives trying to shore up a rotten foundation . <p> Criminals or not , counterfeiting has bad effects , and no one should do it . Destroying something of value is perfectly legal as long as you own it and havent made anyone dependent on it . Oooh ! That 's interesting ! They have made us dependent on the US$ , have n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving them into a house built on a foundation of sand ) , how do you fix that ? Do you direct them to put their effort into shoring up the decaying ground ? No , but this analogy is getting off track . The Fed only destroys money that they hold they have to obtain it before they destroy it , and that action only serves to help everyone else who is holding some . So , like I said , counterfeiting has bad effects , but destroying what you already hold only enriches everyone else who holds something similar . So criminal or not , wed be better off without them .

The best part for us has been how great the people are here , the locals and the ex-pats that are getting out of the US . Ive been getting emails from folks around the US that have been reading my articles on TDV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who " get it " , and their friends think they are crazy for buying gold , or looking outside the USA , or whatever reasonably proactive steps they are taking . Definitely not so here , where almost everyone is like-minded ( i.e. , **34;1072;TOOLONG misfits ) , and motivated to make a better future here in Argentina . <p> Why did we decide to come here ? After years of trying to educate friends and family of the coming financial collapse , and engaging in whatever political activism I could , including being a very early and vocal supporter of Ron Paul , any rational person would realize that the time to stay and fight has long since past . I 've even changed my opinion that the problem is primarily the egregious political class we have elected ( President and Congress ) , but that the fundamental problem is the tens of millions of Americans ( and most westerners for that matter ) that do n't  have any idea what 's going on and continue to participate in their own self-destruction . For the US , Bush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people who got them elected . I admire the convictions of the minority that want/need to stay and fight for " their " country , but when I see no future for my children , and I 'm primarily concerned for their safety , its time to go . <p> In considering almost the entire world to pursue independence , safety and opportunity , one can quickly rule out Europe , which is breaking up faster than the US , Asia ( too difficult to assimilate ) , and Africa ( nowhere is safe ) . We quickly gravitated towards the cone of South America ( Chile , Argentina , and Uruguay ) . There are other interesting opportunities in Latin America for second citizenship ( the Dominican Republic , for example ) , economic opportunities , and tropical climates , but most of Latin America is still under the thumb of the American military complex , and I 'm more convinced that the Southern Hemisphere will be safer from the coming collapse and geopolitical fallout . <p> THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY <p> Chile , Argentina and Uruguay each have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering any one of them . However , by far the most important thing to consider no matter where you go is that you have a community that you are a part of . When the going gets tough , and IT WILL , a warm and inviting foreign populace is not going to cut it . You need a COMMUNITY of trusted , deeply committed , like-minded folks that really love each other and are committed to each others safety . <p> While I originally had my eyes set on Uruguay ( and still have invested in property there ) , I eventually visited Caseys Gulch here in the wine country of Argentina , and could n't believe what I saw and how interesting and supportive all the other people associated with the project were . There are hundreds of ex-pats settling in this remote region of the Calchaqui Valley , the vast majority from the US and Canada . One of the founders of the community was the governor of this Salta province , so we have some political clout , too . But also the influence of Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and author of the best-selling book " The International Man " back in the 70s . <p> Everyone here knows the geopolitical turmoil that we are facing , and are reasonably like-minded in how to approach these challenges . Most of us are loosely libertarian , but all are independent , freedom-oriented , hard-working and self-sufficient ( to a point ) . This place was largely selected because it has an ample underground water supply and is a prolific agricultural region and we are securing our own food supply . This is also a prolific wine growing region , and we have hundreds of acres of some of the top wine grapes in Argentina in production . We also have the best golf course in South America , one of the nicest polo fields , and are building what will easily be the best health club between here and Buenos Aires , with tennis courts , pools , lakes and gyms . <p> Its definitely reminiscent of " Galts Gulch " , modeled on Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged utopia for the productive class escaping the destructive political class and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even heard of Ayn Rand . What convinced me this was the safest place to raise my children over the next decade was the people that were here and that have plans to come here . Not exactly the ex-pat pensioners you find in a lot of places , but young people with families , young couples just starting out , people that want to build this community into something great . There 's a vibrancy here you do n't  get anywhere else in Latin America . Our neighbors are from California , Vancouver , Seattle , North Carolina , Calgary , Colorado , Germany , etc . <p> 330 DAYS OF SUNSHINE <p> At about 6000 feet up in the Andes Mountains , the air here is clean and fresh unlike anything I have experienced since I was a kid going to Lake Tahoe . Theres 330 days of sunshine each year , and the local town of Cafayate has everything you need on a daily basis from groceries , to restaurants and hardware stores . When you are here you realize again what fresh food really is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air and water in the US . After her first bite of locally made ice cream here , my daughter exclaimed , " Wow , we do n't  have ice cream like this in the US " . <p> " La Estancia " , as the place is known , is not heaven , but for us , at this time , its the closest place we can imagine . But more importantly , we are building something that we want for ourselves , and we are doing it as a community . Already the frustrations I had with the economic situation in the US , the growing threats of war in Iran , and the troubling news about Fukushima radiation are quickly becoming a thing of the past . Argentina has its challenges for sure , and this particular community may not be for everybody , but I have n't felt as optimistic about my familys future for a long time since we arrived here and this place became a reality for us . <p> We are somewhat dreading having to go back to the US for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of time here starting later next year . I have a hunch 2012 might be a good year for anyone to execute on plans to get out of the US . <p> Here are some photos we have taken : <p> Its almost the first day of summer but fresh snow has fallen on the nearby local peaks in Cafayate with clear , warm days in the valley below . <p> The sunsets on the hills and the unlimited visibility are amazing here . The new health club is ready to open up across the lake on the left with pools , gyms , tennis courts , croquet and more . <p> The wildlife is also amazing , from the wonderful array of birds , to frogs , foxes , owls , and insects of every shape and size . <p> The golf clubhouse is the gathering place for souvenirs , a good meal , and interesting conversation . <p> Gary KinghornBio : Gary Kinghorn is currently a senior marketing manager at Cisco in Silicon Valley , and is a part time ex-pat in Argentina at Doug Caseys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of the Austrian School of Economics and previously worked as a financial advisor at Citigroup/Smith Barney .

Take a look at the diagram at this link and after you have stopped weeping , read on : In short , the general public works , eats , masturbates , play with their kids for 10 minutes a day , watches television 10 or 12 hours a week , and surfs the web for porn or cute one-liners to post on their Facebook pages . <p> But they do not read . <p> This is why , as a nation , Americans are ignorant . It is why as a nation we are on the train to Armageddon . Most are too uninformed to stop the train or jump off and that has led us here , to a myriad of false beliefs , a dangerous world view , and a choice that is no choice at all . <p> Their parents are no better , believing in idiotic stereotypes of other countries , even though most do n't have passports and have never traveled outside the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . <p> The same insular nitwits are certain theirs is the " greatest nation " in history and that everywhere else is a scum-ridden shit hole . <p> Most Americans will tell you straight-faced that the US is the " land of the free " , even though it has more people incarcerated nominally and as a percentage of its population than any other country in the world . They will insist that America is the " land of opportunity " even as one-fourth of the work force is employed in jobs that pay less than $22,000 , the poverty line for a family of four , half are on the government dole , and most of those will die virtually penniless . <p> These are fools . And voters . <p> Left and Right , Not Created Equal <p> Such is the big , ugly picture , but ignorance , like chunky peanut butter , never spreads evenly . It would be unfair to toss the left and the right into the same trash bin when they each so richly deserve their own . <p> My experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftists than right-wingers read , meaning they read something more than the cereal box that sits silent in front of their soul-dead eyes each morning before leaving to earn a buck working at a meaningless job they hate but must keep to make the underwater house payment each month . It is not necessarily because more intellect is found on the left . It is just that in socialist circles one is expected to at least appear educated , even if most are only dilettantes . <p> The right , on the other hand , seems to take pride in their ignorance , their homophobia , their racism , their ethnocentrism , their belief in sky-fairies , their open despising of immigrants , their relentless hillbilly one-liners , and their Pollyanna-ish belief they will somehow win when the government comes to take their beloved guns . <p> There is a palpable difference between the right and the left and Doug Casey nailed it : Republicans are the party of the ignorant ; Democrats are the party of evil .

Most are more interested in their bank balance than their quality of life and are genuinely shocked by their own material success , as they rightfully should be . <p> Most Democrats , on the other hand , are victims , or believe they are , certain that they were somehow wrongfully fucked along the way by " the man " and are pissed and want to get even . Stealing from idiot-savant Republicans who tripped over their own dicks into piles of stolen money somehow seems right to them .

I am shocked the US got this far before hitting the wall like Mr. Magoo playing jai-alai . But the wall is where we find ourselves and egging the General Public on toward economic or nuclear demise are Obama and Romney , one a classic Democrat and the other a prototypical Republican . <p> Americans ' " Choice " <p> It now comes down to Obama or Romney , a hideous thought to be sure . <p> Obama appears intelligent , but he is a fool .

He will , and Congress will , too . <p> Romney , on the other hand , is a fool and acts like one . He has no idea who he is or what he believes in , except that making a lot of money by boning the working man and hiding it away like a squirrel is okay , even good in his case because he accomplished it at the direction of his imaginary friend in the sky . His believers buy the proposition that an expensive suit who specialized in destroying jobs over a lifetime has the capacity and desire to create 12 million of them over the next four years . His followers likewise seem mathematically disabled . Romney has promised not to cut Social Security or Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That spells massive deficits , no matter whose calculator you use , or how many silly sports metaphors he uses . Behind that painted on smile lies a pathological cheater who was behind , or at least on board , with silencing Ron Paul . <p> In the end , the US is screwed , and has scheduled November 6 for the hosing of a lifetime . Either of these Statists will hump Joe Lunchbucket like a red-headed step mule , insuring America 's journey toward total unmitigated disaster is completed in the next four years . It has been hypothesized that the unread , disinterested , intellectually bankrupt general public is simply too ignorant to support a functional democracy . Sounds right to me . <p> As I watch the endgame , I continue to debate both left and right , a sad exercise that always ends with some inane non-sequitur , most often the accusatory , " But Jim , you left America , " as if that is relevant to anything , as if that decision disqualifies me from the discussion . <p> Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other burning building even as the debate between dumb and evil rages on . <p> Jim Karger is a lawyer who has represented American businesses against incursions by government and labor unions for 30 years .

As the great anarchist writer Robert Heinlein wrote , " How can I possibly put a new idea into your heads , if I do not first remove your delusions ? " <p> That 's why the Internet is so exciting . It does n't just make a staggering amount of information available to each user . It makes a staggering amount of alternative information availabe . I 've met plenty of people who are actually bothered by that . " There 's a lot of crap on the Internet , " they point out . More 's the joy , I always retort .

The ideas that are laughed at one day ( disease is caused by microscopic agents , not bad airthe world is round and it 's not the center of the universeyou should n't spank or intimidate your children if you want a peaceful world to come about ) sometimes end up making the world a better place . Just like with all things , free exchange and competition will sort it out . <p> So it 's refreshing for me to know that online I can find every unpopular opinion getting a showing : Holocaust denial , 9/11 Truth , white supremacy , black supremacy , climate change skepticism , creationism , or evolution for that matter , homophobia , and voluntaryism .

They feel that " dangerous " ideas ( which usually just mean unpopular ideas or ideas that governments consider dangerous to their own survival ) should be controlled . Without admitting it , these statists crave at least some form of censorship . I 'd remind them of this other quote from Heinlein : <p> " When any government , or any church for that matter , undertakes to say to its subjects , ' This you may not read , this you must not see , this you are forbidden to know , ' the end result is tyranny and oppression , no matter how holy the motives .

And anyway , in keeping with my principles I want liberty and prosperity to flourish because the truth works better , not because I suppressed at gunpoint things I did n't agree with . <p> Now that I 've defended the availability of all sorts of opinions and theories , let me get back to an earlier point . There really are a lot of bad ideas floating around out there and they 're actively pushed by the government in its public indoctrination camps ( schools ) and by its lapdogs in the media .

Losing it <p> This is the story of one sports great who thought he was investing conservatively . The problem ? He was not investing conservatively at all . In fact he was investing in one of the riskiest assets available today government bonds . His financial advisor did not advise him of that . <p> Before we get to his story , let 's paint a picture of his home country , Puerto Rico . To put it bluntly , it is mired in debt . Lots and lots of debt . Sound familiar ? <p> According to Puerto Rico 's representative in Congress , Puerto Rico 's debt crisis is the result of the island 's status as a United States territory . <p> For 115 years Puerto Rico has been an US territory , and its people US citizens since 1917 . <p> For nearly a decade the Puerto Rican economy has been contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The island 's $70 billion in debt has been downgraded to junk by credit rating agencies in recent weeks . It 's solution ? To beg for more subsidy from the US government . <p> What used to be a tax haven is no more when it comes to Puerto Rico . In fact , even Time Magazine has suggested that thousands of US-based mom and pop investors stand to lose their island shirts in " the next financial catastrophe " , Puerto Rico . That is just what happens when an island of 4 million accumulates $70 billion in debt . 51% of the island 's population is on welfare . <p> The island 's debt crisis has not persuaded well-to-do people away from purchasing Puerto Rican government bonds . In so doing , many have nearly lost it all . Take Puerto Rican boxing legend Felix " Tito " Trinidad Jr. , for example . <p> After winning belts in three different weight classes , earning $90 million throughout his career , Trinidad will be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in June , alongside Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically brokeDespite his success , Trinidad has but $9 million in assets and a whopping $27 million in debt . <p> Where was his error ? That is simpleHe spent $63 million in Puerto Rican government bonds ! The global economic crisis has not been kind to these bonds , making them practically worthless . <p> So , what is the moral of the story ? Felix Trinidad lost everything , for all intents and purposes , because he invested in government bonds . This might seem like far-removed story for Americans , but the truth is this will happen to many Americans who are told that government and corporate bonds are safe assets , just as Trinidad thought . <p> While Trinidad was able to strike a debt deal because of his notoriety , let 's face it you probably would n't get the same treatment . He is a national hero . <p> PUERTO RICO AS AN ESCAPE PLAN ? <p> Americans have moved to or put money in Puerto Rico for its tax benefits , but they will be dissapointed to learn that Puerto Rico is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and the government there will likely be taken over by the US government if not the International Monetary Fund and forced to restructure the economy . As you can see , the nation is already suffering from a failing economy and too much debt . <p> It is not likely that any Puerto Rican tax benefits will last long . When considering the bigger picture , there are many places more desirable to live than Puerto Rico , which will continue going downhill economically due to its dependence upon the US . It will probably help the US in its own decline as well . The truth of the matter is this : Puerto Rico is too interconnected with the US to experience any meaningful growth . <p> A much better gateway to freedom is to procure a second passport in a low or no tax jurisdiction and then move outside of the West completely to a freer country than both the US and Puerto Rico and live as a Permanent Traveler globetrotting this beautiful little ball floating in space . <p> Puerto Rico basically has no hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path it has been on of slashing spending and raising taxes .

The major problem many of these folks face is sorting through the details of what makes most sense for them now . That is where The Dollar Vigilante comes in .

Me too ! I 'm a younger , go-getter entrepreneur . I 'd love to be investing in technologies and amazing , world-changing businesses more than anyone . But I cant . Not knowing what I know . Not knowing that all the socialist democratic western states are insolvent under any measure . Not knowing that because of that and because they all have fiat currencies which can be printed into oblivion to keep their show going just a few years longer will mean a complete collapse of the western monetary system .

No , Charlie , what is uncivilized is this entire immoral system of theft and slavery ( taxation ) and the communist fashioned central banks that impoverish the people while paying for every major war in modern history .

Whatd you think those cash sniffing dogs and men and women hiding on the jetway to the airplane with badges around their neck asking how much cash you have are for , Charlie ? Oh , maybe they do n't  have that for private jets yet . <p> In the interview Charlie points out that one of their main skills is seeing changes in the world and adapting quickly to them . They appear to have missed the biggest change staring them right in the face . <p> They were warned long ago by a much , much greater man than both Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett Warrens father , Howard Buffett who stated : <p> " I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold , although they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation , war and slavery then this cause demands your support . For if human liberty is to survive in America , we must win the battle to restore honest money . There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors . " <p> Sadly Howard Buffett never lived to see the day his fasco-communist , idiot savant , brat of a son learn about freedom , liberty and not being a part of a criminal system . Our only hope is that both Charlie and Warren do live to see it . <p> If you believe gold is a barbarous relic then buy some Berkshire Hathaway .

I spent the weekend at the Calgary Resource conference and I was unable to get out our Interim Update this weekend . Ed Bugos had written it but I was so busy for the entire weekend I did not have time to get it out . Then , yesterday , as I was preparing to get it out , my laptop stopped working ! <p> So , I will get that out as soon as I can get to my home computer in Acapulco later this evening . <p> On that note , I also want to state that there has been a LOT of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our launch . When we launched in July 2010 things got off to a bit of a slow start , as you might imagine . However , in the last 3 or 4 months things have changed dramatically . As Ed mentioned , when he covered for me on the blog last week when I was in transit , the message we are spreading here at TDV is really beginning to catch on to the point where I seem to be on planes to conferences around the globe or on the radio , TV or podcasts nearly daily now . <p> This is all great news but it has made me realize that if I am going to do all these events and appearances that we are going to have to hire some extra staff , so things like me being too busy or having my computer break wont cause us to be delayed on the release of our subscriber content . <p> Thank you to all of our amazing subscribers for your patience as we try to adjust to the massive growth in our brand . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been taking on lots of new subscriber requests something else we are backlogged on ! <p> Well get this rectified ASAP , I promise . <p> And with that , let 's get right to the most important news of the last few days , Barrack Obama managed to keep the Washington Monument from disappearing ! <p> As I mentioned in my blog on Friday , I held out no hope that the US Government would actually stop itself from destroying the planet and so I was one of the least surprised when , at the last minute , they came up with a way to keep this gravy train of funny money going . <p> If I am reading the statements from Barack Obama correctly , he seems to think one of the most important roles of government is just to keep open the White House Gift shop and , apparently , the Washington Monument so that school children can visit and " feel the sense of pride and possibility that defines America " . <p> He even dropped in to the Washington Monument in a bizarre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it occurred like this : <p> " Hi everybody , " he told surprised tourists , " I just wanted to say , real quick , that because Congress was able to settle its differences , that 's why this place is open today and everybodys able to enjoy their visit . " <p> Gee , thanks , Barack ! But , is that what you think the $4 trillion+ federal governments budget is for ? To operate gift shops and to remind people of the PAST when there may have been something to be proud about in Washington DC ? ? <p> Is he going to drop in on some Pakistani families and do the same , " Hi everybody ! Thanks to my hard work our unmanned drone bombings can continue in your country ! " Doubt it . The same probably goes for those living in other places under attack by the Prince of Peace , like Libya , Iraq and Afghanistan . <p> The best thing that could have happened would have been for the US Government to shut down , for good . This one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would bring peace and prosperity to the planet in a very short period of time . <p> And , even if the US Government were to close down , I think it is important to remind Obama that the Washington Monument would still exist he seems to think it would all disappear unless he keeps taking your money ! 
@@99475526 @3675526/ <p> When I read the screeds of some Libertarians and anarchists , including some of my own , they often come across as strident and arrogant . A good recent example is Paul Craig Roberts , one of the most articulate , well-credentialed critics of the U.S. government . His otherwise well-reasoned arguments are made less persuasive when he engages in name-calling and hyperbole . His excellent piece , " America : Totally Discredited " , sounds whiny and even juvenile in places when he uses adjectives like " fool , " " moron , " and " liars . " Hyperbole is neither necessary nor effective in rational argument . Solipsistic name-calling has never caused anyone to wake up . Indeed , belittling others who believe differently , regardless of merit , nets no converts . To the contrary , it results in defensiveness and the closing , rather than the opening , of other minds . One only need to read or listen to Ron Paul who has been a highly effective advocate of libertarian ideals not only because of his genius but because he is likable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor . Even icons on the left of the political spectrum admire and respect him . <p> Yesterday , I was reminded of the soft side of anarchy and voluntarism while visiting Puebla , Mexico . As our bus pulled up to the hotel in the center of this historic city of 3 million people , I saw a little girl , about 4 years old , through the window at an ice cream stand set up on the sidewalk . She was trying to get the attention of the owner , a woman doing a brisk business selling homemade ice creams . She at first ignored the pleas of the little girl , who was a little dirty but a lot precocious , who refused to give up . She danced , played the canisters of ice cream like bongos , tried to engage the owner in conversation , always smiling , laughing . I decided when I got off the bus that the first thing I would do was buy her the ice cream she was working so hard for . But before I could leave my seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic buckets , scoop out ice cream and put it into a small cup . Without even looking , she handed it to the little girl who smiled and mouthed " gracias . " The woman smiled gently , and then quickly went back to serving the paying class . <p> No government was involved in this transaction . No bureaucrat told the woman who likely supported an entire family with her ice cream stand that she did n't have the right permit , and no one outlawed the little girl from trying to garner the charitable attention of someone who was probably in the same spot 20 years earlier . No one waded through State paperwork that would somehow make the little girl entitled to her treat , rather than simply grateful for it . <p> One does n't even have to live outside the Nanny State to see this dynamic . It even happens in the land of hustlers each and every day . <p> Rational self-interest expresses itself not in the virtue of selfishness in its ugliest manifestations but in responsibility assumed voluntarily by individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of cards . By voluntarily assuming that responsibility as individuals , we make government unnecessary . Pursuing our own short-term self-interests to the exclusion of the needs of others results in nothing other than the belief by a majority that a central authority is needed to sort it all out , to make it right . Those espousing various brands of voluntarism who stridently and loudly worship self-indulgence and consumption to the exclusion of the needs of others only insures the existence of the very state they so despise . <p> So , I am suggesting that voluntarism not only has a soft side , but is by its nature soft . At its core is the absence of force and the seeking of a meeting of the minds , of voluntary agreement . Those of us who do not want government taking money at the end of a gun and feeding the child on the street corner in Puebla know that we need to do it ourselves . Those who recognize that the failed and soon-bankrupt social and economic programs of the 1930s are not the answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a problem or that it will magically self-rectify without voluntary acts of individual kindness . <p> Such is a way life here in Mexico where homelessness is rare even in the face of poverty and even absent a vast government social net . Why ? Because families step up and voluntarily take care of their own . It is their history , their culture , and it was once our culture , too , until it was sacrificed at the altar of consumerism masking itself as rational self-interest . <p> Morris Berman , US expatriate and noted historian now living in Mexico observed in Why America Failed : The Roots Of Imperial Decline that " progress " is defined in the US strictly in terms of what is tangible . " What we lose , however , " he observes , " is intangible , and thus it is difficult for most people to understand what they are actually losing . Is it progress to have forty-seven ( or whatever ) different types of razor blades available on the market ? Is it progress to have dinner with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking on their cell phones ( usually right at the dinner table ) rather than to each other ? Or when a group of Wal-Mart shoppers literally trample someone to death to get their hands on discounted DVD players , and then refuse to get out of the way when the medics arrive ? If this is progress , I 'm not sure we can endure much more of it . " <p> Each of Berman 's examples fall under the heading of self-interest , but there is nothing rational about them , not in the long-term . Berman cites Douglas LaBier , a psychotherapist in Washington , D.C. , who contends the problem in the United States is an " empathy deficit disorder , " a fancy term for not giving a damn about anybody but one 's self . " LaBier claims that empathy is a natural emotion , but that Americans unlearn it from an early age because ours is a society that focuses on acquisition and status and avoids inner reflection . We kneel before a cult of the self , elaborately constructed by the architects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less fortunate , and honesty . The methods used to attain what we want , we are told by reality television programs , business schools and self-help gurus , are irrelevant . Success , always defined in terms of money and power , is its own justification . " In fact , it is no justification at all , but should rather be the result of doing the right thing well , and the oft-forgotten part of the right thing is helping others less fortunate than one 's self . <p> I submit that voluntarism works because of empathy , not in spite of it . While capitalism and rational self-interest define the best economic path forward , Vance Packard was right when he admonished us " to see that cherished values and integrity of the soul have more to do with a well-spent life than self-indulgence . " <p> When I got off the bus , I watched the little girl carefully , hoping against hope there was an adult somewhere close by that she called her own . Then I saw her Mother , sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap , as she held up her hand to the passing crowd . A few who passed put a peso or two in her hand , not asking for anything in return , not seeking any accolade , and probably not even understanding why they were giving on a conscious level , but intuiting a need to help , to preserve their own humanity and their culture to the exclusion of the state which strips all donative intent and empathy from the act of giving , an act essential to our humanity . <p> It is hard to know how this dialectic will play out , but I humbly suggest that those of us who genuinely believe that we can do better than government should start by spouting less cruel hyperbole at those who still promote the state as the answer and instead step forward to prove that it is not .

Rather , it is the natural order of progression from the collective fear engendered by 9/11 that netted Americans the Patriot Act , a massive legislative incursion on their civil liberties . Once those in power recognized the majority was willing to sacrifice their freedoms for a faux security , the endgame began . And in a short decade , virtually every right guaranteed by the Constitution has been trampled upon or simply ignored . From the NDAA to FATCA , the Statists are now in full control , which would be true even if the " other guy " had won .

America 's last vestige of hope , the judiciary , has been marginalized by an executive branch that is out of control . Indeed , Executive Orders are now the way laws are made . Congress has become a pathetic joke , a sub-intellectual class of do-nothing puppets with rubber stamps . <p> The United States has sadly and tragically transmogrified into a full-bore dictatorial police state . I observe this with no joy , but with a profound sadness and an intense clarity . <p> Beginning in two short months , the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) will take it a step further , resulting in the US government not only having access to all bank accounts of citizens and non-citizens alike inside the United States , but to most US citizen and resident accounts outside the US . Remember that knowledge and access are the only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . <p> US passports are now harder to get and will soon be more difficult to renew , a first step to border control , not as in keeping the unwanted out but as in keeping the tax donkeys in . <p> Bottom line ?

Enjoy the world of mindless shopping and endless traffic forever and ever , Amen . <p> But , if you find yourself or your money seized or locked into place , unable to cross a border , then you made a bad bet . In the words of the immortal Dr. Hunter S. Thompson : " Buy the ticket , take the ride . " <p> Indeed . <p> Think about it , hard . <p> If you decide now is the time to get out of Dodge , have a little money , some transferable skills and a lot of imagination , there are places in the world you can live that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten you with prison for the slightest infraction of the rules , where it is not assumed you are a criminal with something to hide . <p> Mexico is one of those places . <p> Government here is , in a word , disinterested . The Mexican government likes expats to live here , or better said , they like our money , and as Jeff Berwick has pointed out on many occasions , we are generally treated with some deference here . They ca n't quite make us out . They do n't know what to do with us , so they figure it is best to leave us alone . And that is just fine . If life was the " The Story of the Three Bears " , Mexico is living in Mama Bears porridge . <p> My wife and I and our 10 dogs live in what the readers of Conde Naste Traveler recently voted to be " the best city in Mexico " and " the 8th best city in the world " . I have written about San Miguel de Allende extensively , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , simple , straightforward , or as the locals say , " muy tranquilo . " This part of Mexico is known as " the land of Eternal Spring , " with an average year around temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit . We walk nearly everywhere we go . We live on two-thirds of what it costs to live in the US and we have two full-time employees who do nothing but take care of us . <p> The architecture is stunning . Even after eleven years , when I stand on my rooftop overlooking the city , my breath is stolen away . The historical center of San Miguel has been preserved and photos taken 100 years ago do not reflect an image much different than which exists today . <p> San Miguel de Allende is a cultural center with everything from an internationally recognized chamber music festival to one of Mexico 's best beer tasting festivals , both held annually . At 6,200 feet above sea level , the air is clean , crisp , and never humid . We are 10 hours by car from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 hours from Dallas . In other words , returning to see family and friends is not time-consuming or expensive . <p> But that which makes San Miguel de Allende most different from any other city in Mexico is its history of American presence . As early as the 1930s , US artists and bohemians of all sorts began making their way here . After World War II , the GIs discovered that they could come to San Miguel , study art , and still have enough to live on . During the 1960s , Jack Kerouac , Allen Ginsberg , William Burroughs , and Ken Kesey all made the trek to San Miguel . It was and remains a very hip place to be in the world . There are tiny sidewalk coffee shops , out of the way bars , and there is a 5-star Rosewood Resort , all within blocks of each other , and nearly everything in between . <p> Americans and Canadians have been coming here for more than 70 years , which is important if only because there are only a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Americans . We are accepted here as part of the landscape , a part of society . <p> And , we are an important part of the social fabric here . Over the years , many non-governmental organizations have been founded by Americans and Canadians to help those in need , from breakfast programs for poor children , to those like my wife who has dedicated untold time and energy on behalf of homeless street dogs . The local community values and appreciates these efforts and it has made the relationship between expats and locals easy and self-sustaining . <p> As much as I love San Miguel and feel intensely fortunate for having stumbled upon it , I am the first to admit it is not perfect . No place is . There is a government here . There is red tape , but with a big difference . Government does n't actively seek to involve itself in our lives . Indeed , in eleven years of living here we have yet to receive a letter , a phone call or a visit from a government official . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . We live by the non-aggression principle . <p> And so it not surprising that the two casitas inside our centrally-located compound stay full , not only with tourists but with those looking at life alternatives . These are not kids who want to come down and smoke dope all day and drink all night , but serious people , those with transferable skills who want to see , who want know what is possible , who want to meet the lawyers , bankers , accountants , real estate professionals , and others in the know who can help them evaluate their ideas , their dreams , and assist in their implementation . <p> If you are one of this rare-breed , write me at email protected . Selfishly , I want San Miguel de Allende to become a haven for freedom lovers , a place with perfect weather , friendly locals , a world of opportunity , and liberty-lovers to socialize with .

They thirst for unbridled , unquestioned power . <p> And it is getting worse . <p> And it will continue to get worse . <p> And you know it because you see it . <p> So , if you are not ready to make a leap of faith now , then when ? <p> Jim Karger is TDV 's legal correspondent and the TDV concierge for San Miguel de Allende , Mexico , where he and his wife have lived for 11 years .

By declaring that we must take from the rich and give to the poor , the communist is essentially admitting their failed moral state .

Please introduce yourself and give some background on yourself to our audience . <p> Hugo Salinas Price ( HSP ) : I am 79 years old , son of a Mexican father from the city of Monterrey , Mexico , and of an American mother from Bryn Athyn , Pa. , where I was born . My education was largely in English-speaking schools . I married early , at 22 , and my wife and I are looking forward to our 57th Anniversary later this year . I did not finish any college course for a BA ( Editors Note : Yet another " uneducated " billionaire as per our recent blog post : Debtucation ) ; <p> I decided to devote myself to some productive work at age 20 and so I am mostly self-educated . As luck would have it , I managed to build a tiny company building radios into a chain of small stores selling durable consumer goods in installments to the public . After 38 years of one single job , I turned over management entirely to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . Its certainly not my fault I am considered a " billionaire " this was my eldest sons doing , he is to blame for it entirely . <p> However , monetary affairs have always fascinated me , and in " retirement " I was able to devote myself to thinking through the problem of instability in modern society . Thus , I arrived at the question of silver money , in 1995 , when I wrote a little book " Silver The Road for Mexico " ( available only in Spanish ) . Thus began the long journey which has given meaning and purpose to my old age . <p> TDV : Where in Mexico do you live ? <p> HSP : I live in Mexico City , same house since 1959 . <p> TDV : You have been very active in lobbying the Mexican Government to integrate silver into the money system . Could you please expand on this ? <p> HSP : First , I want to make it clear that my campaign for silver does NOT mean backing the Mexican peso with silver . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mexican monetary system simply because such a program would cause so much disruption and grief while people adapted to it , that it is politically impossible ; and so it is useless to spend time working on something so " far out " . <p> Mexican Silver LibertadWhat I propose is simply to give a quoted monetary value to a one-ounce pure silver coin which already exists , the " Libertad " ounce ( editors note : Libertad means freedom in Spanish ) . This coin has no engraved value upon it , and it would be given a QUOTED monetary value by the Central Bank ; the quoted monetary value would always be slightly higher than the market price of a silver ounce , and when the price of silver rises , the Central Bank is to adapt to that situation by giving the coin a higher price . When the price of silver falls , the last quote remains in place , so that the quoted value can never diminish , only rise to accommodate the higher market price of silver . <p> By this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remain permanently in circulation with paper money ; the silver coin would never be melted down , because higher prices of silver would simply mean a higher monetary value for the coin . Of course , people would save these coins , the demand for them would be enormous . But they could also use these coins for payments in emergencies or for investments . An excellent and simple way to save ! <p> There is in the world today , no real alternative to fiat money fake money . All currencies of the world are equally void of any intrinsic worth . Monetizing the " Libertad " ounce would give Mexicans an alternative and simple way of saving , in money that is truly money , because it is made of silver . Savings in " Libertad " ounces would provide every family with a nest-egg of great importance , as it would consist of coins which can not be devalued by the State , with a totally liquid value . <p> TDV : OK , this clarifies things a lot . So , your goal here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HSP : Yes , as I said before , I am NOT for " backing the Peso with silver " . I am striving to have a single silver coin , the one-ounce pure silver " Libertad " , MONETIZED by means of a monetary quote to be issued by the Central Bank . <p> The Government of Mexico , just like the Governments of every single country in the world today , allows the Central Bank to inflate the money supply through the banking system . Not one of the worlds governments is ever going to willingly stop inflating ! <p> The monetized one-ounce pure silver " Libertad " will provide an excellent refuge for savers who want to preserve the value of their savings for their old age , for the education of their children , or simply to eat when hard times strike . It would be the first and ( for a time ) the only true alternative money in the world of the 21st Century . <p> TDV : In other words , the Mexican central bank can keep inflating under this proposal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WORLD will ever swear off of inflating the money supply and expanding credit when it can be done . That 's why we need the alternative money , which can be said to be " indexed " to the market price of silver . <p> TDV : Why would the Mexican government give the " Libertad " a quoted monetary value ? Does this mean that someone can pay a certain amount of pesos for the coin and then , if the peso value of silver halves , they can sell it back to the Central Back for the same price that they purchased it for ? Wouldnt the Central Bank have an incentive to print enough money so that the peso value of silver never falls ? <p> HSP : The institution giving the coin a quoted monetary value would not be the Mexican government , it would be the Central Bank , in obedience to Legislation passed by the Mexican Congress , which has the constitutional authority to instruct the Central Bank on this matter . <p> About " selling the coin back to the Central Bank " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver has fallen in bullion value : Yes , they could , but no one in his right mind would do this . The Mexican peso which circulated for 25 years ( 1920-1945 ) , of which 458 million were minted , contained silver which fell in value sharply during the Depression , yet not one of those pesos was ever returned for PAPER . Greshams Law , you know . No one ever exchanges better money for worse money . <p> Printing pesos to keep the peso price of silver up , means inflating and devaluing the peso against the dollar , in which currency silver is quoted in world markets . The Central Bank would have no reason to do this . <p> TDV : We have been debating your proposal amongst some members of the Austrian economics community . Some state that silver is too volatile to use as an alternative currency at this time they prefer gold . What are your thoughts on using silver versus gold ? <p> HSP : The monetization of the silver ounce would cause a demand for it that would tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case is due to manipulation of the silver market . The best way to combat that manipulation is to create a great demand for physical silver which would put the shorts out of business . <p> Talk of a return to gold is important , as it fosters a re-orientation of thinking which is indispensable from the paper of the last 40 years , to gold , that will give more long-lasting benefits to humanity . Eventually , well have to get past the " talking " stage and move on to action ; however , no one has a clue , at this point , on how to get from paper to gold ! <p> Monetizing the silver " Libertad " coin is a FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION . It does not fix everything , it does not reform everything , it is painless and it is very , very attractive to people . This , my friends , is the only practical way to get anywhere in life ! <p> TDV : Nice touch . Just for the record , we here at TDV are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if need be to rid ourselves of these central banks and governments !

We need to have our people save lots of silver , to face the coming readjustments in the US economy , which will be very painful , indeed . <p> TDV : Thank you very much sir for your time and your efforts to try to bring some sort of sanity to the monetary system . <p> In closing , this is a small but potentially inspiring move to bring something solid into the monetary system .

@@99475533 @3675533/ <p> Editors note : the following post is by Jim Karger , TDV Legal Correspondent <p> American taxpayers worldwide face a June 30th deadline to file with the U.S. Department of Treasury the Form TD-90-22.1 , Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts , also known as the FBAR . <p> On its face , the FBAR is just another form in a long line of forms required by the US government of its citizenry . <p> But , as with all government incursions on privacy and freedom , the FBAR is much more than a form . It is a first step to the US government having access to American taxpayers assets worldwide . To understand how the FBAR fits into the puzzle , one must follow the legislative bread crumbs . <p> FBAR " Tell Us Where Your Money Is " <p> Any U.S. person with a financial interest in , or authority over , a foreign financial account ( accounts that exceed $10,000 in the aggregate ) must file an IRS Form TD-90-22.1 , Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ( FBAR ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other authority over a foreign financial account . <p> Exactly what constitutes a " foreign financial account " has been hotly debated . Suffice it to say that the IRS takes a broad view of the term . See their document here . ( If you have or believe you may have a foreign financial account , you should consult with your tax attorney or tax advisor immediately . ) <p> The FBAR is not a part of the US tax return . Rather , it is an independent report that must be filed with the US Treasury , to be received ( not mailed ) by June 30 of each year . <p> It is important to be right on what foreign financial accounts to report and to be timely since there are no extensions available for the FBAR filing and since penalties for failing to file the FBAR are severe , including a civil penalty of $10,000 for each non-willful violation , and the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the amount in the account for each violation , with each failure to file a separate violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assets Are " <p> In addition to the FBAR , beginning in tax year 2011 , every US taxpayer with " specified foreign financial assets " must report them on IRS Form 8938 , which was due for most US taxpayers April 15 , 2012 , this pursuant to Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) . <p> Any individual who holds " any interest " in a " specified foreign financial asset " must attach to their income tax return certain required information ( in the Form 8398 ) , if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $50,000 . A " specified foreign financial asset " includes any financial account maintained by a foreign financial institution , and if not maintained by a foreign financial institution , any stock or security issued by a non-U.S . person , any other financial instrument or contract where the issuer or counterparty is a non-U.S . person , or any interest in a foreign entity . <p> Exactly which assets are covered ( and which are not ) , both for FBAR and Form 8398 , remains subject to dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a trust or corporation . <p> Unlike the FBAR , Form 8398 must be attached to your Form 1040 . It does not replace the FBAR . Many Americans are required to file both . Much of the information is duplicative , but other information is not . <p> Many Americans will , no doubt , fail to file one form or the other , or both , or fill in the blanks incorrectly , not understanding what is covered and what is not . It has been posited that the complexity and duplicative nature of these filings reveal an intent by government to insure non-compliance in order that the taxpayer can be fined and threatened into submission . <p> We will know soon enough . <p> FATCA to Banks " In Case You Did n't  Tell Us , They Will " <p> The 8398 required by FATCA will , no doubt , prove to be a challenge to many taxpayers , but it is not the worst , nor the most invasive , requirement of FATCA . Rather , it is the requirements imposed by the US on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their U.S. account holders starting in 2013 . <p> Foreign financial institutions with US account holders stare into the face of a compliance nightmare . They will have three basic choices : ( 1 ) enter into an agreement with the IRS to put procedures in place to identify and disclose U.S. account holders , ( 2 ) accept the 30% withholding tax on U.S. payments , or ( 3 ) restructure their businesses to stop serving U.S. customers , stop offering ( and owning ) U.S. investments , or both . <p> Many foreign banks are already closing American accounts , not willing to jump through the hoops of an American government gone wild with power and hubris . Other banks and financial institutions will comply if only because they fear the financial repercussions of losing American accounts or having their rights to wire funds into and out of the United States summarily terminated . <p> Capital Controls " Now That We Know Where Your Money Is . . . " <p> All of the above is frightening enough for most , but it is just the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and FATCAs gross impositions on foreign financial institutions puts the US government just one short step from being able to force US citizens to repatriate their financial assets to the United States . <p> Before FATCA , such a step would be formidable , requiring the US government to actually know of a non-compliant foreign account without a fishing expedition , then file suit in the foreign jurisdiction in which the taxpayer resided , and finally go through a long and costly legal process to seize an Americans offshore financial assets . <p> Now , with a knife in each hand , one held to the throats of US taxpayers via FBAR and Form 8398 , and the other to the throats of banks worldwide via FATCA , one need not strain credulity to envision a day US law will be extended ( or simply interpreted by Executive Order ) to require foreign banks and financial institutions to freeze or even repatriate foreign financial assets in response to a demand by the US government for a violation or perceived violation of US law , or for the " common good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In times of desperation , due process , equal protection and any sense of decency or fairness go out the window . <p> Under what specific circumstances might the US government be interested in freezing , seizing and/or repatriating a US citizens foreign assets ? There are many , and they include : <p> 1 . To collect from US taxpayers in arrears . Considering the pending legislation that would permit the US to revoke an American citizens passport for owing back taxes , it is not much of a reach to see the same government desirous of seizing those taxpayers other assets , including their foreign assets . <p> 2 . To prevent capital flight . At such time as capital begins its flight from the US to other jurisdictions viewed more financially responsible or at least safer from government confiscation , there is little doubt the US government will institute capital controls , limiting the ability of US citizens to move money , gold and other assets out of the United States , all in attempt to stabilize what will then be a failing US dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and more fleeing everyday , and an untold number of financial accounts held by those who still live in the United States , merely limiting capital flight from within the country may not be enough to save the dollar , even temporarily . With the knowledge of the whereabouts of all taxpayers foreign financial assets via FBAR and Form 8398 , and with foreign banks acting as reporting and collection agents of the US government , it is only one short step from forcing those with offshore financial assets to repatriate those assets to the United States where they will once again come under control of government . <p> The Only Way Out Is Out <p> Failing to file a FBAR on covered foreign financial assets is dangerous . The same is true for Form 8398 . Once FATCA takes effect , just six months from now , foreign banking institutions will be providing identities of US account holders , leaving US citizens with foreign financial assets a Hobsons choice : Either file and identify the whereabouts of their financial assets , making them easy targets for possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to Draconian civil and criminal penalties . There is little doubt that beginning next year , hundreds , perhaps thousands , of Americans will be made examples of in order to bring the herd into compliance . <p> The question that begs to be answered : " Is there any legal way to avoid identifying ( and thus making a target ) of my financial assets , while at the same time avoiding the risk of massive fines and possible imprisonment for failing to file the FBAR and 8398 ? " <p> Yes , there is . <p> Expatriation , the relinquishing or renouncing of ones US citizenship , turning in the US passport , may eliminate these reporting requirements going forward . But , the costs for some will be high , too high , including the possibility the expatriate may never be permitted back into the United States . <p> ( See the proposed " Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing the Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act , " referred to as theEx-PATRIOT Act , which provides that anyone who renounces U.S. citizenship and has a net worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least $148,000 over the previous five years would be presumed by the Internal Revenue Service to have renounced citizenship for tax purposes and would face a 30% tax on future capital gains on U.S. investments twice the current 15% rate and be forever barred from receiving a visa to enter the United States . ) <p> The decision to expatriate should not be undertaken lightly or emotionally . Many factors and individual circumstances come into play and will be the subject of future articles . <p> The endgame , however played , is not to avoid filing forms , but to avoid being imprisoned inside the United States , either as the result of you or your assets being seized , repatriated or limited in movement . <p> Jim Karger is a lawyer who has represented American businesses against incursions by government and labor unions for 30 years .

The international financiers have artificially manipulated the precious metals to a level not seen in thirty years . The Pentagon is agitating Asia in an attempt to position itself between the Russians and the Chinese , having already stationed troops at the Red Dragons underbelly down under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare on the continent , while back home in the USSA anthrax floats about to the droning background news coverage of Bostons domestic terrorism . <p> You see , I used to rant much about government corruption , but as I grew in my faith , I realized that was not my primary calling and focused more on the spiritual . I figured I was somewhat in the clear , at least for a while . You know , leave the government alone and they are supposed to leave you alone . <p> Ah , but this is a classic mistake , as explained by Nazi-resister and German Pastor Martin Niemller : <p> First they came for the communists , and I did n't speak out because I was n't a communist . <p> Then they came for the socialists , and I did n't speak out because I was n't a socialist . <p> Then they came for the trade unionists , and I did n't speak out because I was n't a trade unionist . <p> Then they came for the Jews , and I did n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came for the Catholics , and I did n't speak out because I was n't a Catholic . <p> After having had fun with the TSA in earlier years by wearing my " 9/11 Was an Inside Job " t-shirt to the airport ( and having nearly been forced to miss my flight ) , I learned the cost/benefit was n't worth it . Later , I donned a t-shirt with a Christian message . I guess pretty soon itll be considered suspicious , extremist , hate speech . <p> The Boston Massacre <p> In the film Children of Men , an explosion takes place in an urban center . Later , the characters blame the government and passively explain how whenever a politician is losing their grip on power , they resort to dictatorial tactics . <p> Boston Marathon eyewitnesses report heavy police presence and activity prior to the bombing and the fact that the government was running a drill having to do with explosives . This has gone on long enough and those of us who have done our academic research are aware of strategies of tension ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a method to execute terrorism . Drills have taken place just before nearly every recent bombing in the West . <p> So I send information that implicates the government to my stateside family , thinking yegads , they must realize it by now ! To add to the Twilight Zone , a recent episode of the Family Guy depicted the lead character blowing up the Boston Marathon , which is now being scrubbed off the Internet and TV . I do n't  know what to think of it , but wrap your mind around that one ! It was just like the time the X-Files put out the 9/11 scenario six months prior to the event itself ( maybe its that Hollywood-CIA connection ? ) . Yet my family tells me they 've had enough of me . Me too , I 've had enough of trying to shake them from their " American Dream " stupor . You cant blame me for mercifully doing my duty . <p> One family member retorts that I never mention the bad things that happen in Mexico . Hmm , let me think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U.S. citizen ? Unfortunately , yes . Is the Mexican government killing its own citizens ? No . Is the U.S. Government killing its own citizens ? Yes . Furthermore , they have labeled my Christian identity as suspect . I hear Dietrich Bonhoeffer rattling in his grave . <p> Boiling Point of No Return <p> Its reached that point where I absolutely no longer feel safe in the USSA . Trips back to the homeland are now few and very far between . First they came for the Muslims and the cults . Now they come for the Constitutionalists , those who seek the rule of law and good ol apple pie evangelical Christians ( and by Christian I am not talking about the false , delusional , right-wing , war-mongering , " I hate fags " kind ) . <p> The analysts were right ; one should n't wait to prepare during interesting and perilous times . I have only recently discovered that what todays investment gurus tell us is merely ancient and forgotten wisdom . The Book of Ecclesiastes , Chapter 11 says this : <p> Invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days you will make a profit . Put your investments in several placesmany places evenbecause you never know what kind of bad luck you are going to have in this world . <p> There are a few things I am glad I arranged a few years ago . I obtained a second passport ( now , how about a third ? ) . I broke my fiat-Chuck E. Cheese-monopoly money hypnosis by making my first purchase of gold and silver . I diversified internationally ( the paperwork to set up accounts can take a while ) . I stored food . I studied self-defense ( Israeli Krav Maga , the best there is ) . I found faith . I have options . Do you ? 
@@99475538 @3675538/ <h> BREAKING : Ross Ulbricht of the Silk Road Sentenced to Life In Prison <p> A kangaroo court in the Fasco-Communist Police State of America , just now , has decided that a man who had never hurt another human being , who created a way for voluntary individuals to trade any item they wish in a much safer environment than in the streets and provided nothing but value to others will be sentenced to life in a work/rape camp in the biggest gulag system on Earth today . <p> Ross Ulbricht , a founder of the Silk Road website , was sentenced to life in prison and , to add insult to injury , ordered to pay- $183,961,921 in forfeiture in what is clearly the US government trying to use fear/terrorist tactics in trying to ensure that no US slave ( citizen ) ever tries to cut into the CIAs drug running monopoly . <p> The real criminal in the room , may have ironically said it best , when- US District Judge Katherine Forrest said , - " Silk Roads creation showed that you thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he thought that and I think that too . - Silk Road is BETTER than the US federal law that Katherine Forrest criminally enforces. - Silk Road does not kidnap people , coerce people nor steal from innocent people as the US " justice " system- does . <p> Aside from drug laws in the US being immoral and unconstitutional the entire trial was completely rigged . - At Anarchapulco , this year , Julia Tourianski , Roger Ver and others who were involved or at the trial clearly stated what a whitewash the entire trial was . <p> And that was even before two former federal agents were- charged in May with stealing Bitcoin for their own personal gain while working undercover to help unmask Ross Ulbricht . <p> The two agents were both members of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force , which helped conduct the investigation that led to the seizure of the Silk Road servers and Ross Ulbricht 's arrest in October 2013 . Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Carl Mark Force IV , 46 , was charged with wire fraud , theft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaun Bridges , 32 , was charged with wire fraud and money laundering . <p> These were the two main investigators into Silk Road and they also turned out to be the real thieves in the case . - Yet , Ross , the only one in the whole process who has never stolen nor harmed anyone is the one facing spending the rest of his life in a cage . <p> The Silk Road trial is just another step of the USA turning into the USSA and putting more innocent people into the biggest prison population on Earth . <p> My advice to Americans is to either a ) Stand up and fight for freedom for once or b ) Get out of the US before you end up in the prison camps with Ross . <p> We have been warning for years that freedom minded people should get outside of the US and , preferably , renounce their citizenship before they turn into the next Edward Snowden , Ross Ulbricht , Aaron Swartz , Bradley Manning or others trying to live free or expose the tyranny in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Ross , his mother Lynn and his other family and good friends . - If you 'd like to help in a retrial please go to FreeRoss.org. - This can not stand . <p> Our thoughts tomorrow , however , will return to exposing the largest , most dangerous and tyrannical government in the world , warning others to stand up to it now or just get away from it as quickly as possible . <p> Evil is enabled when good men do nothing . - And , I hope that many of us in the near future wont have to utter the words , " First they came for Ross , and I did nothing " . <p> Shares <p> Filed Under : Uncategorized <p> Chuck <p> In a sense he was convicted of profiting from those who were engaging in black market activities on his web site . Is this any different from a homeowner going to prison because a drug deal goes down in his back yard ? Or , a restaurant owner being charged for crimes planned in his establishment without his knowledge . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silk Road Task force and the Judge who piled on time in prison so that this would act as a deterrent to further activity of this kind . What a complete idiot . <p> When in the history of the world has force been able to stop black market activities . Our country was founded by smugglers who knew their lives were at risk . Ross Ulbricht having to serve a life sentence for a victimless crime , has just upped the stakes in the war on freedom . Look for a general escalation as America becomes a war zone . <p> Just another reason to seek refuge in a more peaceful country , like Mexico for example . <p> Though I agree that this sentence is an atrocity , you do realize do n't  you that Ulbricht was caught contracting out murder contracts , right ? <p> The first one was staged by the same agents that later stole the bitcoins and did not actually happen . But they discovered he had contracted other killings out with a biker gang . Ulbricht got arrogant and then he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sentence , but its not just a case of a guy doing the Silk Road site . <p> kookaburra <p> ive heard that 's what the government claims but is it true ? its a sincere question , i do n't  know one way or the other . <p> but i do know for a fact the government frequently lies when it suits their purposes , on everything from the CPI , to GDP , to unemployment rate . and it does frequently railroad those it wishes to convict . <p> i really do n't  trust any claims the government makes , its best to always assume they are lying . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> My info comes from the great 2-part article at Wired , but its kind of strange for them to lie about it . They admit in full detail how they ginned up the first contract murder by busting one of Ulbrichts top assistants then forcing him to act out being murdered by a hit man , the hit man supplied by the agents . So if they admit that easily why wouldnt the other evidence be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it also was discussed that the bikers who said they did these killings also eventually stole $500,000 in bitcoin on top of the fee they changed for the killings . Actually , though , the article left it unclear as to whether anyone was actually killed . It could have just been another scam like the ones the agents pulled . <p> Yet , the fact that Ulbricht went there says he was more than just a romantic guy who was keeping things free and open . Again , I believe all drugs should be decriminalized , so its not that . Its that in a lot of ways , Ulbricht got caught up in his own arrogance and self-importance . However , if drugs had been legal there would have been no need to contract killings . But then if drugs had been legal there would have been no need for Silk Road . <p> Randy <p> Yes , I 'd like to see some evidence of a crime of ANY kind before I believe that it really happened ! Just WHO was it that was killed ? Wheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied either directly or indirectly to Ulbricht ? If the " hits " were a conjob that were either put up by or facilitated in order to trap someone , they are n't  really crimes then , are they ? Oh , am I making just way too much sense here now ? But the undercut to all that is what March Stevens said back in Anarchast #155 , do ANY of the " laws " that he was persecuted under actually apply to him in any way ? What is the foundation for saying that they do ? Is it the fact that many millions of people have had it done to them already , ergo everybody must bow to the force of the State from the first one on out ? If enough people read my papers about how the legal system is nothing but a huge scam , a fraud , and no one has any kind of legitimate obligation to be made a victim of the legal system , then it would all dry up and blow away on the next gentle breeze ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ankles and millstones on their necks to apply a little bit of logic in their life . So they wind up getting what they deserve ; being a slave in the system for the rest of their life ! Since the clerks who pose as judges work hand in hand with the prostituting attorneys , how can anybody get a " fair trial " , whatever THAT is supposed to mean ? Can anybody reading this find even just ONE lieyer/attorney who will give an honest answer to TTMQ ? ? Has anybody even tried asking them ? There is NO place on Earth where you are not going to find corruption like this until enough people are educated sufficiently to keep it from happening . ALL nation states have the same kind of criminal " legal system " , therefore this can happen anywhere you may go . The ultimate undercut is what Marc Stevens brought to light for me . <p> Randy 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Its not important if someone got killed or not . It is that Ulbricht wanted to have the killed . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to undercut his defense attorneys storyline about him being a good guy . <p> You just need to put yourself in his place .

Say that I 've got some horses or goats that I look after , and I want to sell some of them , but what I get for them is not equal in value. - Did I really sell them , or are they still mine until the equation is balanced ? - When someone uses a fiat paper currency or a crypto-currency , there is an imbalance in the bargain and someone got cheated out of their due. - Until that balance is restored , the deal is incomplete. - With fiat paper or electronic bookkeeping entries , where is the parity that makes a deal a deal , instead of a steal ? - If you- buy a TV with a stolen credit card or a bad check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may be too much rational thought for you to handle , but please make an effort here as I 'm just presenting facts .

@@99475539 @3675539/ <h> The US Leads All Other Countries In Citizen Defection <p> When it comes to extortion , or as they call it , income tax , the places where you want to be a citizen are colored green on the following map . Those countries have no income tax on individuals . The next best countries to be a citizen of , but not live in ( as per the Permanent Traveller/Prior Taxpayer PT Theory ) are the ones shaded in blue . Those countries will charge you income tax if you are a citizen of that country AND also residing there but if you are not residing there they will not charge you income tax . <p> There are only two countries on the entire planet that have the gall to charge you income tax if you are citizen , no matter where you may happen to live in the world . <p> Those two countries are shaded in pink . They are Eritrea and the US . <p> There is one big difference between being a citizen of Eritrea or a citizen of the US , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IRS ) that can and will track you down anywhere in the world to enforce their tax laws . <p> So , in that sense , the worst country in the world to be a citizen of , for tax reasons , is the US . <p> And , for this reason , the US now leads all countries in terms of defections and renunciations of citizenship . <p> WE 'RE NUMBER ONE ! WE 'RE NUMBER ONE ! <p> A record 1,335 people were listed as renouncing their US citizenship in the latest quarterly disclosure from the Treasury Department , released on Thursday .

That was up 14% from 2,999 individuals in 2013 , the previous record . <p> That makes the US the #1 country in the world in terms of citizens giving up their citizenship . No other country comes close and certainly not for the same reasons . The closest is Singapore , which averages about 1,200 renunciations per year .

You know , people like you and Berwick , who suffer from having been flash-frozen out of the womb and then making the rest of us suffer with your hideous disabilities and whining ever since . <p> But that is a story I will save for later . <p> What he is talking about , or wants me to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swirly by the 900-pound gorilla to the south because they had the misfortune of being born to one American parent in Canada , or were born in the US for no good or apparent reason before returning to Canada as children . They are , to their extreme disadvantage , American citizens , whether they know it or not . And , American citizens , voluntary , knowing , or otherwise , are required by the most dangerous criminal enterprise in the world to report and pay taxes on every thin dime they earn their entire miserable lifetimes regardless where in the world they earned them or where they live . <p> So what ? So this : <p> Canada , being just another water-boy for the behemoth to the south , will turn over all its banking data on " US persons " to the United States Internal Revenue Service starting July 1 this year .

By our calculations , you owe us everything you have ever earned plus penalties and interest , and that much again for not filing FBAR 's on your Canadian bank accounts . In short , you are fucked . And , if you do n't pay , you will be indicted and we will hunt you down like a rabid animal and cage you until death do us part . <p> Thanking you in advance for your cooperation , <p> The USSA " <p> Or words to that effect . <p> And , that 's not all . <p> Some of you ice-heads made the hideous mistake of marrying an American and co-mingling not only your bodily fluids , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you not only insured the American will go straight to tax hell , but the Canadian with them .

There is an effort to have this extended for Canadians over 50 years old , but it is a trick that will capture more of them than ever in the US tax lair . <p> Here 's how : <p> Under US law , one is considered a US resident for tax purposes if they meet the ' substantial presence ' test for " any calendar year which means they are physically present in the United States on at least 31 days during the current year , and 183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that , counting : All the days you were present in the current year , and 1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second year before the current year .

Please file your income tax return on your worldwide income and , by the way , let us know where you have every dime hidden . Or else . " <p> Bottom line ? Threats , fines , imprisonment , and serious bodily harm . <p> And insanity , of course . The greater the coercion in any society , the greater the occurrence of mental illness . It explains why most Americans of the intentional variety are crazier than a shit house rat .

Many have been doing this for years and often spend more than six months in the US each winter ( because the Canadian winter lasts a minimum of six months ) . <p> Up until now they have been left mostly unmolested by the US government . However , now , all kinds of regulations and rules are being put into place that will see many of these people deemed as US residents if they can not somehow prove otherwise . <p> That means they will then have to file a US tax return . It gets very convoluted beyond that and Jim Karger will be speaking on how to avoid the legal details which will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cabo . <p> But the gist of it is that you should not be surprised to see 60 , 70 , 80 and 90 year old retired Canadians ending up taken to backrooms at the border , interrogated and even jailed in the coming years as the US and Canadian government have now signed a complete information-sharing agreement . If their records show that they have spent a significant amount of time in the US and they have n't been filing US taxes it could mean large fines , blacklisting ( never to be allowed in the US again ) or incarceration . ( Make sure you 're taking those selfies to prove where you are ! ) <p> And the worst thing is that probably not one in a thousand Canadian snowbirds even know what is going on . For this reason , if you know a Canadian snowbird please pass on this information . <p> And , do n't forget , at the end of the day on Wednesday the " early bird " rate for the Crisis Conference in one month in Cabo , Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental American you may wish to attend to find out how to extract yourself from the depridations of the US government . 
@@99475542 @3675542/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> The Walls Are Crumbling Down Around 9/11 Why ? 28882 @qwx888882 <p> An absolutely monumental shift is in process that most have not recognized yet . The truth , or at least some truth , is about to be shown to the American masses about 9/11 . I say American masses because everywhere I 've gone in the world outside of the US , with few exceptions , almost everyone knows that the US government conspiracy theory on 9/11 is for people with tin-foil hats that are either completely zombified or are under mass hypnosis . Most of the rest of the world looks on the US like the Truman Show and ca n't believe how many people in the show do n't realize it 's not real . <p> Before we delve into what is about to happen let 's just take one last look at the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 by one of the great freedom-minded investigative journalists on the planet , James Corbett because this theory is about to evaporate in front of our very eyes : <p> C-SPAN is operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which consists primarily of representatives of the largest cable companies . While you ca n't call it " mainstream media " per se , it is available in 100 million households in the US and therefore this is significant . <p> For 40 minutes the truth about 9/11 was represented as not being crazy instead it was the exact opposite . It was positioned as highly credible and six of the seven callers thanked both C-SPAN and Richard Gage for finally bringing countless issues with 9/11 forward to the large segment of the US populace which still thinks something is n't real unless it is on their television programming . <p> This is the first time 9/11 has been presented in this way on a US based network with a significant reach . The only other time the truth about 9/11 has been presented on TV in the US in this light was by RT ( formerly known as Russia Today ) , which is a Russian government propaganda channel ( which mostly distributes the truth about the US but in a pro-Russian light ) that is beamed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US when they broadcast the truth about 9/11 on September 8 , 2013 . <p> Getting back to the C-SPAN broadcast , on its own it might not be incredibly significant but when put into context of other events there is clearly something going on and we will discuss what may be going on below . <p> Former Senator Bob Graham ( D-Fla. ) , who co-chaired a congressional inquiry into 9/11 separate from the 9/11 Commission stated , as though now it was obvious , " None of the people leading this investigation think it is credible that 19 people most who could not speak English and did not have previous experience in the United States could carry out such a complicated task without external assistance . " <p> Now , Graham says , a breakthrough may finally be around the corner with the upcoming declassification of 28 pages of the " Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11 , 2001 . " <p> Remember , as well , that Vladimir Putin threatened in May of this year that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was going to release it after NATO and the US government staged a coup and false flag attack in the Ukraine . <p> So , what is really going on and why does there appear to be a sudden opening of the American public 's eyes to some new information on 9/11 ? <p> THEORIES <p> Of course with this many things going on , so many covert operations , so much propaganda and misinformation and so many actors involved it is hard to say . But something definitely is going on . <p> These are the three theories that we consider the main possibilities with the most likely being the final one . <p> But , to start , here is the most optimistic . <p> THE MOST OPTIMISTIC THEORY <p> I have stated since the advent of the internet circa 1993 that this would result in the end of all major wars on Earth . It took twenty years to begin to come into fruition but of course most people really did not start utilizing the full modern capabilities of the internet until the mid 2000s but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1928 , " When war is declared , truth is the first casualty . " But with the internet the truth is not so easy to hide . With the global human populace becoming aware and having access to all human knowledge at their fingertips , John Kerry summed up the result , " This little thing called the internet makes it much harder to govern " . <p> It is clear that never before in recorded history have humans been able to so quickly transfer information and it is reaching a point where it is going exponential . Quickly after most false flag attacks , within hours , private investigative journalists from around the world are dissecting the info and exposing the lies . This could be seen with the false flag attack in Syria where Turkey , a member of NATO , staged the gas attacks in Damascus in August , 2013 killing more than 1,300 . The US quickly tried to pin the gas attacks on the Syrian government but within days the global populace was aware that this was likely not what they said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US government could not attack Syria as per its plans laid out by General Wesley Clark shortly after 9/11 . <p> And so , the most optimistic theory about what is going on right now with a soon-to-be-revealed information on 9/11 is that humanity has awoken and the rise of this consciousness amongst a large part of the human populace is finally driving the truth out and shining the light on The Powers That Be ( TPTB ) and the momentum is too big for even TPTB to hold back now . <p> THE MOST PESSIMISTIC THEORY <p> The most pessimistic theory , or the closest we can think up , is that this is all part of a greater script in which certain truths about 9/11 will be revealed and then quickly a massive event will so engulf the world in chaos that it will be wiped down the memory hole , much like Donald Rumsfeld announcing that $2.3 trillion was missing from the US Department of Defense on September 10th , 2001 . <p> The next day something blew up the accounting department of the Pentagon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it again . <p> This time ? Who knows . All of a sudden Ebola is the scare of the day ( as we discussed yesterday ) perhaps Agenda 21 's population reduction is about to swing into full effect . <p> Or , if you want to go down the most extreme road , maybe the rumored Project Blue Beam is about to be unleashed . <p> According to what some believe , the infamous NASA Blue Beam Project has four different steps in order to implement the new age religion with the Antichrist at its head . We 'll save you the gory details but it results in a gigantic ' space show ' with three-dimensional optical holograms and sounds , laser projection of multiple holographic images to different parts of the world , each receiving a different image according to predominating regional national religious faith . This new ' god 's ' voice will be speaking in all languages and the supposed purpose is to scare the world into a new world order . <p> We doubt this one but , as we said , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it so if you see some new god talking to you from outer space in the coming days <p> THE MOST LOGICAL THEORY <p> Russia gifted the US this 9/11 Memorial in 2005 . <p> Given everything that is going on between Russia and the US today this could be a massive power struggle between the two governments in which Putin is threatening to expose certain aspects about 9/11 and the US is attempting to front-run them with a more suitable version of events . In this theory , which is the most likely given evidence to date , it is a massive chess match . <p> The US and NATO begins to surround Russia with military bases . Check . Putin threatens to release information that 9/11 is an inside job shaking the very foundation of many American 's beliefs in their own government . Check . NATO and the US try to take over the Ukraine in a coup . Check . Putin fights back . Check . NATO and the US down a Malaysian Airliner and try to blame it on Putin . Check . Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the US begins to release a version of 9/11 to discredit Putin 's information . Check . <p> If this is the case then our theory on what Congress is about to release about 9/11 will show a mostly fake Saudi Arabia connection , with a few fall guys in the Bush administration , orchestrated as a semi- " inside job " that will so infuriate and obsess the US populace that any evidence Putin releases will be lost in the noise as the US begins to go on war footing against Saudi Arabia , creating another war and further distracting the public and furthering the tentacles of the US empire in the Middle East . Check . <p> What is the check mate of this game ? We 'll have to wait and see . With this many pieces on the board anything can happen . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Something big is about to happen . Perhaps not in days maybe not weeks but almost certainly in months . Whether it is the most optimistic scenario , the most pessimistic , the most logical , something in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens there is going to be a definite period of chaos and uncomfortableness to put it lightly . Even in the most optimistic scenario there will be chaos , especially in the US , as the US empire collapses , the dollar collapses and the world begins to pick up the pieces while tens of millions of brainwashed slaves , full of mind-altering pharmaceuticals and completely dependent on the government for survival roam the streets like zombies . In the most pessimistic , well , let 's not even go there . <p> And , in the most logical scenario we are looking at continued global turmoil and more war which will further bankrupt the US government and destroy the US dollar . Shorting the dollar by going long precious metals and bitcoin would be the play . <p> When 9/11 happened I thought and still wonder to this day if it was a cyber attack . My first thought when the second plane hit I thought a genius or perhaps a bunch of geniuses figured out how to hack into the navigation systems of the airplanes and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find trying to shut the economy down . <p> Because in those days computers were not as secured especially the airline industry which was still being upgraded from the late 1980s systems one piece at a time . <p> A lot of todays technology was brand new and on only selected aircraft . <p> SortingHat <p> Before 9/11 there were groups that wanted the North American trade union established so I thought 9/11 was a way to get it kick started where chaos would reign for a while then comes the new order out of the ashes of the *failed* old ways that was failed on purpose by greed and neglect .

Anyone who was not invited by the Mayor , or who disagreed with the official government story about the murder of JFK , was not allowed to enter public property during the government-sponsored event . <p> Although the officials did provide a remote small parking lot roped off for the dissenting views they aptly named the " Free Speech Zone " .

Ha ! <p> We were wrong . <p> Finally getting permission for us freedom lovers to walk a practically empty public street , out of what seemed like nowhere , Sheriffs Deputies appeared aggressively in shoulder-to-shoulder formation wearing full black clown suits to fit the occasion .

But that notion does n't even occupy the same continent as truth . What a central bank is really good at is creating money and then lending it to the government . <p> All new money created by the central bank without any preceding prodcutive activity or capital investment to back it leeches away purchasing power from existing stocks of money .

This makes sense because he wasted four years of his life , and likely went into a large amount of debt , to " learn " useless communist style Keynesian economics . <p> There really are n't all that many jobs out there for a person who knows less-than-nothing about economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of ignorance of economics and those include Chairman of the Federal Reserve and lead economics writer of the New York Times . Both of those positions , as point of interest are or were held by Princeton " trained " economists . Ben Bernanke was the chairman of the Princeton economics department prior to selling his soul to the devil and Paul Krugman is the most well known " economist " currently at Princeton . <p> As a point of interest , even Ben Bernanke admitted to Congress in 2012 that his own son will graduate from college with $400,000 in student loan debt ! Luckily his son did n't take Keynesian economics but a much more valuable line of study in medicine ( although many occupations in medicine are as fascist drug dealers of toxic pharmaceuticals including dangerous antidepressants which Gilbert Jr . was reported to be on ) and so there may be some job opportunities for him and he may eventually crawl out from under his debt . <p> The student loan debt bubble which has dragged millions of the younger generation into unabsolvable ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get mostly worthless pieces of paper was largely funded and championed by people like Ben Bernanke and Paul Krugman . <p> Krugman , in 2002 , called for a housing bubble when he said , " To fight this recession the Fed needssoaring household spending to offset moribund business investment . So Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble . " <p> Of course , that happened and since the housing bubble collapsed the focus has been on the college bubble to get people to spend four years of their lives getting mostly useless pieces of paper and going deeply into debt to " save the economy " . This has resulted in an explosion in student loan debt . <p> In fact , student loan debt , of which almost all of it , at now over $1.2 trillion , is held by the US federal government has far surpassed the mortgage debt held by the government . <p> Student loan debt has now surpassed mortgage debt at the peak of the housing bubble in 2008 . <p> More scary , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments ! Compare that to less than 10% of mortgagees who were delinquent when the housing bubble collapsed and you can see this is a ticking timebomb . <p> GET OUT OF SCHOOL <p> It is bad enough that most people today waste twelve years of their youth in public indoctrination camps but then to go and actually pay and go into debt for four more years is the height of ludicrosity for all but a small percentage of people who desire to work in certain specific and scientific fields ( and even that is highly debatable as even places like M.I.T. offer all their courses online for free ) . <p> In today 's age of the internet , with all human knowledge literally in your pocket and freely accessible , there is absolutely no need for these anarchronistic multi-year schools where 90% of what most people " learn " ( or better , memorize ) is quickly forgotten as it is mostly useless . <p> Technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that many things learned in school will be outdated by the time you graduate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to go for years of college to learn to be a journalist and many of the things learned wo n't be applicable by the time you finish . I spoke with Luke Rudkowski of We Are Change and Dan Dicks of Press for Truth on these very topics . They will be conducting a one-day seminar of Change Media University at Anarchapulco in February which cost $145 and will give you everything you need to know about being an investigate journalist and reporter in today 's digital age . <p> The entire concept of school is outdated . Dayna Martin , a leading expert in unschooling will also be hosting a one day seminar on how to raise creative , entreprenurial and vibrant children by keeping them out of the school system altogether . <p> And also , recently , I spoke with Skinner Layne of Exosphere about how you never learn about being an entrepreneur in traditional schools . We spoke about why getting an MBA is a complete waste of time and wo n't teach you anything about business . <p> Most of the great thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is no accident . People like Albert Einstein , Henry Ford , Mark Twain , William Shakespeare and Steve Jobs just to name a few . <p> Perhaps fifty years ago going to University and getting an MBA or a degree in Economics had some value . But it simply does not anymore in today 's day and age . And , especially after people like Ben Bernanke and Paul Krugman have been a part of destroying the economy through central bank money printing and fasco-communism . <p> Do n't end up like Ben Bernanke 's son with $400,000 in student loan debt or like 30 year old Tom Gilbert Jr . who wasted his time getting a degree in Economics at Princeton and ended up killing his father over a $400/month allowance that he felt entitled to . <p> Government intervention in the " higher education " sector has , like all government intervention , destroyed any value that it may have once had . Do n't fall for the trap and educate yourself .

" If you get engaged with one of the shooters , you 'll know it , " he tells students prior to an active shooter drill in school . <p> He did not include that they would " know it " because the images might scar them for life . <p> " When you get shot , you need to close your fingers and keep em in , " adds Tammy Kozinski , the drama teacher . " When the bad guy and the police come through , theyll step all over you , and who will be saying they 're sorry ? " <p> " Nobody !

After all , you do n't want them to break some fingers and not be able to fill out ( A ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ) on standardized tests that have led the US students to becoming some of the dumbest in the world . <p> The 69 students at the thirteenth active shooter drill in Missouri are all volunteers , and mostly come from the school 's drama class . They wear fake-bloody bullet wounds , still wet , on their necks and chests . <p> The shooting drill , the students are told , will feature " bad guys with AR-15s " shooting blanks during a simulated between classes . PVC pipes line the floor , and the lucky girl who was picked to the shooter 's hostage is thrilled : <p> " I just really wan na get shot , " she jokes . " Is that weird ? " <p> Instead of protecting the students in an armed society with arms , schools are developing cute tactics , like lockdown drills . Other schools are going further by teaching students self-defense. ( which I think should be taught to everyone young ) <p> Many believe the drills do little for the students , especially considering the kids are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by an active shooter . <p> But , in Missouri and other states , state legislatures have voted to require every school district to conduct simulated shooter drills . <p> A THIN LINE BETWEEN DRILL AND THE REAL THING <p> 17-year old Alex Bargen is a little on edge : <p> " I 've done this like 10 times , and it gets me every time , " says Bargen , who agreed to do the drill as extra credit for drama class . " This one is even scarier because its on my home turf . Its going to make me second-guess my school . " <p> " Its a bit nerve-wracking because I 'm disabled and cant really run away , " says Katie Ladlie , 15 , who is in a wheelchair . <p> One girl , Kiera Loveless , 17 , signed up because she thought it would look good on her college applications . Forget learning practical skills like languages or sciences , simply aiding authorities in violent outbursts can land you in college in the USSA . <p> The first time she participated , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . ( at least , thanks to Hollywood and video games , she probably has heard quite a few fake gunshots ) " I did n't  even really have to pretend . I kept having to remind myself this is n't real , this is n't real. " In one way , however , the drill was very real , betokening of a militarized society and the psychoses ( induced by prescription pills ) which has led to violent outbursts from people who are described as peaceful , non-violent and even loving people . <p> The drill starts to the tune of piercing fire alarms , and Lanham is taken hostage as nearby students are " murdered . " She is barked at to bang on classroom doors and urges the occupants to open them . <p> By now the hallways are filled with dust from ceiling tiles and the scent of gunpowder . Bullet shells fall to the floor , and after several excruciating minutes , a few cops run down the hallway . The gunman is shot . <p> After eight minutes and one second , the intruder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed , in police-ese . <p> Students start to stand up , some take bullets as some sort of sick American souvenir , but one girl stays lying on her face . She is sobbing . <p> THE COST OF ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS IN SCHOOLS <p> English teacher Amy Venneman was ambivalent about the drill . <p> " You want kids to feel like school is a safe place to be , " she says . " And I know those kids chose to be there , but for it to be that realistic , that 's almost too much . As a parent , I would n't want that many kids being terrified , just knowing my own reaction to it . " <p> " Its so hard to hear all of those gunshots and not freak out . " <p> One St. Louis firefighter , who found out about the drill from a newspaper , tweeted the link and commented : " B/c this is a thing , we 've failed , America .

" His concern is that the drill would " traumatize " some kids and " desensitize " others . <p> Stephen Brock , a California State University professor and member of the National Association of School Psychologists , says counselors may even be necessary for a fake shooting . <p> " Live drills can be very intense and potentially psychologically harmful for some people , " says Brock . Its not likely to cause post-traumatic stress on its own , but " if a child has some pre-existing mental health challenges " up to 20 percent of students do , says Brock " this could exacerbate that challenge . " <p> The Missouri drill has not been the only active shooter drill in a school far from it . There have even been surprise active shooter drills , such as one which took place in Halfway , Oregon . ( surely they mean " Halfway House " , Oregon ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from parents last year when they staged an active shooter drill , blanks and all , with the entire student body present . Another , in El Paso , Texas , led to screams and terror as an active shooter drill was simulated without warning to students , staff nor parents . Text messages were sent to alarmed parents . Still , school officials support their decisions with the support of local police departments . Schools in the US , in fact , actively work with police departments in an increasingly coordinated manner . <p> Amid the simulated violence in schools , students are learning valuable life lessons of love and acceptance : <p> " This drill made me think , you have to look at everyone as a threat . That sounds so harsh , but you do n't  know anybodys story , " said one student . <p> Others have been led to start asking themselves existential questions . One quiet girl named Haylee Martinez asked , " It makes me wonder , like , who these guys are who enjoy being powerful . When they hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Growing older in the US , Haylee will learn that those with guns have lots of power over her , especially if she herself does n't have weapons . <p> I have kids myself , and I would never send them to a public school , especially a US public school , because I do n't want them to be interacting with " teachers " who really support the use of violence against them to force them to sit in their rowed seats day-in and day-out and learn no practical lessons whatsoever . <p> The active shooter drills are a completely different story , however . They are completely psychotic . That people would put kids into these violent situations over a situation they will likely never experience does n't fix anything . The proper fixes would be preventative . Childrens peace of mind and happiness would be of utmost importance . Instead , finishing tedious assignments after going to school 8 hours a day ( a full-time job ) is the most important thing . <p> Peace of mind falls through the cracks , and those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even worse , their disorder is noticed and they have more odds stacked against them via psychotic medicines which work to make people more psychotic. ( while their peers get shot-up in drills in the meantime ) <p> If you are going to raise kids , there is scant a reason to do so in the US .

I had a few hour layover and scanned through a number of my usual sources of info which I usually get through my RSS reader that I use at Google Reader . For those interested , here are a few of the feeds I receive and are part of my daily reading : <p> There are dozens more , of course , but those sites alone give me all the news and analysis for 90% of the things I am interested in that I need . <p> After I check those more reputable sources of information I then usually like to take a peek at what the cattle are grazing on , so I flipped by CNN.com . I have n't paid much attention to the " US Government shutdown " which is all over the front page of CNN . The reason is , when you have a bunch of politicians fighting over whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills can be paid by printing money ) , or not , you do n't  have to be a genius to know that they will ALWAYS find a way to keep the money flowing . Sure , they may even " shut it down " for a few days , like in 1995-1996 , but its theatre . But , they would n't go away if you hit them with a rake , do n't  worry ! <p> The image that caught my eye today , however , was the following from the front page of CNN : <p> " Do n't  Shut Down the Recovery " ? Are you kidding , lady ? First of all , no such thing as a recovery exists . Government GDP figures have no basis in reality in terms of trying to gauge the real growth of an economy but there are definitely other indicators of how things are going that have some value . Unemployment figures can give you at least some idea of how things are going . Even if you take the lies the government feeds you ( the red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? <p> Oh yes , I forgot . Its one of those tricky " jobless " recoveries ! You 'll believe anything they say on that boob-tube , wo n't you ! How can I explain it to you ? You look like you might like basketball let me explain it this way If I told you the Lakers beat the Heat , tonight , but told you the final score was Miami Heat 101 , LA Lakers 0 , you would think I was crazy . And if I told you the Lakers won in a scoreless recovery , youd think I was a fool , right ? Well , that 's you , when it comes to understanding economics . So , put the sign down and go home . <p> I shouldnt be so rash with you . I apologize I 'm in a bit of a bad mood , I just spent half an hour with some of the Government henchmen of the TSA while they asked me about my underwear . Let me try to explain it to you another way . <p> Let 's say we live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , god forbid . I fish all day and you .. well , I 'm sure you can do something let 's say you make cookies all day . At the end of the day I like to give you some fish in exchange for cookies and vice versa . And everything is fine . <p> Now , let 's say , one day , we decide we need a government to oversee us ( your idea , not mine , obviously ) . So , we call over another person from another island and we tell him we want him to take ( and eat ) half our fish and half our cookies and , in exchange , he will oversee us and make sure we feel safe and will also " manage " our economy . <p> Now , because of this , we have a lot less fish and cookies . So , we are in a recession . We complain to our new government that we need more fish and cookies . He has already eaten them but he smiles a lot and comes up with some plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new green energy economy which will create jobs . But , of course , he has nothing of his own in which he can contribute , so he takes more of our fish and cookies and sells them and with the money he gets he pays us to build some windmills which also results in us producing less of the cookies and fish we need to survive so we likely end up dying of starvation but have some windmills . <p> Now , are we better off than we were before ? Of course not . <p> Is the government " creating " the recovery ? Of course not . It is just taking some stuff from us and redistributing it , in a non-free market fashion , to things they have an interest in and which usually is n't profitable or of any value , or else a private company would have done it . <p> So , sign-lady , in actuality , the best thing you could do if you really want a " recovery " would be to get rid of the governments involvement in the economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you likely are a recipient of some government largess and some political group probably just handed you that sign so , in that case , a government shutdown would hurt you personally , at least in the short term and that 's probably why you are here on my computer screen today . <p> But , you should just be honest and hold up a sign saying , " Give me money !

Not For Long ! <p> One of the most difficult things for me , personally , is seeing what is going on , knowing ( more or less ) where it is going and then talking to people who have no idea what is going on and are absolutely unprepared . <p> I often receive messages via email , through our website or on places like Facebook , which say , " I currently live in the US and survive on a pension that pays me $3,000/month which does n't  go very far in the US and so I want to look at expatriating to a cheaper and nicer locale , what should I do ? " <p> Of course , for what I see coming , I recommend anyone who can to get out of the US now while they still can . - But , in the case of those on pensions , I fear that they are being irrationally comfortable that their pension will still exist even a year or two from now . - And , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just find themselves in a new place , unable to speak the local language , without a group of trusted friends and family around them , who are dead broke penniless. - I have visions of American street people , homeless , around the world , begging for money . - Of course , that 's a big reason why we have set-up TDV Groups , which is a worldwide network of libertarian expats , to help but I think people are being far too casual in presuming their pensions will just keep rolling in for a long time to come . <p> First , obviously , is that I do n't  expect the US dollar to be around in its current form in the next few years . - Weve covered here for the last five years how the US dollar is one or two black swans from being turned into toilet paper , like in Venezuela . <p> Secondly , though , is that most pension funds are or will be in serious trouble . - Certainly Social Security ( or as it should be called , Socialist Insecurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponzie scheme now that only can pay out because the government continues to take in money from those who will never see a Social Security cheque . - That is the true definition of a ponzi scheme . <p> The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , itself , is predicting that if nothing changes dramatically , that entitlement spending ( Social Security , Medicaid ) and interest payments will surpass the entire US governments tax revenue base by 2025 . <p> And that is assuming that interest rates stay near 0% . - An increase to a mundane level of 5% would mean that interest payments alone would be nearly $1 trillion per year which would overwhelm the system completely and that number where expenses exceed revenu would go from 2025 to something closer to 2016 ! - What happens then ? - Either Social Security payments are cut dramatically or the dollar is hyperinflated neither one is good for those depending on their Social Security cheque . <p> What about private pensions ? - Well , the great majority of pension funds in the US have their assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have nowhere to go except down in value . - And many of the pension funds are geared to only be viable if they can achieve a large rate of return that just is n't possible in the current environment without taking extreme risks . <p> The only thing , in my estimation , that has a chance of surviving are personal retirement savings such as 401ks and IRAs but even those now are being targeted by the government for nationalization ( and then likely put into US Treasuries which pay 0% interest and lose , at current rates , about 10% per year in monetary inflation terms ) . <p> He stated , " Between the ( Supreme Court ) court ruling and the Obama administration 's push for stronger fiduciary rules send a strong message that government can much easier seize the pension fund management industry of course to protect the consumer .

What is the viable realistic solution put forth by Libertarians ? <p> I think you 're asking for the solution proposed by those who recognize that the government is a large criminal organization on which no one should rely for anything . There is n't ONE . There are many . Or you might be asking for the " Libertarian Party " solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know what it is . <p> One thing is for sure , and that is that continued reliance on the widespread acceptance of coercion as a means of support ( ie , any reliance on government ) is a losing strategy . Even if you die happy and comfortable , you leave a world full of misery for those who survive you . <p> My personal solution is for old people to leverage their age . With age comes wisdom and experience , and that has value . <p> I recently heard Dick Gregory talking about what amazing creatures we are . Nearly everyone alive today came from one sperm that beat millions and millions of others on the way to the egg . And all of them came from a person whose parents both came into existence through the same competition . And this goes back thousands of generations . Everyone alive today is the product of millions of years of trial and error trying to create human beings that can survive long enough to have kids .

If you ask lots of people whether or not they can think of a solution , most will probably tell you to keep relying on government . But if you ignore them and pay attention to those who understand the nature of that institution , you 'll probably start forming your own solution from their ideas , which you can then share , possibly for fun and profit . <p> I do n't  understand where you get genocide from . Do you mean that allowing people to die when you could do something about it is genocide ? What if the only thing you can think of doing is immoral ? If you do call that genocide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution . But genocide usually means taking effective action to end the lives of others , rather than failing to take any action to prevent their deaths . In fact , if you really want to do the right thing , you 'd have to let them die unless you can find a moral way to save them . So your use of the term is quite peculiar . Perhaps you can explain more ? 28886 @qwx888886 <p> I am truly mystified by your magical thinking . Whether we came from one sperm that beat millions of others is utterly irrelevant in the now . <p> Your response is just happy talk . It has no real solutions to the fact that most people as they get older can not get hired doing anything even if the are well enough to work .

If you refuse to see it , then I have no solution for you . I suppose my view of other people as assets rather than liabilities is sometimes incorrect . When someone is a liability to me ( which is what you seem to be assuming ) , I do not help , I run away . If you can find it in your heart to entertain the idea that YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS , then maybe we can have a useful discussion . Until then , have a beer or something . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> You were trying to help me find something of value in myself ? Why would I need you to do that for me ? I already have found many things of value in myself . The problem has always been that the general society finds little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in paying them for doing work . It has nothing to do with me , Dave . And just because you personally find something of value in me and you want to help and not run away ? That does n't  pay my bills , Dave . So unless that help you are going to give me has monetary value ( and can be exchanged for food and shelter ) ? Of what value is your help to me ? <p> I have pondered your reply for quite some time . I have two possible conclusions which I will write here for the benefit of other readers . As I wrote earlier , I have given up on you ( or at least the person you 're pretending to be ) . <p> Conclusion One : restless was paid by a psy-ops arm of the federal government ( or UN ) to demoralize the liberty movement because it is gaining too much steam . <p> Conclusion Two : restless is infected with some kind of mental virus or meme deployed by a psy-ops arm of the federal government ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gaining too much steam . <p> We ( Kookaburra , Margie , and I , and other readers ) are supposed to get angry and develop negative emotional responses which , over time , will be subconsciously associated with liberty-leaning posts ( like " Hey , the US govt. is no good , so better stop relying on it ! " ) and thus postpone the demise of coercive authorities by slowing us down and/or shutting us up . <p> So I had to reply one more time . Sorry if it hurts , Restless . I still recommend that you have a beer . I 'm celebrating my epiphany : - ) . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> I find it interesting that instead of replying to one or both fo the common scenarios that happen to normal people in the US , you have instead decide that I have some type of ulterior motives that have no basis in any reality . My scenarios were very simple , Dave , and should not be a challenge to you in any way . They entiail normal events that happen to normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instead of providing a solution to these common problems you would suddenly jump to the conclusion that am a government agent looks to me and others like you are n't  able to deal with the normal ups and downs of every day life . <p> So your epiphany does n't  seem to make any sense . Why do n't  you just respond to the examples , Dave ? I am drinking a beer right now , guy . What does that have to do with the common misfortunes that befall all of us sooner or later ? You appear to think that nothing like that could ever happen to you . Perhaps , you will be right . But you will be one of the few lucky ones . So that 's a philosophy and a way of living for everyone ? <p> Innovation is stifled when there is vast inequality in income amongst the populace . This is proven fact . Though you may personally be doing well , your society is stagnating . This will affect you and your kids . How could you be so blind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Restless , I agree with you totally . Sorry Dave , but your happy talk nonsense will get you nowhere . And apparently Kookaburra is another dreamer . Oh yeah , let 's just all run out and buy a farm . HOLY CRAP ! lol <p> fej <p> Restless , I agree with you totally . Sorry Dave , but your happy talk nonsense will get you nowhere . And apparently Kookaburra is another dreamer . Oh yeah , let 's just all run out and buy a farm . HOLY CRAP ! lol <p> fej <p> Restless , I agree with you totally . Sorry Dave , but your happy talk nonsense will get you nowhere . And apparently Kookaburra is another dreamer . Oh yeah , let 's just all run out and buy a farm . HOLY CRAP ! lol <p> fej <p> Restless , I agree with you totally . Sorry Dave , but your happy talk nonsense will get you nowhere . And apparently Kookaburra is another dreamer . Oh yeah , let 's just all run out and buy a farm . HOLY CRAP ! lol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victimhood mentality . it is no ones responsibility but ourselves , to work hard , secure our wealth , and provide for our own future and the future of those we care about . it is no ones responsibility to provide solutions or answers for you . <p> its a symptom of the sick american entitlement mindset to say , someone else had better be looking out for my future ! <p> the first thing will have to be to lose that mindset , otherwise , you may as well just stick with your FSA buddies in the USSA as they go down with the ship . <p> if i were older and did n't  have a secure future , i 'd look to buy some rural property , learn to grow my own food , and learn to live a minimal lifestyle , minimize expenses , and not depend on the broken system that surrounds us. 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Dude , even the best investors and hardest workers often lose all their assets and their wealth . In many cases , one major illness ( either yours or your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , I 'm a victim . You have me laughing actually at your naivete . <p> Taking care of the older , the sick , the losers in the game of life is not an American mindset . Its simple economics . As even Milton Friedman ( in 1980 , yet ) explained , something like a guaranteed income would mean less bureaucracy and more work for the younger and able-bodied as well as good for the economy . Friedman is frequently cited as a Libertarian economist as well as others . <p> You say if you were older and you did n't  have a secure future you would " look to buy " a farm . With what money would you look to buy that land with ? Your self-sufficiency dream is really just an ill-considered night mare . No man is an island and no man ever will be . <p> So , right now , I 'm seeing that this idea of yours is all about you got yours and who cares if others do n't  have any . They must be lazy or stupid . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build those walls really high and really thick . And get some guard dogs . Or even some guards . Make sure you pay them well . <p> kookaburra <p> yup , sounds like you 're not willing to lose the victim mentality . until that happens , there 's not much hope . <p> i 'm not rich , but i worked , saved up , and bought a 20 acre farm property , undeveloped , on auction for $10k a couple months ago . it can be done . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Sounds like you are n't  willing to put yourself in another mans shoes . Just because you only paid 10,000 dollars means you had to have that money in the first place . <p> So here 's a question : you have your farm . Then your wife or child hurts herself in an accident on your farm . Its life and death and you rush her to the hospital . Its serious . If they do n't  airlift her to the hospital in Chicago where brain surgeons are waiting to operate , she will die . <p> I 'm assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000.00 . <p> What do you do from then ? <p> Or , if that 's too distressing : <p> You have your farm . The Mississippi floods during the rains that have not blessed your land with moisture in 5 years . All your livestock has died , your crops have failed for 5 straight years , but you have held on . Then the rains come . Your house your kids and wife have been swept away never to be seen again . <p> What do you do from then ? 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Oops , forgot to add to that second example : your land is now underwater and will not drain for the next year as there are no services to you area . In short , you can not go back to it and your family , livestock and crops have been wiped out . What do you do from there ? <p> Margie Barnes <p> There is no reason you cant make $25,000 this year working from home . I am not talking a get rich scheme or ponzi scheme either . It requires time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve got the ability if you have the motivation . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> There is no reason you cant make $25k and also there is no reason that you can . The idea that your ability to make $25k rests solely on your personal motivation is flawed at its core and is unworthy of further consideration . As I said , good on you . Carry on . The idea that millions or billions of people could do the exact same thing if only they had the motivation is obviously nonsense . <p> Analogkid <p> We are victims when , like me you have had mandatory deductions coming out of our pay checks for social security and for me since I work for a school mandatory deductions towards my pension every pay . So if our government takes my pension and social security runs dry , I am a victim . Oh and social security is not an entitlement for me I have been paying into it since 1985 , the money I should get out of it is my money dammit ! ! ! 28886 @qwx888886 <p> You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe the nonsense put forth by the billionaires who are funding said nonsense . You are a victim of believing in that nonsense . <p> Social Security works . It is one of the few programs that works well . Furthermore , it is in no danger whatsoever from going dry for at least 50 years more and even that can be easily remedied by the simple solutions I have mentioned in other posts on this thread . <p> You should really think about being old in America . And stop talking in ifs . If WWIII happens tomorrow this or that may happen . If , if , if . <p> A victim is one who let 's others panic him into acting scared . Do n't  be a victim . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> You are talking about an imaginary future that will only happen if you believe the nonsense put forth by the billionaires who are funding said nonsense . You are a victim of believing in that nonsense . <p> Social Security works . It is one of the few programs that works well . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 50 years more and even that can be easily remedied by the simple solutions I have mentioned in other posts on this thread . <p> You should really think about being old in America . And stop talking in ifs . If WWIII happens tomorrow this or that may happen . If , if , if . <p> A victim is one who let 's others panic him into acting scared . Do n't  be a victim . <p> DoninOdessa <p> I 'm old , I may retire in a couple of years , but if I do , I will probably outlive my savings if Social " Security " fails me . I am eligible but I have n't started taking it yet . So realistically I will probably keep working until I fail me . I have a small business that pays the bills . Not much more . So , if I can keep up with the rapid technology changes in my field , I will probably eat and sleep under my own roof until I die . <p> If you are able , why not start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old folks commune . A self supporting community centered around agriculture and off grid living skills . That way when I am ready there will be a place for me and my wife to go . = If not that then classes that teach financially conservative living for older folks . <p> Or , get involved with a community charity that helps those that have similar needs as you may have down the road . Build up some good will for your own needs in the future . <p> Giving is like planting a garden . Each gift is a seed that can and often does , bear much fruit for the giver . <p> Find a need other than your own and fill it . People often get paid for such activities . <p> Too simplistic you say ? What else is there to do ? If you plan on doing nothing for anyone but yourself in retirement , you are a waste of fresh air and water . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Don , I have my plans and I am implementing them . As do you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been and hope to be in the future ) , my hard work and planning will be profitable . Being lucky means , among other things : remaining free , physically and mentally healthy , not having to support a loved one or pay huge medical fees , have people economically well enough to sell your goods or services to . <p> In other words , you might be lucky , you might not be . That 's why there is and needs to be Social Security and that is why there needs to be and should be something that Milton Friedman suggested 35 years ago : a guaranteed income . <p> Your ideas that starting and old folks commune or getting involved in a charity are not simplistic and not doing either does not imply that I am a waste of fresh air and water . I would n't consider them because they are unworkable and would do nothing related to my own survival . Contributing to charity are for those who have the time and the funds to give , not a backhanded way to possibly make an income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presevation of Social Security by actively fighting the nonsense ) and instead hoping and a praying that ones own personal scheme for ones own personal survival , is someone who is a waste of fresh air and water . Those persons would just watch as their own futures evaporate , becuase millions of people whether old or young who have nothing to eat will destroy your future as sure as theirs were destroyed . <p> Stop being selfish . Do something for all people in the United States . <p> DoninOdessa <p> Sorry , I did n't  mean to seem confrontational as the tone of your reply seems to say . Though not directed at me , you asked the question and I answered it . <p> Just curious , what part of my comment leads you to believe I am doing nothing for the greater society ? Your last sentence called me selfish . Ca n't imagine how you could possibly make that judgement based on what I said . As far as my future retirement goes my suggestion to you is exactly what I plan to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I am a bit of prepper . Not a gun toting , tin hat wearing , nutball . But , my wife and me have developed enough skills over our many years to have a fairly comfortable off grid life if the need arises . In addition to that , we have ongoing food production and preservation to feed more than just our family and friends . Is that the mark of a selfish life style ? No ! You just pulled it out of thin air . <p> A guaranteed income ? Based on what or who 's effort may I ask . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> I believe that all solutions based on solely individual survival skills or instincts are fundamentally flawed . For one , they are doomed to failure due to the fact that if there is a general collapse most or all of the skills learned and enclaves built will fall . <p> Those approaches are selfish because instead of working for the common good , which would be to fight to preserve programs that keep regular people solvent ( as opposed to large banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which help everyone ( since people with money spend that money on services and goods provided by people like you ) , they selfishly work solely on their own well-being ( and/or that have their immediate group or family ) . <p> Thus I did not pull it out of thin air . Its the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face . It wont work and it takes energy and time away from measures that will . <p> Guaranteed income comes from deep deep conservative thought and has been around for 4 decades , probably even longer . It comes from the same place that the money to buy a trillion dollars of military support every year does . Except a guaranteed income is good for the entire society including you . You can sell your services to those who have the money to pay for them . You cant sell your service to the dead broke old and poor . <p> I 'm not sure you are really that old . If you were I would think that you would know more about economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I believe that all solutions based on solely individual survival skills or instincts are fundamentally flawed . For one , they are doomed to failure due to the fact that if there is a general collapse most or all of the skills learned and enclaves built will fall . <p> Those approaches are selfish because instead of working for the common good , which would be to fight to preserve programs that keep regular people solvent ( as opposed to large banks , military services corporations , and law enforcement/prison building projects ) , which help everyone ( since people with money spend that money on services and goods provided by people like you ) , they selfishly work solely on their own well-being ( and/or that have their immediate group or family ) . <p> Thus I did not pull it out of thin air .

You cant sell your service to the dead broke old and poor . <p> I 'm not sure you are really that old . If you were I would think that you would know more about economics and history . Why do n't  you ? <p> DoninOdessa <p> Who said anything about a general collapse ? And do tell , what part of " for family , friends and more " sounds like " individual " survival ? You sound like a delusional , pie in the sky , liberal to me . If we all just come together and help each other the world would be so much prettier . Given the human condition , it ai n't  going to happen this side of Heaven . Typical of a Liberal to read what they want and not what is actually written . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer your question about my historic knowledge ) even if there is a general collapse we , as a society , will live through it just fine doing just the kinds of things I described . We have done it before and its being done all over the world now where economies are failing . Ask the Russians of recent years , the Ukrainians , or many in South American countries as well , How about Japan twenty years ago or Greece , this very day . <p> More about history : The nature of government , any government , with mankind at the helm , is to gather power and money into fewer and fewer hands . It is historic . Governments always fail . When ours does , and it will , then perhaps we will be smart enough to build the kind of system you dream of despite the selfish , greedy , power hungry , strong man that is at the root of humanitys psyche . But , your notion of transforming the existing paradigm is not going to happen . In fact as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government mandate is the basis of communism . We have all witnessed the success of that little fiasco the past hundred years . Socialism is only slightly better . But as with all human endeavors in that direction , it also fails as more of a given population discover they can vote themselves " a chicken in every pot . " Eventually its more than the chicken . It becomes the housing , utilities , free cell phones and snack foods on top of the chicken . All without a drop of personal sweat of the receivers. ( sound familiar ? ) The working population dwindles to just a few hard working , individualist , Libertarian types left holding the bag and their rifle . When there is no one left but the rich to pay taxes , the rich hide their wealth . The government handouts fail for lack of revenue and they fall to the last resort war . The system fails just like every other one has and will continue to do in the future . If you think we can change the entrenched powers that currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regulated free markets that limit monopolies is the system that has provided the most abundance for the greatest number of people historically speaking . It is not perfect and yes it is even now failing . I am sorry to say , nothing will stop that . When ? I have no idea . <p> Having said all that , none of this is what my original reply to you was about and neither was the question you asked . If the countrys economy holds on to the status quo trend of a slow death , my plans are as I said . To be in a position to help as many as I can the best I can . And that without Government help . We began losing our control of our government almost as soon as the ink was dry on the Declaration of independence and the Bill of Rights . My plans , as I said was live as though no Government help would be my way coming . There is nothing selfish about that at all . If that is all one can do at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working to steal from Peter to give to Paul , as you seem to be implying is the selfish act . Take from someone else , give it to someone not working , so you feel inclined to give less . But my preps go beyond individual survival . How much help can you offer when the eye of the storm passes over ? Any kind of storm . <p> As far as my " selfish " preps go , I live in Florida . Ever hear of a hurricane . ( I refrain from using the crude name calling at the end of that last sentence , but it is extraordinarily difficult ) My preps are more for that and general hard times and are even now doing a small bit to help some less fortunate than me . <p> Your response to me is what I would expect from a jerk troll . Not saying you are one mind you . But you do seem to be working hard to impersonate one at the very least . Perhaps you would like to retract your assessment of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 28886 @qwx888886 <p> The jerk troll types paragraphs of utter nonsense and then calls names . The article itself is about a general collapse . And yes , if you are just working for a few people you personally know , then its personal . <p> There was someone who said " we either hang together or we are hung separately . " His name was Benjamin Franklin . This basic idea of one of the Founders of the United States is , in your view , a Liberal idea . <p> I really can not spend 15 hours repudiating or correcting your deliberate misconstruing of what I 've said to you , but one of them would be as an example , you conflating prepping for a hurricane as having anything to do with your original definition of being a prepper . I told you , prepping for having a lot of people with no means is not possible for you to do and any business you have will fail if there are no customers . <p> You are in a dream world , while in the real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all governments fail or whatever . Well , that 's in the future or it is not . For right now , the only thing that might fail , according to the article we are supposedly commenting on , is Social Security for the old and sick . Meaning you someday . But will the enormous spending the military fail ? <p> No . It wo n't . Meaning , there 's a solution to the " problem " of Social Security sitting right in front of your face and instead of running away and/or " prepping " for your personal circle , you would be less selfish and at the same time more effective if you spent time working for the common good of all of your fellow citizens . <p> DoninOdessa <p> And thus our dilemma . We can not even agree on what is selfish and what is not . So , just to further explain , this time in kindergarten English , My preps are not just for my " small circle . " But as you have this entire exchange . you fail to comprehend what the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends " means . <p> Fine about the military . Should have said that from the start , instead of asking the question what can we do ? Which looks like you have now deleted . Ive been saying bring our troops home and put them to work rebuilding the country instead of tearing up others for years now . It would boost the economy for years . But Social Security will not be fixed by taking the military budget and applying it to Social Security . Oh it would be a temporary band aid for sure , but a fix , no way . A financial system based on exponentially increasing debt is the real problem . It is killing the whole country financially , not just the seniors . Using the military budget is just another can kick down the proverbial road . Not to mention the national security issue or resulting lack of it . Just my opinion . You are entitled to yours . <p> When I responded to you , it sounded to me like you felt like you were in jeopardy financially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you started bringing all this other crap into the discussion . Looking back at the beginning of this exchange I no longer see what I responded to . I 'm done with you . <p> DoninOdessa <p> And thus our dilemma . We can not even agree on what is selfish and what is not .

I 'm done with you . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> You are wrong . The math on Social Security is in and it is final . Social Security is easily fixed and as I 've said before would be ample for another 100 years with a few changes . Less military and military adventures and reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Drugs . The math is incontrovertible . <p> Increasing debt is a problem and that is totally fixed by just writing it off and letting the banks fail . In fact , that is going to be the solution , one way or another . <p> I responded to your response regarding the article . Your response was that a selfish individual can do it for him and a few of his friends and family . That is not a viable solution to a giant population of a giant country . My point in all this is , individual solutions ( " I started a business you can too " or " I bought some land you can too " ) are not viable . <p> If you do n't  fight for Social Security then you do n't  fight for yourself because you have fooled yourself into thinking that a selfish solution ( just me and my buddies ) will leave you healthy and surviving the failure of a program that does n't  need to fail and will not fail if educated people of America stand up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article itself has let me know that there are n't  many in this " community " who are thinking longterm and thinking of their country and their people . The American people . <p> The people here do n't  seem to be aware of history , economics , finance , and basic mathematics . All they can see , it is clear , is that : When the going gets tough , the tough get going . <p> Good luck in whatever refuge you think that you have secured and built .

When there is no one left but the rich to pay taxes , the rich hide their wealth . The government handouts fail for lack of revenue and they fall to the last resort war . The system fails just like every other one has and will continue to do in the future . If you think we can change the entrenched powers that currently run the world , you are indeed delusional . <p> Regulated free markets that limit monopolies is the system that has provided the most abundance for the greatest number of people historically speaking . It is not perfect and yes it is even now failing . I am sorry to say , nothing will stop that . When ? I have no idea . <p> Having said all that , none of this is what my original reply to you was about and neither was the question you asked . If the countrys economy holds on to the status quo trend of a slow death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to help as many as I can the best I can . And that without Government help . We began losing our control of our government almost as soon as the ink was dry on the Declaration of independence and the Bill of Rights . My plans , as I said was live as though no Government help would be my way coming . There is nothing selfish about that at all . If that is all one can do at least they are not a burden to the rest of us . Working to steal from Peter to give to Paul , as you seem to be implying is the selfish act . Take from someone else , give it to someone not working , so you feel inclined to give less . But my preps go beyond individual survival . How much help can you offer when the eye of the storm passes over ? Any kind of storm . <p> As far as my " selfish " preps go , I live in Florida . Ever hear of a hurricane . ( I refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sentence , but it is extraordinarily difficult ) My preps are more for that and general hard times and are even now doing a small bit to help some less fortunate than me . <p> Your response to me is what I would expect from a jerk troll . Not saying you are one mind you . But you do seem to be working hard to impersonate one at the very least . Perhaps you would like to retract your assessment of me now that I have explained it in first grade English ? 28886 @qwx888886 <p> I believe that all solutions based on solely individual survival skills or instincts are fundamentally flawed . For one , they are doomed to failure due to the fact that if there is a general collapse most or all of the skills learned and enclaves built will fall . <p> Those approaches are selfish because instead of working for the common good , which would be to fight to preserve programs that keep regular people solvent ( as opposed to large banks , military services corporations , and law enforcement/prison building projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend that money on services and goods provided by people like you ) , they selfishly work solely on their own well-being ( and/or that have their immediate group or family ) . <p> Thus I did not pull it out of thin air . Its the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face . It wont work and it takes energy and time away from measures that will . <p> Guaranteed income comes from deep deep conservative thought and has been around for 4 decades , probably even longer . It comes from the same place that the money to buy a trillion dollars of military support every year does . Except a guaranteed income is good for the entire society including you . You can sell your services to those who have the money to pay for them . You cant sell your service to the dead broke old and poor . <p> I 'm not sure you are really that old . If you were I would think that you would know more about economics and history . Why do n't  you ? <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victim . You are just wanting sympathy and you do n't  deserve it . Working for someone else just makes them rich . You are a loser . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> This is our proof ? That beause I do n't  suddenly participate in your scheme I am had the opportunity and the ability ? I am the loser ? So , in other words , the billions of people on earth who can not participate in your own personal scheme for individual wealth are all victims and losers ? And you are the winner . One of the few .

But what Marieand you , dear Margiedid not understand is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victims as you define them into the equation . If you do not ? You reap the whirlwind , Margie . And it comes for you . And believe me , it will . <p> Arrakis <p> Man do you have a bee in your bonnet ! I suggest you stop digging the hole deeper for yourself . 28886 @qwx888886 <p> Man are you a patronizing prig . Not everyone wins at everything all the time . You just sound ignorant and out of touch with reality . Its not wise to blithely ignore reality . It is folly . And everytime you say more about this issue , and do n't  account for the losers ( instead of just blabbing on about the winners ) ? You dig the hole deeper for yourself . <p> I 've given several scenarios and I can give even more and I 've asked you what you would do . Your answer is : you did n't  answer . You do n't  know what you would do . <p> Vast disparities in income among a people stifles innovation in those countries .

These are both the same thing : if the US continues to spend more and more of its treasure on military and belligerence in the world there could be a problem with Social Security . <p> My question of the author was : your solution to this possibility is not a solution . Staying where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can depend on friends and family is not a solution that would work for more than a paltry few . Friends and family are not usually that friendly and familial in America . There 's a song , an old one , God Bless the Child Thats Got Its Own . The lyrics of that song are an accurate reflection of the way things are among people . I 'm your friend , but not that kind of friend . I 'm your cousin but not that kind of cousin . <p> That is what makes me question this " solution " and ask for a better one or at least a discussion of what might be a better one . And all I 'm getting is a patronizing attitude ( have a beer , calm down , you 're digging a deeper hole ) and a few who are depending on a home business to get them through . <p> Well , to those who think the latter : if the government fails and there is massive poverty , who are you selling things to ? Your home business depends on stability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  understand why this is so hard for seemingly educated people to understand . <p> dave <p> Thanks Jeff . I have pondered for years leaving this dump for somewhere else and ultimately decided its better not to be an outsider . I think it will be difficult to continue to conduct business with the US from the outside after the ball drops which would convert me and mine to TDV Statistics . I 'm also fairly certain that the chances of getting through the foreign gates with a hundred pounds of metal even today is virtually zero . I appreciate your insights over the years and also feel for those on pensions who 's top priority is their boats and adding a pool to their backyard . Totally FN clueless .

All these prognosticators of doom have been wrong over and over again . Sinclair is still looking for gold to move above $2000 and silver above $60 dollars . What all these false prophets fail to realize is that the markets have been manipulated and completely controlled by governments and banking concerns since the creation of the Federal Reserve . The idea that markets are to big to control is a canard put forth by the manipulators , and a smallish market like precious metals is frightfully easy to control . All the talk about China and India buying gold is meaningless chatter.When a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own reasons .

Most economists realize the numbers are fudged and meaningless but if they told the truth they would be out of a job . Dick Chaneys off the cuff remark " that deficits do n't  matter " was as close to the truth the public will ever come . When will the crash come ? the answer is when the manipulators want it to come not before . The banking and monetary systems are the source of their power , without it they have no control . 
@@99475552 @3675552/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Now Is The Time To Get Into Gold Stocks 28882 @qwx888882 <p> It has been roughly three years since I 've written , excitedly , about precious metals stocks ( which has turned out to be quite prescient ) . <p> I 've never emphatically said to sell , though , either which is regretful but the TDV portfolio is not a short term trading letter and we will always have a percentage of our portfolio in this sector , through thick and thin , until The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It ( TEOTMSAWKI ) nears its final conclusion . <p> But aside from talking about expatriation , offshore banking and corporations , second passports and commenting on how badly the Western world is devolving into a fasco-communist police state I have really only talked about a few specific " investment " areas for the last few years . <p> As you know , I 've talked emphatically about bitcoin ( and our long awaited bitcoin manual free to subscribers will be out very soon ) since 2011 ( when it was just $7 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symptom of TEOTMSAWKI and a worldwide awakening ) has gotten me extremely excited about medical marijuana ( MMJ ) stocks ( of which we will now be focusing on more specifically at TDV Golden Trader ) . <p> And , of course , I 've never once talked negatively about owning precious metals bullion as an important safety hedge ( but always admonish you to make sure you geopolitically diversify as much as possible as we have written about at Getting Your Gold Out Of Dodge ) . But Ive nary said a peep about precious metals stocks in years . <p> The reason ? Bluntly , there just has n't  been much to be excited about in this market in the last three years . Bre-X could be wrought from the ashes and say they just found 200 million ounces of gold in Indonesia again and the market would have sold it down from $0.10 to $0.06 . <p> In fact , in my 24 years of following the precious metals stock sector I have never , ever seen it as bad as it has been the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January which I go to each year as a tradition I have n't even attended a mining conference in years . The last time I attended one it was like walking into a funeral of someone that no one liked ! There was hardly anyone there and those who were there , with the exception of people like the incredibly smart billionaire anarcho-capitalist , Rick Rule ( who loves a good bear market almost as much as he loves a good bull market ) , looked like their mother just died at the hands of their dog who then got shot by the police . In fact , just yesterday , one of the biggest gold mining conferences , the Hard Assets Investment Conferences announced that they will not be doing any more shows ! <p> But lately there has been a subtle change . Not a major sea change more like a small ripple rocking your sailboat after weeks of doldrums in stagnant , motionless water out in the Pacific . Like you almost forgot what the wind or a wave felt like . <p> And one stock I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shareholders , Euromax Resources ( V.EOX ) , which had been clanging about between $0.09 and $0.30 for the last year spiked from $0.14 to $0.75 in one day on the release of a broadly expected pre-feasibility report just a few weeks ago . <p> So , after years of a terrible bear market in the gold stocks nearly everyone has given up now . I get the sense there is no one left who wants to sell on many stocks . The Hard Assets conference shuttering its business yesterday may ultimately ring the final bell for the lack of interest in this market . But , as stated just above , something appears to be afoot quietly a small ripple has begun . <p> Buyouts , takeovers and dramatic price rises on news are happening in this space for the first time in years and hardly anyone has noticed . <p> GOLD AND GOLD STOCKS VERSUS THE STOCK MARKET <p> A quick look at the charts showed that gold bullion itself has n't  been this low versus stocks since November , 2008 . <p> When you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even uglier . <p> And , well , when you look at the junior gold mining stocks versus the S&amp;P over the last three years avert your eyes ! <p> It does n't  get much uglier than that . <p> But , as I stated above , I sense something is afoot . And I tend to have a knack for spotting shifts like this . <p> Certainly in risk terms I have never seen less price risk in this gold mining market than today and that includes the depths during 2008/2009 which seemed apocalyptic . That , combined with some stocks now doubling , tripling or much more on little major news is telling me that it is time to get back in this market . <p> I am not expecting a massive bull to come out of nowhere in the next few weeks or even months but it is times like these before anyone else even notices the turnaround that the big money can be made . There will be doubles , triples and more before the general investing public even begins to notice and start to pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ed Bugos , and myself , will be on the prowl more than ever looking for dramatically underpriced high quality deals . <p> PRIVATE PLACEMENTS <p> The best way to truly hit a home run if I am right is to invest in private placements of select companies which offer warrants . <p> As one example of how I have done this before , on June 2 , 2009 , at the very depths of the last ultra-bear market in the junior gold miners I grit my teeth and invested $10,000 into a private placement of Copper Fox Metals ( V.CUU ) at a price of $0.05 with an option to buy another share ( warrant ) for $0.07 . <p> Less than two years later it hit $2.80 per share . <p> If I had sold at the top ( which no one ever does , but if ) I would have sold my original shares for $560,000 and profited an extra $400,000 on the warrants or over $1 million from a $10,000 investment . <p> If you think that was good , however , I remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ernesto Echavarria a businessman based in Sinaloa , Mexico could have , if he sold at the top , made a profit of nearly half a billion dollars ! It since , of course , has dropped significantly in this bear market . <p> The point being , however , is that it is times like now that absolute fortunes can be made by investing in private placements of these companies with warrants which essentially doubles your profit potential with zero extra risk . <p> CONCLUSION <p> After a three year hiatus I will actively , but surgically , with the great help of Ed Bugos , again be positioning myself into junior gold stocks and preferably private placements in them over the coming months as well as offering TDV Premium subscribers access to the deals that Ed uncovers . <p> In fact , today , for the first time in TDVs history we have negotiated an exclusive private placement with a gold mining company that Ed believes has 10-bagger+ potential in the next year and TDV Premium subscribers ( you can subscribe here for only $25/month Basic subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ones with access to it . Of course , for those who are not deemed " accredited investors " by the people who own you ( the government ) you can also just buy in the market . <p> And we will be doing many more over the coming months . <p> And so , after many years away from this market I am publicly throwing my hat in the ring and putting my money where my mouth is and am coming back into the gold/silver stocks sector . <p> I 've focused more on Bitcoin and Bud ( marijuana stocks ) two pillars of my five " Killer Bs " for the last while but I am now positioning myself and our subscribers in one of the other key Bs , Bullion. and more specifically , the precious metals stocks . <p> So , you 'll be seeing me back talking about this sector and attending the few mining conferences that are still left standing . I just accepted an invitation to Keynote at the Silver Summit in Spokane this October between the bitcoin conferences , medical marijuana conferences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be busy . <p> But , TEOTMSAWKI only comes around so often and never before like this so I will keep pounding the pavement and working to create wealth and salvage what we have now I 'll take a rest when the dollar and the Federal Reserve are good and dead .

Many , including ourselves , say even that number is cooked . <p> Tax compliance and a payment of $450 ( not to mention many lawyer fees assuring tax compliance and filing various paperwork ) is no longer enough to get out . Now , to leave officially leave America , a US person will have to cough up $2,350 just to beg for permission to leave . This trend will only worsen . The State Department says it needs to recuperate costs for increased demand . Apparently instituting police state and bankrupting a citizenry results in a bit of extra paperwork as people flee . According to the notice : <p> 1 . Consular officers must confirm that the potential renunciant fully understands the consequences of renunciation , including losing the right to reside in the United States without documentation as an alien . <p> 2 .

" Ron Paul at the GOP Convention , Tampa , FL 2012 <p> As an anarcho-capitalist it is difficult for me to watch the election year shenanigans . But , it is still hard not to watch , like a car wreck , as Ron Paul supporters got the cold shoulder and the message . The Republican Party played some awfully dirty pool . Now the Ron Paul supporters have done the only sensible thing . Theyve taken their ball and gone home . <p> Ron Paul never had a real shot at being POTUS . But it was disgusting to watch the Republican National Convention make rule changes specifically designed to weaken Dr. Pauls delegate count , and to make it harder for non-establishment candidates to gain any traction in future elections . Although , that 's just what happens in the world of politicsdirty pool is just " pool " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 Maine delegates , the RNC made sure that Dr. Pauls name couldnt even be submitted for nomination . The euphemism from the RNC is about providing " a united front . " The reality is they are taking away even the illusion of choosing real change , the sort that would have any effect on the fasco-communist police state axis of power in the US . <p> Now the Ron Paul supporters see just how hopelessly corrupt the Republican Party the fascist wing of the single fasco-communist ruling party is and they have staged a micro secession in Tampa . We here at TDV truly hope that those walkouts have lost all faith in the political process and that they have divorced themselves spiritually and emotionally from this farce . In other words , I hope they have achieved true individual secession and independence . Because , folks , doing so is the only answer . <p> If at first you do n't  secede , try , try again <p> A lot of Ron Paul supporters are undoubtedly people who became disillusioned with the political , social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a paleo-conservative background , almost as many from an Austrian school economics and libertarian background . There might have been a few anti-war hippies and commies who actually started understanding economics because of Ron Pauls unrelenting message . <p> These are the people who correctly concluded the US was doomed . Despite their hope in Ron Paul riding in on a white presidential horse , however , Paul had little actual chance of winning . Although he likely actually beat Romney ( the Republican party controls the puppet strings ) . They change the rules when it suits them . And if Dr. Paul somehow got passed that , then itd be the Obamadragon . And if he got past that , hed be pulled in a backroom to show the JFK assassination from a completely new angle , and if he did n't  then back down , hed be JFKed . Its time for his supporters to accept with finality how hopeless what they are trying to achieve is and as much as I hate sounding like that fascist fundamentalist Mike Huckabee move on . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a political quack and who support Romney because they think he is a capitalist patriot whose policies will restore liberty and prosperity to the land . Ha ! Romney is an empty-headed privileged fascist who will do nothing substantially different from what Obama would . No matter who wins , expect more military bullying overseas by the US , more currency debasement , more regulation of personal and private affairs , more state kidnappings of dissidents , more poverty , and more misery . <p> If there is indeed a **31;1327;TOOLONG , **25;1360;TOOLONG , it will essentially be fascists taking a few pot shots at communists just like in 1939 Germany . Then the comically over-militarized local police would come in to fill the gun-toting rednecks with hollow point rounds and toss the survivors into FEMA camps . <p> But like TDV correspondent Jim Karger said in his recent excellentarticle , not only would nothing be different whether its Obama or Romney , but the masses will never fight back anyway . They have done a wonderful job of proving that over the preceding decades . They have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forcibly vaccinated their children , charged them rent to live in their own houses , gave them fines for driving too fast or too slow , and forced thousands of laws upon them so that it is impossible not to break them , and then throw them in cages . <p> Surely , if Ron Paul were to win the presidency , the dirty bombs would have gone off like firecrackers on Chinese New Year . That 's it . Its over . Now that Ron Paul is officially out , this ship is definitely as good as sunk . But it probably really did n't  matter anyway . This ship would very likely have gone down even with him at the helm . It would have been like nominating him captain of the Titanic as the great ship rose broken into the air and those poor passengers came falling down , bashing against the inner workings of the great machine . Things are just too far gone . <p> A libertarian president would just have made the masses blame the inevitable economic and social collapse on unfettered capitalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown state controls . Not that a thoroughly ruined US really matters in the bigger picture ; the US is 5% of the world population , and except for North Korea , full of the most brainwashed and enslaved people on Earth . From here on in well just take awkward enjoyment in watching them eat each other from our flat screen TVs in Latin America or Asia . <p> For all the good Ron Paul did in spreading the understanding of liberty to a few million people , his campaign also put the spotlight on the growth of the liberty movement . The mainstream media tried to ignore it . Then they could n't . You can bet that the powers that be have taken notice . The Ron Paul followers have been very vocal . And now the psychopaths who run the police state know who the potential troublemakers are . Im surprised the Ron Paul supporters made it past the goon squad outside the RNC without incident . <p> Note how the term " anarchist " **25;1387;TOOLONG on an almost daily basis . The mainstream media applies this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military thugs . You will see more of this , with anyone who questions the role of government like Ron Paul supporters , libertarians , voluntaryists , and market anarchists all being lumped together with actual violent militant revolutionaries . <p> During the next few years , the US will be locked down like a prison . Heck , we may not even get an election ( though they may wait till 2016 to cancel the elections when their leftist strongman or strongwoman takes over ) . The Paulites , libertarians , and anarchists may not be the very first to be disappeared and to fill the FEMA camps , but theyll certainly get their turn . As happy as we all are that Brandon Raub was released , his treatment should serve as a sobering warning of what 's to come .

@@99475557 @3675557/ <h> Why Burger Kings Expatriation Is The Moral Thing To Do <p> It was announced last week that Burger King had bought a famous Canadian restaurant franchise known as Tim Horton 's to reduce the amount of taxes they " owe " to the US government . An upcry arose ! <p> As usual the mainstream media and the people who watch it have the story totally wrong . Burger King is not giving US taxpayers a " raw deal " by looking to move abroad so as to save on profits which are not repatriated . Instead , the iconic fast food burger chain is doing the moral thing by moving its tax-base outside the war-mongering , highly socialist US federal government 's reach . <p> The mainstream media will never give you this side of the story . This obvious trend towards expatriation terrifies the talking heads . You have to come to alternative media sources like The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) Blog and others to get the truth . As Howard Kurtz writes at Fox News , <p> I feel confident in saying that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies avoiding taxes by incorporating in another country . <p> If this is the case , it is because Americans love bombing other countries . They lust for blood . I can think of no other logical explanation Americans would want the machine in Washington to continue being fed . Burger King is not the first company to make the moral decision to leave the US tax farm . Many American companies are going abroad as many as 70 . These so-called " inversions " . Even the most American of investors stand behind the inversion . Iconic American billionaire , Warren Buffet , coughed up $3 billion so the hamburger chain could buy the Canadian donut outfit Tim Hortons . Buffett did this just one month after Obama denounced inversion tactics as an unpatriotic tax loophole , ordering regulatory changes to undermine them . <p> The debate has been totally laughable . It is truly shocking how clueless Americans are about why these companies ( and citizens ) are leaving the US in droves . The US is not competitive ! For a country that claims to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . <p> US tax policy has made the US uncompetitive globally . The nation has the highest effective corporate income tax rate in the developed world . <p> And the US taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries of US companies once that money comes back to the US . US corporations instead have chosen to keep more than $1.9 trillion earnings offshore abroad . The moral thing to do . <p> The past couple years alone have seen dozens of well-known US companies move abroad . Many have at least considered it . All this just to lower their corporate income tax . All the politicos in Washington would need to do is lower the US corporate income tax , but they are Marxist and Keynesian idiots . In the US , the wealthy are now seen as the cash-cows for the poor thanks to the nanny state 's government welfare . As Nick Giambruno of International Man points out , Medtronic , Liberty Global , Sara Lee , and Omnicom Groupthe largest US advertising firmhave all moved abroad . Pfizer looked into moving abroad in order to cut its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulled doing the same . <p> Walgreens was looking at Switzerland . Its tax rate would decrease to 20% down from 31% . The move would save around $4 billion over the next five years . Quoting an international tax lawyer , The New York Times stated , " it takes one company with enough public recognition to start a domino effect . " <p> Walgreens backed off due to the public scrutiny . By moving , though , Walgreens would have gained a big advantage over its competitors who will all be paying the effective US corporate tax rate . I still think they will do it . They 've tested the waters . And now Burger King has made the move . <p> What a joke ! Immoral ! Sorry , Chuck , but immoral is bombing nearly every country on the planet or at least intervening to the tune of millions dead and forcing people at gunpoint to pay for it . <p> These companies do n't want to keep giving parasite psychopaths in Washington DC more money . It 's immoral to keep funding Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying taxes in less war-prone nations . Inversion is a matter of life-and-death for people all over the planet , including in America . While people abroad depend on the inversion of American companies to slow the tide of American-led war , Americans depend on US companies not inverting so that they do n't starve when their food stamps run out . <p> I am not so much championing Burger King as much as I am championing the notion of an inversion . Personally , I think Burger King produces nutritiously void foods and promote an unhealthy and early-to-the-grave America ( albeit admitting I have eaten it after a long night out and it has been delicious and appreciated at that moment ) . As far as I know , the only thing I support in their business model is the company 's long history of aggressive tax-reduction strategies , which is something we champion here at TDV as well as its ancilliary businesses TDV Passports , TDV Offshore , TDV Wealth Management and others . <p> By operating a tax-efficient overseas regime , with income coming through Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign income in the past three years . Clearly Burger King wants to lower that rate . What does Burger King have up its sleeves ? As an American company Burger King can not cut its current American tax bill by routing franchise fees from its US franchisees via Switzerland . If they bought Tim Hortons this would not apply to the Canadian company . <p> At this point , for a company clever on taxes like Burger King , despite its status as an American icon , Obama 's vision for a 28% corporate tax rate wo n't be low enough . <p> And this is all besides the fact that THERE IS NO CORPORATE TAX . Corporate tax is always passed on to the consumer it is a tax on consumers . Yet , look at all the tax slaves in the US rising up angrily that a company is trying to find a way for them to be extorted for less money . <p> It 's a thankless job helping people by always doing the moral thing ( in this case avoiding taxes at all costs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their service .

There will be no real safety in serving the civilian side of this forced labor for the state , however . H.R. 748 makes all persons between 18 and 25 able to be inducted into the uniformed services should the state determine there is such a need .

It truly has become a definitive race between the forces of good and the forces of evil ; between those who seek to leave alone and be left alone , vs. those who seek to plunder and rule their fellow human beings . <p> Unfortunately for those who yearn for freedom ( though fortunately for those who seek to exploit them ) , a pair of beguiling yet highly destructive fallacies have risen to prominence in libertarian circles : " Public freedom " and " collective emancipation " . <p> You have probably never heard of either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per se but the ideas they embody are alive and well . <p> What is meant by " public freedom " ? It is the erroneous notion that freedom is a condition of society . Whenever you hear someone talking about " a free society " , or expressing a desire for " the world " to be free , you are observing that fallacy being propagated . <p> The fact is , freedom is NOT a condition of " society " . " Public freedom " is every bit as absurd as " public rights " and " public property " . There exists only one kind of freedom : Freedom of the individual . Think about it : To the extent that you the individual are free , you have freedom regardless of the rest of the individuals in society , or the world . Yes , freedom is alwaysand everywhere an individual phenomenon , regardless of how many individuals in a given society enjoy it . <p> The idea that " the world " has to be made free in order for the individual to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ruled in order for the individual to be safe . <p> The fallacy of " public freedom " paves the way for the other fallacy , " collective emancipation " : The absurd notion that freedom must , or even could , come about through the deliberate collaboration of a greater " We " . Whenever you hear someone saying , " We need to " or " If enough people " ( relating to the quest for freedom ) , you are observing the fallacy of " collective emancipation " being propagated . <p> While the destructiveness of the fallacy of " public freedom " lies in its capacity to trigger despair , the destructiveness of the fallacy of " collective emancipation " lies in its capacity to misallocate the resources of those who seek freedom . " Collective emancipation " demands the individual divert his or her precious personal resources such as time , energy , money and mental focus to " the greater good " of collective initiatives for freedom " public freedom " , that is . <p> The fact is that one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single individuals participation in a collective initiative does not change the outcome at all ( with only extremely rare exception ) . <p> Examples of such collective initiatives for emancipation include : All political action " for freedom " ( i.e. voting or campaigning for Ron Paul ) , civil disobedience , demonstrations and protests , armed revolution , participating in anonymous hacker attacks , limiting oneself in an effort to collectively starve the beast ( agorism ) , etc . Do you see the common thread in all of these ? They all require the individual to sacrifice his or her precious resources ( some more than others ) . They all promise " public freedom " ; none hold any promise for making the individual participant any freer only poorer . Even if the collective goal is in fact accomplished , it would be accomplished even if that single individual you had not participated . In a word , the common thread running through each of these is collectivism self-destructive , impotent collectivism ( though , of course , always for " the greater good " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the individual there also exists only one path to freedom : Self-empowerment . Anything that empowers oneself the primary individual is a step on the true path to freedom . Ask yourself : Does my vote in an election actually result in a different outcome than if I did not vote ? Does my participation in acts of civil disobedience , protests , revolution , etc. result in me actually being freer afterward than I would have been had I not participated ? If you can be reasonably certain in advance that the answer is " no " , then it is a false path to freedom . It does nothing to actually empower YOU . But it sure will waste your precious resources which you could have used to become freer in real terms and it may even result in the loss of what freedom you have , or even your life . <p> Libertarians easily grasp how the phenomenon of a smoothly functioning and prosperous economy can not result from central planning , yet astonishingly most of them readily assume that the phenomenon of a freedom-supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it about . In fact , just as a prosperous economy arises from individuals everywhere each independently pursuing his or her own interests ( think " I Pencil " ) , so the infrastructure of freedom can arise and become accepted as the norm only through individuals everywhere each independently pursuing self-empowerment . There is simply no other way . <p> Note that this is not the kind of phony " self-empowerment " promoted by new age or self-help gurus . The self-empowerment referred to here is anything that actually increases one 's power over one 's own life in a real , palpable sense . Things like money , knowledge , and good health ( especially these three ) . Things that expand your options . Things like camouflage techniques and privacy enhancements . Self-sufficiency skills and tools . Strong value-reciprocating relationships and useful connections . Developing the skill of spotting trends and hidden dangers in order to position yourself ahead of the crowd and out of harm 's way . Security-enhancing technology such as wireless security cameras . Bitcoin and encryption . Foreign residency and second passports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors to vast new opportunities . The list goes on and on . <p> Now , there is almost certain to be someone so thoroughly brainwashed with the collectivist mindset ( itself a product of the State ) as to say , " But ' if every libertarian ' did as you suggest , there would be no one to stop the State from running amok ! " First of all , it is ludicrous to even contemplate that this simple message could possibly be powerful enough to perceptibly dampen the efforts of " the greater libertarian collective " . But just for fun , here is an eye-opening exercise in collectivist daydreaming : " If enough people " focused all of their personal resources on actual self-empowerment , instead of wasting them on collective initiatives where the single individuals participation does not change the outcome at all then the oppressive yoke of those who rule their fellow humans would disintegrate as the market rises to fill the demand for self-empowerment technologies and techniques . <p> But the phrase " if enough people " amounts to nothing more than impotent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " actually did the right thing , then that would happen regardless of whether or not you wished for it , or participated . On the other hand , well thought out self-empowerment efforts lead to maximum freedom and the wonderful part is , self-empowerment works regardless of what the greater " We " does . <p> Nothing could possibly be more gratifying to the parasitic elite than watching those who yearn for freedom waste their precious resources on impotent endeavors , and encouraging others to do the same . Are you playing into their hand ?

Government , which is an artificial , unnecessary construct has made a concerted effort to make economics sound as difficult as possible for decades . The reason ? They can use your programmed ignorance as the publicly " educated " to confuse you about how they manipulate the economy for their benefit . <p> Economics is simple . Nearly the full extent of it can be taught in a near pamphlet , as has been done in Henry Hazlitts " Economics in One Lesson " . That is the full extent that any individual needs and should know about economics . <p> Those four to eight years in college to get a bachelor or PhD in Economics ? Pure mental masturbation at best . <p> ECONOMICS ON AN ISLAND <p> Most everything can be broken down to its most basic components in order to simplify things . When faced with a large question always try to break it down . Let 's do that with economics to show how simple it is and why central banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes no sense in a free market . <p> Let 's say that you and four other people live on an island . As far as you can tell there are no other humans on Earth . Each of the people on the island do things which help the collective although they have selfish reasons for doing so ( ie. they want something in return ) . <p> Perhaps you fish . Another gathers coconuts . And another is good at building and repairing thatch huts and collecting rainwater for drinking . Amongst yourselves you trade . You offer some fish for coconuts , water and a nice maintained hut . The others offer their services in trade for your fish . <p> In comes the fourth person a bearded man with no particular skills who thinks he is better than everyone else . He produces nothing but tells you that he has come up with a better system using " money " where you do n't  have to wait until the man who gets coconuts wants fish before you can get coconuts . Instead you can trade money perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pictures and denominations on it . <p> So far it does n't  sound too bad . But here is where he becomes a " central banker " . First , he pulls out a spear and tells you that you must , under all circumstances use his money and no other money . Then , during times when the fishing is poor or there is a drought he tells you that he can help everyone out by " stimulating " the economy of the island by drawing up more money . <p> If things got really tough he could double or triple the amount of money on the island . At first , everyone thinks they are richer , so they buy more fish or water or housing than they otherwise could afford . This ends up using up more resources than would otherwise be prudent . Soon the money has circulated and now coconuts just cost twice or three times more than before in currency units . The same for fish the same for water and housing . <p> How has this central banking scheme " helped " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce resources as it fooled the participants in the economy for a period of time into thinking they were more wealthy than they really were . <p> That is all there is to central banking . Of course , what then happens is the entire island gets corrupted and people begin to look to get favors from the central banker to get the newly created money first . And , then , if the printing of money begins to get out of control and the central banker stops printing money in order to salvage the " value " of the money before hyperinflating it into worthlessness , because of the fact he uses violence to enforce its use , all of a sudden there will not be enough money in the system to transact basic transactions and people will not be able to survive . There will be either war ( over the resources ) or starvation as the denizens of the island find themselves unable to acquire the currency they are forced to use to survive . Either that or the banker will take control of your future productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into slavery just to survive . <p> The only thing missing on the island at this point is someone to start a fascist media conglomerate who , in cahoots with the central bank , put out the following magazine cover showing the one non-productive member of the island as being the hero : <p> THE HERO ? <p> " Ben Bernanke saved the economy , so why does everybody hate him ? " <p> First of all , not enough people know enough about him to hate him . If they did , however , a public sodomization and lynching like Hillary did unto Khadaffi would be in order . <p> Here is the man who destroys economies . The man who funds and makes all wars possible . The man who puts senior citizens on treadmills and makes them run just to be able to eat cat food . And he does it all with a smug look on his face reminiscent of the last time this kind of nonsense was attempted : <p> Remember that one ? Three of the smuggest looking conmen in the world posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy which they all brought about . That Slime cover story came out on February 15 , 1999 proclaiming that the money changers had saved us all from the global economic meltdown . <p> Howd that all work out for everyone ? <p> Are they pulling the same tricks again now to try to salvage a few more months of the fantasy economy ? Probably . <p> The beautiful thing , however , is that all those anachronistic media organizations such as mainstream television and newspapers are dying a rapid death . I sat in the office of the President of USA Today , Tom Curley ( now CEO of Associated Press ) , in 2000 and told him that inside of ten years hed be irrelevant . <p> I declared victory when in 2008 Gannett ( the parent of USA Today ) hit $1 after being $60 in 2000 despite the dead cat bounce it has done since . <p> Today , The Dollar Vigilante and its parent company , TDV Media , is one of the fastest growing media organizations on the planet . <p> Why ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution is going on whether you realize it or not . The internet has exposed the cockroaches . Government , nor central banks , have any right to exist . Only propaganda and subterfuge has enabled them to survive this long . <p> DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? <p> If you understand what central banking is really about then you are preparing now for the final stages of the collapse of the western monetary system . This means investments in hard assets such as gold and silver bullion and speculative bets in a final inflationary bubble into precious metals stocks . If you understand central banking and the governments that are subjugated to them then you know by now to get a significant portion of your assets outside of the control of the government that purports to own and control you . You understand that getting a second or a third passport is now as common sense as saving a significant percentage of your income in the past . Or , if you want to stay and fight in the coming years , you understand the importance of becoming self sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself via armaments . <p> And if you understand all of this then you have broken out of the brainwashing of your public education and are thinking for yourself .

@@99475564 @3675564/ <h> How to Escape from Jail , Twice , Like a Vigilante : The Weekend Vigilante December 14 , 2013 <p> Editors Note : The following post is by TDV Editor-in-Chief , Jeff Berwick <p> Hello from Miami , <p> I apologize for again missing last weeks Weekend Vigilante , but I have a pretty good excuse : I was in jail in St. Kitts in the West Indies ! <p> As you can glean from my current location , I have escaped . The story of what happened might be quite interesting to you and also instructive on how to get out of jail in smaller countries like St. Kitts . <p> I had been in St. Kitts attending the Liberty Forum conference ( which was excellent by the way ) and part of the conference had a focus on getting St. Kitts economic citizenship ( which is something TDV Passports offers ) . There were also some top government officials from St. Kitts who attended to promote to the audience of wealthy people on how to invest in and become a citizen of St. Kitts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after presentations and meetings during the day and often going long into the night , I and two other younger conference participants headed off to a bar called Vibes , one of only about three bars on the entire island . I had actually previously named it " Bad Vibes " , presciently , due to there being a few too many police officers and military guys with machine guns around for my liking . <p> The two guys with me from the conference had spent a fair amount of time in Nevis drinking something called " Bumble Bees " which apparently has some psychoactive elements , like absinthe , that can make you pretty wild and crazy and they were . I , on the other hand , was my usual self . I had a number of drinks , but remained pretty calm . <p> It was getting pretty late and , to be honest , my memory is n't 100% clear as we had been drinking quite a bit . But , the last memory I had was that we were outside of the bar near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one security guard from the club , one military guy with a machine gun , and two cops in typical US style cop gear ( bulletproof vests and the like ) . <p> I believe I might have said something like what I normally say , " What do you criminals want ? " to the cops and the army guy . <p> Things began to escalate from there and then the cops got quite rough with me and began rifling through my pockets very forcefully . They all had guns and I did n't  so I did n't  try to stop them , but let them know that I found what they were doing to be a criminal act of aggression against a peaceful person . <p> They did the same with my friends and then all of a sudden one of the cops pointed to a small baggie of what looked like cocaine on the ground about ten feet away . That 's when their aggression really escalated . They started pushing us and demanding that we admit it was ours . I cant speak for my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . <p> They kept getting more aggressive ; mostly focusing on me now and then brought out some handcuffs and kept yelling at me and physically grabbing me very forcefully . <p> I tried to explain that even if that was my little baggy of cocaine , it is n't a crime because there is no victim . If there is no victim there is no crime . And , in fact , the only crime being committed here was assault with a deadly weapon against us by the police . <p> Apparently they did n't  like my take on things too much . They grabbed me and very roughly threw me into a police car and then drove off with me in the car . They drove very fast and continued to shout at me , push me and make threats . It actually , at one point , was so bad that I considered ditching out of the car as they drove as they were almost making it seem like they were going to take me somewhere and make me " confess " . I did n't  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to feel quite a bit of fear ( something I later felt bad about more on that below ) and decided maybe it was time that these guys understood exactly who they had just kidnapped . I told them that I was just one of the main speakers at the conference where numerous high level government officials were and that my worldwide media and services organization has been bringing investment into St. Kitts and had planned on bringing a lot more . <p> They became a little less aggressive after that but did n't  totally stop . So , I did what I often do when the government or police of a country is aggressing against me : I told them I am journalist with a very large audience of readers . <p> That quieted them down even more , but they still were being quite aggressive and so I did the last resort . I started bringing up the topic of lawyers , naming off a few of the top lawyers on the island with whom I had good relations and had just been meeting with and assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think at that point they realized they did n't  have some dumb kid tourist that they could shake down and we took a turn off and ended up at the police station . <p> Once there the police captain on duty was quite good . He was very calm and patient , finally getting the two young ( 20s ) steroid monkey cops behind me to stop hooting and hollering . He then asked me to go to a back room while he spoke to them . <p> I could hear the conversation from the dank , dungeon-like holding cell I was in . <p> The one larger cop kept affirming that he had found narcotics in my pocket , which I knew to be a lie . They talked about it for quite some time and they then called me back out and asked me if I had any narcotics in my pocket . <p> I told him that I absolutely , unquestionably did not and that I even had witnesses ( my two friends ) who saw me getting searched and nothing was found and restated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite some distance from me , as we all did after the police pointed at it . <p> The police captain again asked the cop if he is sure it was in my pocket . The cop looked a little less sure , but he also looked angry that I was putting up such a fight . But he then signed a piece of paper that stated that he had found something in my pocket . <p> After he had done that I continued to tell the police captain all that had transpired , that I had witnesses that could corroborate and told him my background . He even went on Wikipedia and on YouTube to watch some of my videos and seemed to believe me . <p> He then asked me to go back to the cell and I could again overhear their conversation . The police captain got quite stern with the cop and said , " This guy is a big businessman and is here at a conference with government officials promoting the island for business . Are you absolutely sure you found it in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet for a few minutes and finally the police chief opened the door and was quite nice and stated that both cops admitted they did n't  find anything in my pocket . <p> " Good ! " I said , " Because that is the truth ! " <p> I began to walk to the door and head to my hotel when he stopped me . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said , " But they have already filed the allegation and so I now have to keep you into custody until you are cleared . " <p> I looked at my watch : 3am . <p> " Well , how long will that take ? " I asked , irritated . <p> " I need a superior to sign off on your release . I know you are innocent , but I simply cant by our rules and the earliest I can likely get a hold of them will be 6 or 7am , " he said . <p> I was very unhappy to hear this , but he explained how it all worked and was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OK , well , I am tired anyway , just get me a bed and I 'll sleep until they get me out , " I said . <p> " There are no beds you can stay back in the cell on the floor or you can sit out here with me in the chair you are now in . " <p> I could n't sleep in either , but luckily I had my cell phone so I passed the time with it and let people know I was in jail in St. Kitts . Mostly just because I thought it was funny . <p> Little did I know that my network of tens or hundreds of thousands of people around the world would take it much more seriously than I did ! <p> Much to my surprise , less than 5 minutes later an entire uproar had erupted amongst the Dollar Vigilante and anarchist communities and this meme ( above : Free Jeff Berwick ) started to go viral . <p> I laughed at the idea that I was in jail in St. Kitts on my smartphone watching this all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could go have a cigarette and he said that I was not allowed to smoke in jail . <p> " Well , that 's the final straw ! " I said to myself and I began to plan my escape . <p> The jail was more of a big house with numerous rooms and there appeared to be only two people on duty so I managed to find a way out through the back and walked out , lighting a cigarette and walking to my hotel to get some sleep in a good bed while subconsciously humming this song in my head : <p> Its a very small island and my hotel was actually right across the street so I walked over and past one of the bellboys who looked surprised to see me as everyone on the island who was awake was aware of my arrest . <p> " Oh good , you were released , " he said . <p> " No , " I responded , " I just left . " <p> I made my way to my room when the police captain came jogging up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Whyd you do that ? " <p> I responded , " Because I do n't  like it there . " <p> He motioned to come with him without making any act of aggression and I just sighed and went with him , saying , " This is ridiculous you know I am innocent , why do I have to sleep on the floor all night ? At least let me smoke . " <p> He responded , " We have rules , I 'm sorry . " <p> As we returned to the police station/jail the phones started ringing off the hook . Apparently someone on Facebook had found the number of the police station and dozens , if not hundreds of people were phone bombing the police station . <p> I could generally hear the conversations as I was now sitting at his desk and everyone was quite cordial , but were letting him know that if I was not treated well , there would be repercussions on an international level . <p> After quite a few calls he looked up at me and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod . <p> Another call came in from a TDVer from Tokyo . " You have a call from Japan , " he said , " he wants to talk with you . " <p> I answered and it was a very nice , concerned person who wanted to verify that I was not being unduly harmed . I thanked him for his concern and let him know that I am being treated quite fairly except for the fact I could n't smoke . <p> By then it was 7am and the phones continued to ring . Then one of my lawyer friends from the conference had walked over ( she only lives about a block away , it is a very small island ! ) <p> She brought in a criminal lawyer and they explained to me that because the cop had officially charged me , despite recanting his statement afterwards , I had two options . I could try to go to court immediately and get bail , but they said because I am a foreigner they may not grant it because I may be a flight risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> They then said that the other option was to request a court date as soon as possible to have me released of the charges and freed . But , they said , it might take a few days and since it is nearly Christmas the courts might soon be closed until after New Years ! <p> They then went off to the court house to look at options . <p> At that point I again got concerned . I did not want to sleep in that jail for a month ! Although I did think that if I could get a decent bed , it might not be too bad since they had WiFi and I had my laptop that I had just gotten from my room and maybe I could finally finish that book I had been working on . <p> But this no smoking thing just would n't work . <p> I began planning my next escape . As I did , I Skyped my wife and told her the situation . <p> My wife is the stronger one in the family . As I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across , " St. Kitts is one of the most strict in the entire region for drug laws often holding people for months or years on a small possession charge . " <p> I then REALLY started planning my next escape . <p> By now the night police captain was off his 12-hour shift and he came and apologized and told me he had been trying everything he could to get me out , but it was now in the hands of the system . <p> The new shift of all female police people were now at their desks , answering the never ending stream of phone calls still coming in . They looked very confused . One of them asked , " Who are you ? " <p> I told them to look me up on the internet . <p> They all sat around a computer giggling and looking at photos and videos of me . " Well , this is better than the all male night crew , " I thought . <p> But I still was going to get out of there one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the people trying to help me were now regularly calling the Prime Ministers office , among others . <p> By then it was 10am and having not slept at all the entire night I went to pass out on the floor in the jail cell , where I had requested to go because I could n't sleep in the chair in the office . <p> As I passed out I continued to hear phone calls and a general frenzy . I figured if by the time I woke up that I had n't  gotten bail or a very quick trial to exonerate me , then I would call in one of many friends in the area with yachts and arrange a pick-up for my next escape that was my final thought before I passed out . <p> I awoke to the cute female police captain lightly tapping me on the shoulder in the dark , private cell . <p> " Oh , this could get interesting , " I briefly thought . <p> " Were sorry , Mr. Berwick , you are free to go and free to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be there for another reason , I then felt relieved . <p> " I thought I could n't go until I got a court date ? " I asked . <p> " You must have some very high connections , " she said . <p> I then grabbed my stuff and caught a taxi right outside to the airport . I was n't going to wait around to see if they changed their mind ! <p> I caught a flight to Miami and just by chance good friend , Luke Rudkowski , of WeAreChange.org was in town . He has spent nearly a decade fighting the system and helping free people who did n't  deserve to be in jail . <p> I recounted my story and we both laughed . I then told him , however , that I was disappointed in myself . <p> " Why ? " he asked . <p> I said that twice during the previous night I felt scared . The most was when I was being roughed up by the police and the second was when I thought I might be in jail for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffed and in the sole control of two out-of-control large cops who were roughing me up . <p> " I felt helpless in that position , " I explained . " I know that my wife , in that same situation would have sat proudly and indignant no matter what they did ! I feel so disappointed that I was so scared in that situation . " <p> He told me that it was normal to feel that way , but he said that after having been brutalized by police countless times he has learned to stand solid , chest out and proud and not let them take away his sense of self and pride in his convictions . <p> He told me , " When you show them you are scared , they win . That is what they want power over you . " <p> I replied , " I did n't  look scared , I do n't  think , and was constantly indignant , but I felt scared . " <p> " Thats normal , my friend , " said Luke . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Some may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again go to St. Kitts and will stop doing business there , but they are wrong . <p> What happened to me that night could have happened on any country on Earth . Where there is public policing there will be cops who abuse their position of power . It happens every minute of every day in the US . <p> So , that is no blight against St. Kitts in general . In fact , for me personally , St. Kitts is probably one of the safest places in the world for me to now go . The police wont ever try that with me again after this experience ! <p> And , I also do wish to again say that besides the beat cops the police captain and others at the police station were as professional as could be expected . <p> In the end there are things to take note of in regards to any situation in which you get embroiled in the police system . And these work everywhere , not least of which in the US . If you get arrested for a victimless crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to ensure you have connections in whichever jurisdiction you are in . In this case I was at a conference with top government officials and lawyers and got to know some of them very well and quickly formed a relationship . Try to give the sense that you have local , big connections <p> 2 . Always state you are a journalist . This works equally well with customs guards who may be antagonizing you . Right after I left St. Kitts I was sent to the backroom at the Miami airport for " secondary screening " in which they were quite antagonistic . When they asked me what I do I replied , as always now , " Journalist " . This almost immediately gets them concerned as they worry you may tell the world about their behavior . You do n't  have to be a real journalist , if they ask further who you work for , say " freelance " . If they prod even further about where you are a journalist , you can even say you have done writing for large companies like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted anything on Facebook . <p> 3 . Mention very quickly that you want to talk to your lawyer , and it is even best to know the name of a local lawyer if possible . This also makes most police back off . <p> 4 . Stand strong no matter how aggressive they are . When you show weakness it feeds them . When you show strength it concerns them . This does n't  mean you ca n't be scared , it just mean you try not to show it . <p> 5 . Build a strong social network . This is especially easy if you are a libertarian or anarchist as these groups are quite small and stick together and understand that helping people get free of baseless or victimless charges is important . There are organizations like Cop Block , for example , which is a large group of people who help fight these things . Or , communities like Just Us Jury Nullification who try to free victimless crime victims . Or groups like The Dollar Vigilante . Many of the people who created the uproar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can get to know many of them best through TDVs Facebook page or my personal Facebook page , both of which you should join . If you are ever in the same situation , we can help . Strength in numbers , after all . <p> There is also the TDV Groups ( for subscribers only but it is a social network well worth having for $15/month ) that have TDVers around the world that you can contact before even visiting a place and most if not all would jump to your aid if you had an issue like I did in their area . <p> 6 . Whenever possible videotape the event or have friends/witnesses videotape . Video is like bug repellant to cops . <p> 7 . When all else fails , escape from jail . Or if you are an expert level vigilante , like me , escape from jail , get caught , then still get freed hours later on a presidential pardon . Do n't  try the latter until you are a God Mode vigilante , however .

This step is vital because the New York Fed returns the exact bars deposited by the account holder upon withdrawalgold deposits are not considered fungible . " Emphasis added <p> Or , rather , the website used to offer that assurance . A few months ago , the Fed returned melted and recast bars to Germany , not the original ones that had been stored . The link to the former message now leads to " page unavailable . " The page may have been eliminated due to unwanted attention created by a blogger who noted the discrepancy in the Fed 's policy and what it delivered . <p> A 1968 memo discovered and published by the financial iconoclast Zero Hedge in 2012 explains the need to return the originally deposited metal . The memo exposed a conspiracy between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve " to provide the Bundesbank German central bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 172 bars . " The ' bad delivery ' consisted of returning gold to Germany that was below the standard of the gold deposited . <p> Now alarm bells are ringing over the possible absence of gold . In 2003 , confidence was shaken by an announcement from the Bank of Portugal . 433 metric tons of gold approximately 70 percent of its gold reserve had been lent out or swapped into the market . International banking analyst James Turk commented in the Free Gold Money Report , " In either casethis gold is no longer stored in this central bank 's vault andno longer available as a monetary reserve . " Yet the policy of the International Monetary Fund is to count loans and swaps as reserves . Turk asked , " How can that be ? How can the IMF allow gold no longer in the vault to be reported as a reserve asset ? " <p> How ? Gold reserves are not audited by objective sources when they are audited at all . Moreover , the IMF needs to prop up confidence in a shaky web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bookkeeping is all that really matters . Even the Bundesbank seemed content to enter numbers into forms and never check on the physical gold in the NY Fed . That is , the Bundesbank was content until a German federal court ruled that it must conduct annual audits and inspections of Germany 's gold reserves worldwide . <p> The paperwork-fetish of central banks raises another " how ? " How many have assumed the Portuguese position ? <p> THE US POSITION <p> Also in October 2012 , Germany announced an intention to repatriate 300 tons of gold held by the NY Fed by 2020 . The deposit has not been audited since 1979 . The German public was clearly worried about whether there is allocated gold at the NY Fed or whether Germany is just one of many creditors on a metal statement . The German people lack confidence in the US . They are skeptical about the US government and the Federal Reserve 's ability to protect the value of its own dollar , they look askance at its poor track record in fiscal and monetary policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track of the gold it lends out . <p> The investment advisor site The Day Trading Academy described what happened when German accountability met the NY Fed . " The Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkhad excuses why representatives from the Bundesbank would be unable to see German gold . The response from Germany was not flattering . Accusations of corruption and dishonesty soon followed . After a rash of negative international reactions , the Federal Reserve finally agreed to give back over 600 tons of gold , but insist sic it will take until 2020 to be able to achieve this task . " Two other German delegations were each shown " one representative gold bar " and were not allowed to enter the rooms in which the rest was said to be stored . <p> By January 2014 , a year after the original Bundesbank demand , the NY Fed had returned only 5 tons of the German government 's gold . Again , the bars were not the original ones . German media ran wild with the allegations that the Fed took so long to return so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> WHERE IS THE GOLD ? <p> An 2012 audit conducted by the US Inspector General of the Treasury established that 99.98% of the gold held by the US is housed at the NY Fed . Germany deposited 1,500 tons of gold there , yet the audit shows the NY Fed contains 419 tons in total , and that includes coins . <p> Now Austria is sending a delegation to audit its gold reserve at the Bank of England . The metal website The Silver Doctors asked , " We wonder how soon the central banks of Switzerland , Italy , Australia , New Zealand , and countless other Western nations whose gold reserves have been leased , swapped , and hypothecated to the East over the past decade will realize that the music is finally ending , and there is more than one chair missing from this deadly game being played by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England . " <p> There is almost certainly a dearth of physical gold in the vaults of either America , the UK or both . If so , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repatriating wealth . Not all will succeed . The Italian government is the world 's third largest holder of gold , after the US and Germany . The Banca dItalia recently revealed that approximately half of its reserves is at the NY Fedor allegedly so . The losses will be huge and not paper ones . <p> What happens to the US dollar when America 's vaults are seen to be as empty as its promises and moral fiber ? It will crash and the suffering of average people will be terrible . The good news : privately held gold will soar . And it will be ever more important for such gold to be just thatheld with privacy . <p> Editor 's Note : Get Your Gold Out Of Dodge can help you today protect your international gold holdings .

" <p> And that was before the government financial system really got good at stealing from and impoverishing us . Today , if we all really had any idea as to what has been done to us by the system thered be 6.8 billion people involved in these protests . <p> However , there is a very , very important piece of the puzzle that you have missed completely . <p> In order to understand why , you have to realize one thing . You have been brainwashed . Do n't  feel too bad , we all have been . <p> Thomas Pynchon said , " If they can get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about the answers . " And that is precisely what they have been doing for decades , using propaganda and indoctrination to confuse you as to the real source of the problems so that you never ask the right questions . <p> In a sound , honest world , you could do anything you want you certainly would not have been forced into a minimum of 12 years of indoctrination ( called public or private , state regulated schools ) as a child . As well , practically everything in mainstream media is meant to subtly , every day , push you in the direction of supporting the nation-state . <p> After 12-16 years of government controlled " education " and thousands of hours of television propaganda from mainstream media that is all but one-in-the-same with the government it can be very hard to see reality . <p> Here is the reality . All of the problems you see are real . But you 've been misdirected as to their cause on purpose . Wall Street is , for the most part , corrupt and incredibly damaging to society as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the CAUSE of the problem . <p> If you want to protest the real devils who have caused every major problem in the world , from wars to poverty to oppression , then you shouldnt be in New York . You should be in Washington D.C. ( District of Criminals ) in front of the White House , Congress and the Federal Reserve building . That is the source of all of our problems today . <p> Sadly , because of all the propaganda and brainwashing you are actually asking for more government involvement in the economy as a solution to the problem CAUSED by the massive amount of government involvement in the economy . You have to realize one thing . There is a war on for your mind . At the moment , the side of reality , truth , honesty and self-responsibility is losing . The side of propaganda , corruption , theft ( taxes ) , violence ( laws against victimless crimes , wars and cages/jails or death if you do not submit to theft ) and outright evil has been winning . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth . We do n't  need to fight violently , like them . We just need to say no . But this will only happen if you can see the true cause of all of the problems of today . As the younger generations we have unfortunately been completely brainwashed and indoctrinated . <p> Weve been told government is good and here to protect us when the only times most of us have been accosted , tased , put in cages ( jail ) or beaten has been at the hand of a " police officer " . <p> Weve been told taxation is n't theft , when that is exactly what it is . <p> Weve been told that democracy is freedom , when in fact it is slavery . <p> Weve been brainwashed our entire lives but we can snap out of it very easily . Here are a few videos to get you started down the rabbit hole : <p> You will feel a lot of emotions as you awaken . You may feel , more than anything , fear . Swallow it . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be scared out of freedom , love and peace . Step past that feeling . Once you can quell those feelings , then you may feel angry . That is good and natural . However , we should n't need to get violent to stop this slavery . <p> All we need to do to stop it is to stop supporting the government and spread the word to others so that they do the same . This is very easy . <p> Mahatma Gandhi said , " Withholding of payment of taxes is one of the quickest methods of overthrowing a government . " <p> Be warned , this process will not be easy we will go through a few months and maybe even a few years of virtual chaos as the entire nation-state , political control system collapses . The entire false , non-free market , thieving monetary system will collapse in the process . Everything will change . People will once again have to learn to support themselves and how to be productive . <p> But do n't  worry . As Bill Hicks said , its just a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who only can have power WHEN we CREATE that power for them to attain ( governance ) then they scurry like the cockroaches that they are . <p> Freedom is right in front of you . Prosperity like you 've never known lies at your fingertips . All you have to do is awaken , educate yourself and follow one simple principle . A principle that is so simple and obvious that they teach it to kindergarten children . The Non-Aggression Principle . Do n't  hit do n't  steal and only resort to violence when aggressed against . And do n't  allow any person , corporation or government to breach this principle . <p> When that stands as the center of your philosophy of being all else becomes simple . The " authorities " hope you never figure this out . Unluckily for them , but typical at the same time , they did n't  realize the internet would allow this message to get to the masses . It is typical because these people are n't  especially smart . They are scheming sociopaths and excellent conmen and women , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have realized the internet would be a major problem for them years ago and have done something to stop it . <p> Now they are beginning to realize that the internet will facilitate their fall . People like Barack Obama speak often of the " internet kill switch " for this reason . But we have a few months still to educate , communicate and to defeat them . Act now to devour all of the real , honest information that is available to you through the internet . Look to website such as LewRockwell.com , Mises.org and watch interviews with top anarchists at Anarchast . Also , download all of this information it will almost certainly be censored by the government very soon . <p> If we can not spread the word prior to them shutting the internet down then we will lose . We will all be enslaved except for the few of us who have found a way to escape to remote islands , live discretely off of un-policed waters on sailboats or ships , small seasteads or the few who may have even escaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> But it is my hope that we can use this moment as our time to awaken . Pass along this post , its videos and articles to anyone and everyone you can . <p> Fight the power and stand up to the tyranny , but fight the root of the problem , not the symptom . The root are the governments of the world . They have created an entire , artificial financial system ( which is not capitalism , it is corporatism/fascism ) based on theft ( taxation ) . It is natural , then , for the financial edifice that grows up around that system to also be based on theft and corruption . <p> But you can not defeat that financial system without defeating the system that created it . Take your fight to Washington , D.C.

" The US is stepping up their processes . Already each passport of incoming visitors to the US is screened through multiple databases . After flight 370 disappeared , the US has started this process for all outgoing passengers . <p> " Coupled with this information and the new abilities to act on that information definitely makes air travel a lot safer , " according to one government official . <p> Throughout the video it is hinted numerous times that the US government has new capabilities to screen passengers . Travel is about to get much harder for many US passengers , as bureaucratic red-tape stops them from travel . For many , to be sure , traveling in-or-out of the US has been a nightmare already . <p> The nightmares that await hundreds of travelers in-and-out of the US are palpable for those paying attention . For nearly any random reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel by the US bureaucracy , and it happens way more than you think . <p> US CONTINUES HISTORY OF BURDENED TRAVEL FOR BRITISH CELEBRITIES <p> Take for example one British celebrity . On her way to the US , she encountered quite a problem , putting her career on the line . <p> Nigella Lawson was recently prevented from boarding a flight to the United States over a court confession that she took drugs , it has emerged . <p> Lawson , a celebrity chef , was stopped at a Heathrow boarding gate on her way to Los Angeles this month . She was prevented from boarding the flight to the US due to a drug confession that she has taken drugs . Should she be unable to travel to the US her television career would be effectively ended . <p> The 54-year-old star confessed that she had snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis in front of her children . Although Scotland Yard has yet to do a thing , the US has taken a stricter policy , outdoing a country which has recently banned drinking in front of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to ten years in a cage . <p> It appears US authorities told British Airways not to allow her to travel to California , where she would have been refused entry anyway . The US can disallow certain visitors from entering , even if they have n't ever been charged . To lift any ban could take months or years . In the spirit of transparency , the US Department of Homeland ( In ) Securitys custom and border protection department declined to comment . <p> We suspect Lawson was caught up in the requirement that airlines supply US security officials in advance with details regarding all passengers on flights to America in order to screen them against Washington 's ' no fly list . ' <p> Lawson had been allowed to travel to the US as recent as January , after her admission to taking drugs . It seems , as Telegraph notes , that US authorities have hardened since then . This is a harrowing trend which Americans best take note of now , before it is too late . <p> Every single day 366 people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to US government statistics , most of which are cooked . The information that Lawson had taken plants ( a.k.a. drugs ) came out during a bitter divorce trial . <p> She is far from the first British celebrity said to have found entry into the US difficult due to convictions or drug use . Amy Winehouse , Kate Moss , Russell Brand and Oasis stars Noel and Liam Gallagher are all on that list . <p> " YOU 'RE NOT FLYING ANYWHERE TODAYTHE JUDGE WANTS TO SEE YOU " <p> But her story is nothing compared to one American family 's in particular . Celebrities , and other people in the public spotlight , are far from the only ones who find it difficult to travel in or out of the US . Take Charles and Kathleen Barrett for example . On August 8 , 2013 they were barred from leaving Colorado on their way back to where they lived in Cuenca , Ecuador . Charles settled into his seat in a waiting area at the airport and was surrounded by three men , one of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not flying anywhere today , " one of the marshals told him . " The judge wants to see you . " <p> Charles was forced to turn over his passport and airline ticket and was kidnapped and led out of the airport in handcuffs . <p> Charles knew what the problem was . In 2007 he had received a large refund from the IRS he and his spouse were not entitled to , the result of a tax return filed without their signatures by their tax preparer . They ultimately testified against the tax preparer . <p> " When we found out about the mistake , we knew we needed to repay the IRS and had been working with the court to do it , " Charles said . " Based on an agreement , we had paid $5,000 a month for 2 1/2 years and had paid $226,000 in all , almost the total amount we originally owed the IRS . " The Barretts were also filing reports every six weeks with the court , providing documents as requested . <p> Once in court , Charles did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turns out the court had issed a writ of Ne Exeat Republica , ordering the Barretts to turn over their passports . The writ of Ne Exeat Republic is a virtually unknown judicial tool dating to the 18th century English royal court . Its original intention was to restrict travel for political reasons and is occasionally used in the US . It is almost always issued as a civil law action . <p> The IRS attorney insisted that Barrett go to jail or post bond of $253,000 . The judge informed the attorney the writ did not authorize jailing , only the confiscation of passports and other travel documents . The IRS attorney insisted , and ultimately the judged relented . Charles was booked into jail , though no charges were filed . <p> Kathleen , who was leaving from Grand Junction , 200 miles west of Denver , was experiencing the same abuse . She was also booked into jail . It was two days before anyone knew where she was . <p> Kathleen and Charles saw each other for the first time in five days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal courthouse in Denver . Their new attorney demanded they be released . Judge Boland agreed , but the marshals refused to obey the judges orders based on the instructions of their superiors . Ultimately , the judge demanded the handcuffs and shackles be removed and they finally were . <p> Nearly eight months later , the Barretts are still unable to leave the US . Charles has lost the source of income that allowed him to make payments to the IRS . <p> The Barrett 's lawyers are arguing that the IRS has repeatedly misrepresented the facts and has perjured herself on numerous occassions . Since , Judge Boland has been removed from the case . In fact , the Barretts have dealt with three different judges during the process . <p> The Barretts remain in Colorado , living with Kathleens mother . <p> " We just want the nightmare to end , " says Charles . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Every single day hundreds of people are barred from entering or leaving the US , and many of these individuals are held because of some issue or another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the IRS . As the Barrett 's case demonstrates , the IRS will do whatever it takes to make your life a living hell if they believe you have done something wrong , even if you have n't . <p> Pretty much right off the bat bureaucratic processes take over and the entire situation is out of yours and everybody 's hands even the government courts . The Barretts case shows that bureaucrats within the US government have no problem being in contempt of court , upholding the orders of their superiors before the rulings of the judge . <p> Getting one 's assets outside of the hands of the US government , a government that clearly has no problem stealing in broad daylight from its own citizens , is instrumental to living a near worry-free life . Why become one of the 366 people each day , who , in the process of traveling to the US , find themselves passport-less or thrown in jail ? As a result , many of these people have their assets stolen from them , and what they have leftover goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a witchhunt <p> And it is only getting worse .

Nothing herein should be construed as legal advice . Consult a qualified attorney regarding your particular situation . <p> Every TDVer we know who has chosen Mexico as a place to flee the police states of the United States and Canada utters one common theme : " I will never go back . " Yes , it really is that much better here . Government in Mexico exists to be sure , but has been slow to acquire the desire and sophistication to put its boot heel on the neck of its citizens . <p> Yet , as Mexico becomes more First World , so has its government . While light years behind the USSA in intrusiveness , Mexico is following briskly in the footsteps of its northern neighbor . <p> Just a couple of weeks ago in the gym where we work out in San Miguel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over fees . Rather than work it out or just take his business elsewhere he went to government and complained about " code violations " . This retaliation resulted in city officials inspecting and ultimately threatening the club 's ownership with fines and worse , all resulting in at least one employee being fired , i.e. , sacrificed , and the club shut down for two consecutive Saturdays ostensibly to " retrain " its employees . That kind of in-your-face use of government as a personal weapon was unheard of here five years ago . Five years ago he would have just taken his business elsewhere . <p> And Mexico is not alone among emerging states following the path of bigger and more intrusive . TDVer and Managing Partner of Galt 's Gulch Chile , Ken Johnson learned the hard way the same lesson recently when trying to travel from Paraguay to Chile . He has made the trip many times , but this time the airline agent pulled out a book and pointed to a clause that says if a passenger ca n't show a Chilean I 'd card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have the money on him to buy a ticket to return , he ca n't enter . Editor 's Note : TDV Editor-In-Chief , Jeff Berwick , regularly prints up a fake " onward " ticket because this has happened to him dozens of times around the world . Ken scrambled and got back to Santiago , but not without a grim reminder : " We are the state . We control you . " <p> Here in Mexico the government continues to wage war with the drug cartels at the behest of , or more likely a threat by , the United States . Absolutely ineffective in curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States , Mexico has taken a different tact control the US dollars coming back into Mexico from the sales of those drugs , specifically making it difficult if not impossible to use US dollars or to convert them to spendable Mexican pesos . Net-net : the war on drugs has transmogrified into the war on cash with significant collateral damage . <p> Mexico 's recent currency controls are nothing new . Governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every commercial transaction is money , the easiest way for any government to control its population is to control its money . By specifically limiting what transactions can be made in cash , government gets control as well as their cut ( or " mordida " as we call it here in Mexico . ) . To those ends , Italy recently banned cash transactions over 1,000 and Spain prohibited transactions over 2,500 . <p> The United States , likewise , has been trying to stamp out cash transactions , using a more incremental approach , i.e. , requiring banks to report customers who present more than $10,000 in currency or engage in undefined " suspicious transactions . " To learn more , watch this video in which Professor Joseph Salerno breaks down the hidden war central planners have been waging on the free markets for decades <p> Every government needs a boogeyman to justify breathless tirades and resulting regulation , and in Mexico the bogeymen are the drug cartels that have ironically been created by the US government 's immoral and unnecessary war on drugs . <p> In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of dollars foreigners can exchange for pesos in Banks &amp; Money Exchange Establishments to no more than $1,500 USD per month . Until recently , the law has been mostly ignored . But no more . The government has notified banks and businesses they will be held accountable if they violate the law and recently banks here have instituted tighter controls with several financial institutions limiting exchange up to $300 USD in a single transaction , and others refusing to accept or exchange US dollars in any amount without prior government approval . <p> Last year the Mexican government went even further limiting the use of cash in real estate transactions . Indeed , cash payments of more than a half million pesos ( $38,750 USD ) for real estate are now forbidden , and cash payments for automobiles , planes , boats , jewelry , precious metals , watches , precious stones , artwork , gambling tickets , lottery tickets , raffle tickets , payment of related prizes , transfer of shares or equity for more than 200,000 pesos ( $15,500 USD ) are likewise forbidden . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fine of 4,051,450 pesos ( $316,000 USD ) or 10% of the prohibited transaction , whichever is greatest . <p> Businesses , e.g. , restaurants , bars , hotels , retail stores , may now accept a maximum of $100 USD in cash per transaction , with no restriction on the number of transactions per customer . However , many businesses have begun refusing accept US dollars at all . After all , what are they to do with US dollars if their banks will not accept them in quantity ? <p> Finally , the new law also requires notaries , real estate brokers , and other dealers to report to government , specifically Mexico 's federal tax authority , the forms of payment for transactions above specified limits . Financial institutions will be required to report monthly credit card balances in excess of 50,000 pesos ( $3,875 ) . This provision was technically enforceable June 17 , 2013 but the rules and regulations have not yet been published . Our lawyer in Mexico who specializes in business and real estate transactions advises us that we should expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as soon as October of this year . In the meantime , banks have begun clamping down on receiving U.S. dollars in excess of that permitted by law . Notarios in Mexico , quasi-government officials that supervise and approve most sales transactions of size , will likewise fully comply giving the Mexican IRS ( Hacienda ) open season on all taxable transactions , many of which have gone unnoticed under former law . <p> What does it all mean going forward ? Like most things fomented by the State , the cure may prove worse than the disease , to-wit : <p> Mexico 's attempt to stamp the US dollar out of existence in Mexico will likely result in the rise of US dollars as a secondary currency which is never converted to pesos , just as dollars in the United States are rarely converted into a real currency , e.g. , gold , silver and bitcoin . Mexico fails to recognize that all fiat currencies are lies agreed upon and it does n't matter who printed the paper or what color it is . It works as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services . <p> Other currencies like bitcoin may take hold , replacing both the peso and the dollar . <p> Gold and silver , long secondary currencies in Mexico , will become more prevalent in commercial transactions . <p> Bottom line : States are states . States do what states do : attempt to control and tax all those within their borders , and in doing so fail to heed Bastiat 's inviolable dichotomy of the seen versus the unseen . Mexico is not different . Indeed , currency controls are just one step being taken to make the rich richer and empower the state . At the same time Mexico is implementing these controls , it is planning to boost its tax coffers by an extra $50 billion a year by extending sales tax coverage to food and medicine , and by starting to tax capital gains . Terrorist chatter continues that the next step in governments ' control sequence will be a combined currency among the United States , Mexico , and Canada . <p> But this effort by the statists to kill the cash market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for goods and services will be expanded due to these government incursions . As discussed above , more , not fewer , transactions will take place in pesos , gold , bitcoin , and even US dollars that will never see the inside of a bank and will remain unknown , unrecorded , untaxed . The Mexican people have long been innovative and resilient when it comes to defeating government intrusion into their lives . We may be unsure of every avenue they will use to avoid this latest attempt by government to interfere , regulate and control their lives and their money , but we are comfortable they will succeed . <p> If you do live in Mexico just be sure to keep the majority of your assets well outside of Mexico and well beyond their capability to find . Contact TDV Offshore for more on that . And , preferably , like Jeff Berwick , do n't become resident if you live there . Be a tourist .

Prior to 2012 there was 0% income tax in Paraguay . Again , we asked our high level contacts in the country what caused the sudden change . They told us that , effectively , the US government had been behind a coup d'Ttat that ousted the prior president in June , 2012 and forced them to institute an income tax ( 10% ) . <p> Now , why would they do that ? Read on . <p> The most recent was in Panama , just last week on the day before New Year 's Eve . <p> THE PANAMA TAX FIASCO <p> It was bizarre and caused a massive uproar the next day in Panama . In fact , it 's repercussions are still being felt and it likely will cause major damage to the country of Panama . <p> What occurred ? <p> Late on December 30th , Law No. 120 of 2013 was passed , and two articles were included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every natural or juridical , domestic or foreign , who receives any taxable income within or outside Panamanian territory , must pay taxes . " <p> The law made it clear that those who are residents , citizens or companies in Panama will have to pay tax-based on their worldwide income instead of only Panamanian-sourced income . <p> This was massive news with massive repercussions for any Panamanian resident who had foreign income and , more importantly , the thousands of businesses who had moved to Panama mostly because of their non-taxation of foreign income . <p> The Panamanian business community went into a near panic and noted how the law had been passed while shrouded in secrecy . There was no discussion of the law whatsoever in public . <p> Realizing the disastrous potential results , the President tweeted amidst the outrage : " On territoriality and taxes if we need to repeal we 'll repeal or what needs to be defined will be defined , but ample debate must take place . " <p> The law was not even discussed in the National Assembly . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : laws do n't need to be debated in order to be implemented , but " ample debate must take place " to repeal the law . Ah , the logic of government . <p> At 12:06 he tweeted this : " There is too much gossip and disinformation regarding tax territoriality . On the first week of January everything concerning that will be clarified . " <p> On the same day , Mr. Luis Cucal=n , Director of Autoridad Nacional de Ingresos de Panam ( Panama 's version of the " IRS " ) , tweeted this : <p> " I was the one who proposed Arts . 2 and 3 of Law 120 and I made a mistake . We are not prepared for taxation of worldwide income . " Then he quickly followed at 13:58 with : " I have requested Mr. President to repeal said articles , which he accepted . " <p> That Panama 's version of the IRS is " not prepared for taxation of worldwide income , " should not make anybody with wealth in Panama feel comfortable . This only implies they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 've displayed once before , it will come without warning nor debate . <p> The government ultimately announced on December 31 that the law will be repealed right away in the New Year . <p> The attempt by the Panamanian government to institute worldwide taxation , without debate , shows us how governments work . When they are in trouble , as governments all around the world are with their historical sovereign debts , they will do whatever it takes to fleece you of more of your hard-earned income . And , it would not surprise us in the least if the US government was pushing for the change . The US government , after all , actually has 150 IRS agents in Panama spying on US citizens already . <p> Either way , Panama just shot itself in the economic foot . <p> Until now , Panama has been seen by international businesses and North Americans as a place of strategic financial importance . Panama allowed people from retirees to international companies a tax-enhanced place to live , do business and enjoy the benefits of the Panamanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason Panama has enjoyed economic success in recent years . Its tax laws and business environment are directly responsible for this . <p> Now that the country has showed its cards that it hopes to one day tax everyone and everything to the hilt the Panamanian authorities can be assured people will begin looking to get their money OUT of Panama . <p> THE NEW VERY OBVIOUS TREND <p> This does n't come as a surprise to us here at TDV . We have been warning for years that more and more governments will begin to clamp down on the ease of obtaining residency and citizenship and make it harder and harder for people to escape egregious taxation . <p> The US government realizes this the most because as they continue to clamp down on their economy and it continues to disintegrate more and more people are just choosing to leave . Up until now it has been relatively easy to re-organize your affairs internationally , all legally , and reap massive tax benefits ( often 0% ) . <p> Seeing this the US government is pushing as many countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already done , increase taxes ( to make it less lucrative for people to internationalize ) and also implement a worldwide income tax so that no one can get out of the tax dragnet . <p> Not to mention that the IMF just had in a recent report , " The sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a capital levy a one-time tax on private wealth as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability . " <p> This will affect all Westerners , not just Americans . Because , up until recently , it was quite easy for non-Americans to expatriate to another country ( preferably one with 0% income tax or where their income taxes are n't applicable to their income source ) , become resident there and effectively end up paying a 0% income tax rate . I 've been doing that , all legally , since 2006 as a Canadian citizen who is resident of a Caribbean country that has no income taxes that apply to my income source . <p> I expect at some point Canada will too impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce my citizenship as I hold passports in other countries where they do n't have income taxes that apply to me . <p> But , for Americans , things are going to get much worse very quickly . The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) comes into effect in July , 2014 and is effectively a form of capital controls that will make it very difficult , if not impossible for any American to internationalize their assets and reap the legal tax advantages of doing so . <p> As will happen in any country that announces worldwide taxation , billions of dollars will now leave Panama . It does n't matter that the law was repealed . The damage has been done . <p> In order to foster a strong business environment , a nation-state must have a clear and predictable policy . People need security about the future of tax law in their jurisdiction . Panama just stripped that from its population . <p> Is Panama going down the road of Cyprus ? <p> Possibly one day ( even likely ) . One thing is certain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> THE CRISIS CONFERENCE <p> Panama has long been considered an excellent place to preserve wealth .

Bitcoin 's historical price rise has done much to bring bitcoin into the public eye : <p> Senior Central Bank of Ireland official Gareth Murphy was the most recent official to espouse that bitcoin poses a threat to financial stability . He made the comments last week at a conference in Dublin called BitFin 2014 . He suggested the more consumers use digital currencies for transactions the likelier it becomes that governments will receive less revenue , meaning fewer people will allow themselves to be victimized by taxation ( theft ) which is used for murder and to pay off cronies . He also said digital currencies could undermine a bank 's ability to influence the economy 's price of credit , stripping the power of central banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " At the outset , I think that it is important for me to state my belief that developments in mobile and information technology are very likely to change the landscape of financial services in the coming years . ( And indeed , there have been a number of reports written on this subject recently ) , " said Murphy . <p> Murphy 's recent warning has not been the only bitcoin-related warning rolling off the lips of a central bank official . The Bank of Canada expressed a similar view in May . According to the Bank of Canada , bitcoin could pose this threat if it ever became " a significant means of payment . " The bank went on : <p> " Governments may become concerned about legal security and law enforcement issues associated with Bitcoins . For example , the private nature of bitcoin transactions , bitcoins could easily be used to facilitate criminal transactions and to evade taxes , " he said although he seems confused about what is crime or not . The true crime is the taxes themself without that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , 2014 meeting the Federal Advisory Council ( FAC ) of the Federal Reserve discussed bitcoin , and the question was posed , Does Bitcoin pose a threat to the banking system , economic activity , or financial stability ? . The group deduced " There is the potential for Bitcoin to act as a contagion of instability because of its volatility and lack of connection with the rest of the financial networks already in place . " <p> Other central criminal organizations ( central banks ) have stated that bitcoin does not pose a risk to the financial system , such as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank . They are totally incorrect and Gareth Murphy of the Bank or Ireland is correct . Bitcoin has the potential to completely eradicate the entire criminal centralized banking cartels , the bankster financial system and even better , violent and thieving government as we know it ! <p> The technology will continue to metastasize and grow and most smart individuals , mostly in the technological space I know , who are not already anarchists or libertarians , remain very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are where I was in 2011 . So once these types of individuals experience that " aha-moment " financial advisors , economists , bankers , technology entrepreneurs things will become much different . For now most slaves have n't even heard of bitcoin which portends very well for its future rise . <p> Everyone acknowledges how small bitcoin is at the current stage . For this reason many bankers do not think bitcoin will negatively impact the monopoly on money and banking . Many of them see bitcoin 's price volatility as being the nascent technology 's biggest enemy , but over time volatility will lessen due to its growing market and evoke more confidence . <p> Bankers do imagine a bitcoin world as a theoretical possibility but I imagine it as a tangible reality that has already taken shape and is forming before our very eyes . It 's only a matter of time before the bankers realize this is the case . These are all developments we have been covering at The Dollar Vigilante ( TDV ) , and we have much more planned for the future in the cryptocurrency space . 
@@99475572 @3675572/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Rent Control : A Nightmare to Avoid <p> Editors Note : The following post is by TDV correspondent , Phil Champagne <p> With the prospect of higher price inflation coming , I 'd like to bring up a potential risk of what might happen more often in some cities in the US and across the world , particularly in places with a more socialist view such as San Francisco . <p> To many investors in real estate , I 've just stated the obvious in my title . All cities or countries that have implemented a rent control have ultimately destroyed the availability of good housing . Rent control has always been implemented only on residential housing , since the government does n't  feel it needs to be involved in commercial real estate where the lease contract is between two businesses . But when it comes to housing , what better way to get more votes than to promote a new law that will freeze rent increases or limit their growth ? <p> One example is in San Francisco where a tenants rent can be adjusted by only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the unit be rented at market rate . The San Francisco Chronicle reports : <p> Tommi Avicolli Mecca , who works for the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco , said he and his roommate split the $1,100 rent on their Castro district two-bedroom apartment . He has lived there for 17 years and said the apartment would probably rent for $3,000 now . And without rent control , the landlord could keep raising the rent , meaning few people who make the city unique could afford living there , he said . ( See sfgate.com ) <p> So there you have it . This owner is forced to charge about one third of the rent he would normally charge . It is important to note , however , that existing market rates are higher than they would otherwise be if it were n't for rent control . This is because rent control reduces the amount of capital available for investment in multifamily properties . In San Francisco the supply of multifamily properties has declined drastically over the many years that rent control has been in place . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have lots of regulations that prevent new housing development by making it a much more expensive undertaking than it otherwise would be . Removal of all government restrictions would attract tremendous investment and after a few years San Francisco would have plenty of high quality housing . I strongly suggest you read the above-referenced article . You will find the story of a heart surgeon making $500,000-a-year who wants a pad in SF and gets to enjoy the benefit of rent control . He is subsidized by property owners with an income substantially lower than his . <p> Usually , these laws are discussed and/or enacted during periods of higher price inflation . In other words , the governments printing press destroys the currency , forcing all prices to go up , hence forcing market rental rates to rise . When this happens , some politicians will yell at these " awful " owners who are raising their rental rates at a time when people are struggling with the burden of rising food prices . So the politicians are trying to fix a problem they themselves created and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower return on real estate investment will result in investors losing interest in investing in this city or country . They will look elsewhere . Rent control reduces the quantity and quality of housing . Rental income is the revenue a property brings . Even a hardcore socialist would prefer to buy a higher paying dividend stock when all other relevant factors are the same . So this underinvestment will prevent the properties from being improved and maintained properly . They will therefore degrade with time . Sure , the renters will have a fixed rent or very low increases year after year , but then a new problem has been created . And you guessed it the same politicians who created this problem will likely be yelling again at the owners for not maintaining their properties . Of course they are not purposefully neglecting their properties , they are doing what they can with the artificially low rental income that has been imposed on their assets . Nevertheless , you might see those politicians considering creating a new law that will penalize with a fee any owners who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine what such a Keynesian-inspired politician might think : <p> Wow , the city will be able to make new revenue with the fees we will be charging those mean owners and with those fees , and we will be able to hire new city employees to inspect those properties . This will increase employment ! <p> Could they really think so ? You think I 'm making this up ? Recently , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed " Slumlord Prevention Guidelines for bank lending to help protect tenants " . But , this is a lot less likely to happen in a state like Texas and more likely to happen in a state like New York or Vermont or the Peoples Republic of California . In case you are not yet convinced about the damaging effect of rent control , I invite you to read this article from the Library of Economics &amp; Liberty . <p> Now that we have established how terrible rent control is for real estate investment and therefore quality of housing that is available in a given area , I 'll be talking about another type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the amount of rent you must pay on money you are borrowing . A central banking system such as we have can , and has , artificially lowered the interest rates across the board and this rate has become distributed across most assets and therefore investments . Imagine if city A is implementing rent control , forcing returns on investment properties to drop from say 8% to 5% , investors will start investing in city B that does not have rent control . This flood of investors in city B will push down returns from 8% to 7% or 6% , even if this city enjoys no rent control , just because there are more competing buyers pushing the prices up , and returns down . <p> Well , the same applies in some ways to corporate and municipal bonds an dividend-paying stocks as welll when the Federal Reserve lowers the interest rate . With lower Treasury bonds , people invest in other investment instruments paying higher yield . But just as rent control in a city eventually leads to terrible things after a few years , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems manifest themselves are quite different though , but we have malinvestment that develops from this practice and will only grow with time . <p> With this 30-year treasury bond bull market that is about to end within the next few years , I 'm afraid we have a lot of malinvestment to unwind and this is why we are " paying " close attention on where we buy and what we buy .

A mother in Arkansas sparked it . Her daughter 's 6th-grade homework required her to " prune two and add two amendments to the Bill of Rights . " The document was called " outdated " and so " may not remain in its current form any longer . " <p> The mother was particularly concerned because her daughter had not yet gone through a civics course .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of a special committee to change the Bill of Rights , which the mother worried may lead her to incorrectly believe that it could be changed in that manner . <p> In response to media attention , a school official confirmed the authenticity of the assignment and defended it as being in accord with Common Core standards . The official denied the homework was " political " or that the children were not taught about the Bill of Rights beforehand ; apparently a hand-out was discussed just before the assignment was given . Note : the brief discussion about one sheet of paper clearly did not teach the child anything about the Bill of Rights . Moreover , if the assignment was intended to elicit critical thought , why was n't " keep as it is " an option ? Why were children told the Bill of Rights was " outdated " rather than deciding for themselves ? <p> The Bill of Rights is a flash-point because there is an ongoing war between the feds and individual rights . This paper document is the strongest remaining legal protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The onslaught did not start with Obama but it has accelerated under him . ) <p> The First Amendment protects freedom of speech , religion , assembly and the press . Free speech is abrogated by federally-imposed policies against ' incorrect ' speech . For example , Title VII of the Civil Rights Act holds employers legally responsible for the " hate speech " by employees . Obamacare 's mandate that employers provide abortifacients despite religious objections attacks freedom of religion . Freedom of assembly is denied by protest zones proscribed areas to which protesters are confined , often by wire fences ; by law , those protesting anywhere near the President are arrested . America fell from 32nd to 46th in the 2014 World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders . <p> The Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms is dying through " salami tactics " slice by slice . For example , on January 3rd , Obama issued two new executive actions aimed at ' tightening ' the federal background-check system for gun ownership . <p> The Third Amendment prohibition against soldiers being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federal appeals court . The case involves the police forcibly occupying a residence in order to surveil a neighboring home . A question asked is whether militarized police , such as SWAT teams , are soldiers under the Constitution . <p> The Fourth Amendment is no more . Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures evaporated with the TSA 's ' right ' to search the person and property of all air travelers . The NSA 's massive warrantless searches of telecommunications has been upheld by a federal court . <p> The Fifth Amendment speaks to due process of law , eminent domain , double jeopardy and grand juries . Its most important protections are gone . The feds were exempted from due process by Section 412 of the USA Patriot Act which permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial . Al-Awlaki and other Americans were executed by " imperial drone " even though they had not been charged with a crime . Eminent domain was gutted by the 2005 Kelo decision , which was upheld by the Supreme Court ; in Kelo , the government confiscated private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-profit owner ; government agents continue to confiscate property from innocent people through civil seizure laws .

The indefinite detention and assassination previously mentioned are clear abrogations . On March 4 , Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a letter to Rand Paul , stating he could " imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable lawsfor the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States . " On confronting witnesses , the federal government increasingly uses " classified documents " or secret witnesses against those charged with crimes against the state . <p> The Seventh Amendment guarantees trial by jury in federal court for common law or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment protects against " cruel and unusual punishment . " Again , indefinite detention and assassination are violations . As is the punishment of whistle blowers like Chelsea/Bradley Manning who was held naked in solitary confinement and constantly awoken by guards . He did n't receive a proper trial for years . Even those who consider the Amendment to apply only to Americans on native soil should be concerned about federal defenses of torturing Gitmo prisoners who have been charged with no crime . A new report on the CIA apparently reveals such torture to be " normal procedure " by federal agents abroad ; since the CIA is responsible for declassifying the report , it is not clear how much will be made public . <p> The Ninth Amendment affirms that people have other rights even if they are not enumerated in the Constitution . " Other rights " refer to just about anything the government does n't prohibit . Given how regulations and the Nanny State have exploded under Obama , it is difficult to consider him a Ninth Amendment purist . <p> The Tenth Amendment reserves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the federal government . The feds bypass the Tenth Amendment through the stick-and-carrot of funding . Consider Common Core . Education is a state prerogative . But any state that wants a bite out of a $4.35-billion federal fund must adopt the program . Moreover , any state that does so is exempt from the widely despised No Child Left Behind Act . As of Fall 2013 , 45 states and D.C. have complied . Education has become a de facto federal prerogative . The chart below represents the rate of growth in student achievement in math , reading and science . US is the black line . <p> More is becoming known about Common Core curricula , largely because parents are appalled at what their children are learning . Or not learning . 6-graders without a good basic grasp of writing or math are being introduced to the Bill of Rights with the word " outdated " and told to rewrite it .

Translating , " concentrated benefits " are the large returns earned by the privileged groups through subsidies or bailouts . <p> For each one of us tax payers , the cost of any individual bailout or welfare program is quite small , hence " dispersed costs " . In looking at political action to fight the system , the individual taxpayer faces the following set of tradeoffs : the time and effort to understand even one piece of legislation or policy is substantial , and even if opposition to a particular program were effective , it would only save a few dollars per individual in taxes . This leads to " rational ignorance " , the decision by most taxpayers that the return to working harder at your job or just enjoying life is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes that are dominated by public choice logic , the monetary system will not be reformed when " it makes too much sense " to do so . It will not be reformed because it would put government finances on a sound footing , nor to restrain war-making . Stabilizing the dollar wont do it either . The current monetary system ( or as James Grant calls it , non-system ) will be replaced , eventually , because it will fail , catastrophically . <p> What will the alternative to the current regime of central banks , floating exchange rates , and unbacked fiat money look like ? Here I must reject the wishful thinking that " things need to get worse so people will be really angry and insist on something better " . Things do not necessarily get better when there is a crisis . Things can get worse and stay worse , or get worse and then go even further downhill . <p> What exactly Steve Forbes has in mind is nebulous because the term " gold standard " is used differently by different people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fixed rates , with central banks , each one having some gold as a reserve asset . In this world , central banks are obligated to provide a form of convertibility , though reserves held may be less than 100% . Individual nations may , under some conditions , be able to devalue their own national currency relative to the fixed rates and to gold . <p> For adherents to Murray Rothbards theory of banking , the gold standard means gold as money proper with banks holding 100% reserves against demand deposits . Under these conditions there is no necessity or even any purpose to having a central bank and devaluation is a form of default . <p> What does Forbes have in mind ? He has been associated with supply side economics , who have their own so-called " gold standard " . So-called because it is not much of a gold standard at all , only a rule that the central bank is supposed to manage the inflation of the fiat money system in line with the gold price . <p> Under this system , gold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered the best indicator of the looseness or tightness of monetary policy . As Frank Shostak points out , this system offers none of the advantages of using real gold as money . And why should anyone expect that when push comes to shove , the Fed will follow any rule when the situation seems to demand improvements ? <p> As Murray Rothbard wrote in his critique of a similar money supply growth rule advocated by Milton Friedman , " Of course , Friedman would then advise the Fed to use that absolute power wisely , but no libertarian worth the name can have anything but contempt for the very idea of vesting coercive power in any group and then hoping that such group will not use its power to the utmost . " <p> When the current system fails , there are two primary barriers to the adoption of a better system . The first is the political actors who moved to abandon the gold standard the first time around havent gone away . The vested interest of powerful groups who wish to use the fiat money printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the usual suspects will apply for their jobs back . That which has not killed them has made them stronger . <p> But the deeper obstacle is ideology . Most economists and central bankers actually believe that a ) an economy can not grow without an increasing quantity of money , b ) the gold standard caused the Great Depression , c ) The Fed determines monetary policy , a necessary and beneficial function and , d ) the banking system needs a lender of last resort in the case of financial crises , you know , those crises that just sort of happen , that come out of no-where with no warning and hit us when we least expect . <p> None of the preceding propositions are true , but as long as they are accepted factoids , the next monetary system is likely to look a lot more like the current one with extra lipstick than anything that existed in the 19th century .

And decentralized systems like bitcoin and 3D printing and even WordPress are the asteroid which will ensure just this . <p> I 've been doing a lot of thinking , and I simply do n't think totalitarianism can withstand the global political awakening we see taking shape before our very eyes . <p> Things are changing on Planet Earth . I can tell because the dinosaurs are getting desperate . <p> The United States as whole looks a whole lot to me like the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) did during its existence . My head researcher Justin O'Connell and I were just talking about how the wall fell , and he cleared some things up for me I was n't 100% sure about . He will be writing an article on that in the coming week <p> Let 's just say , the things he and I talked about , in regards to the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the GDR , the US constantly looks bad in the world media . It also looks a bit behind the times <p> And it 's politicians make ( or try to make ) similar totalitarian decrees as the former German Democratic Republic counterparts . <p> When I read that Senator Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) called for a ban on bitcoin , I laughed out loud . Obviously , this guy has no idea what he is talking about , and obviously he has deep psychological issues which force him to want to controlthings . I ca n't wait until he learns that you can print a gun using 3D printing . <p> He wrote a letter . Or likely an assistant wrote a letter . Maybe it took a few assistants and Manchin to write the letter , since we all know the state of US public education . <p> Anyway , " he " addressed it to the Treasury , Federal Reserve , and multiple financial regulatory agencies , saying that bitcoin and digital currencies are " disruptive to our economy . " If he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Congress , since that is where the power is supposed to lie in Washington , D.C. <p> Here is most of the text in italics , with my comments in regular font . <p> I write today to express my concerns about Bitcoin . This virtual currency is currently unregulated <p> FALSE : Already Manchin has stated something false . Bitcoin is regulated . What else could one deduce from criminal charges being brought against Charlie Shrem , Mt . Gox &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts ? High profile cases have been solved , making public agencies look good . The feds should be celebrating the success they 've had bringing computer nerds to " justice . " Bitcoin is value , and when it is transacted , it is subject to basically all the same taxes and laws , etc. , as real money . And just like gold and silver , you do n't pay taxes on the gains until you sell the bitcoins for fiat . His letter continues : <p> Bitcoin has allowed users to participate in illicit activity , while also being highly unstable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the illicit activity spiel before . Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash . Further , bitcoin has not disrupted the US economy one bit . The entire bitcoin market has yet to reach more than $14.5 billion in market cap . The Federal Reserve prints out of thin air $85 billion and invests that into the pockets of banksters and war-mongerers . That is called disruptive to an economy . And he continues some more : <p> For the reasons outlined below , I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency . <p> FALSE : Bitcoin is not a currency . This is a highly subjective disposition on what bitcoin is . Bitcoin is technology . Decentralized digital currencies go beyond our historical understanding of what money is . Please continue , Sen. Manchin : <p> By way of background , Bitcoin is a crypto-currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its rising exchange value and relation to illegal transactions . Each Bitcoin is defined by a public address and a private key , thus Bitcoin is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferring that value . It also means that Bitcoin provides a unique digital fingerprint , which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions . <p> FALSE : Again , bitcoin does not allow for anonymous transactions like cash does . And what the heck is a " digital fingerprint " if bitcoin is so anonymous ? Does n't a fingerprint make something not anonymous ? As our very own Jim Karger says , bitcoin has built-in FATCA controls , meaning that it is not really that anonymous at all nor hard for agencies like the National Security Agency , etc. , to detect . But , please continue Sen. Manchin with your half-truths ( at best ) : <p> The very features that make Bitcoin attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement . Due to Bitcoins anonymity , the virtual market has been extremely susceptible to hackers and scam artists stealing millions from Bitcoins users . Anonymity combined with Bitcoins ability to finalize transactions quickly , makes it very difficult , if not impossible , to reverse fraudulent transactions . <p> FALSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anonymous as cash . His logic here could be applied to , say , the Target database hack , in which millions of credit card numbers were exposed to hackers . So , let 's get rid of credit card payments too , while we 're at it , since they pose such a risk . <p> Manchin goes on : <p> more than a handful of countries , and their banking systems , have cautioned against the use of Bitcoin . Indeed , it has been banned in two different countriesThailand and Chinaand South Korea stated that it will not recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate currency . <p> It 's good to see US leaders looking up to free societies , like China and Thailand , to set policy . <p> Several other countries , including the European Union , have issued warnings to Bitcoin users as their respective governments consider options for regulating or banning its use entirely . <p> FALSE : None of the EU countries have moved to ban bitcoin . Yes , Europe acknowledged bitcoins ' existence , and said there were some risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitcoin , realizing it is already part of the country 's regulatory regime , and said it is legal tender . Instead , Senator Manchin wishes to keep the US in the industrial revolution . Senator Manchin would prefer the college graduates in the US , saddled by $1 trillion in debt , stay indebted instead of innovating . <p> While it is disappointing that the world leader and epicenter of the banking industry will only follow suit instead of making policy , it is high time that the United States heed our allies warnings . <p> FALSE : Okay , this guy really does n't know what he is talking about . The United States has been a world leader in imprisoning bitcoiners . Nowhere in the world are bitcoiners less free than in the US . Moreover , the US 's allies have not come out against bitcoin nor have they come anywhere as close as the US to banning it . <p> I am most concerned that as Bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries , Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , Manchin , I know lots of US-based bitcoiners , and what 's likely is they are more suited for the future than you are . They can handle their own finances . Many of them have way more money than you ( aside from kickbacks you might receive ) . <p> All it takes is simple due dilligence on the behalf of one of your tax cattle for them to protect themselves from making a mistake in the bitcoin ecosystem , such as banking at a failing company like Mt . Gox . You 're stuck in the past . Many of us have moved onto the future . I 'd implore you to move on into it , as well , but something tells me it 's too late for you <p> Our foreign counterparts have already understood the wide range of problems even with Bitcoins legitimate uses from its significant price fluctuations to its deflationary nature . <p> WHAT FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS , MR . MANCHIN ? Are you really still talking about China and Thailand ? Because the US 's closest allies , like Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the United States . Even the United Kingdom has been more open to bitcoin than the US . These countries are not scaring businesses and talent away . You are limiting economic opportunities for an American people that has been fleeced since the 2008 banking crisis . People like you are the problem . <p> There is no doubt average American consumers stand to lose by transacting in Bitcoin . <p> The majority of US bitcoiners , Mr. Manchin , have won by using bitcoin . Except for those thrown in cages by busybody regulators . You 're ignoring reality . <p> Luckily , I was n't the only one to notice Manchin 's ignorance . Yellen stated a day after the Manchin letter on bitcoin that the Federal Reserve had no authority to regulate bitcoin . She said Congress should look into it . The Bitcoin Foundation wrote an understanding letter to the senator . Perhaps too understanding , but I understand why they put it the way they did . <p> Ultimately , there is one thing to take away from Manchin 's letter : uncreative control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true way to protect oneself is not through bitcoin , but via diversification into various assets : foreign real estate , gold , silver , and yes even bitcoins . The 21st century is not the time to be an idealogue ( like Manchin ) . Solutions abound for us to free ourselves economically . At this point , if the United States banned bitcoin , then bitcoiners would leave the US en masse , voting not only with their private and public keys , but with their feet as well . That 's a right , Mr. Manchin , you will have to work much harder to strip away .

Crazy , conspiracy theory talk , you say ? <p> Well , those statements come from former FBI Chief , Ted Gunderson , who spent the last year of his life after being diagnosed with cancer airing the dirty laundry of the FBI and the CIA , stating that both organizations have had roles in countless false flag terrorist attacks including the original World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO THANKS <p> So , Muellers attempts to " help " tech companies might as well be like having Godzilla drop by to see if they need any help with all those buildings getting knocked down and set ablaze in Tokyo . <p> Thanks but no thanks Mr. Mueller .

@@99475581 @3675581/ <p> Many like to watch movies or read fiction novels as a way to relax and get away from work and other stresses of day-to-day life . I , on the other hand , find non-fiction to be much more interesting than almost anything dreamed up by a fiction writer . So , when I want to relax and get away from things I like to read and watch non-fiction books and documentaries . <p> Given what is going on in China lately I have been nearly obsessed learning about China 's history . It is easily one of the most interesting cultures on Earth with thousands of years of dynasties , warlords , communism , capitalism , wars and atrocities . <p> Of all the atrocities the worst , by far , was committed during Mao 's Communist China revolution and the typically Orwellian named , " The Great Leap Forward " . <p> That leap eventually ended up with the deaths and starvation of somewhere between 20 and 45 million people . Despite this devastation , American oligarch David Rockefeller said this of the period : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration , but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose . The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao 's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history . " <p> As I watched a recent documentary on this period it struck me how eerily similar the early years of Mao , leading to those deaths , were to today 's USA and Obama . <p> THE SIMILARITIES <p> Hope and Change . As with Obama , Mao was swept into power under great fanfare as a savior by a society of people who had been so impoverished and wartorn to put their faith in this man with his ideas . As with Obama the first few years did n't go too terribly giving some people hope . But , soon after taking power , in 1950 , he quickly got China involved in the Korean War . <p> Land Reform . During that same period Mao went to work on taking away land from landowners and " giving it to the people " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US has been decimating small farmowners through regulations , taxes and even armed raids ending up with large corporations owning more and more of the productive land . The large corporations , through the US blend of fascism and socialism , end up owning more and more of the land . According to the US Department of Agriculture , the number of farms in the United States has fallen from about 6.8 million in 1935 to only about 2 million today . According to Farm Aid , every week approximately 330 farmers leave their land for good . This is n't done as overtly as it was during Mao 's time of just killing landowners as the US government has perfected propaganda but the end result is essentially the same . <p> Suicides . In Shanghai during this time , suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that suicides might land on them . In the US today , even the New Yorker writes about the " suicide epidemic " . Between 1999 and 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-four who took their own lives rose by almost thirty per cent . Among young people in the US , suicide is the third most common cause of death ; among all Americans , suicide claims more lives than car accidents , which were previously the leading cause of injury-related death . <p> Media Suppression and Targeting . Mao launched the " Hundred Flowers Campaign " urging all those with different opinions to express themselves . It was a ruse , however , and he used this to target opponents eventually killing 500,000 landowners . In the US it is done differently but groups , like the Tea Party , have been targetted by the IRS for having oppossing views . And it is well known in the mainstream media that you can not speak out against the current regime . Journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye was imprisoned under Obama 's orders for speaking out about US involvement in the Middle East . And , currently , according to Reporters Without Borders , the US stands at #46 on the World Press Freedom Index just after Romania and one ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao 's time it was said that only those in government and those in the capital cities connected to the government prospered . This is very similar to what is happening today in the US . Government workers currently get paid 45% more than their counterparts in the private market . And , while most of the country languishes in depression level conditions , Washington D.C. is flourishing . The Washington metro area includes a whopping six of the 10 most affluent counties in the nation . <p> Lies And Statistics . As things got worse in Mao 's China the government took to overtly lying about nearly every statistic . They lied egregiously about crop production and the amount of deaths by starvation . Doctors were not allowed to list " starvation " as a cause of death . In the US it is similar in that nearly all government statistics are heavily manipulated to paint a better picture of what is really going on . Unemployment figures , for one , are adjusted so that if people give up looking for work they are not counted as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the current rate of unemployment is 7.3% . However , the percentage of the population which is employed is at lows not seen in 40 years . And , just by computing the unemployment numbers the way they were computed prior to 1994 ( before they took out " long term discouraged workers " from the figures ) as computed by Shadowstats.com , shows an unemployment rate of 23% . <p> Famine and Starvation . As things got worse , by the end of the 1950s , tens of millions of Chinese died of starvation . The US has much more past wealth to live upon and still has the printing of the US dollar to keep things more afloat temporarily but even with these advantages there are now 1 in 6 Americans on food stamps and 1 in 4 children in the US on food stamps . In other words , already , a very large percentage of the population can not even afford food to eat without assistance . Without government assistance , they would starve . <p> THE DIFFERENCES <p> It should be said that China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 21st century are two very different places . China , at that time , was a very poor and backward place . Whereas the US , due to semi-free markets for past centuries , is incredibly advanced and has built up a lot of wealth . <p> As well , communication technologies such as the internet do not allow most government 's today to wholesale slaughter people . In the US today these same goals are undertaken through fines , taxation , regulation , inflation and criminalizing nearly every human activity . Nearly half of all people under the age of 23 in the US today have been arrested and the US has the world 's largest prison population with 25% of the prisoners with only 5% of the world population . Through these means the US government can look to be less heinous than outright murdering thousands or millions of people but essentially with the same results . <p> Because of these differences we should not expect to see the US follow the exact same path of Mao 's China . But the similarities of the two times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Tribune in 1934 on numerous occassions because it so perfectly explains what is going on in the US today . <p> Spend ! Spend ! Spend ! The US government has been spending and going into deficits at rates that would have shocked people even 15 years ago . The debt of the US government has increased $6.666 trillion since President Barack Obama took office . When Obama was first inaugurated on Jan. 20 , 2009 , the debt of the U.S. government was $10,626,877,048,913.08 , according to the Treasury Departments Bureau of the Public Debt . As of Jan. 31 , 2014 , the latest day reported , the debt was $17,293,019,654,983.61an increase of $6,666,142,606,070.53 . The total debt of the United States did not exceed $6.666 trillion until July 2003 . In the little more than five years of the Obama presidency , the U.S. has accumulated as much new debt as it did in its first 227 years . <p> Blame The Capitalists . Fomenting a class war the heavily socialist indoctrinated youth and poor are constantly told it is " greedy corporations " causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent " minimum wage " rhetoric . <p> Junk The Constitution . The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been all but ransacked in recent years specifically since 9/11 and the Patriot Act . People collecting rain water or building a pond on their own property or living sustainably off the grid have been deluged by federal agencies threatening them with massive fines or jail time . And , the rising police state and the endless accounts of police brutality is just another example of this . <p> Declare a Dictatorship . Barack Obama continues to wage wars without approval from Congress , issue Executive Order edicts , create kill lists and in his most recent State of the Union address even went so far as to say that he was going to go around Congress to get things done all to wild applause . That is a dictatorship . <p> THE FALL OF AMERICA <p> Those plans , as laid out in the Chicago Tribune cartoon from 1934 are falling exactly into place . That , combined with the fact that Barack Obama 's US is following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up . <p> Unfortunately , it only keeps getting worse . Capital controls are coming into effect in July of 2014 , under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) and so if you do n't have yourself or your wealth well outside of the US by this point your time is running out . <p> For this reason we have again set-up an urgent conference called the Crisis Conference this time scheduled for April 30th-May 4th in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . If you still have significant assets inside the US I urge you to seriously considering attending . <p> The US is currently similar to the early days of Mao . How it ends up is anyone 's guess but it is n't going to be pretty .

He sought sanctuary in Ecuador 's embassy in London . On the one-year anniversary of his haven , Assange stated , " if the Swedish government immediately drops their request tomorrow , I still can not leave this embassy . " Why ?

He is the US soldier who provided the classified material to WikiLeaks . Arrested in May 2010 , he has spent over three years in jail without being convicted of a crime . Shortly after Manning 's imprisonment , Adrian Lamo the man who turned Manning in assured an audience that the friend he betrayed would be treated well . " We do n't  torture our own citizens , " Lamo said . <p> While jailed at Quantico , Manning was kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day . He was not allowed to lean against the wall , to sleep during the day or to exercise . His personal items were confiscated ; eventually , his reading glasses and clothing were also taken . Long-term solitary confinement is well recognized by human rights organizations as a form of extreme torture . On June 3rd , 2013 , he finally went on trial . Of 22 charges against him , he has pleaded guilty to 10 which could bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " aiding the enemy , " a capital offense that can be punished by death . <p> Edward Snowden knows what it means to speak truth in a jurisdiction that is not immediately obedient to Obama . Snowden leaked the classified details of the National Security Agency 's illegal , massive surveillance of the emails and other communications of both Americans and foreigners . He was smart enough to release the information from Hong Kong . This was a geopolitical gamble WRIT large but Hong Kong was a superb choice . <p> The former British colony is ultimately answerable to the Chinese Communist Party but it has a considerable degree of self-administration . Its common law system shielded Snowden from political arrest while America 's legal system would have slapped him into cuffs faster than he could say " indefinite detention . " Hong Kong had at least three other advantages . There is an active protest movement that solidly backed Snowden with demonstrations in the street . Hong Kong is renowned for a meticulous legal system that requires every " i " to be dotted . America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially said " the paperwork is inadequate . " First and foremost , however , the revelation that America has been hacking into the computer systems of institutions and individuals in Hong Kong obviously infuriates officials ; their official response to America 's demand for extradition included a pointed inquiry about the hacking . The response came only after the Moscow-bound Snowden was in Russian and not Chinese air space . <p> America 's despotism has turned the world upside down so that China and Russia are the protectors of free speech and transparency . Their motives are self-interested , of course , but this is true of any government . The most America could do was to revoke Snowden 's passport and sputter demands that no country allow him to enter . <p> Domestically , Obama has responded by speeding the implementation of " Insider threat " a program established in October 2011 as a response to the Manning leak . It imposes criminal penalties on government employees or contractors who do not report a suspected whistleblower . In short , everyone is to monitor everyone else 's words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed by McClatchy illustrate how some agencies " are pursuing " unauthorized disclosures of any information , not just classified material . They also show how millions of federal employees and contractors must watch for ' high-risk persons or behaviors ' among co-workers and could face penalties , including criminal charges , for failing to report them . Leaks to the media are equated with espionage . " <p> The media and public silence surrounding " Insider Threat " is the silence of death ; freedom of speech is dead in America . <p> Freedom of the press is hardly more vital . Snowden has been excoriated for leaking the NSA information to a British newspaper , The Guardian , rather than to a US one . " If he was sincere about not wanting to harm America , " his critics howl , " then he would have published in an American newspaper . " And , yet , Snowden went to the TheWashington Post with the same story . Politico reported : <p> " Edward Snowden used the code name ' Verax ' , truth-teller in Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barton Gellman about disclosing some dramatic state secrets on intelligence gathering.A series of indirect contacts preceded the first direct exchange May 16 between Snowden and Gellman .

The newspaper not only declined , it also " sought the views of government officials about the potential harm to national security " prior to eventually publishing " only four of the 41 slides " provided by Snowden . Whether or not Snowden contacted Guardian commentator Glenn Greenwald prior to The Washington Post 's decline , it was at that point that The Guardian became a necessary second outlet . <p> American news outlets that should be doing investigative reporting to establish the truth are consulting with government officials instead on what they should print . What if The New York Times had waved off Daniel Ellsberg or reported the Pentagon Papers to the government in advance for ' guidance ' on what to report about the Vietnam War ? Snowden went to The Guardian because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America 's mainstream news outlets . This is just one fall-out of the inability to speak truth on American soil without risking life and limb . <p> Those who wish to speak truth confront an increasing need to do so on foreign soil or , at least , to have a haven . Snowden 's American passport was revoked precisely because the United States knows it must trap people within its own border to silence them .

It allows their broker to lend their shares to short sellers , driving down the price of your investment . <p> Additionally , this method allows the broker to re-hypothecate your assets and borrow money against your shares so they can speculate in the derivatives market <p> These hidden risks are the seeds of tomorrows ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer accounts as experienced in the MF Global fiasco . " -Jim Sinclair , April 5 , 2012 <p> By our estimation , Mr. Sinclair is 100% correct , and those who take defensive action now will avoid the next " MF-Global " style collapse of a broker dealer . We are in the eye of an economic storm , and as the economy begins to nosedive once again , Western financial firms will continue their industry-wide wave of bankruptcies . <p> Those holding stock investments in a traditional brokerage account may be wondering : What are the alternative methods of holding stock certificates , and how do I get started in following Mr. Sinclairs wise advice ? <p> Below is a reprint of my January 13th article which covers the basics of " direct registration " and " paper share certification " forms of share ownership . They are both easily accessible , and remove all the risks inherent in " street name registration . " Additionally , my report , " BulletProof Shares " How To Protect Your Stock Investments From Broker Bankruptcy &amp; Theft , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " paper share certification " of shares . Learning about these methods and taking action now may help prevent your stock portfolio from being ransacked by the next Jon Corzine . <p> The reason I began researching and ultimately put this paper together was simple : fear . As a stock investor , I became afraid to continue holding my stock investments in the financial system . My investigations into this matter were both shocking and relieving as I 've previously reported , for the reason that all the financial " safe guards " to protect investors from losses are flimsy at best . I 'm indirectly referring to the SIPC when I say that by the way . I discovered that in the economic " good times " , the SIPC carries around a billion dollars in capital , which is raised from annual member company dues . But in bad economic times such as were in now , member companies go bankrupt and many fall behind in their annual contributionswhile at the same time broker bankruptcies increase , putting a tightening financial noose on the entire organization . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how easy and simple it actually is to protect and remove stock investments from broker dealers custodial possession and the financial system itself . By default , stocks are always purchased under the " street name registration " when you purchase them with a broker dealer . This means the stocks are held in custody under the name of the broker dealer you 're using . The two alternative methods which serve to " de-risk " your shares from counter party risks in the system , are " direct registration " and " paper share certification " . <p> Direct registration and paper share certification are covered in depth in " BulletProof Shares " . It took hundreds of hours of research pouring through the internet , and speaking with dozens of transfer agents , brokers , and public companies . While I highly recommend stock investors purchase a copy of " BulletProof Shares " , I 'd also like to point out that anybody can use these methods at no cost , provided they do the research on their own . All my data was acquired from public sources and companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others I might add ) for free . So the question for most people is simply a matter of value vs time . Spend a couple bucks and save a few hundred hours , or spend a few hundred hours and save a couple bucks . The choice is yours . <p> WHY WE MUST BE AWARE OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF SHARE OWNERSHIP <p> While MFG may be the last high-profile investment custodian bankruptcy the United States will see during this financial crisis , there 's a high likelihood in my opinion that it wont be . In my conversations with the SIPC I discovered they 're replenishing 800 MFG client stock accounts , but they would not tell me how much of the fund has been used in doing so . In my last written piece , I spoke to the fact that over 30,000 customer accounts were comprised in the MFG collapse . I 've also previously written that all it takes for $1 billion in SIPC funds to be tapped out , is a total of 2,000 compromised stock accounts each containing $500k in securities or more . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first $500k in bankruptcy losses of a customers account . After that $500k threshold , all the losses are suffered by the investor with zero insurance coverage . The only other means of loss recovery would be the investor engaging in a lawsuit against the fallen broker . But as we 've seen with many previous high profile bankruptcies , when these companies go outthey go out with a bangmeaning billions upon billions upon billions in losses . Any single account holder looking for recovery of a $1.2 million investment portfolio will be standing in a creditors line for a decade before being told " there 's simply no more money left to pay you . " <p> Therefore , in my humble opinion and as a student of the investment markets , I feel we must understand each and every tool in our investment toolbox in order to build a proper wooden shed . Or for our readers who are inclined to the cookingwe must be familiar with each utensil in order to prepare a savory banquet . What would the meal be like if we were forced to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are we suppose to saw a wooden 2+4 in half using a pocket knife ? We must learn of all tools available to us ( whether on our own of through " BulletProof Shares " ) , and carefully prepare for times in which an alternative tool or utensil is required for the occasion . <p> COMMON MISNOMERS &amp; BROKER-FED RESISTANCE LINES <p> As previously stated , direct registration and paper share certification are investment tools we must be aware of . Thousands of " BulletProof Shares " readers have already sent in streams of feedback and questions to which we 've used to further improve the paper . Some common questions &amp; circumstances we 've seen are : <p> - " I use xyz broker-dealer and I know they are SAFE because they specifically say in all their company materials that they do n't  use " re-hypothecation " or enable discrete lending out of shares ( short selling ) in customer accounts . " <p> Market commentator Peter Grandich is known for saying , " I 'd rather be a scared chicken than a dead duck . " His comment sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a plan of writing a reportmy research began when I decided I no longer trust any broker dealers . To add clarity to the pointyour broker dealer may in fact be a fantastic , trustworthy organization . What I discovered which bothered me specifically , is that many " safe " brokers are using " unsafe " banking organizations . Some of them are using 3-5 diff. " unsafe " banking organizations . When I say " unsafe " by the way , I 'm simply using my own opinion of what safe is . Everyone has a different opinion . So in order for a broker to be fully " safe " , they need to also be only dealing with safe counter parties in this writers opinion . <p> At this juncture you might ask this writers opinion on what a safe bank iswhich is a conversation that can not be fully addressed in this article . One thing I will say however , is that any bank which received a penny from the bank bailout is not a safe bank in my opinion . As an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge fund manager Kyle Bass , in which I learned many Swiss bankers are held personally liable for fraud occurring in their bank . Also , China is executing individuals who are discovered of investor fraud . Executions and personal liability in response to these high profile frauds are items which would coax my trust back out of the bottle . <p> " I have my shares held in a retirement account and I do n't  want to pay capital gains when I sell my shares in order to use direct registration or paper share certification . " <p> This is a common misunderstanding . Direct registration and paper share certification are not " sales or dispositions " of shares . They are simply a " transfer " from one party to another , or from one physical manifestation to another . You can digitally send a stock position from your broker to the transfer agent , have it printed as a share certificate , then send it back to the broker , before going through the process all over againall without selling your stock . You 're simply moving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in " BulletProof Shares " to learn more about this . <p> " My broker says I 'll need an attorney to use these methods , or that it will cost too much money , or that it will take too long , or that its a bad idea , etc , etc , etc " <p> Let me make this perfectly clear:Youre brokers job is keep all client accounts in their possession for as many commission generating buy &amp; sell cycles as possible , and most will say or do anything in their power to keep it that way . <p> Much like holding physical precious metals or real estate , when you 're holding paper share certificates or using DRS method , chances are your " trading activity " will completely dry up . You will trade maybe only once or twice a year , and you may even end up owning the shares long enough to pass them down to a family member . How will your broker make money if you 're not trading in his accounts ? <p> Therefore , many broker dealers will tell you anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cost-free methods which will protect your shares ( did I mention I recommend two brokers in the report which offer free transfers to transfer agents ? ) . As a final point to this question , I spoke with dozens of brokers myself during a search for a broker to recommend in " BulletProof Shares " . I called one broker after another asking if they charged fees to use DRS stock transfers to the transfer agents . <p> Most of the time I was dealing with customer service agents who knew nothing of transfer agents , and I was often transferred from one representative to another before obtaining the correct information . Since there has yet to be a highly-publicized broker dealer collapse affecting tens of thousands of stock investors , the entire broker-dealer customer service industry is mostly unaware of how to precisely use these methods.That discovery was probably the most alarming of all . Many people I spoke with in the investment industry had no idea how counter party risk works , what a transfer agent does , or why a stock investor would use direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I wrote this paper myself , stand by it 100% , and take great pride in my work .

Last month , Doug Shulman , commissioner of the IRS , said the bureau is targeting asian bank accounts and that taxpayers should expect new criminal investigations and prosecutions . <p> " We definitely have been tracking migration of assets out of Europe and into Asia , " Mr. Shulman told reporters when introducing the disclosure program in February . He said the IRS is looking for offenders in places " you might not expect . " link <p> This is leading to record numbers of expatriate US citizens to cut their final link to the US by renouncing their citizenship of course that is n't something you want to do without having a second passport and citizenship already lined up . <p> But , very soon , you might not have to go to the trouble of renouncing your citizenship . The Government will be happy to do it for you . Fascist Joe Lieberman is co-sponsoring H.R. 3166 : Enemy Expatriation Act . <p> Introduced as S. 1698 in the Senate and as H.R. 3166 in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " add engaging or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality . " <p> These bills are inconsistent with current law and Supreme Court precedent . They appear to be tailored to cow the American people , without regard for the 14th-Amendment guarantee prohibiting Congress from divesting an American citizen of his citizenship . <p> On their face , S. 1698 and H.R. 3166 make it appear that any citizen " engaging in , or purposefully and materially supporting , hostilities against the United States " would lose his citizenship . This is unlike current law , which also requires proof that the citizen does so " with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality . " Thus , the new bills would make it much easier for the government to strip a dissenting citizen of his citizenship . Link <p> We can clearly see that the United Soviet States of America is putting in place the necessary tools to be able to strip whoever it likes of the so called " privilege " of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasite like Lieberman , who has been at the forefront of the legislative side of the police state for quite some time . Here is a report on a bill he co-sponsored in 2010 , the " Enemy Belligerent , Interrogation , Detention , and Prosecution Act of 2010 , " <p> When it comes to freedom of speech , the USSA is also clamping down hard . This week saw the largest ever online protest of the governments actions with major sites such as Google , Wikipedia , Reddit and others blacking out their sites over the proposed SOPA and PIPA Bills . These bills would give the US Government the ability to strangle any website it chooses based on the flimsiest of claims of an IP owner that their Intellectual property " rights " are being violated . <p> So just in case you missed that , a citizen of the tax farm known as New Zealand is facing extradition to the USSA and up to 50 years in in a cage for running a site known as MegaUpload . Do n't  be surprised if the thugs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MegaUpload and troll for the records of as many of its users as possible . <p> Do n't  get entangled in the collapse of this criminal enterprise known as the USA .

@@99475585 @3675585/ <p> You may be sitting there , thinking , its November 7th , why am I not speaking about how 30% of 305 million people in the geographic region known as the US gave their consent to a murderous , thieving organization . Or , at best , voted for the lesser evil in a popularity contest of sociopathic criminals . here 's the deal . It does n't  matter . Its a show . To paraphrase rapper Notorious B.I.G. , If you did n't  know that , well now you know . <p> What 's more important ? Much more important than any person in government ? Men like Nikola Tesla . Or Louis Pasteur . Or Steve Jobs . Hell , any thousands of producers and contributors to your and my life . Have an iPad ? Have electricity ? Do n't  die when you scrape your foot on a sharp stone ? You owe your life and the quality of it to true heroes . Not to Mittens or Bronco . <p> Bronco OBomber and Mittens Romney ? I cant believe I even have to mention these cretins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short history lesson . Something you 'll never hear discussed in the public indoctrination camps . 150 years ago humans did n't  even have light bulbs . They did n't  have electricity . This brings me back to Tesla . He , not Edison , produced most of what we know about electricity , radio , x-rays , electric motors , lasers , wireless communications and countless other things today . <p> People like Bronco OBomber and Nancy Pelosi have never producted anything except an advance of theft and kidnapping . They are sad , twisted individuals with no care for truth in history . They just know they get shoveled millions of Federal Reserve Notes for shilling for the system and riding in their limousines , or the aptly named " Beast " for Bronco . <p> Unbelievably , if you ask the average American female young slave , who they would like to emulate most , it is Killary Clinton . If you ask the average US male young slave , itll likely be Bronco OBomber . This is your hint to get out now ( call TDV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , you live among zombies . You cant defeat them . You 'd have better luck trying to infiltrate the mafia and trying to turn it into a children 's charity . Not going to happen . <p> So , if you voted yesterday shame on you ! Plus , you did nothing to change anything . Your vote did n't  count . And even if it did , you just consented to being ruled . How do you feel about that ? <p> I 'm going to actually pour my heart out a little here . Ive been writing about this stuff for a few years . I 've had a lot of people shake my hand and thank me for telling the truth . I 've also been attacked , on a very regular basis . Its an interesting dichotomy . People call me all kinds of things but all I really am is a human being . I love peace and prosperity and the human connection . I do n't  know why were here if anyone does and has conclusive proof , please notify me . But , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodney King , may he rest in peace . To paraphrase , we have to stop hurting and stealing from and killing each other . <p> While I do n't know the existential answer to the " why ? " of human existence , I do know that peace and freedom are by far the preferable modes to the " how ? " of our existence . Violence and oppression are not just awful in their own rite . They also tend to impoverish humanity overall by killing initiative and material progress . A system of property rights married to absolute freedom ( as scary as absolute freedom is to most of humanity still ) is what produces the most wealthand wealth is just another word for increasing material comfort . <p> But liberty is equally vital to happiness . It is hard to be happy if you live in constant fear of an abusive mastersomething that African slaves in the Americas knewas did Soviet Russians . It 's something US citizens will come to realize a lot more clearly in the coming months and years . ( In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain really should at least use our other advice to prepare financially . ) <p> THE NEVER ENDING LEFT-RIGHT DEBACLE <p> I was quite sad to waste an hour recently watching a " debate " between a sound , morally correct individual , Doug Casey , and a snickering , snorting caricature of what are now called " liberals " and a seething mainstream presstitute named Krauthammer . <p> While Doug Casey tried to get a word in edgewise to ask , " What are you principles ? What do you believe in ? " , the two government lovers to the right snickered and snaked their way to talking about the exact opposite . They spent about thirty minutes debating the most unimportant details of the electoral process . I advise you to not even waste your time watching . <p> But this is the state of affairs in the US today . Brainwashed people , for the most part , debating nonsensical , unimportant details while not one sheeple in the crowd boos . To me , its long past time to get out . What Nikola Tesla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tesla today would likely go to Singapore , or Hong Kong , or Santiago , Chile . Things change , baby . <p> The entire modern human history is just a saga of people fleeing collectivism and it still has n't  changed . The funny part is , however , much of the world is catching on to this trap people in the US havent . Watch what happens when they figure it out . <p> oh , I just landed and hear Bronco OBomber won the job of Chief Murderer . Enjoy ! <p> Anarcho-Capitalist . Libertarian speaker at many of the worlds freedom , investment and gold conferences as well as regularly in the media . <p> Your devoted state-hating scallywags here at The Dollar Vigilante often quip that there would be no substantive difference between a Republican or Democratic win at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " more state . " Either way you 're getting : indefinite military detention of civilians , the continued war on drugs , the use of drones to explosively detonate brown women and children abroad , the increasing use of drones to spy and terrorize American citizens stateside , more bailouts of corporate zombies , more debt and more debasement of the currency . <p> But with an Obama presidency you will get a LOT better-sounding speaches . And maybe a slight acceleration of the inevitable economic collapse . Romney is a moralistic , dictatorial , daddy figure who could n't wait to impose curfews and beatings for lifestyle choices . But he was less likely to hand money out to the those who did n't earn itunless they incorporate first ( and get " too big " ) ! So that acceleration of the economic collapse under Obama really may not be all that noticeable . It would have happened under Mittens , too . Those who think that Mitt Romney represents some kind of free market capitalist hero really need to brush up on why central banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandy in Mitt 's eyes are NON-free market things that impede economies . Capitalism is n't really about dismantling companies and hiding the proceeds in offshore accounts . <p> Personally , I do n't believe that anybody is really centrally running the show when it comes to the elections . The people really are allowed to vote and those votes are actualy counted and the candidates probably really are striving to win the contest . The beast puts on a show it truly believes . After all , the state is n't a bunch of shadowy figures ruling down on a begrudging populace . It 's all the players , the sociopaths who seek political power as well as the easily-led masochists who put their faith in political authority . It is billion-entity orgy of impostions and submissions , of comingling myths about the need to be told what to do . <p> I 'm so fundamentally negative on politics and voting that I almost hate to admit that there was a shred of good news coming out of Election Day . But the facts remain : The State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . It is now legal to smoke marijuana recreationally in those states . And as of last night it is legal to smoke pot for medicinal purposes in Massachusetts . As stupid and brainwashed and completely afraid of freedom as Americans arethey are at least waking up to the fact that the war on drugs has always been a war on them and their privacy and liberty . <p> Marijuana prohibition in the face of alcohol legalization made absolutely zero sense even in the dismal logic of the nanny state . Federal law still says the feds will kidnap you and toss you in rape camp for marijuana use , however . So this show is n't nearly over . But it 's a positive sign nonethelessa tiny flicker of hope that maybe the USSA wo n't go permanently into the night . Can enough people wake up in time ? Probably not . But I 'll still take my joys where I can . And this tiny but significant rollback of prohibition will warm my soul on the cold northern nights to come . <p> Regards , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as we love the blow for sheer liberty that Colorado and Washington representwe 're also capitalists and we will be exploring the entrepreneurial opportunities involved in marijuana legalization .

@@99475586 @3675586/ 28881 @qwx888881 <h> Its Now Easier to Enter the US than it is to Leave <p> On my recent trip to New York it was much harder to leave the country than it was to enter something that should make every Americans ears perk up . <p> Here is what I had to go through to get on my flight bound from New Yorks JFK to Mexico City . <p> The first stop was the TSA screening procedure . The TSA recently announced that they will give " extra screening " to those who show " contempt " to the TSA procedures . <p> Let 's look up a definition of the word contempt : <p> con-temp noun 1 . The feeling with which a person regards anything considered mean , vile , or worthless ; disdain ; scorn . <p> That is exactly how I feel about the TSA ! It is mean , vile and worthless ! Perhaps for this reason they initially pulled me aside to get me to walk through the Backscatter X-ray machine . <p> Trying my best to hide my disdain and scorn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that thing . " <p> The woman there eyed me down . " You do n't  want to go through ? " she asked as though I must obviously be hiding something . <p> " Opt out ! " she shouted . " Opt out ! " . Making sure everyone within about 100 feet of the screening area was aware of my highly suspicious choice not to be irradiated and be viewed naked by a bunch of government underlings . <p> She then got on the walkie talkie to notify them that we are going to need a male screener despite my request for a female for an opt out . He mustve been at lunch or something , because it was nearly 10 minutes later when he finally showed up . <p> He put on some plastic gloves and told me to walk to the back with him , spread my legs and hold my hands out to the sides , palms up , and then performed the most thorough check of my body Ive ever had . It took over 5 minutes to feel every part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas he was so kind as to tell me , " Using the back of my hands " . <p> This was the first time I 've had the " thorough patdown " and I have to say , based on what they did , I doubt I will ever travel by air through the US with my wife or my children . I would not want any female or young person to have to go through that . It definitely felt very invasive . <p> Withholding the urge to say , " You like that ? " when he touched my groin I finally made it through the full patdown and made my way to the gate . <p> Upon showing my boarding pass I was then pulled aside for " secondary screening " where they went through all my baggage . <p> But here is where it gets a bit crazy . After having gone through the 5 minute patdown and then having my carry-on luggage checked for a second time , as we walked down the tunnel to the airplane , as we turned the final turn there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badges on . They pulled every single person off to the side to question them . <p> Here was the conversation I had with my female customs agent : <p> Her : " Where you going ? " <p> Me : &lt;resisting the urge to say , " What do you care ? " &gt; Uh , Mexico City . <p> Her : Do you know the currency laws ? <p> Me : All of them ? There must be thousands , how could I possibly ? <p> Her : You know what I 'm talking about <p> Me : Uh , that $10,000 thing ? <p> Her : Ya , you cant take more than $10,000 out <p> Me : &lt;resisting the urge to ask her why&gt; Ok , yes I have heard about that rule <p> Her : Here is some reading material . <p> Me : I 've already got a book , I 'm OK thanks <p> Her : I want you to sign this pamphlet <p> Me : Why ? <p> Her : It says you understand that you cant take out more than $10,000 <p> Me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you got ? <p> Me : On me ? <p> Her : Ya <p> Me : I do n't  know , $200 maybe <p> Her : Uh-huh <p> She then told me to come down a side-tunnel where she asked me to take out my money and show her . I did and then , again , for now the third time , she looked through all my stuff . <p> Finally she asked me to again sign the contract , this time saying that she did n't  take my money . <p> Government apologists will state , well , if you are n't  doing anything wrong and you are n't  trying to take more than $10,000 in cash outside of the country then you should n't mind all the searches , questioning and triple checking . But those people are missing the point entirely . <p> This much searching of people trying to leave the country , plus the cash-sniffing dogs they have in many US international airports makes it blatantly obvious that the US Government is beginning to clamp down on people leaving the country with any cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With all the infrastructure now in place , the US Government is prepared for a major crackdown on the wealth of US citizens . Theyve already made it so no US citizen can open a stock brokerage account outside of the US and they have done many deals with other countries to make them report ANY accounts Americans have in their countries . <p> Unbelievably , the IRS even has agents outside of the country spying on US citizens trying to ensure that none of their assets escape the control of the US Government . <p> The IRS recently opened an office in Panama City with 160 agents . According to reports , they go around in plain clothes to strike up conversations , without stating who they are , with ex-pats to start a profile and find out what they are doing with investments in Panama . They hang out in bars and restaurants listening to conversations . <p> If you are paying attention to all of this and are aware of the US Governments insolvent situation and the amount of money printing ( which will turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , it is as plain as day what is going on . <p> If you also take into account how , like we posted in yesterdays blog , that the US Government , fresh off of announcing the death of Osama bin Laden , has begun to spread the meme that the new threat are American citizens themselves , the picture is scarily clear . <p> All it will take now is a false-flag " terror attack " which they will pin on an American citizen , and the borders will be shut down to all but the most politically connected Americans . Taxes will then likely be raised and IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement accounts will be either taxed or taken over and placed in worthless Government treasuries , just like Ireland did this week . <p> People will then finally see the writing on the wall and will begin to want to move assets outside of the country . That is when full currency controls will be put in place and the aforementioned infrastructure will be there to make sure no one can get out with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and you have n't begun to move your assets outside of the country you are running out of time . Things are happening at such a speed now that you may only have months left . <p> If you have an IRA in the US there are ways to get the assets in the IRA outside of the country , completely legally . I urge all Americans with an IRA to check out this service by friend and colleague , Terry Coxon , called " Unleash your IRA " here : LONG ... <p> As well , for other assets outside of your IRA , look to move them outside of the country as well . It is still legal in the US to do so although , legally , you may be required to report the whereabouts to the US Government , but at least it is one step removed from them being able to seize it themselves . <p> I also urge Americans to rush to get a second passport . This , also , is 100% legal still . We report every month on the best countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatriate for a few years while the collapse of the US dollar and US Government continues . <p> For those who do n't  want to leave or do n't  have the capability to leave at this time we also report each month on how to prepare for the dollar collapse to come and the subsequent social chaos items like food storage and survival strategies . <p> My recent trip to the US only reinforces what our research and data has shown all along : that the US Government and the US dollar is in a state of collapse and they appear ready and willing to treat their citizens as milk cows to keep the system alive for as long as possible
