@@44077559 @4077559/ <p> There is a lot of confusion regarding loot and item levels in Mythic+ dungeons and the weekly chest . Here is our guide to clarify ! <p> Mythic+ Dungeons are a new feature introduced with Legion and they were announced as an alternate path to raiding . They are a pretty solid way to gear your character and most of the top raiding guilds even found chain running them more effective than doing heroic split raids . But , there are two major questions about Loot in Mythic+ that are causing a lot of confusion . Here are the answers : <h> When And How Much Loot Do I- Get Loot in Mythic+ Dungeons ? <p> You do not get any loot from Bosses or trashmobs- during your run , regardless of difficulty <p> You do get at least one and up to three loot chests- at the end of each run , depending on your performance : <p> One chest- is guaranteed upon completion of a mythic+ dungeon , no matter if you have made it in time or- not <p> To get two chests , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chests , you have to be 40%- faster than the timer <p> The chests upon completion are personal loot and contain guaranteed two items for your whole group <p> Everyone gets some AP from the chests at the end of the run <p> After every weekly reset , you will get an item through your Grand Challengers Bounty the big- chest that can be found in- your Class Order Hall <p> Note : take a look at the addon MythicPlusTimer which will show you the timers for 2 and 3 chests as well ! <h> What Itemlevel Does Mythic+ Loot Have ? <p> At first glance , this is where it gets complicated . TL ; DR is : the weekly loot is- significantly better and all loot is capped at level +10 . The quality of the item in your weekly chest is- determined by the highest difficulty you have completed- the last week . And it is not important if you have beaten- the timer . <p> In other words : if you manage to complete a mythic +8 dungeon your chest will contain a 895 item after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more to complete the run . <p> Mythic Level <p> On completion <p> Weekly chest <p> 0 <p> 865 <p> <p> +2 <p> 870 <p> 875 <p> +3 <p> 870 <p> 880 <p> +4 <p> 875 <p> 885 <p> +5 <p> 875 <p> 890 <p> +6 <p> 880 <p> 890 <p> +7 <p> 880 <p> 895 <p> +8 <p> 885 <p> 895 <p> +9 <p> 885 <p> 900 <p> +10 <p> 890 <p> 905 <p> +11 <p> 890 <p> 910 <p> +12 <p> 895 <p> 915 <p> +13 <p> 900 <p> 920 <p> +14 <p> 905 <p> 925 <p> +15 <p> 910 <p> 930 <p> Note : The rewarded items can be titanforged 925 , of course !

At a certain amount of upgrade-levels ( +15 ) these items are called " Titanforged " instead of " Warforged " . Yes , a TF LFR item can be better than a base mythic one ! <p> Last Update : November 15 , 2016 <h> Artifact Weapon <p> So let 's dive into some of the more important points . First of all the- biggest change in gearing will be artifact weapons . Your character will get his- weapon- during the very first quests- when arriving at- the Broken Isles . Those weapons are iconic and unique to every class and a large storyline- will be tied- to it. - You will level up and improve your artifact as you progress further in the game. - Surely there will be plenty of guides on that , as soon as Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itemlevel 750- when you first receive it . You then can add up to three ( third one is unlocked later in the campaign ) relics to it and besides empowering your weapon with better stats or buff special traits they- will increase its- overall itemlevel as well . Relics can be- looted from almost every PvE activity and their power is scaled according to the effort you have to put into getting them . <p> So before the raids and mythic plus dungeons will open , you can have a total artifact itemlevel of 870 . <h> Craftable Items <p> All the professions of course get overhauled too with Legion , but like with every other expansion , the craftable items are a pretty good start when looking for better gear . We will cover each profession separately over the next week , here are just some very basic facts : <p> Most professions allow you to craft items with an basic itemlevel of- 800 <p> This time there will be no restriction on the amount of crafted items you have equipped <p> Materials will be pretty expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be replaced with Order Class Halls . We will cover them in detail as soon as beta progresses . We already- know though , that the items from ilvl 795 up to ilvl 840- can- be bought with Class Order Ressources . The items make up a complete set ( like Legacy of AzjAqir for Warlocks ) - and the single tiers are heavily gated ( reputation , achievements , ) . The lower items can be upgraded until a maximum of 840 as well . <h> Faction Gear <p> Some- major Factions will sell you a 820 gearpiece on Revered and a- 850 itemlevel gearpiece when reaching Exalted . The Suramar faction The Nightfallen will sell itemlevel800 boots items on friendly . We will cover Reputation and Faction content in a separate guide later this summer and will leave you here with the following facts : <p> One 850 item per Faction purchaseable with gold <p> Character needs to be Exalted <p> Reputation is gained through world quests <h> Legendary Worlddrops <p> The community roared as the devs announced , that there will be random dropping legendary items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special effect <p> You can get a Legendary from every activity in the game . The developers want to bring back surprising moments on casual farm days back in the game . <p> In a later state of Legion , legendaries will probably be targetable and farmed . <p> Characters can only equip one legendary at the start but can unlock a second one by progression with their Class Order Hall <p> The effects on the items will be disabled in the first weeks of Mythic Progress to make the race a bit more fair UPDATE : Legendaries will be fully usable in raids and mythic dungeons at any given time . <h> BoE Ring of the Kirin Tor <p> The Ring of the KirinTor is back and better than ever : Empowered Ring of the Kirin Tor ! The new ring- will have an itemlevel of 865- and can be purchased for 250.000 gold without any restrictions at a Vendor- in New Dalaran . Being Exalted however makes it- a bit cheaper . <h> Loot from Dungeons : alternate path to raiding <p> Normal and Heroic Dungeons work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kill the mobs- and get loot with itemlevel 730-760- on normal , 825- on heroic and 840 on mythic difficulty . The real deal in Legion will be the new Mythic plus dungeons , wich replace the old Challenge Mode Dungeons . This system was introduced- as an alternative to raiding and the loot is bound to the level you are playing the dungeon on . It will start from 845 ( Mythic +2 ) and goes up to 870 ( Mythic +11 ) . You also will get a weekly chest with loot , based on your best run it the past week contained items can scale up to- 885 . <p> Mythic plus dungeons are- supposed to have an infinite difficulty and can be chain-runned as long as you have enough fresh keystones . Two items per group per run are guaranteed , when you beat a given timer by 20% or even 40% , you will be rewarded with even more loot . Possibly those Mythic plus runs will reward loot equal to mythic raids in higher levels . <h> Warforged and Titanforged Items <p> You all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further and will introduce so called Titanforged items , which are simply Warforged items with a much bigger upgrade ( +15 or greater ) . Those items have an itemlevel upgrade in +5 intervals and can- drop from- almost every endgame content : in dungeons or raids , from world bosses and world quests . <p> Itemlevel Range across all difficulties in the first Legion raid instance <p> This means , an item from LFR- could possibly have itemlevel 895- ( 835 base +60 titanforged ) . Oh and a socket . OH AND a tertiary stat . This is totally intended and should reward players doing content , they have already cleared , as Ian Hazzikostas stated in a Q&amp;A earlier this month . <p> However to keep the game balanced and reward mythic raiders , the chance for an higher upgrade decreases with each interval . If an item drops and can be WF/TF , the system rolls for a +5 upgrade . If the roll succeeds , the system will roll for another +5 , until the roll fails . A- 895 LFR drop will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mythic Raids And Mythic+ Are Available <p> To prevent the system having a bigger- impact on the progression race , it is tied to the maximum available itemlevel in the game . This means the itemlevel for Titanforged will be capped around 850 until the Mythic+ Dungeons and Mythic Raids are available . After that , Titanforgedwill be capped at 895 . <h> Wrapping it up : - 840 average when the raids open <p> At the current state of the beta it looks like there will be much more ways to raise your characters itemlevel especially within the first weeks . A lot of the different paths to better gear are pretty much tied together around the Class Order Halls : for example , you need to be revered with three Factions of Legion to get a piece of the Class Hall Armor and by gaining reputation you unlock the recipes for the craftables and you eventually unlock the 840 pieces that can be bought from- their quartermasters as well . <p> Assuming the normal and heroic raids will open up on a schedule similar to Warlords of Draenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get some gear .

( The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing . ) <p> Q : What character should I use to test the raid ? <p> A : Whichever you prefer .

As we 've said in the past , Tomb of Sargeras will not be available right when 7.2 unlocks , and a quest arc ( akin to the 7.1 Suramar Insurrection campaign ) will lead up to its opening .

That means we need to begin testing it far earlier , relative to the date when the raid will actually go live , than we have in past expansions . But this weeks test is just dipping our toes in the water to assess the stability of the overall testing environment , identify class bugs or server issues that might hinder raid testing , and get the process started . <p> These two bosses will be retested in the future , and likely more than once . There are weeks of raid testing to come , and its exceedingly likely that testing for numerical tuning purposes and bug fixing will occur in a PTR environment even after 7.2 is on the live servers . If you can log on this Friday to help us test , that 's of course much appreciated , but if not , please rest assured that there will be plenty of additional opportunities to come .

@@44077633 @4077633/ <p> Mythic Keystone Dungeons are one of Legions biggest features and yet we feel Blizzard missed a great opportunity there . Let 's fix that with Custom Keystones ! <p> To fully understand the following concept , we expect you to know how Mythic Keystone Dungeons work in the game right now . This is meant to be an extension to the current system . So let 's dive right in ! <h> Create Your Own Keystone <p> Imagine this : you enter Eye of Azshara , click on the little pylon and instead of dragging your Keystone from your bags into the marked spot , you get an interface like this : <p> Interface concept for creating a Custom Keystone <p> The interface shows an additional Tab at the bottom , called " Custom " . Once clicked , you are able to fully customize your desired Keystone . <h> Setting Level And Affixes <p> First of all , you can set the desired level for your run by simply clicking the plus / minus buttons , NPC health and damage bonus will adjust accordingly . <p> Next , activate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the icons . Run Sanguine and Volcanic or go crazy and activate all of them ! You are not limited to the existing combinations on the live servers . <p> Once you are happy with your Mythic Keystone parameters , go ahead and click Activate. - After a short loading screen , your Dungeon will be set up and you are ready to slay . <h> What would it be good for ? <p> You might ask , why we do need such a system . Well , we believe there are two use cases : <h> No Loot , But Fun ! <p> Obviously , - such a Custom Keystone Dungeon should not award any loot or any other rewards . It would be way too easy to exploit it for ultra-fast gearing and Artifact Power farming . First of all , this system should be fun . People are doing the weirdest challenges in World of Warcraft , why not add a Level 30 Black Rook Hold run with 6 active Affixes to that list ? <p> Well , we agree this might be quite a weak argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Blizzard for sure knows how to produce high-quality tournaments but maybe this is a scale too big for WoW PvE esports yet . On the other hand , the World of Warcraft community is one of the most vibrant and active ones in the world . We do even cover the hardcore raiding progression race for years , mostly for fun . Giving fansites and smaller tournament hosts the right tools , paired with streaming and combat log parsers could easily be the birth of a new form of WoW PvE competition . <p> Just think of it for a moment , this is how a Mythic Keystone Dungeon Tournament could look like : <p> The teams register on the tournaments website <p> After registration closes , the teams get seeded into a double elimination bracket <p> Each " match " is a speed run through a randomly drawn Mythic Dungeon , Level 9 with Teeming , Volcanic and Tyrannical <p> Each team has to provide a combat log after their run <p> These are very simplified rules , of course . Just add some restrictions on class-choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra flavor ! <h> But Legendaries , Artifact Power , RNG ? <p> Yes , you are right . The best environment for tournaments would be tournament realms ! But we still need a tool to create the desired Keystones. - This would be a first step , let 's take it to Blizzard ! <h> Spread The Word <p> If you like that idea or do even have a better one feel free to write an comment or email . We love to discuss every idea on competetive WoW and are always looking for people who share the same passion . Maybe we can make this PvE esports a thing together !

Rumor has it that Serenity officer Pottm also quitted . <p> Serenity was a once in a life time opportunity , but it ended up in too many problems on our road to world first . We tried for 3 tiers and could n't make it work , too many core people to replace .

It is pure HYPE because it is time for another Progression Race ! <p> 22:00 CEST / February 15th An here they are , the top 3 GulDan kill videos from Exorsus , Serenity and Method . Congratulations once again everyone , we are closing our coverage at this point but may be back with an top guild interview soon ! <p> 07:00 CEST / February 15th The Top 5 is complete , as LIMIT managed to defeat GulDan ( US#1 ) tonight , right after the reset . Congratulations ! <p> 8:30 CEST / February 14th Drama again ! Someone leaked the From Scratch kill video for GulDan Mythic this night . The original source is down again , but a lot of reposts are spreading across the web . From Scratch already apologized but the damage is done . Even though this is not a fully edited and official release , it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world first guild to release their video first . We wo n't link it here for the exact same reason and hope Exorsus will get the deserved exposure once they have finished their video . <p> Besides that , we can expect some more GulDan kills in the near future , as the US guilds get another reset ( = more gear ) today . And now they even have a strategy on video , they simply have to execute . <p> We are sad to learn that the Gul'dan video we watched in private yesterday was leaked by one of our members during the night . <p> 22:00 CEST / February 12th Well we cant have a kill video yet , but we can have interviews ! Method just released theirs with this tiers winners Exorsus . Go check it out here . <p> 10:00 CEST / February 12th After quite some time , GulDan is defeated again : From Scratch claims World #4 , once again finishing strong and proving their status among the best guilds in the world . And that means , we are only one GulDan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Besides that , a lot of movement on the 9/10 pack . Currently 9 guilds ( AFK R with an armory bug ! ) are fighting for World #5 . <p> 10:50 CEST / February 8th Last night brought some more action with FatSharkYes and Limit finally defeating Star Augur , moving up to 9/10 . This weeks resets will bring a lot of new gear and in combination with the recent Star Augur nerfs , we might see a lot of new kills over the next days . <p> 19:30 CEST / February 5th And here is the heavily deserved World Second kill for Serenity . Theyve dominated almost the entire instance , once they had caught up on the US guilds and looked as the clear favourites on the final blow . Well done guys , despite all that drama ! <p> 01:30 CEST / February 5th Some more information and drama on the World First by Exorsus popped up over the past few hours . <p> Some people on mmoc and /r/wow accused one of their players of exploiting a bug which let 's the Darkmoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not equipped . Alveona ( GM of Exorsus ) posted a screenshot from the respective warcraftlogs-page , that proves bespoken player did not use the bug . <p> After all , Exorsus did need 248 pulls in total , they reached the secret phase only 3 days ago . Their complete setup can be seen on the wowprogress page now as well . Looks like Fury , Assassination and Shadow carried that fight ! <p> Source : wowprogress.com <p> On a side note : what 's particularly cool about that roster : 9 out of 14 DPS were Melee ! In the past those classes were always supposed to be somewhat unfavourable for hard fights . <p> 23:20 CEST / February 4th A lot of new Star Augur kills are coming in : a total of 6 guilds is now on 8/10 , Serenity , Method and From Scratch are on 9/10 . <p> 17:20 CEST / February 4th My most favourite part of progression : NERDSCREAMS ! <p> 14:20 CEST / February 4thExorsus with the World First on GulDan !

It 's been a long road . Screenshot and everything else later . Epic video inc too , but will take a lot of time <p> 22:15 CEST / February 3rd Grand Magistrix Elisande got defeated once again : From Scratch moves on to 9/10 , World #4 . This means we will get to see the killvideos soon ! <p> No news from the fight on the final bad guy GulDan however . Serenity seems to struggle to get a good roster during daytime and they had to cut hours . Their advantage over Exorsus and even Method should be gone by now so it is really everybodys race right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LIMIT finally defeated Star Augur Etraeus for World #5 . This fight seems to be one of the best tuned fights in the history of the game : even with the loot of now three heroic resets , it has to be executed perfectly to be defeated . <p> In the meantime , we are all waiting for the big bad guy to die . Serenity was not able to keep up their full day schedule yesterday , so Method should have caught up by now . <p> 00:15 CEST / February 2nd We are just past midnight in Europe and all three top guilds now have had some good chunk of time back on GulDan . Of course , Serenity and Exorsus are the favourites on the final kill , but we do not know how far they already progressed . If they did not make it to the final phase so far , Method might have the chance for a bit comeback . <p> 16:15 CEST / February 1st All three top contenders seem to follow the same strategy today : they have recleared up to 7/10M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split raids ( at least the armories show some indications on that ) . This means that none of them progressed GulDan far enough to get in range of a kill , right ? Which is cool because hype intensifies , right ? <p> 11:15 CEST / February 1st The European top contenders are chewing through their rekills pretty fast : Method on 2/10M , Serenity on 4/10M and Exorsus already on 7/10M recleared ! <p> It will be interesting to see if one of them switches to heroic splits afterward or if they are confident enough to kill GulDan already . <p> 8:00 CEST / February 1st Ladies and Gentlemen , GulDan survived the night and made it to the weekly reset on EU servers as well ! This means the next hours will be spent with doing at least one mythic reclear and maybe even heroic split raids if the guilds need more gear for the final fight . We will see ! <p> 23:50 CEST / January 31stMethod with the last minute kill on Grand Magistrix Elisande , 2 hours before the server maintenance starts ! While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time needed for progressing Elisande is almost identical for all three guilds : <p> 20:00 CEST / January 31st GulDan reached his first mini-goal , surviving a full reset on NA servers at least . Europe however has still a good amount of hours to go and Serenity and Exorsus surely will use that time effectively and maybe even kill him ? Who knows ? <p> In the meantime Method and From Scratch are the only guilds on 8/10 so far and if they still want to get a shot on GulDan mythic , they better hurry and finally defeat Grand Magistrix Elisande . <p> 16:45 CEST / January 30thExorsus moves on , defeating Grand Magistrix Elisande for World #2 ! A lot of pressure now on Method , as they are still on 8/10 . <p> 01:30 CEST / January 30th WORLD FIRST ELISANDE by Serenity ! Congratulations ! And all the sudden it seems possible that the race will be completed within the first reset as Europe still has two full days left . Serenity is definately in a big lead now as GulDan is supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned and progressed . <p> 22:30 CEST / January 29th If you follow the progression race on social media as well , you might have expected it already : Fusion exploited some Monk class mechanics to kill Star Augur and got banned now for 8 days . Wowprogress already delisted the kill again , so there are only 3 guilds on 8/10 ( Serenity , Exorsus , Method ) left , followed by 22 guilds on 7/10 . <p> Fusion shared their kill , the exploit happens when phase 3 starts : <p> 19:30 CEST / January 29th Our quiet and cozy Sunday evening gets disrupted by a big bang : russian guild Fusion grabs World #3 on Star Augur just minutes before Method ! Four guilds on 8/10 now , and 20 more on 7/10 . <p> 12:00 CEST / January 28th Another day of progression starts in Europe and The Nighthold has delivered so far : tons of drama and a real close race . Serenity is still in the lead with 8/10M , followed by already 14 guilds on 7/10 . It looks like Serenitys massive amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack Shadow Priests and Rogues for Star Augur yesterday . Will other guilds manage to bring similar setups to the fight ?

Sadly set sails armory is broken for several weeks now , so they wont pop up on wowprogress .

Good ! <p> 19:45 CEST / January 26th A TON of drama happened today : as it turns out , probably someome with the Method guild-tag blocked Serenity from raiding large parts of the day . While he obviously did not act officially for Method a doubt remains : it looks like be that an officer of Method already knew for more than two hours why Serenity was not able to enter the raid and did not say anything . <p> We will reconstruct this drama a little bit once the dust settled . Now back to actual sports : Still four guild with 7/10M on the top ( Serenity , LIMIT , Exorsus and Method ) , followed by From Scratch on 6/10 and four more guilds with 5/10 ( Midwinter , Entropy , Honestly and Danish Terrace ) . <p> 15:42 CEST / January 26th Meanwhile everything runs smooth today for Method : Botanist World #4 , moving on to 7/10 now paired with Serenity , Limit and Exorsus in the race for the top spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serenity , but rather weird and sad ones . Someone managed to get their Raid-ID , went into The Nighthold and held their I 'd hostage , so that Serenity was not able to enter themselves . This could happen if a Serenity-Raider invited a random player for a Mythic Keystone run for example and that stranger jumpes right into the raid instance . The blocked I 'd prevented Serenity from raiding the complete morning . <p> It is investigated right now and let 's hope , Serenity is able to raid again soon . <p> Sad this is what things have resorted too , locked out of our instance for 2 hours because a salty person held the i 'd hostage and hid inside <p> 21:00 CEST / January 25thExorsus did it ! World #3 on Tichondrius ! Moving on to 6/10M . <p> 18:00 CEST / January 25thSerenity grabs the World #2 on Tichondrius ! Moving on to 6/10M and joining LIMIT on the top of the pack . <p> Following closely behind Exorsus , From Scratch and Method are on 5/10M . <p> 16:00 CEST / January 25thSerenity grabs the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , Exorsus has finally decided its time for heroic splits . <p> 15:00 CEST / January 25thFrom Scratch and Method AND Serenity : 4/10 . <p> 14:00 CEST / January 25th Speaking of Exorsus and Account Sharing : their Guildmaster Alveona discussed this problem alongside other things in an extensive post on reddit , confirming this is actual a comonly used thing upon top guilds : <p> 2 ) " Accout sharing " once again , if some guild needs 4 ( insert class here ) and their main roster has only 3 of this character or some guy has an alt / inactive guild players with better legendaries they will just transfer him to new account with the same name and surname , and use him for progression for another player . If its an inactive player account , they will just " rent " it for the progression . Its a common approach and every top guild uses it when they need it . ( And yes , top guilds been using it even on last 2 contents with a bunch of examples ) <p> 13:50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving on to 5/10 , only one more kill before they join LIMIT on the very top . Still no heroic splits . <p> 13:20 CEST / January 25th : Serenity with obvious Account Sharing <p> Account Sharing : Acurielle , Mandrai and Sokila <p> Serenity is on 3/10M as fast as expected . The sad thing is , that they do use Account Sharing in a very obvious way even for mythic progression . <p> As far as we know and got confirmed by sources , the characters Acurielle , Mandrai and Sokila do belong to the same person or at least did in the past . All three participated in the Skorpyron Mythic kill , proven by the armory . this was pointed out already after Serenity released their Xavius video , where Acurielle and Mandrai did play in the same raid as well . <p> Sokila could be played by Zaelia who recently became a Heroes of the Storm professional with Dignitas and did not have the time to prepare a character for progression anymore . <p> Account Sharing is widely used amongst the top guilds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Artifact Power only made it more efficient as you can bring the characters with best possible items in for progression . We do understand why it is so tempting to use sharing . However , it violates Blizzards EULA and clearly does not help building a fair and transparent competition . <p> 12:30 CEST / January 25thExorsus pulls ahead , defeating Spellblade Aluriel for a World #3 moving on to 4/10 . They did not have done any heroic splits so far . <p> In the meantime , Serenity started raiding mythic as well , we do expect them on 3/10 soon as well . <p> 10:45 CEST / January 25th : Serenity losing Healer to Method , right before the- race starts . There are some rumors regarding EU top guild Serenity flowing around the webs . Their wowprogress profile reports the leaving of some highly equipped characters this morning .

We do not know what happened behind the scenes but such transfers do not help creating a fair competition , that 's for sure . <p> Meanwhile , Sidestep joined the 3/10 pack . <p> 10:20 CEST / January 25th Some more updates on the European race : Exorsus , From Scratch , Pieces , Openness and Method are all on 3/10M now .

Midwinter snacks Spellblade Aluriel for US #2 and 4/10 overall . They are followed by a larger crowd of 12 guilds with 3/10 . <p> 23:15 CEST / January 24thLIMIT are finally done with their heroic split raids and are on 2/3M now . We do expect the US top guild to catch up rather quickly and maybe even pull ahead , as no guild managed to kill a fourth boss yet . <p> 16:00 CEST / January 24th Let 's have a look at The Nighthold itself and what the top guilds will encounter on Mythic Difficulty : <p> A total of 10 bosses <p> The first three are in fixed order , namely Skorpyron , Chronomatic Anomaly and Trilliax <p> The final two are fixed as well : Grand Magistrix Elisande is the last gatekeeper before the final showdown against GulDan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuned properly <p> High Botanist TelArn has the potential to become quite a mess of a fight with a lot of micromanagement and individual player skill required <p> Let 's hope for no bugs and tightly tuned fights ! <p> 11:55 CEST / January 24th Can you feel it ? Can you hear the air crackle ? Is it the arcane magic flowing from the Nightwell ? NO ! It is pure HYPE because it is time for another Progression Race ! A long and exhausting path led us from the launch of Legion through The Emerald Nightmare , the Trial of Valor and countless Maw of Soul grinds to this day : the opening of The Nighthold Mythic and the first real pinnacle of progression raiding within World of Warcrafts latest expansion . <p> NA Servers should be up in around 5 hours and we do expect first blood very soon , as Skorpyron should not be a big deal on Mythic either . However , the top contenders most likely will do some heroic splits first to complete the Tier Sets for their raiders first .

Once theyve picked up their I 'd from the night before and wanted to enter The Nighthold , they got ported out again within 60 seconds . Broken IDs are nothing uncommon during the first weeks of a new raid but two hours later they actually found out , what was causing the problems : <p> A character called Isabellab- was already inside the raid , literally taking their I 'd hostage . It took several hours until the character was removed from the instance and Serenity could start raiding again . <p> Leaked screenshot from method-slack . <p> This all caused a lot of drama on Twitter , especially as a screenshot from a Method internal slack-channel was leaked and confirmed real . It creates the impression , chrispotter ( an officer of Method ) knew about the whole situation for at least two hours before Serenity found out what 's blocking them from raiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked Serenity from raiding this morning ?

The now banned Paladin was already on Twisting Nether , just with another name . When Method had issues on Tarren Mill , we talked about ways to slow down Serenity and did a name change . <p> This morning the whole thing was really simple and took no effort at all . I wrote to only one guy in Serenity , before the raids began , around 9:30 CET . Asking if he was interested in some extra flasks for progress , just trying to be nice and friendly to avoid it being too random . <p> Namechange -&gt; Isabellab <p> Taking serenitys I 'd <p> Serenity finds the hidden character <p> The person was happy to take my flasks , but what he did n't  know was I was waiting outside of Nighthold .

After awhile they got a GM to port me to Org , he did n't  contact me or give me any kind of warning . I was just removed from the raid and placed in Org . <p> The- account is banned for 24 hours now , but I believe it still has the I 'd . Even if I do not plan to do so , maybe this could be done again on the weekend . <p> So the big question is : Why did you do that ? <p> I did n't  find it fair people what were doing what they did to Method/Tarren Mill yesterday . This , what happen today did even out the race , the downtime Serenity had was equal to the time lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on point , Serenity was able to raid about 5 min before Method got 7/10 . <p> So you suspect the problems Method had yesterday were caused by other players and not simply a server problem ? A targeted action against Method ? <p> It was 100% players . I cant give you any more info about that part sadly , but the best guess is the flowers crashing the instance server . This issue yesterday was ONLY on Tarren Mill and Dentarg ( Realm connected to Tarren Mill ) . And who was behind that , I do n't  know . I do n't  think its directly Serenity , but more the fan base of Serenity . <p> But Exorsus for example surely got some benefit from that as well ! I cant really speak for the Russians in this case . I speak with Exorsus sometimes during progress , but I 've never had the feeling they were involved in anything outside of exploiting inside of the raid , like Helya . But sure , they were the real winners in all this mess , together with Limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of the fact that the raid was blocked actively ? When did they knew it ? <p> Leaked screenshot from slack . <p> Well i obviously told Jadelol about it and shared that screenshot . The leaked slack screenshot is real , so in theory all of Method was aware since it was posted to them . But if they were aware of the scale ? I do n't  think so . But that being said , the picture come from SOMEWHERE , it has to and it was indeed another Method member . And this person did n't  share this picture until the problem was solved . <p> Were you aware of the fact that your actions caused damage to Methods image and legitimacy as a top guild ? No , the only reason this hurts Method is the reason that ONE picture got out with Jadelolz name in . Which is why he is taking the trash on social media now as well . <h> Can we please all grow up now ? <p> Although Isabellab told us his reasons to do such a thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why people break Tarren Mill on purpose or DDoS warcraftlogs either . And at least the question remains , why chrispotter did not try to reach out to Serenity once he got knowledge of the things happening . <p> We are so super serious about raiding but not professional . We blame Blizzard for ruining our game and lives with Legendaries , titanforged and Artifact Power . They suck for sure , yes ! We argue about an unfair race even before it starts . True ! But the biggest damage to our scene is caused by people that try to be Batman , try bringing justice to the race on their own behalf . And people shit-talking on stream and twitter without talking to each other . <p> Fandom and passion is important , but just hurts if misdirected . If we want to attract sponsors and even fresh players to the hardcore PvE scene , we do need to grow up . We do need to get as professional as we are passionate . We do have the power to create a fair and enjoyable race within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now time to grow up or the hardcore PvE scene will die to DDoS , Swatting and salty , toxic people that cant enjoy the game anymore . <p> Update Jan , 27th ; 22:50 CET : Edited some typos and two phrases that created the impression I would favor Method , trying to discredit Serenity . <p> Tara <p> 1 . Twisting Nether was lagging too , not just Tarren Mill ; Serenity lost time from that . 2 . Its pretty much impossible to DDoS a single server , or a single servers instance server , unless you had some pretty advanced stuff going on . Even if it were easily done , wheres this genius proof that they were being DDoSd in the first place ? Blizzard tells players when they are experiencing significant ( that is , gameplay-affecting ) lag due to an attack . Other ways of bringing down a server , such as creating 1000s of level 1s , would have been noticed very quickly . 3 . Jadelol admitted to at least being a part of it in a conversation with Darrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I get that you guys are trying to uncover the facts or whatever , but even with a disclaimer , this comes across as defending their actions because you failed to mention any of the above points , and you throw shade on Serenity by bringing up account sharing ( which , as you yourselves stated , is widely used among top guilds , presumably including Method , as is run selling ) . <p> Plus , is this person actually threatening to block them out again ? Cause it sure sounds that way . <p> I do agree that it is very unlikely that one or even a group of players managed to disturb Tarren Mill in such a huge way as Scos video from the Krosus fight shows . <p> Jadelol is not completely innocent , I agree on that . He knew early on and did not tell anything but so did chrispotter . Maybe I should get that clear , that I did not want to help jadelol in any ways by creating the impression he would be innocent . <p> Finally : Account Sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will report it . But totally clear that this is used among a lot of top guilds . This particular case from Serenity was just so obvious that I wanted to report it specifically . <p> Tara <p> On the account sharing note , personally do n't  have an opinion on it either way , I was just bringing it up because for the purpose of this article it was completely irrelevant . It uniquely casts Serenity in a bad light right off the bat . <p> I do n't  take issue with your English , good on you for learning and getting this out there . My only complaint really is that the article itself is framed as objective , and maybe you tried to accomplish that , but it definitely reads as an attempt to justify what people affiliated with Method did . <p> Felblade Noz <p> When you are saying that <p> Felblade Noz <p> When you are talking about lagging .. Does that mean that the server crashed back to back like 10 times within like 3 hours ? <p> Tara <p> I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever was happening was n't unique to TM <p> Noctus <p> Playing on Tarren-Mill myself , i do think the intensity of the server issues were unique to TM ( at that evening i did n't  see complaints from other servers fully crashing ) . Every 10 minutes or so the server stopped . chat kept working and you still could move around freely . The only solution was alt-f4 as logging out was also impossible . The cause remains unknown , it did n't  feel like a ddos as things did n't  slow down , but just suddenly stopped ( I remember the day Ensidia moved to TM and our server was attacked and unplayable in the evening for 28 days in a row ) . You also instantly knew when the server was crashing last Thursday as the GMotD suddenly popped up and all notifications of members coming online . <p> Revokes <p> i love how you guys put 100% was n't Jadelol just because this guys said so , RP from method posted a conversation another method had with him asking why and he said the reason behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a culprit LONG ... <p> Thanks for your comment . I did know the linked chat you post there before the interview and even tho I do believe Isabellab was not played by Jadelol , I feel like he definately played a bigger role . My interview partner confirmed , that they talked about ways to block out Serenity on the night before . Jadelol did knew about it for a long period and obviously was at least a bit happy about it as he has some real beef with Serenity . <p> At this point we do not completely know the truth and maybe will never know . At the end of the day I may only have told another version of the story but a larger and extensive one . <p> gogoadgetkat <p> First off , if you 're going to attempt to be an English news source for high-end raiding , the least you could do is know how to write in English . This article is poorly written and at times is incredibly difficult to understand . <p> Second , if you 're wanting to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have a horse in this race and its just a source of mild interest for me , but I actually feel for Serenity in this situation . Its very clear to me that you have a bone to pick specifically with Serenity , as you 've called them out for account sharing while neglecting to mention that account sharing has been a staple of the progression race for many , many other top guilds throughout the years . You mention Serenitys account sharing again today in this article , as if suggesting that Serenity cant really be victims because they 're such bad guys . This clear bias , coupled with the obviously terrible writing , does n't  help you here in trying to establish a following . <p> Third , I think its very telling that an awkward , poorly written , basically unknown website with an obvious bias against Serenity is suddenly very popular , being retweeted by members of Method , shared on reddit , and getting " exclusive " interviews with the " anonymous " person who sabotaged Serenity yesterday . Its so very convenient that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , it was a random person that you can personally confirmbut we have to take your word for it . Who are you , exactly ? I know you are attempting to be a legitimate news source for progression raiding . I know you are biased against Serenity as you 've made that abundantly clear . Why are you trustworthy ? You can barely write an article . Why should your readers trust any of this ? To me this whole interview seems just a little too convenient to be believable . <p> Ultimately this article has n't  convinced me of anything except that this website should not be regarded as a true source for progression raiding news . Ill stick with Wowprogress . You 're either in with Method here trying to clear their brand name , or you 're getting played alongside everyone else . Either way , this article reads as if you 're condoning these actions and I 'm not down with that . Why is account sharing so terrible in your eyes , yet the purposeful sabotage of Serenitys raiding time yesterday is justified ? <p> Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading my small site = <p> Let me answer some of your points , first off : English . As you have noticed me and my interview-partner both are not native speakers . I do always try to improve and in this particular case I did leave large parts of the answers untouched . This probably was a failure . <p> Second : I try to be objective but probably will fail within single articles . I did cover Exorsus Account Sharing as well as Method taking a top geared healer right at the start of progression . I did do interviews with other top guilds in the past , giving them a platform to talk , just check my coverage on gamescom 2016 with From Scratch and set sail for fail for example . Plus : I did an interview with deepshades and gamko after their World Record on a +21 Mythic Keystone run , giving Serenity some exposure just a few weeks ago . <p> And ultimately : is n't it objective calling Serenity victims and " villain " in the same article ? For me it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am biased with Serenity or a fanboy of method . I do know people in both guilds and do not want to hurt anyone of them in particular . If you want to know more about me , there is an " about " page linked at the bottom of this site . I am a longtime raider with little hardcore experience just passionate about PvE as everyone else here . <p> Finally : I 've started this site only 8 Months ago and got a slow but steady growth since then . Of course this may be the biggest " story " so far , but especially my interviews were re-tweeted from top raiders already in the past . I have gained 25 followers in the past 48 hours . That 's nice but not ground shaking , I just feel like a complete different kind of people are now coming to my site . Well , welcome = <p> One last thing : I did create this site as manaflask died and usually covered the race more extensively than wowprogress does . At this point I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coverage as well ! <p> DcARR <p> That person was being a whiny cunt , The articles english was fine for not being native language <p> amiShael <p> First off : if you are going to attempt to write a reliable feedback use your regular user I 'd . <p> gogoadgetkat <p> This is my only user I 'd . I 've never used Disqus before but you could probably Google this username and find that I use it on many sites . Thanks for the feedback though ! <p> Nag <p> Ca n't say I had much respect left for Method after it looked like they sold out leading to the Serenity split but any respect I did have left has completely gone out the window after this . <p> Disgusting . Even if they did n't  set this up , its idiotic not to have done something once they knew what was going on , WHOEVER wins the race now has the results tarnished by this , whether it be Method or Exorsus . Its one thing to be exploiting things internally or account sharing , as much as I dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over the line . <p> Hollyweed <p> Not going to win something because you are the only one who has issues or a handicap is not that fair aswell . Its hard to find the balance of justice in this case . But no doubt , I would agree with your opinion in any other situation . = <p> Alan Lanson <p> Yes this article is n't biased at all and the convenience of the " person responsible " suddenly stepping up to claim Method had nothing to do with it is completely a coincidence . <p> This article is biased from the start . Yeah well just take some " random persons " word for it that the server issues were intentionally caused to slow Method and print it as if it holds ANY weight .

@@44077657 @4077657/ <p> Weve talked to Gamko and Deepshades from Serenity about their recent Mythic Keystone world record ( EoA +21 ! ) and a possible future for WoW PvE esports . <h> World Record : Eye of Azshara Mythic Keystone +21 completed in time <p> As there is no raid content to be progressed at the moment , a group of players from the top guilds Serenity and FatSharkYes recently searched new challenges in real high Mythic Keystone Dungeons . Their best beaten one : Eye of Azshara +21 , which means a new world record for the highest ever completed-in-time Mythic Keystone dungeon . <h> NPC Health and DPS increased by 366% <p> Both are well known faces in the hardcore PvE scene . Deepshades ( formerly Method ) joined Serenity at the very beginning , Gamko joined shortly after , leaving Pwnanza . Before we jump right into the interview , let 's have a look at what they actually dealt with ( besides the seagulls ) : <p> Last week you managed to set a new " world record " and beat a +20 Keystone and later even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite easy in the end , with Deepshades down for half of the Shade of Xavius fight on your +20 and still plenty of time left ! Was it that easy as it looked ? <p> Gamko : After we did our first test run in which we tried to see if all bosses were possible it was just down to execute all parts of the dungeons correctly . The completion of the 21 took us roughly 4-5 hours . Time wise it was not that much time spent compared to a raid boss that you progress but its still rather demanding on everyone in the group . A single missed interrupt meant death for one of the party members . One fuck up on an ability as well . Every small mistake was punished with the death of a player . Everyone had to stay focused for 35 min and do their job properly . Its definitely nothing that is " easy " . <p> Deepshades : That last fight in Darkheart Thicket , where we completed our +20 Keystone is definitely hard but most of the damage incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much is happening but as soon as Shade of Xavius is using his ability " Feed of the Weak " , one player in the group takes heavy damage . Thanks to our group lineup with a Paladin Tank we were able to work pretty well around that ability . Blizzard also recently nerfed the " Nightmare Bolt " so it does not one-shot us . <p> The timer for the dungeon itself is kinda lenient so you just have to make sure you do not wipe and also do not lose too many people throughout the dungeon . <p> Was +21 with the given Affixes the current limit ? Do you think under the given circumstances a +22 would already have been possible ? <p> Gamko : M+ 21 definitely is n't the limit . With the current affixes ( Sanguine / Volcanic / Fortified ) , Vault of the Wardens and perhaps a few other dungeons should be doable with some practice . <p> Deepshades : With the bespoken affixes , Vault of the Wardens and perhaps a few other dungeons are at least possible up to M+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed in time <p> You did several high keystones this week ( +19 Court of Stars , +20 Darkheart Thicket ) . Do you enjoy Mythic+ now , after the grind that came alongside with the progress-preparations ? Do you feel like the scaling difficulty keeps it challenging and ejoyable for hardcore raiders like you , once the raidcontent is cleared ? <p> Gamko : I actually love the new M+ system compared to the old one which basically was just grinding out a dungeon until you get good rng on trinkets , dodges , etc . In general I do n't  like doing the same stuff over and over just with more damage and healthpoints . It is definitely providing an appropriate challenge but I personally would prefer new affixes / custom affixes instead of just a plain ramp up on damage and health . At some point you need certain classes to survive abilities or you just cant survive at all which makes a lot of stuff impossible with the Tyranncial affix . As we learned from The Great Collegiate Dungeon Challenge earlier this month , Blizzard has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be a great future ahead of us with M+ Dungeons . <p> Deepshades : I definitely enjoy M+ but not the grinding that comes with it . Scaling difficulty makes it interesting and you can push yourself to your limits , but most often you just get blocked by one-shot abilities , especially with the affix " Tyrannical " . At some point it is not skill that decides whether you live or not , it is the gear and the traits ( more Stamina per trait ) . <h> The Rise of WoW PVE Esports ? <p> Blizzard recently gave out a prize money of $20.000 USD for The Great Collegiate Dungeon Race the first time in WoWs history that a large pile of money could be won in a PvE competition . Do you think there lies enough potential within the Keystone system to play out bigger tournaments ? Maybe with finals on the gamescom or BlizzCon stage ? <p> Gamko : I think there is a future for the M+ system if its done correctly . The Collegiate Dungeon Race showed us a nice possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch , they could do a leaderboard and contract the best teams to play in tournaments or something similar . Regarding the tournaments itself it makes sense to let 2 teams to compete in a dungeon and see who could do it faster . <p> Deepshades : I think there definitely lies potential in the entire M+ system . I think for tournaments it would be the best to make speed races with several teams . Blizzard also could do seasonal leaderboards and the highest M+ dungeons would perhaps get awarded with Titles , Mounts or Money . <h> The Great Collegiate Dungeon Race <p> ICYMI : We did a recap on the Great Collegiate Dungeon Race . UC Irvine finished first and took home $10.000 USD with a 4 DPS setup . Go read our recap here ! <p> What would it need from your perspective to make such tournaments work ? Maybe even evolve into WoW PvE esports ? And what would that mean for highend-raiding ? <p> Gamko : The most important factor is Blizzards support of it . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff/contracts or just money prices . People need to have an incentive to invest the time and push themselfs to their personal limit in those dungeons . <p> For High End raiding it would probably mean that it gets more focused on and maybe more people are willing to compete again in the race ( there are less and less guilds raiding hardcore every tier ) . It could eventually even become a Blizzard sponsored race for the public where the guilds actually compete live for the world first or something similar . <p> Deepshades : The biggest factor would be that Blizzard is willing to give prize money out . If people do n't  have an incentive , they wo n't do it . If there would be money for Tier races , there would be a chance that more people would be attracted to hardcore-raiding.

@@44077706 @4077706/ <p> The first titanforged items from the Emerald Nightmare LFR dropped on Beta this weekend and a lot of confusion kicked in , as players wondered how high itemlevels will rise . Well the- good news is : Titanforged will not kill Mythic raiding . Not completely . <h> Basic Introduction to- Titanforged Items <p> For those not following the Beta very closely , here are the basics : Legion will introduce Titanforged items . Those are basically Warforged items but with a much greater upgrade in itemlevel . Almost every item you can get from endgame content ( world quests , Raids , Dungeons , PvP crates ) can have an upgrade to its itemlevel in- +5 intervals . Items with- +5 and +10 bonus are flagged Warforged , everything beyond is called Titanforged . <p> To ensure a proper balance , there will be a cap for upgrades around 850 within the first weeks of the new expansion and a cap at 895 once Mythic Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons are open . Every item that can get an upgrade will have a " + " attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts . <h> LFR Loot Can Have Higher Itemlevel Than Mythic <p> Applied to the base itemlevels of the first raid instance in Legion ( The Emerald Nightmare ) this means , that loot from LFR can have a higher itemlevel than a basic mythic item without upgrade . <p> Itemlevel Range across all difficulties in the first Legion raid instance <p> Items from mythic difficulty will have a base itemlevel of 880 , titanforged LFR items can have 895 . If you stop reading here , you probably will believe , that Blizzard just has killed Mythic raiding . When LFR players can get the same itemlevel as mythic raiders , what 's the point with mythic raiding at all ? <p> Well , they have n't . The system will work in +5 intervals with a decreasing chance for an upgrade with every added interval . Assistant Game Director- Ian Hazzikostas who did a long bluepost on the topic last night simplifies it as follows : <p> When generated , these items have a chance to roll a +5 item level bonus . If that roll succeeds , the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it rolls again . This process continues until an upgrade roll fails or the global item-level ceiling is reached . That 's it . <p> So yes : players can get the very best possible items from LFR . But the chance is ridiculously low . <h> How Will This System Affect ( Mythic ) Raiding <p> It will have some positive and negative effects on raiding in general . Let 's dive in : <h> Effects on Balancing <p> With the global cap at 895 and the decreasing chance of high upgrades on low difficulties , balancing current and future content is- quite- easy for the developers. - Hardcore raiders with multiple farm kills on mythic encounters will soon settle around 890 or higher , depending on how long the content runs . However the gap to more casual raiders wont be as large as it was in previous expansions . A guild which only can manage doing heroic raids because of a missing playerbase or skill , will have a chance on higher itemlevels in the long run . This probably could make systems like Valor upgrades obsolete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising their overall itemlevel every week . <p> This is cleary a positive effect for the complete raiding playerbase . <h> Rewards for Mythic Raiders <p> Of course there are some downsides to this Titanforged thing . The fact , that LFR can drop items as good as on mythic raids at least feels bad for every hardcore raider . If you want to be salty you can turn it this way : there is no exclusive reward for mythic raiders left in the game . Well be salty then ! <p> The truth is : if you want to have the best possible gear in the game , you still will have to raid on mythic difficulty . The dropchance for a full Titanforged item on LFR will be so low that there wont- be a single character in whole Azeroth with an itemlevel of 895 which was- solely farmed in LFR . Doing mythic raids will reward you 880 items from the start- and you will need much fewer attempts to reach BiS gear than on any other difficulty . <h> Effects on the Progress Race : Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress race for world first or on a smaller scale on their region or realm however , the new Titanforged system will have a big negative impact : If you are serious about squeezing every tiny- bit of performance out of your character , you will have to clear every raid and mythic dungeon on every difficulty , every reset . And after that , - you will probably do 5 man heroic instances , which do not have a loot lockout . <p> Of course , this was done in the past as well for trinkets or set pieces . But those were farmed out after a couple of IDs or splitruns . This time it looks like we will do those clears for a much longer period than before . If you would describe yourself as such a type of raider , be sure to get your priorities right : farming Artifact Power will most likely- increase your characters power much more effectively than running Heroic 5 mans all night long . <h> Time /played Not Skill is Rewarded <p> However , this Titanforged System- makes one very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but /played time is rewarded . A player who can afford doing instances- all day long will end up on better gear than someone who ca n't put the same amount of time into the game . Of course , this is totally fine to a certain point for a MMO . And with play time comes practice and that might increase skill. - But maybe Blizzard has taken it too far this time . We have seen many of the top guilds stepping down in raiding hours lately and this content will probably bring up some new faces in the top ranks : simply because they can play longer hours- than others .

@@44077741 @4077741/ <p> Only 5 days left until the launch of Legion and Blizzard made another big change : Artifact Knowledge now increases every single gain of Artifact Power . <p> Artifact Knowledge is the main catch up mechanism in Legion . You research it in your Class Order Hall and it works quite simple : the higher your rank of Artfiact Knowledge is , the more Artifact Power you gain . Up until recently this only buffed all repeatable sources of AP , such as world quests or missions . It is now extended to every source of AP , even quests and treasures : <p> The fact that Artifact Power rewards from quests and treasures now scale with Knowledge is not a bug . <p> We started off the design of the system thinking along the exact same lines as many of the posters in this thread : We figured that we should make sure that one-time AP rewards did not scale , or else the " right " answer might be to delay completing key quests or collecting any treasures until you had higher Knowledge . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the first half of beta with all repeatable AP sources ( world quests , item drops , missions , etc. ) scaling , and all story quests and treasures flat . We added multipliers to things like Suramar or Order Campaign quests that tried to incorporate a likely expected Knowledge level at the point where players would get to that content . So , for example , finishing the third chapter of the Suramar campaign awarded a flat 10k Artifact Power , since by that point we expected players to likely have a 14x multiplier from being around Knowledge Level 12 , and we wanted to make sure that the reward still felt meaningful to that player . <p> But as we were actually playtesting extensively and getting into endgame ourselves and going through the Artifact Power and Knowledge progressions , we realized two things : <p> Artifact Power is n't a limited resource . There 's always more available . There are world quests popping up every few hours , dungeons that can be repeatedly run , and so forth . And regardless of what we did with one-time sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the expansion would come from repeatable sources . <p> Even trying to account for an expected " par " Knowledge level , any time you came across a non-scaling reward that was aimed at someone with a lower Knowledge level , it felt pretty bad . Stumbling across a zone side-quest you 'd missed and getting 100 AP from it when you needed 70k for your next trait felt like a waste of time . Opening a treasure to get 25 AP when you needed 300k for your next trait felt insulting . The system wed set up actually encouraged trying to front-load all your AP while it still mattered ( e.g. doing a full world tour to collect every treasure possible while still at Knowledge Level 1 , since if you waited theyd no longer be worth the time relative to other activities ) . <p> So we started changing it . The first step was making treasures and level-up quests scale . That helped , but we still found that someone who delayed doing much in Suramar beyond the initial Friendly unlock , and instead focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found all the rewards in the zone incredibly underwhelming once they got around to doing those quests . So just over a month ago , we also converted those rewards to be scaling sources . <p> Now , we have n't had a new client build since then , so community sites and datamining likely still show the values of the old items . That Suramar Chapter 3 capstone reward mentioned above is not a 10k AP item that gets multiplied by Artifact Power thatd be pretty crazy . Its now just a 750 AP base item , which will give around 10k AP when you get there if you 've been keeping up with your Knowledge . <p> Its not necessarily intuitive , since at first glance it seems like an obvious flaw in our system that if you wait until Knowledge Level 20 ( a month and a half longer ) to complete that quest , itd give over 70k AP instead of 10k . Are n't  you " wasting " 60k AP if you do n't  do that ? The key here is that everything is relative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quests . Itll be equal to 5 world quests if you do it ASAP ; itll be equal to 5 world quests if you do it two months later . And itll contribute roughly the same amount towards whatever trait you 're working on at the time . <p> Finally , its also worth noting that the biggest one-time sources of AP are the Order Hall campaign , and the Suramar campaign . From a pure min-max perspective ( probably the mindset most associated with the competitive raider ) , you really do n't  want to delay turning in either of those . The former leads to unlocking your third Artifact relic slot ; the latter unlocks additional repeatable sources of AP ( new world quests ) and eventually access to the two Mythic dungeons , for an extra two Mythic clears each week . <p> tl ; dr : Just get Artifact Power when you find it , as you find it . Enjoy the rewards and the immediate benefit , and you are n't  hurting yourself in the long run .

@@44077744 @4077744/ <p> Watcher just confirmed a reduction of max camera distance with the latest beta build on the forums .

The developers want to make sure we expierience the gamedesign and its art on the settings it was created for . However a lot of raiders and PvP players used a larger distance to have a better overview of the whole fight going on . <p> This is a quite unpopular change among hardcore players , but Watcher points out , that a majority of players , namely those without knowledge of the console command wont experience any difference . We have made two screenshots in front of Ogrimmar . As you can see , especially on the sides of the screen , there are fewer- objects in sight than in the current game : the Horde banner on the left , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion <p> Zoomed out max in WoD <h> Watchers Complete Statement <p> This is one of this changes that we realize will be intensely unpopular with the group of players that has used console/WTF CVars to increase camera zoom beyond what the UI slider permits . For everyone else , they probably wo n't see what the big deal is , since its removing a hidden option that most never used . But for those who are accustomed to an increased max zoom , its changing the way you 're experiencing the game in a way that feels restrictive and simply worse . So why would we do that ? <p> In a broad range of gaming genres ( from RTS to Action RPG ) , being able to zoom out and see more of the world around you provides an objective advantage in the form of information . Due to that competitive advantage , camera-unlocking or increased zoom distance are features commonly found in third-party hacks for a variety of games . Whatever the maximum allowed , that 's what competitive players will use in order to maximize performance , even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We strongly believe that there needs to be parity in this area between players who are using the default UI and those who have addons or knowledge of hidden console variables . One option was certainly to just allow the in-game slider to go all the way up to the CVar hardcap . But that scale is beyond the one around which the game was designed at its core . The development team builds the world , its art , its combat mechanics , and other interactions , around the base UI experience and scale . At the 3.4-CVar zoom level , your heroic Warcraft avatar takes up about as much screen-space as one of the dozens of marines you might control in a game of Starcraft . <p> Basically all of us started out playing WoW at the UI-enabled zoom level , and fell in love with that world enough that we now find ourselves here posting on an expansion beta forum discussing its future . At some point , we saw a raid video and wondered how they could see so much of the field at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful tip from another player , and learned that if you typed " /console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4 " you could zoom out way more , and we never looked back . But was that original experience bad , or have we just grown accustomed to something different ? <p> There may also be a bit of hyperbole in the discussion around the change . This is a screenshot I just took with the max UI-selectable zoom settings in the current Legion build : http : **25;36;TOOLONG <p> I 'm not sure its fair to say that this level of zoom entails your character dominating the screen , or removes all awareness of nearby threats . <p> Finally , why did this happen suddenly now , late in the beta cycle , seemingly without any communication ? Honestly , the intent was for the change to have been in place from early alpha onwards . I believe that what happened was that one of the CVars ( CameraDistanceMaxFactor ? ) was clamped from the start , but a second CVar ( CameraDistanceMax ? ) was overlooked . That issue was entered and tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a development team , at this point were fixing up to 2000 Legion bugs a week , and its not always obvious which player-facing build will contain a particular one of those fixes . This clearly was n't something we ever imagined could just be swept under the carpet . <p> The developers want to make sure we expierience the gamedesign and it 's art on the settings it was created for hahahhaha what a load of poo , its the exact same garbale they feed us about removing flying from the game for 2 years in draenor and the reasons I no longer play wow .

@@44077750 @4077750/ <p> Ion Hazzikostas started his first appearance as Game Director for World of Warcraft on todays Q&amp;A stream with a big announcement : Patch 7.1 will already be released on October 25th ( in NA ) . <p> Here are the highlights from the Legion Q&amp;A . You can watch the complete session- here or read through our summary below : <h> Patch 7.1 and Karazhan <p> Patch will be released October 25th <p> The Raid Trial of Valor will open after BlizzCon <p> Karazhan unlock should be account-wide <h> Class Balance and Design <p> The team is happy with the effect of the- balance patch but feels like there 's a lot more work left to do <p> It is very likely that there will be more tuning changes , it is an ongoing process . <p> The game has driven to far away towards- " bring the player not the class " . Groupleaders should always try to get every class into their group but still should n't be punished if they stack a certain class because of player-skill . <p> Shadow Priest and Surrender to Madness will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give viable alternatives in the specific talent tier <p> Frost-Mages are a lot better than most people would think of right now . That 's because most of the top mages play fire and have invested a lot of AP in fire . They are min maxing etc. and are setting the trend for the majority of players , as a lot of players are playing the " " best " " specc instead of what the probably would like more . If Frost would get buffed , players would be upset but play frost anyway and it suddenly would become the " new fire " . <p> Barrage is not perfect but fine for the moment . The Devs are instead are trying to buff the other talents in that tier <p> Ion admits they should have had listened more better on Fury Warrior Feedback during the beta . Changes will be made ! <h> Legendaries <p> The system being totally random based is good as it produces moments of true joy , excitement . That would not be the case if they could be obtainable after a long grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legendaries should become a toolset to individualize your character . You will be changing them regarding the situation . The Devs are happy with the fact that not every orange item is a flat damage boost but adds variety to the gameplay . <p> Obtaining a Legendary is simply- based on a random distribution . There is no component like time that counts into a bad luck protection system . Just play the game and you will get one sooner or later . <h> Tuning of Mythic Emerald Nightmare <p> Xavius was tuned to easy , the rest was okay . They hoped for a two day boss with 80 to 100 pulls . Besides that , it should alsways have been an easier boss as it is the first raid . <p> It would be a failure to tune a raid for a group of people who can put as much effort into the game as the top guilds did . <h> Secondary Stats <p> The Devs regret the power of secondary stats , as they turned out in Legion . At no point in history of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now <p> Changes are not easy as they could change gearing choices a lot <p> Base intent should always be : a higher itemlevel item should be an upgrade without a lot of thinking <h> Costs of Consumables <p> The Devs expect prizes to drop once the Blood of Sargeras trader hits the live servers with Patch 7.1 <p> But prizes may not drop on a WoD level , as gathering professions should be useful and rewarding which they are right now . <p> Watcher suggests to adjust our own expectations and requirements towards consumables . He questions if you need a rune , food and pre-pot for a fight you are currently progressing at a very early stage . <h> Mythic+ <p> Not every class needs to have the same amount of AoE potential , it is good to have weaknesses and strengths within the different classes . <p> Players need to build their groups more carefully , when it comes to higher Keystone difficulty . A Shadow Priest was part of the very first successful +15 clear and did well , because AoE is a- less important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something quickly . <p> A punishment system for quitting a Mythic+ run would bring up lots of more problems . The Devs are closely looking at this problem but do not have a working approach yet . <p> Mythic+ dungeon loot will be upgraded once Nighthold releases . No changes for 7.1 as Trial of Valor only is 5 ilvl higher . <h> World Quests <p> There are items for your offspec on your World Quest Maps to allow you to gear up that offspec steadily without needing to change your loot specialization wich could result in a Legendary or high titanforged item . <p> The team works on bringing a better variety and distribution of World Quests ( nuts ? ! ) <h> Trivia <p> Action Camera is coming back with Patch 7.1 <p> The Devs are happy how Artifact Power and Artifact Knowledge plays out currently . No plans to change that . <p> Failed Bonus Rolls giving gold is hard coded into the system and ca n't be changed easily . System will be changed to better rewards- ( AP ! ) when not rolling an item in the future

Alongside the usual balancing changes , the testing schedule for micro-holidays gives us a hint for patch-date . <h> Lots of Class- and Item-Changes <p> As with every build , the devs pushed more class changes and reworked items .

One event will be tested each day for the next few weeks , and we 'd love to hear your feedback on them . <p> The testing schedule is as follows : <p> Tuesday , December 06 : Call of the Scarab Wednesday , December 07 : Kirin Tor Tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Friday , December 09 : Hatching of the Hippogryphs Saturday , December 10 : March of the Tadpoles Sunday , December 11 : Volunteer Guard Day Monday , December 12 : Spring Balloon Festival Tuesday , December 13 : Glowcap Festival Wednesday , December 14 : Ungoro Madness Thursday , December 15 : Call of the Scarab Friday , December 16 : Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Saturday , December 17 : Love is in the Air Sunday , December 18 : Hatching of the Hippogryphs Monday , December 19 : March of the Tadpoles Tuesday , December 20 : Volunteer Guard Day Wednesday , December 21 : Spring Balloon Festival Thursday , December 22 : Glowcap Festival Friday , December 23 : Ungoro Madness <p> As these events open , we 'll be starting up new threads to gather feedback on them .

Why should they open a raid before the reworked items are even in the game ? <p> On the other hand almost every class faces major changes that will affect their gameplay . Running new content- with a changed class rather than the old bosses prevents some frustration when you notice , you cant pull the same amount of DPS on Guarm than before the patch . Banging your heads against new content distracts you a bit from that and an early 2 piece T19 bonus may even pacify you further . <p> Blizzard already confirmed , that the Nighthold- is planned to be opened mid / end of January and we are expecting that this will happen hand in hand with the release of Patch 7.1.5 .. <h> More Raid-Tests Scheduled <p> And since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me add this final piece of information : <p> Were moving on with Nighthold raid testing , with five raid bosses on the higher levels of Nighthold accessible : Spellblade Aluriel , Krosus , Tichondrius , Star-Augur Etraeus , and High Botalist Telarn . Well be leaving these bosses up for a couple of days . Please use this thread for feedback or bug reports on any of the encounters . When providing tuning feedback , please note the nature of your raid group ( e.g. Mythic guild group , PUG , etc . ) . <p> Links to parsed logs are tremendously helpful . <p> ( And yes , the team is aware of concerns with 7.1.5 class changes the next build should have a new set of responsive changes , and were working on communication on other fronts .

We will be scaling players ' effective level to 110 for raid testing , and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested . <p> Q : How long does testing last ? <p> A : The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters , evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice , and identify bugs . Once we 're satisfied that we 've received that information for a given boss , we 'll be shutting down testing . Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours , but there are no guarantees .

@@44077785 @4077785/ <p> The time has finally come : after years of World of Garrison and weeks of pre-patch event , World of Warcraft : Legion has finally launched . Here is a quick guide , what you should do over the next few weeks to get prepared for Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons . <h> Enjoy yourself ! <p> First of all , let 's make this clear : unless you are not trying to be the first Level 110 player in the world , there is absolutely no need to rush over the next few days . The Raids and Mythic+ Dungeon wont be open until the 20th of September ( 21st in EU ) . Enjoy the game and the new content , enjoy the hype around the launch this only happens every two or three years ! <p> But let 's be real now : here are- your most important steps- to reach and prepare for endgame content ! <h> #1 Level Up <p> First of all , the most obvious thing is to level- from Level 100 to 110 . For Legion the most effective- way to so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones Highmountain , Valsharah , Azsuna and Stormheim . By doing so , you gain enough Reputation ( you need to be at least Friendly ! ) with the respective Factions to unlock World Quests on maxlevel . Although there is no flying enabled on the Broken Isles , the first stage of the meta achievement to unlock it on a future patch is already in the game and you will have to do the Loremaster of Legion AV anyways . <p> Remember : You do not have to start in a particular zone as NPCs and Questrewards scale with your level this time . That being said , prepare for slightly harder mob packs than it was the case in the past . Using- some flasks , pots and bufffood while questing is highly recommended . <h> #2 Class Order Hall Campaign <p> A lot has already been talked about Class Order Halls , here is the most important thing : whenever there is something new to do in your Class Order Hall just do it . Do not procrastinate , just do it . Almost every important Questline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questline- will unlock a third Relic slot for your Artifact Weapon and the ability to equip a second Legendary later in the game . Absolutely crucial for endgame content ! <h> #3- Artifact Knowledge <p> Within your Class Order Hall you can research Artifact Knowledge . This works just exactly like the work orders in your Warlords Garrison . AK will multiply the amount of Artifact Power you gain from various sources ingame . You should simply try to get the work orders started and rolling as soon as possible to get as much Artifact Power as possible . Simple as that . <h> #4 World Quests <p> Once you dinged Level 110 , World Quests will be accessible- from within your Class Order Hall . They are a huge source for Artifact Power , Class Order Ressources and can reward a lot of sweet good gear . Luckily those quests do pile up for three days in a row unlike the good old daily quests . Dragon Esports ( we interviewed them a few weeks ago ! ) did a great overview video on World Quests : <h> #5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a very unique and special zone simply dedicated to endgame questing : Suramar . Once you reached 110 you should head there and do all the quests . They reward a good amount of blue gear and a huge pile of Artifact Power . And the zone contains two Dungeons that have to be unlocked by questing : The Arcway and the Court of Stars . <h> #6 Gear Up and- Go Shopping <p> Once you have done all of that sweet new quest-content , it is time to set your focus on getting the best gear available until the Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons open their gates . As usual , most of the better gear comes from Dungeons but World Quests or Craftables are good sources too . We did a bigger guide on the process of gearing up for Legion Raids and Mythic +- here .

Something that maybe focuses more on the actual number of attempts needed ? <p> I am actually quite satisfied with the current concept . People who manage to raid such long hours really deserve more recognition than they get currently , because it 's not that easy at all to pull off . As long as they do n't add a system tying you to a limited amount of tries I am fine with any system .

Most of our players also rather enjoy doing raids then doing 5-man dungeons ! Additionally it 's a hard task to split up all members into well balanced groups . <p> Furthermore I am not too found of the whole artifact power system because it makes it way harder to change specs during progression , meaning it is also much harder to back up missing players with players on their off-specs . <h> When to see set sail for fail at gamescom 2016 <p> set sail for fail will play alongside the french guild From Scratch on the big Blizzard stage in hall 7 : <p> The complete schedule can be found on Blizzards official Gamescom Hub . <p> How do you like the two new raids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Personally I like the two new raids a lot , I think the overall designs fits very well and the encounters themselves are very well designed .

Although already founded in 2007 as " Synergy " , you most probably might know them as Pwnanza .

Who are you ? What is your role in Dragon and what class will you play- in Legion ? <p> Hi ! My names Franc and I play a Blood DK called Shacabau . I 'm currently GM and one of the founders of Dragon and my role is to manage the day to the day of the team and make sure we stay on track when it comes to our goals . For Legion , I 'd love to keep playing my Death Knight but the truth is I 'm not really sure what class I 'll be playing yet . I feel the class changes hit tanking hard and even if they feel strong mitigation wise , I 'm also missing the control I used to have before and of course , a lot of my old cooldowns . <p> You finished #15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #5 in the Hellfire Citadel race , behind Method and Paragon .

What are your goals and expectations on the race ? <p> I do n't  necessarily think Method splitting up will be beneficial for us . I think both Serenity and Method with the old Rapid Eye Movement core are both going to be up there and have a very good tier . For what Dragons concerned , well stick to what we know we can do well . We have a very good roster , a very good atmosphere and we all want to keep improving our rank and the quality of our raids . I think that after finishing 5th , the main priority now is sustainability .

What is your key to success when it comes to managing a guild over so many years and keep improving even as the game itself and players lives evolve . <p> There 's no secret formula and what works for us might not work for other guilds but in our case , if I was to point out the main factors that made the last decade go by so fast itd have to be our atmopshere and our ambition . We 've always tried to have a plan , an " ultimate " goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guild highlight what we 've been trying to do for a very long time . This helps a lot with putting both the positives and the negatives into perspective which ultimately allows us to focus on improving . Of course , we could n't do any of this if we werent having fun . Even if pushing rank and competing is a big part of that fun , our real assets are the players . We 've had the privilege to , over the years , play and surround ourselves with people that we legitimately enjoy the company of . We have our internal disputes from time to time and the occasional bad raids but overall , the good moments outweight the bad ones by far . As for the rank improvements , its a product of our preparation , the skill of our players and the fact that even when we fall behind on a boss or have a raid where nothing clicks , were back the next day making sure we catch up and that no matter what , we do n't  give up until the tier is over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm proud of ! <p> I 'm not particularly excited about Greater Rif sorry , Mythic+ <p> Artifact Weapons , Mythic+ Dungeons , Legendaries and Titanforged Items will bring significant changes to the gearing process this time .

It did n't  change any of our usual routines , even if its more complex . I 'd say that by the time Heroic is out , well be completely ready for it . As for the new content , I think that 's always good . I definitely like the idea of artifacts and I hope they manage to follow it up well throughout the expansion .

Were certainly open to feedback and refinement of these values . <p> To get started , every character entering a PvP instance has a base template of stats that is scaled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to focus here on level 110 values which budget players at item level 850 . Based on our experience in beta , we felt the ratio of damage to health was a bit high , so this set of stats has a bit less primary stat and a bit more stamina that someone would in 850 gear . <p> For each spec , these stats are adjusted up or down by a multiplier that defaults to 1.0 ( or 100% ) . For example , casters ( like mages and warlocks ) and healers do not benefit from the damage values on their weapons , so additional primary stat is budgeted on weapons throughout the game . Accordingly , all caster classes have a primary stat multiplier of 1.55 in PvP . This represents a 55% increase in Intellect for these specs . <p> We also have a blanket " Mod Damage Done " aura on all of the PvP templates for when we want to reduce damage but not primary stat . Healers are the best application of this aura . We may want to buff a Restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lava bursts to hit like trucks . Currently , all healers have a 25% reduction in damage against other players . Discipline Priests are the only exception as doing damage is part of how they heal . <p> Also , for individual spells , we can increase or decrease their effect while in PvP combat . This includes PvP instances like battlegrounds and arenas , but also World PvP and duels . If we want to decrease the amount of healing that Death Strike does in PvP by half , we set the PvP multiplier of that effect to 0.5.

Mythic , of course , requires 20 and does not scale . <p> As always , this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment .

Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information , and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback . <p> Q : How do I get into the raid zone ? <p> A : In Dalaran , Orgrimmar , or Stormwind , you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing .

@@44077815 @4077815/ <p> I have not enjoyed the cowboys but had a lot of fun seeing Azeroth on the big screen . Still both movies do have a thing- in common : they are good movies . <p> Its good to see snow again . Even in the distance . <p> You remember Brokeback Mountain ? Well if not , you do not have to watch , surely not . But it happened 2006 , that this film about two gay cowboys , struggling to find a way to live their love in a homophobic society was nominated for eight Oscars , including Best Picture . What a success ! This film must be massive even though in only won three of the golden awards in the end ! It is common sense , that a movie , being nominated for an academy award is a good movie and worth watching . Well I have watched it back then and I did not like it . I have to confess : I did not like Chicago , Slumdog Millionaire and Dances with Wolves either . They all got decorated as Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews of the Warcraft movie showed up earlier this week , they all were mostly negative . Kotaku , Variety , the Wrap they all clearly spoke out , that they did not like Duncan Jones latest piece of work . <h> What- makes- a good movie <p> Well , Warcraft is still a good movie . A damn good one . The opinion of an single random person , the taste of the judges at the Oscars does not decide wether a movie is a good one or not . And although the reviewers of Kotaku or Variety are writing for pretty large publications and therefore are being trusted to a certain level , this does not mean they 're right . They just did not see a movie , they could enjoy . And that 's fine , because I did not like Brokeback Mountain back then although it was a good movie . <p> It all comes down to a point , where we have to define , what makes a movie good or bad . Of course , this is the point were it get 's emotional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie is good when at least some people enjoyed it ( or Pbeing touched " by it for movies with more heavy topics ) . And hell yes , a lot of people , who have already seen Warcraft it , have enjoyed it as much as I did . Just check out Twitter or reddit , you quickly will find a lot of positive reactions . <h> Warcraft was not made for reviewers <p> And that 's besides the beautiful landscapes the only thing Warcraft has in common with Brokeback Mountain . Both are good movies for their core target audience . A story told good enough and well executed ( acting , CGI , sound , ) , that certain people liked it overall . It may not be the Kotaku reviewer and not the people deciding on the Oscars this time . But as already mentioned : that 's totally fine ! This film was never made for them anyways ! When reading and watching trough all the interviews and panels , Duncan Jones and Robert Kazinsky- did over the last year , one thing clearly stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warcraft fans at first . That was their main goal and this time its the big difference : Warcraft is a movie made by people , grown up with video games and Warcraft in particular . <p> I feel like there was some sort of misconception in the film industry about video game adaptions . Such projects should always focus on bringing the gamers , the people already loyal to the content into the cinemas at first . They should always focus on porting the feeling of an video game to the screen . And Warcraft does really well in that terms because Duncan Jones knows better . " Warcraft will take fans home " , he says : <p> However a good movie does not have to be successful and vice versa . Those are two different things but in best case , success follows goodness closely . I guess a lot of the bigger reviewers too often try to prejudge if a film has the potential to be successful . <h> So should I see Warcraft : The Beginning ? <p> As a long term World of Warcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film- and I really enjoyed it . There are strengths and weaknesses of course , but overall this piece of film interprets my beloved Warcraft-Universe in a new way while staying true to it 's core . If you do like the Warcraft universe , you should go an see it . The level of detail and game references is just astonishing and brings a lot of fun . And I guess that 's the main problem for people completely unfamiliar with Azeroth : they are missing one of the best things on this movie because they just do not have enough knowledge . So for sure , people that are new to Warcraft will most likely have not as much fun as I had . <p> That 's it ! I will not tell you anything more detailed about the movie . Just one more- thing : give a shit about reviews and if you can afford it , go see this movie and decide for yourself if it is good or not. -
