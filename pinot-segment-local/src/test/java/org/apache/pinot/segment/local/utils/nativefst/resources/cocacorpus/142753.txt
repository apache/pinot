HESAA may , at its discretion , grant borrower(s) periods of forbearance in the repayment of this Note . Forbearance may be granted for situations including , but not limited to , financial hardship . While on forbearance , a borrower is permitted a temporary cessation of principal payment and is temporarily permitted to make payments of interest only . If this Note was approved with a co-borrower , then the co-borrower must also qualify for forbearance and be approved , at HESAA 's discretion . I agree not to claim any forbearance you grant as a defense to repayment of this loan . At HESAA 's sole discretion , monthly interest payments may be deferred . Borrowers who select a 10-year repayment term are only eligible for a short-term forbearance for financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will accrue during all periods of repayment , deferment and forbearance , except for during approved periods of temporary total disability of the student borrower . Interest shall accrue daily on the unpaid principal balance at the rate(s) stated on the Pre-disbursement Disclosure from the date of the initial loan disbursement until the date this Note is paid in full . Interest will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the year and the actual number of days elapsed , including holidays and days on which you are not open . If you authorize Forbearance as to interest , you may add all such interest to the principal balance of the loan at the end of the Forbearance Period . <p> Late Payment and Other Charges : HESAA reserves the right to collect from the borrower a late charge , not to exceed 6% of the required payment , if the borrower fails to pay part or all of a required payment within ten ( 10 ) days after a payment is due .

The minimum acceptable monthly interest payment shall be the greater of the amount of interest accrued , or $10 per loan . <p> Modification : HESAA reserves the right to amend any terms , conditions , and/or definitions upon written notice to the borrower . <p> Repayment : I am responsible for repaying the entire Approved Loan Amount and also the interest for this loan in a timely manner within the period of years specified in the Pre-disbursement disclosure .

Authorized periods of deferment or forbearance do not extend the term . Monthly Repayment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial disbursement . Monthly Interest Only : repayment of principal is deferred until graduation , withdrawal , or notification of less than half-time enrollment and monthly payment of interest is required while in deferment .

Full Deferment : repayment of principal and interest is deferred until graduation , withdrawal , or notification of less than half-time enrollment and the interest is capitalized annually while in deferment . At the expiration of the deferment , monthly principal and interest payments are required . I am not relieved of my responsibility and obligation to make such payments even if I do not receive billing statements or any other written notices from you . Payments will be applied first to unpaid interest and then to unpaid principal and then to unpaid costs and finally to unpaid fees , as permitted by applicable law .

@@73602788 @2302788/ <p> Your estimated Financial Assistance is your financial aid package before the NJCLASS loan . You should include Federal and State student aid and any scholarships you 've been awarded . Your financial aid office can provide this number to you if you are still unsure of your aid package . <p> What does Usury Interest Rate mean ? <p> Usury Interest rates are excessively high . Usury laws are state laws that specify the maximum legal interest rate at which loans can be made . <p> What is a " Loan Offer " and why must I accept my loan within 30 days ? <p> After we complete our review of your application documents and have received the school 's certification , we are ready to offer you the loan . New federal regulations require that lenders honor the terms and conditions of the loans they offer for 30 days . This gives borrowers time to review the loan terms and decide if they want the loan .

" <p> The Federal Reserve Board uses this term to broadly categorize any loan that is not a Title-IV loan . A private education loan is a student loan independently financed and administered by a nonfederal lender . A private education loan is sometimes also referred to as an alternative or supplemental loan . NJCLASS is a supplemental loan program authorized through the State Legislature . <p> What is a pre-paid finance charge ? <p> A pre-paid finance charge is any finance charge ( other than interest ) paid to the lender in cash or check or withheld from the loan proceeds used for processing and servicing the loan . The loan administration fee that is charged to NJCLASS borrowers is a prepaid finance charge . <p> What is a Private Education Self Certification Form and why do I need to complete this ? <p> The Federal Government requires you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aid . You will be asked to complete a Federal Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification during this application process . You will need to know the cost of attendance for the period of enrollment covered by this loan and the estimated financial assistance you will be receiving . The difference between these two items is your loan amount . You can obtain this information from the Financial Aid office at your school . The purpose of this form is to ensure that the student/borrower is aware of the costs associated with attending their school and the amount of loans that may be necessary . <p> What is an APR ? <p> The Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate including interest and loan fees . This allows the borrower to compare loans ; however the APR should not be confused with the actual note rate . <p> What is cost of attendance ? <p> The cost of attendance is an estimation of the total amount it will cost a student to attend a particular school for a specific period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , room and board , books and supplies , and other expenses . <p> What is period of enrollment ? <p> This is the academic year , academic term ( such as semester , trimester , or quarter ) or the numbers of weeks of instructional time for which the applicant is requesting student financial assistance . <p> What is the amount financed ? <p> The Amount Financed is the loan amount applied for less any pre-paid finance charges . For example , if the borrower 's loan is for $10,000 and the pre-paid finance charges are $200 , the amount financed would be $9800 . <p> What is the initial finance charge ? <p> A finance charge is any fee or charge representing the cost of credit , or the cost of borrowing . It includes not only interest but other charges as well , such as transaction fees . <p> What is the purpose of the three day right to rescind and how will it affect my loan ? <p> The three day right to rescind provides the borrower with a final opportunity to evaluate their need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being disbursed . It is during this period that the borrower can rescind or cancel their loan application . If you rescind your loan , it will be cancelled . If you decide later that you need additional funds , you 'll need to reapply . There is no guarantee that the terms and conditions of the original offer will be available if you reapply . <p> What is the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) ? <p> This law , established in 1968 , is designed to protect consumers in certain credit transactions by requiring clear disclosure of key terms of the lending arrangements and all costs associated with the loan . The sole purpose of TILA is to promote the informed use of consumer credit , by requiring disclosures about its terms and standardizing the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed . It is important to note that this law does not regulate the costs or charges associated with a loan ; it just requires that this information is disclosed to the borrower in a timely fashion .

In the 13th or 49th month of principal and interest repayment , your interest rate increases by 0.75% and stays at that rate for the remainder of the loan . <p> Facts to Consider : * Interest accrues from the date of disbursement .
