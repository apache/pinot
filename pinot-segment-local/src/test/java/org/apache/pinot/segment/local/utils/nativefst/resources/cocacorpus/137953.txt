@@98121002 @2321002/ <h> VidCoder Tutorial 11152 @qwx871152 <h> Page 2 of 2 : Selecting the Source + Encoding Settings <h> Step 4 : Selecting the Source <p> Alright , we 're finally getting to the heart of the VidCoder . This step will cover loading your input file into VidCoder . <p> The screenshot above shows the main VidCoder screen . The layout is pretty straight forward , the top section allows you to load in the file/disc you want to convert , then you can select the destination , choose an encoding profile or custom settings , and finally , there 's the work queue , a list of all conversions one after the other that you can schedule and run . <p> In the " Choose a video source " section , you have three input options - choose to convert a video file ( for example , AVI ) , choose to convert an already ripped or a hard-drive based DVD or Blu-ray folder , or choose to convert straight from a non encrypted discs . As mentioned earlier , it 's recommended that even if your disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-drive first ( to a DVD/Blu-ray folder ) , so that it spares your optical drive from hours of constant reading , which may shorten the lifespan of the drive . <p> There is actually a fourth input method , shown in the screenshot above , the " Enqueue Multiple Files " option from the " File " menu . Here , you can load in multiple files and they will automatically be added to the work queue . This seems to be the best way to convert multiple files , but note that doing it this way means all the files will use the same encoding profile/settings , so if you need different settings for each file ( perhaps one will be better quality than the others , for example ) , you 're better off loading the files one by one by using the " Video File " option under the " Choose a video source " section . But if you do need multiple files with the same encoding settings , than you will have to configure the encoding settings and/or choose an encoding profile before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option , so continue reading . <p> Depending on which type of input you chose ( file , DVD or Blu-ray ) , the " Source " section will now show up with information about the input , as well as giving you the option to select which sections of the input you plan to convert . The screenshots below show what the section looks like with a file , a DVD and a Blu-ray source loaded . <p> Let 's go through the " Source " options . The " Video " option allows you to choose which sections of the input video to convert . For discs , or ripped DVD/Blu-ray folders , you can select which " Title " to convert - usually the longest title would be the main movie ( and this is the title VidCoder automatically selects for you ) , with trailers and bonus features occupying the other titles ( see screenshot below - the 2:20:06 is the main movie , while the others are probably trailers ) . <p> For everything else , you can choose which chapters ( if the input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in seconds ) , or even by frames . This means you can easily choose just the right scene to convert , if you do n't want to convert the whole thing ( very handy for YouTube style remix projects ) . Note that the output filename will change based on the settings you make here , for example , if you only choose to convert Chapter 24 and 25 from Title 2 , the output file name will become " SourceName Title 1 - Chapter 24-25 " . Nicely done , VidCoder . <p> The next option is to select which audio track to include . You can include more than one audio track , by the way , by clicking on the " Add Track " button , which then brings up a second audio drop down box . Click on the blue " cross " icon next to the drop down box to delete the audio track . Note that you can have anywhere from zero ( so no audio ) to even more audio tracks then are present in the original source ( so use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you want ) . Go crazy , and select your audio track(s) . <p> Subtitles can either be read from the original source ( except for Blu-ray movies ) , or you can load in an external . srt subtitle file . By default , no subtitles are select , but if you want subtitles , click on the " Edit " button to get started , and you 'll see the screen below . <p> The " Track " drop down box allows you to select , from the input source , which subtitle track to include in the output . The default " Foreign Audio Source " option is a Handbrake feature that selects only the subtitles that are for foreign language parts of the movie . Otherwise , you can manually select a language/track to include . The three options next to the drop down box allows you to set the current subtitle track as the default one in the output ( " Default " option ) , to only display forced subtitles from the current track ( " Forced Only " option - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to burn-in the subtitle into the video so it ca n't be turned off ever ( " Burned In " option ) . <p> The concept of " foreign audio search " and " forced subtitles " is a bit tricky , so I should probably explain in more detail how it works . On certain subtitles , like on certain DVDs , parts of the subtitle can be marked using the " Forced " flag , which means that even if you do n't turn on subtitles , these parts will be shown . This is usually for scenes in a movie that contains a foreign language , or for certain captions ( for example , captions like " 10 years later ... " ) , where subtitles are forced to be displayed . Now , some movies do this via burnt-in subtitles as opposed to forced on subtitles , and other discs do n't use the Forced flag , and instead , have a totally separate subtitle track that only contains the forced subtitles . <p> The " Foreign audio search " option tries to automatically scan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Forced " flag is used . Otherwise , you 'll have to manually select a subtitle track in the right language . <p> So this actually makes it quite tricky to convert movies that have these types of subtitles , and if you want to be absolutely sure that you do n't end up with a movie that 's missing crucial subtitles , or select the wrong subtitles , than a little bit of trial and error may be required ( select a short scene with these types of subtitles , and then try to convert and check to make sure the subtitles are included ) . The preview option helps and does show subtitles , but it 's a bit tricky to get to select the exact scene to preview unless you set a ton of picture preview frames ( see Step 3 : Options -&gt; Advanced tab ) . <p> Anyway , you can add multiple subtitle tracks here by using the " Add Subtitle " button ( or remove an added subtitle track by click on the blue " cross " icon ) . Alternatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Press " OK " when you 're done . <h> Step 5 : Output Destination and Settings <p> Under the " Destinations " section , simply enter in where you want your output file to be saved on your computer . <p> The " Encoding " section is really the meat of VidCoder , and it is here that you select the output quality , the file size , audio type and pretty much everything else about your output . To make it easy , you can simply select one of the pre-saved " Presets " ( " Normal " , " High Profile " , and one of the presets for Apple devices , such as the iPad , iPhone ... ) . So if it 's quick and dirty you want , and you do n't really care about the output file size , then the presets are for you ( so select one and skip to step 6 ) . On the other hand , if you want to custom tailor your encodings to exact specifications , to select between MP4 or MKV , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all , select a profile that 's closest to what you want , normally I would select the " Normal " profile , and then press the " Settings " button . The following screen should show up ( minus the red highlights ) . <p> The first section we 'll examine is the one marked in red in the screenshot above . It 's here that we select which type of container format we use , MKV or MP4 . I do n't want to go into the merits of either format here ( that 's a whole other guide ) , but if you 're already this far , then you probably know which format you need ( to summarise , MKV is more of a computer format , while MP4 is supported by more portable devices , such as Apple devices and smart phones , tablets , game consoles ) . If you select " MKV " , there is only one additional option to the right , and that 's to include chapter markers found in the input video , and place them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the chapter marker option , there are a few more options as you can see in the screenshot above , and they are : <p> Large file support : Checking this option enables MP4 files larger than 4GB , but many devices , such as the iPod or PS3 do not support these kinds of files <p> Web optimized : Choose this if you need files that can be progressively loaded , such as via video streaming <p> iPod 5G support : Adds a marker for older iPods that has to be present before they will allow H.264 video to sync <p> Below these options , we have the " Picture " tab . Here , you can resize your video , as well as crop out areas ( usually the black bars ) . With your input video loaded , the input and output resolution properties are shown for you here , in blue and green . Starting further down below with the Anamorphic options , the " Strict " option basically attempts to replicate what a DVD does when it comes to storing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disables the resizing options , but you may run into problems with certain encoders not liking the automatically calculated height value ( if it 's not a multiple of 16 , some encoders , like x264 , can not perform at optimal efficiency ) . Selecting the " Loose " anamorphic option re-enables the ability to resize the video , but only the width , as the height is automatically calculated to ensure it is a multiple of 16 . " Custom " allows you to specify custom parameters , and it 's not recommended unless you know what you 're doing . Or you can even turn Anamorphic encoding off . Recommendation ? Strict when you 're not resizing , and Loose when you are . If you really need to know more about Anamorphic encodings using the Handbrake engine , please refer to this guide . <p> Cropping is normally done automatically , so choose the " Automatic " option and forget about it . <p> Moving on to the next tab , " Video Filters " , here we can select the types of filtering we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to leave both " Detelecine " and " Decomb " to " Default " , as it usually does no harm , and if you do come across video inputs that require this ( eg. TV shows and animation for " Detelecine " , and interlaced content for " Decomb " ) , they will be applied when needed . If you must need to know more , than here 's the Telecine and Deinterlacing guides that try to explain more about what these options do . <p> It 's best to leave " Deinterlace " disabled , because we 've already got " Decomb " , and that already tries its best to removing the combing effect you get from interlaced sources , and if there 's no combing effect , you do n't need to waste time and resources deinterlacing anyway . Similarly , " Denoise " probably should remain off , as this destroys details for the sake of a bit more efficient encoding ( efficient as in use lower bitrates ) . Use only when the source is poor in quality or as directed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blocking and artifacts from poor quality sources . Note that the majority of DVDs and Blu-ray 's that you 'll be converting definitely do not belong to the category or " poor in quality " . <p> The " Input " video specs are shown in the blue coloured box ( for example , the screenshot above tells us we have a PAL DVD at 25 FPS ) . Despite this simple looking tab , this is actually where we determine the quality of the output . First of all , for " Video Codec " , it is recommended you use " H.264 ( x264 ) " , as this is the more advanced codec and will produce better quality encodings ( it 's worth noting that none of the included presets in VidCoder uses the " MPEG-4 ( FFMpeg ) " option ) . The " Framerate ( FPS ) " option should be set to " Same as source " , although if you 're experiencing audio sync issues ( like I was when trying to play an encoded file on the PS3 , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would specifically select a framerate here , as opposed to using the variable framerate mode when you choose " same as source " . Same if you find playback jerky , choose a set framerate to avoid using variable framerate mode . <p> " Quality " is the most important setting here . " Constant Quality " , allows you to set the quality of the output , without any considerations being given the final file size . This should mostly be fine , except when you need to encode video to fit a certain space constraint . If you do need an output file of a particular size , and do n't mind encodings taking longer due to the need to have two passes , select " Target Size " or " Avg Bitrate " ( both settings take into account the length of your video , including any chapter/time selections you 've made in previous steps ) . The " Target Size " setting is also for the entire output file , not just the video stream ( so if you added a lot of audio files , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kept the same target size ) . Recommendations ? If you use CQ mode , then something around 20 plus or minus 1 will be more than fine for SD sources . For HD sources , you should aim for a setting of around 22 plus or minus 1 . Note that the CQ setting can use decimals , so 19.25 , is acceptable for example . The scale is logarithmic , so do n't go crazy . <p> As for target size of average bitrates , I get asked recommendations for this when using H.264 a lot , so I 'll probably just share some general recommendations . For your typical 2 hour DVD , you should be looking at around 1400 MB , or an average bitrate of around 900 kbps . For 2hr 720p content , for good quality stuff , aim to fill a DVD-5 . For 2hr 1080p stuff , aim to fill a DVD-9 at the very least . If you want the best quaity , most efficient encoding , then you should be using CQ anyway ( with a sensible setting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 ) . <p> On to the " Audio " tab . You can have multiple audio tracks , and if you selected the " High Profile " preset and the " MP4 " container , you would have noticed that it includes a pass-through AC3 track . The reason for this is that , most receivers do not actually support AAC , and so having a backup AC3 track is always a good idea . AAC is more efficient , but 5.1 AAC is less commonly support on hardware . So you really need to know what your output file will be used on . Take the screenshot above , which is for a Blu-ray to a high quality MP4 encode , which will most likely be played on HTPCs and the like , and so it 's not as important to include a 2-channel AAC file as say for a video aimed at portable devices . <p> So after deciding on what you need , select the target stream to convert ( if you have more than one audio stream selected for the input ) , select a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio , or one of the 2.0/2.1 channel downmix options ) . " Sample rate " should be kept as " same as source " , because there 's usually no good reason to change this . " Bitrate " is difficult to recommend , because there are so many different audio formats . For high quality audio , with AC3 , 384/448 kbps is most commonly found on commercial DVDs . For MP3 , 160 kbps for every 2 channels seems to about right for high quality audio . AAC is more efficient , so 128 kbps for every 2 channels is good enough . <p> And so , finally , the " Advanced " tab . Looks complicated ? It is . It would take a couple of guides to explain all of the options , and so it 's really way beyond the scope of this guide , so leave the settings alone . <p> If you 've made changes here , you may want to save these settings to a new profile ( while keeping the original VidCoder profiles unchanged for future reference ) . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " button at the top of the window and enter a new name for the profile . Once this is done , you can select this new profile in the future for your encodes and skip having to change the settings altogether . <p> Close the Settings window . <h> Step 6 : Preview , Encoding and the Job Queue <p> It 's always wise to preview your output before starting the hours long encoding process . Pressing the " Preview " button launches a new window that contains the X number of preview pictures that you selected way back in Step 2 . More useful is the " Play Preview Clip " button , which when clicked , will quickly generate a preview video clip with your selected audio and subtitles options . My recommendation is to always do this , and always look at the preview pictures to at least make sure you 're converting the right title , and that the output quality is good enough , and that the audio/subtitle options are correct . For example , while generating a sample video to help me write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as VidCoder automatically selected the longest title , which was not the movie ( it included the " Maximum Movie Mode " pop-ups , which made the title about 21 minutes longer than the actual movie ) . Had I not checked the preview pictures , I would have ended up converting the wrong title ! <p> We 're nearly finished now . With input selected , settings set , if you want to start encoding immediately , simply click on the " Encode " button . Or if you want to set up a few more jobs , then use the " Add to Queue " button , and when you 're finished adding in jobs , also press the " Encode " button to start the job queue . ( And if you wanted to batch convert a bunch of files with the same setting , use the File -&gt; Enqueue Multiple Titles option now ) . <p> The job queue section lists all the currently working and queued jobs , with columns showing the properties of the encoding job . You can even customize the columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in progress , a progress bar is also present , and you can pause or stop the current job . 
@@98121004 @2321004/ <h> Page 1 of 1 : PS3 MKV Playback Guide ( mkv2vob ) <p> MKV is an increasingly popular video format , mainly because of its open source roots , and it being increasingly used for H.264 encoding . The problem is that many standalone devices simply do not support the MKV format , often preferring the MP4 container format for use with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoding . The PS3 supports the MP4 container , but it has several limitations , least of which is the maximum file size of 4GB ( which is not nearly enough for HD content ) . MP4 files can also only use 2 channel audio . But luckily , the PS3 also supports H.264 streams in other container formats , such as VOB , M2TS and MPG , and some of these do support 5.1 channel audio , as well as removing the 4GB file size limit . <p> This guide shows you how to play MKV files on the PS3 , which supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , but does not support the MKV container . And do so without re-encoding unless strictly necessary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , and just a couple more with audio re-encoding ) . A Xbox 360 version of this guide , using the software GOTSent , is available here . This guide uses the mkv2vob tool , which is specifically designed for MKV to a PS3 compatible video format conversion . <p> Download mkv2vob and follow the instructions as set out in the installer . All the required tools are installed for you . <p> mkv2vob is incredibly easy to use , and so you might argue that a guide is n't even necessary . However , there are several options which will determine what kind of file mkv2vob produces . Despite the name , mkv2vob produces more than just VOB files from MKV inputs . In fact , it can produce AVCHD files for burning to disc or to a USB storage device , and it can produce files of the following format : MPG , M2TS , VOB ( of course ) , MP4 and even AVI , as these are all formats supported by the PS3 . <p> Start mkv2vob , and click on the " Configuration " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go through all the available options and explain just which ones you should change and which ones you should leave well alone . <p> Starting at the top left corner and working our way down , the " Temp Directory " setting allows you to specify where the temporary working files should be stored . This is by default your Windows User temp folder , and there 's usually no reason to change it . To the right of this option is the " Output Type " option . " File " will create a playable file(s) as the output , while you can select " AVCHD - Disc " if you plan on creating an AVCHD disc , or " AVCHD - USB " if you plan on creating the AVCHD structure on a USB storage device . If you 're unsure which to select , then select " File " , since AVCHD limits you to how to play back the video on the PS3 . <p> Moving down , the " Preferred Audio Language " and two options to the right , the " Preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitle tracks in the input MKV file . If a language is selected , then that language will be the one used to create the output . If the audio language is not found , then the first audio track will be used instead . When a subtitle language is selected , and if that language exists in the input file , and if it is different to the selected audio language , then video transcoding will be automatically enabled regardless of your selected transcoding setting ( see below ) . For example , if you 've selected " French " as the audio language , and " English " as the subtitle language ( which exists in the input MKV file ) , then the video will be forced to be transcoded to " encode in " the subtitles into the video , even if you 've set " Video Transcoding " to " Never " . Note that subtitles are " burned in " types , and so can not be removed afterwards or turned off during playback . <p> " Video Transcoding " when set to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream needs transcoding to a format that 's compatible with the PS3 or not , and this is the recommended setting . On the other hand , you can set it to " Always " to force it to transcode to another format , which takes longer and more processing - this has the potential of wasting a lot of time and reducing quality , but will guarantee compatibility and is recommended if the " Automatic " option did not produce a compatible file . The " Never " option is for the opposite , when you know the file is compatible but mkv2vob determines that it is n't , and you want to skip the transcoding process . Note that this setting may be disregarded depending on your " Preferred Subtitle Language " setting ( see above ) . <p> Moving down again , " File Splitting " sets the maximum size of each file that mkv2vob creates - any larger , and a new file is created . And more importantly than that , depending on where you want to store the file . If storing the a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , which will limit the file size to the 4GB limit as required . There are similar settings for Sony memory sticks . Burning to discs is also catered for , with presets for DVD-5 , DVD-9 and even single layered Blu-ray . If you 're not planning to copy the file over to some kind of media ( that is , preferring to stream the file from your PC/network device to your PS3 , for example using TVersity ) , then set this option to " None " . <p> " Output File Extension " allows you to manually to specify which format you want the output file to be in . It is best to keep this option set to " Automatic " , unless you want to force a particular type of file to be created which could cause compatibility issues . <p> For the " Transcoding Codec " , this determines which video codec is to be used if the video needs to be transcoded . For best encoding speed , the default " MPEG-2 " option is best , but as you go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encoding quality , with " x264 High Bitrate " being the slowest , but the highest quality preset . Of course , this option is only relevant if transcoding is to be used . For files that you are likely to keep for a long time and for HD content , it is probably worth selecting one of the x264 options , especially if you have a fast PC . For view and then delete items and SD stuff , MPEG-2 will be good enough , although selecting XviD may also be worthwhile . <p> We 've done with the main options , so it 's just the minor ones to the right that we have a look at : <p> Always Encode Subtitles : Selecting this option will force subtitles to be encoded even if the subtitle language is the same as the selected audio language . <p> Load Subtitles from file : If a SRT or ASS subtitle file is located in the same folder as the input MKV file and has the same filename , then it will be automatically loaded if this option is selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitles slightly higher up in the picture than normally , in case the overscanning function on TVs cut off parts of the subtitles that 's placed too near the bottom of the picture <p> Large Subtitles : Enabling this option will make the subtitle font larger <p> Always Transcode DTS : Enabling this option will transcode DTS to another AC3 or PCM , for those without DTS decoding receivers <p> Use PCM instead of AC3 : When enabled , uncompressed PCM audio will be used , which greatly increases file size . And you 'll also need HDMI audio output to your receiver in order to hear audio <p> Use 448kbps AC3 : 448kbps is the maximum AC3 bitrate used on DVDs . Blu-ray movies support higher bitrate AC3 for better quality ( and greater file size ) . Selecting this option will force the lower bitrate to be used in case your receiver does not support higher bitrate AC3 <p> Use Old File Format : Selecting this option creates M2TS files , which work better on the PC and works with older PS3 firmware <p> We 'll now load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add File " tab and use the " Browse " button to load in your " Source File " . You should also specify an output location . The " Delete source file after conversion " will remove the source MKV file after conversion , but this is not recommended ( in the event the output file was not perfect , losing the source file is a bit annoying ) . Then press the " Add File " button to start the conversion process . <p> Or if you need to convert a bunch of MKV files at the same time , you can put them all in the same folder , click on the " Add Directory " tab in mkv2vob and specify the " Source Directory " and mkv2vob will convert all files in the folder . Press the " Add Directory " button to start the conversion process . <p> One of the more frequent errors you may encounter is the infamous " TSMuxer has stopped responding " error . This usually indicates a problem with the MKV file structure . Luckily , there is an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to put in more plainly , reconstruct the MKV file from scratch , but without having to re-encode the video/audio - this should take a matter of seconds , as opposed to hours with a full re-encoding ) . What you need to do is to first download and install MKVToolnix . Afterwards , download and install Popcorn MKV Remuxer ( which uses MKVToolnix to perform the remuxing ) and then run Remuxer . Once open , press the " Save " style icon , this sets the output options - select one to suit your needs ( it 's recommended that you *do not* select the " overwrite source " option , as this means you 'll lose your original file in the process - only overwrite the original if you 've confirmed the newly re-muxed MKV file is fully working ! ) . Then press the green " + " button to load in your file(s) - you can select multiple MKV files for batch processing if needed . After that , all you need to do is to press the " Run " button and Popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly created MKV file into mkv2vob again , and the " TSMuxer has stopped responding " should hopefully no longer appear . <p> And we 're done . <p> Now all you have to do is to take your new PS3 compatible video file and get it to play on the PS3 . If you chose AVCHD - Disc , then you need to burn the AVCHD files to a DVD or Blu-ray disc . If you chose AVCHD - USB , then copy the files to your USB device . Otherwise , you can use a software like TVersity to stream the file from your computer to your PS3 ( instructions for doing this are here .

This is a good way to ensure you achieve maximum quality for the video that you do keep , and you can even use this method to add additional video files to the DVD . <p> In Video Copy &amp; Convert , click on the " Video Compilation " button at the top to get to the following screen . <p> Under the " Source " section , click on the " Add Movies " button . The " Media Selector " should pop up . Navigate yourself to the folder where your DVD files are stored , and the video contents of this folder will be shown on the right hand side ( in the screenshot below , the title with the longest running time is referred to as " Movie 1 " , as this is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as " Extras " ) . This is where you select what you want to keep on the disc . Click on a title ( eg. " Movie 1 " and it will be highlighted ) to add it to the compilation . If you want to select multiple titles , hold down the " Ctrl " button on your keyboard as you use your mouse to select titles . Press the " OK " button to load the selected DVD-Video titles into Video Copy &amp; Convert . If you need to add more titles , then click on the " Add Movie " button again to load them ... you can load in various video types , even movie files not part of the original source DVD . <p> On the bottom of the main Video Copy &amp; Convert screen , you should see a size bar and an option to select the media type . This option allows you to set what kind of media you are going to make the copy on . The options are single layer DVD+/- blanks , dual layer blanks , DVD-RAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality " rating shows what the estimated finally quality will be like for the current copy . Since most DVDs are DVD-9 ( usually around 8 GBs ) and single layer blanks have just over 4 GBs , Video Copy &amp; Convert will actually compress the original DVD to make it fit , which will affect picture quality . The more compression , the lower the quality . To truly make a 1:1 copy , you will need to use dual-layer blanks . But even a compressed disc will still look acceptable on all but the largest screens . The content quality could range from " Good " to " Excellent " or even " Identical to Original " . <p> The size bar ( orange in the first screenshot below , green in the second screenshot ) shows how much space will be left on the output disc ( the first screenshot below shows no space is left and that all 4428 MB on the disc will be occupied , the second screenshot shows a little bit of space left on the 8147 MB blank ) . If " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Original " , then the size bar will turn green . Keep an eye on the " Content Quality " and size bar status throughout to make sure you 're not cramming too much onto the disc . <p> Now that we have loaded in the videos into this compilation , they will be shown on the left hand side . First , use the purple up and down arrows to make sure their ordering is correct ( the order listed will be the order they are shown on the DVD menu and the playback order ) . You can also select a title and click on the " Rename " button to rename the title ( this title name will be the one displayed on the DVD menu , if you choose to make one - in the screenshot below , I 've renamed my titles " Main Movie " , " Documentary " and " Trailer " ) . Now is probably a good time to save your compilation - from the " File " menu , select " Save Compilation As " - this will save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can continue working on this compilation at a later time . <p> You can also click on the " Preview/Trim Movie " button ( to the right of the purple arrow buttons ) to edit/cut out parts of the video title that you do n't want . It 's the same process as any movie editor ... just set a start and end time of the portion of the video you want . There is a job shuttle to make selection easier , as well as the option to set the movie thumbnail . <p> Since each title , particularly if it 's from a DVD source , may have multiple language tracks , you can also choose to remove some of them to save space . Press the " Language options " button . In the new window that opens , you can select which audio and subtitles tracks you want to keep ( the " checked " ones ) , and which you want to remove ( in the screenshot below , I 've only kept the English audio and subtitles ) . Sometimes a DVD might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DTS and Dolby tracks ) , so you might only want to keep one of them ( but be careful , some 2 channel tracks contain the audio commentary , so you might want to keep that ) . Press " OK " when you have finished your language selections to close the " Language Options " window . <p> Now you will have to select a destination . Under " Format " , select " DVD " , because that 's what we are trying to make ( as you can see Roxio Video Copy &amp; Convert supports many output formats , like DivX , 3GP or even iPod formats ... perhaps a future guide will cover these options in more detail ) . Press the " Options " button just below to change the output options . <p> Here , you can change the disc 's name . More importantly , you can also choose whether to create a menu or not . Several menu templates are provided for use , and if you have multiple video titles , it is recommended that you create a menu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to play the first title when the disc is inserted . Again , if you have multiple titles , you can also specify whether the titles will play in sequence or return to the main menu after each title has ended . You can also set a " Video Format " option , although it should normally be automatically selected for you . US DVDs are NTSC , while most of Europe and UK/Australia use PAL - check the " Always convert to preferred video format " to make sure all titles are converted to PAL or NTSC even if they were in another format originally . Press " OK " to close the options window when you have finished . <p> If you selected to use a menu , then a menu preview thumbnail should show up just below the " Options " button . Click on the " Select Style " button to change the look and feel of the menu . <p> Here in the menu editor , there are several pre-made styles/templates you can use , or you can make your own from scratch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Smart Objects " section , and you can click on various objects in the preview on the right hand side to change their text properties or resize and move objects . You can also change the color or load a different background image . You ca n't make animated menus and things like that , but you probably do n't need to . When you are satisfied with your changes , you can use the " Save as Style " button to save this style for future use . Click on the " OK " button to load the new menu into the compilation . <p> Just one last option to select . From the " Output to : " section , you can select to burn straight to disc or to a DVD-Video folder on your hard-drive . The advantage of burning to another DVD-Video folder is that you can test the DVD on your computer first , using PowerDVD or WinDVD ( both supports loading DVDs from the hard-disk ) . <p> If you want to burn straight to disc , make sure the " Disc/Disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Burn " button just above . Insert a blank disc into your DVD writer drive and choose your burning options . You can select the burn speed ( try to use 4x , as that will guarantee the best compatibility , even if your media is rated for higher speeds ) and also the number of copies you wish to burn . There are also some advanced burning options , that you may not need to change . When you have finished changing the burning options , press " OK " to start the processing the burning process ( the length depends on how much compression needs to be done ) . This guide is now finished for you , so you do n't need to continue reading . <p> If you do want to burn to your hard-disk first , then select the " File/Folder " options under " Output to : " . Press the " Save As " button just above it and select a folder to save your files ( to avoid confusion , create a new folder to save your files in and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files - although Roxio will create a new folder for you as to not overwrite your source files , it can still be confusing ) . <p> Once you have the Video Copy &amp; Convert produced files , you can then use PowerDVD or WinDVD to load the folder containing these files and play the movie back . If everything works as it should , then you can burn the folder as a DVD-Video disc . There are many ways to do this , both free ( ImgBurn : guide ) and commercial solutions , but there 's nothing to stop you from using Roxio Video Copy &amp; Convert to burn the processed files again ( this time follow Step 2a - Roxio wo n't re-process the files as they have already been processed to fit onto your blank media ) . To do this , basically repeat the steps under Step 2a ( not Step 2b ) and load the processed DVD-Video Folder into Video Copy &amp; Convert , but this time , do not set a language option and burn straight to disc using the instructions provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@98121016 @2321016/ <p> DMA is an abbreviation for Direct Memory Access , an access method for external devices where the data transfer is not done by the central processor , but by a small special processor called DMA controller . It uses a procedure called cycle stealing , where the central processor memory access cycles are delayed for very short times to intersperse DMA controller memory access cycles . Some newer , faster DMA modes are called UDMA ( Ultra DMA ) . <p> The alternative , slow and inefficient data transfer mode is called PIO , Programmed Input-Output , where the central processor transfers data byte for byte or word for word .

@@98121020 @2321020/ <p> No doubt about it ! If you want the best quality SVCD or VCD then TMPGEnc is the way to go and what 's more , its free baby ! The bad news is only the older versions gave us full support of SVCD and VCD . This is a very important point , only use TMPGEnc upto version 12a do n't download version 12b or any later versions unless you want to buy the product of course ! And you will need the English patched version too or it will be unreadable . <p> If you intend on converting a DVD into a VCD with TMPGEnc then you probably should frameserve it with Flask Mpeg . If you intend on just using the Ligos and WinDVD filters as explained breifly in my DVD to VCD guide , then you may need to extract the audio first with Graphedit and add it to the movie seperately or audio may not appear . <p> This guide basically assumes that you are converting an AVI file but all the same settings will apply to any file you can open in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As usual any new utility looks hard to use at first but is actually not too bad . Take a look at the picture below . <p> First we will choose the AVI file we wish to make into a VCD . Do this by hitting the ' video source ' Browse button ( A ) ; ( If you are frameserving you will choose the *. avs file instead of the *. avi ) . The audio source ( B ) is not needed unless you have a seperate audio track that needs multiplexing to the video file . This is sometimes the case if you needed to normalize or edit the audio for any reason but keep in mind that TMPGEnc can also normalise audio for us . Finally we can choose where we wish to save our final VCD Mpeg file ( C ) . <p> TMPGEnc is great because it can do everything we need . You can use it to convert just audio alone to Mp2 by not selecting any video . You can use it to convert just video to Mpg by saying ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and join Mpeg files in any way you like . The selection boxes ( E ) allow us to choose what TMPGEnc will give us . Always choose : System ( Video+Audio ) if you want an Mpg with video and audio . <p> The Load and Save buttons of the ' output sytream type ' just let you save all the settings you used to create your movies . This can be very useful if you need to set custom settings for your movies , but we will not need any in this guide . If you download anyone elses settings you can load them using these buttons too . Anyway , let 's configure TMPGEnc to make our VCD . Press the configure button ( D ) , and this box appears : <p> The Video tab are the most important ones , so here is what the options are all about . <p> ( A ) Obviously since we are making a VCD we must select Mpeg-1 . <p> ( B ) Then we must choose a Video CD standard size . No other sizes will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 288 for PAL movies . Even if you are not making a perfect whitebook standard VCD then its a good idea to choose one of these settings anyway because its a nice standardized format : ) . <p> ( C ) Aspect ratio should be set to 4:3 PAL for PAL VCDs or 4:3 NTSC for NTSC VCDs . <p> ( D ) The framreate must be set to 25fps for PAL VCDs or 29.97fps for NTSC VCDs . <p> ( E ) You must use Constant bitrate ( CBR ) for VCDs able to play on standalones . <p> ( F ) You must always use a bitrate of 1150 kbit/sec . <p> The rest of the options are greyed out because they do not apply . <p> ( G ) For motion search accuracy I suggest you either use Normal or High Quality . It does n't matter which one you choose apart from one obviously looking slightly better . If you are a quality freak you can set the thing on highest quality instead . Obviously the higher the quality the longer it will take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal and higher quality modes so experiment to see what you think is best before you do a full movie . <p> That should be all you need to set ! Press OK to get out of the Configire section and press the large Encode button - Bingo ! <p> ADDITIONAL SETTINGS <p> For a VCD you can usually keep all other setting default and everything should be fine . But these extra filters are absolutely wonderful and no other mpeg encoder I 've seen has come close to the options offered with TMPGEnc ! This includes the big names such as the Panasonic Mpeg Encoder , Xing and Ligos - they are total rubbish by comparison ! Unfortunately to explain how to use everything would take many articles and a lot of time . So instead I will give a breif overview and let you play about with them yourselves . <p> Let 's go back to Configuration and click on the next tab , the ' Advnced ' settings : <p> ( A ) Non-interlaced or interlaced , this option is only used to make the resolution larger or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field order . With an interlaced video the picture is made up in two parts one of all odd lines and the other of all even lines , see my interlace article Here for more details on this subject . Basically it should n't make any difference to your video , it will either do it in A field order starting with the top field first ( i.e. AB AB AB ) , or B order first starting with the bottom field ( i.e. BABA ) . <p> ( C ) This let 's you change the Aspect ratio of the video to make it either widescreen or normal screen . You will always use 4:3 for VCD 's . An aspect ratio of 1:1 means no change at all and 16:9 is usual for widescreen . <p> ( D ) The center option helps to centralize your video if it is has been resized or cropped previously . <p> ( E ) Here is where things get really interesting . There are a whole bunch of filter that can be applied to the video before the encoder transforms it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AVI in VirtualDub , but is n't it nice of the programmer of TMPGEnc to include so many options : ) . To select them just tick beside the boxes , but to configure them you must double-click on the selection you picked or the options box wont appear . Again there are too many settings to explain in detail so I will just highlight a few of the most useful ones : <p> Crop Video : This is the one you will probably use most of all . It crops the sides of your AVI to the size you want it , its very easy to use . Double-click on it and up will pop a preview of your video . Then increase the numbers in the Top , Bottom , Left and Right boxes to cut the video to the sizes you need . It also gives you the option of keeping the size but just blacking out the edges like a letterboxed video . <p> Audio Effects : The main point of this is to make video that has low sound volume louder . It does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP2 . Normalizing , as I 'm sure you 've read in my guides before , is a way of amplifying audio to go as loud as possible without ' clipping ' off the scale and causing corrupted parts . I 'd say always use a normalization of 90-100% ; I always use 100 . They 've also thrown in the option to fade in and out at the start and end of the movie which is more useful for small video clips that tend to end suddenly . <p> Edge Enhancement : Another beautiful feature that allows you to control the general sharpness of the picture without significantly effecting the soft tones . If used correctly this can be set to produce some very nice mpeg videos that are both sharp and clear . <p> Basic Color Correction : This is useful if the original AVI has a green or reddish tinge to it . You can change the brightness and contrast too . The option to adjust the Gamma is usually for better PC viewing and may make the picture look too light on a Normal TV ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you intend to view it with before you decide on the best colour corrections to do . The gamma is different from the brightness and contrast in that it changes the midtones rather than how bright the colours start and stop . I will write more about colour correction in other guides and you can learn a bit about colour in my ' More Filter Tricks ' section Here if you want . <p> Custom color correction : This is harder to use but gives better control over image colour values . To start you have to press the ' Add ' button to add an adjustment layer over the image or you can not mess about with the settings . <p> Ghost reduction : This helps to prevent flicker and ghosting effects . You can either set it yourself or let it automatically guess the best one for your video clip . <p> Noise Reduction : Another excelent filter although hard to get good settings with so if unsure try the default settings . It has the option for temporal filtering or spatial filtering ( if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings for a good result . Be very careful with this because it can actually cause ghosting effects . For details on how noise reduction works it may be useful to check out my guides on the VirtualDub filters Here . <p> Deinterlace : If you find that your video file looks like this picture below , especially in scenes with lots of action then you will probably need to use the deinterlace option . Usually Blend ( adaptive ) is the way to go . The theory is that you should n't get this problem with PAL video but you almost always do with video capture cards . With DVD 's you will only sometimes get this problem with the extras and not the main movie . <p> Inverse Telecine : Inverse Telecine is a method that changes an interlaced 29.97 frames per second movie back into its original framerate of 23.976 frames per second . This is no use for VCDs or even SVCD 's because the framerate must be either 29.97fps or 25fps . If you have problems with interlace artifacts you will be better off using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get right and a simple solution is beyond me ! <p> GOP Structure <p> GOP is short for ' Group Of Pictures ' . It sounds realy complicated but the idea is simple enough : I-frames are whole ' keyframes ' in other words whole picture is like a photo . B-Frames represent just bits of the picture that are different from the previous frames ( i.e. when there is a motion change ) . For an explanation of Keyframes and Delta check out my appendix on it Here . The I , P and B frames are arranged into GOPs that produce a good balance between good compression highest quality motion reproduction . <p> In short I think these settings should be left default for VCD 's to avoid any problems . A lot of research has gone into the best settings by the Mpeg orgainazation and the default settings are great for just about anything . <p> I frames only : Using this option turns the MPEG into a sort of MJPEG movie without any half frames , only full frames . This eliminates motion macroblocks almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of VCDs because its a constant bitrate , may actually make much worse quality ! The main reason people use I-Frame only is because they can cut and edit the video in VirtualDub or another video editing application frame by frame like they can with MJPEG . <p> I and P frames only : This is only really useful for custom very low birate movies . By skipping B frames you are able to produce video that is much smaller than normal MPEG files . The bad news is this will result in slighly jerky video that is not well suited for any kind of quality VCD and probably would n't be playable on a standalone VCD player . <p> Quantizer Matrixes <p> I 'm not sure exactly what settings are best for Quantizer Matrices . They are designed as filters to prepare certain types of video for compressing . Generally I 'd say stay with the defaults because they are tried and tested settings . Apart from being able to change the patten of each mpeg macroblock by setting different numbers in the table , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop-down menu . You may , for example , find that the CG gives better results on animated images and MPEG on real life movies or vice versa . <p> Looking a little lower we have the ' Special settings ' section . These again are for either special video types or for just increased or just different ' looks ' for the final movie by encoding in a certain way . <p> Use Floating Point DCT : This option will spend more time making sure that the mpeg video remains true to the original image . You must remember that these settings will servely slow down encoding and you may not notice much difference in quality - if you are a quality freak just use it . <p> Soften Block Noise : Since the Mpeg format compresses blurry images better than it does sharp images , it has a prefilter designed to soften the image without loosing too much sharpness . Again this is a matter of taste ; take a look and see the results . If you think the bluriness is not too much you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then keep it as normal . To increase the blur just increase the block noise numbers , 35 is a good setting anyway though . Intra blocks and non-intra blocks are basically the same as saying ' keyframes ' ( i.e. intra ) or ' non-keyframes ' . You may find that more softening on non-intra blocks produces better results in action scenes or vice-versa - experiment ! <p> Do not perform half-pel motion in still scenes : This option helps to get rid of slight macrolock-noise in non-action scenes where there is very little movement . This works quite well but can give the apperance of slightly unnaturel motion at certain points . Again I suggest you do some tests and see what you prefer , some notice it while others do not .

@@98121022 @2321022/ <p> Motion picture cameras are based on photographic film just like your everyday hand held photographic camera . Hollywood movies use 35mm film but professional camera men often use 16mm and the home enthusiast will usually be content with 8mm . To record a movie , motion picture film is spun around a big reel inside a camera and exposed 24 times a second . As a result it will capture 24 photographs , or what we call 24 " frames " every second ( fps ) . Each frame is one complete photograph , it is not digitally stored or compressed - you could almost literally cut each one out and stick it in your family photo album if you wanted ! Once the movie is made , the film is developed , placed onto a projector , and projected onto the cinema screen . <p> Resolution <p> In terms of resolution its not really possible to compare a 35mm film to a VHS or VGA resolution because , like any photographic film , its resolution is based on a myriad tiny light sensitive crystals embedded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour to match the light that has hit them producing a photo . But a 35mm film , based on average crystal size would be about 5000 x 5000 pixels . This is also the resolution Photoshop artists such as Craig Mullins use to create movie backdrops for the cinema . Nevertheless , the human eye can barely see the equivalent of 3000 x 3000 pixels of such a small area . So when a 35mm movie is scanned into a computer to try and get its full resolution for digital editing , it will be scanned in at 4096 horizontal pixels , also known as 4K . <p> Television <p> Television , on the other hand , is a whole other ball of wax ! As you probably know , a TV screen is basically a empty glass box ( or tube ) with all the air sucked out of it . Inside the front of this glass box it is covered with a mesh of red , green and blue phosphor dots . At the back of the tube it has three devices ( called electron guns ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots . When the electricity hits the dots they glow and a colour picture is produced . Increase the beam strength and you can brighten the amount of red , green or blue light produced at any part of the screen . This , in effect , allows the colours to mix into just about any colour and brightness imaginable . You might compare this to mixing coloured paints together to form new colours . Whatever way you look at it , this produces a colour picture that looks almost like real life . <p> Interlace <p> Next is the important point ! To produce a picture , these electric beam are controlled by electromagnets to scan from side to side across the TV screen ( as illustrated in the picture below ) . The beam fly across the screen in the same motion our eyes use when we are reading a book . They start from the left , finish one line and then shoot back to start the next line . <p> When TV 's were invented in the 1920s the type of phosphor used to produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to get a picture in one shot ; instead we would get a flickery strobing effect moving down the screen ! To solve this they decided that instead of putting the lines on the screen one at a time ( i.e. lines : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) they would put them on every other line in one pass ( i.e. 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) and then in-between the previous lines on the second pass ( i.e. lines : 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 etc . ) . This allowed a whole picture to be produced in two very fast scans and allowed enough time for the slow phosphor dots to recover . This , then , prevented any strobing effects from appearing - success ! This process is called interlacing ! <p> Resolution : Lines , Lines &amp; Lines <p> The biggest misundertanding when it comes to PC video enthusiasts is the idea of horizontal resolution . When we talk about PC monitor resolutions we are talking about pixel resolution . So a PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means 800 pixels ( dots ) going across horizontaly and 600 pixels going down vertically . <p> TV 's engineers , however , only speak about TV resolutions in terms of the number of lines going across not down ! Why ? Because all TV 's have exactly the same amount of lines going down , but not all TV 's have the same amount of decernable dots going across . For example , an American TV picture will always scan exactly 480 lines down , but the number of dots going across will always depend on the quality of the TV and the signal broadcast to it . A VHS video will only offer about 210 dots across while a TV station may offer about 330 dots across ! <p> TV engineers use a test patten to determine a TV 's resolution . This test pattern has lots of vertical lines like this : <p> The engineer increases the lines until it is impossible to see any lines because they have all blurred into each other . When the lines can not be seen any more the maximum resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stacked from left to right as seen in the picture above . Because the lines are stacked from left to right , the number of dicernable lines across on the TV screen is called the horizontal resolution ! So when we say a TV has 487 lines we mean it has a maximum resolution of 487 dots across . But to say a TV has 487 dots across is never correct scince it will always be less unless the signal quality is perfect . <p> Well , in actual fact to measure a TV 's resolution engineers do n't actually look at a grid and count the lines , otherwise we see a whole bunch of googlie eyed technicians with big thick glasses =o ) . In reality a test patten is put in front of a camera and the results are examined on a device called a waveform monitor . This monitor shows a graph representing the peeks and valleys of the image . If there are very high peeks and very low valleys then the resolution is higher and vice versa . <p> This waveform resolution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor that mathematicians call the kell . The kell factor basically describes how fuzzy the lines on a TV appear to the eye . Let 's say we have a TV with 487 lines of resolution . To determine its real resolution after taking such fuzziness into accound we 'd need to multiply that number by 0.7 so 0.7 x 487 = 340 lines of resolution . But again the calculations get more complex and confusing because engineers measure TV resolution assuming that the TV screen is perfectly square . But as we all know TV screens have an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 and are slightly oblong . So we need to take this factor into account also . So our TV with a resolution of 340 lines will now be 0.75 x 340 = 255 lines . <p> Again this resolution represents the full perfect resolution of the TV . If we take into account signal loss and low broadcast quality we are looking at something like 330 lines ! I believe this is why VHS quality Video CD 's use 352 lines of resolution since MPEG works best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To cut a long story short a TV screen is about twice as fuzzy as a PC screen , this means when we capture a TV picture onto a PC screen we only need half the resolution for the same quality ! So capturing a TV movie at a PC resolution of 640 x 480 is overkill . If you are recording from VHS the same quality should easily fit into a resolution as low as 384 x 288 or smaller ! <p> Note : Although the above statement is technically true most PC video capture cards can not capture quality small videos . In this case the video must me captured at the full capture card resolution ( perhaps 352 x 480 ( squished image ) and then resized to 384 x 288 ! See my video capture guide for more details on this . <p> Active &amp; non-active picture <p> An analog TV 's resolution refers to the number of horizontal lines displayed on the screen . This is broken up into the active and non-active areas . The non-active or blanked ( A ) area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically always ' blanked ' . The extra signal information that would have been put here is often used for closed captioning , synch info or other information such as VITC . But obviously the bit we are interested in is the active part which refers to where the actual picture will appear ( B ) . <p> NTSC <p> The TV industry is dominated by two main standards for TV design : PAL and NTSC . NTSC is one of my pet hates basically because of it 's rather low quality and use of weird framerates . NTSC stands for the National Television Systems Committee , it is the colour video standard used in North America , Canada , Mexico and Japan . Some engineers have said it should stand for Never Twice Same Color because no two NTSC pictures look alike : ) . Due to the electric system used in the US it was decided to scan the lines across the NTSC TV screen at about 60Hz ( or 60 half frames per second ) which produced 30 whole pictures every second . NTSC resolution is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem so bad , but divide a sheet of paper into six even parts and chop one off of the bottom and you will have a lot of detail lost . NTSC uses 525 horizontal lines of which only about 487 make up the active picture . <p> PAL <p> PAL stands for Phase Alternating Line , it is the TV standard used for Europe , Hong Kong and the Middle East . It was a new standard based on the old NTSC system but designed to correct the NTSC colour problems produced by phase errors in the transmission path . PAL resolution is 625 horizontal lines but only about 540 of these are used for the picture . PAL is higher quality than NTSC , it keeps a sharper picture and remains closer to the original format produced by motion picture cameras . Due to the European electric standards it was decided to interlace PAL lines every other line at 50Hz producing 25 whole frames every second . <p> TELECINE <p> This is the bit you 've all been dying to read . Unfortunately I have not written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is more to help you understand what is going on with your video so you can decide how you will process it better . <p> Just so you do n't get confused you should be clear on what the difference is between a frame and field . A ' field ' is basically every other scan line of a picture . Two fields stuck together makes a single frame on a TV set ! In the picture below only one field is displayed on the left . Its hard to see because only every other line is displayed . The picture on the right is a whole frame . It is produced when we stick both fields together . <p> THIS IS ONE FIELD <p> THIS IS TWO FIELDS <p> ( OR A HALF FRAME ) <p> ( OR A WHOLE FRAME ) <p> Single fields that start from line 1 of the TV screen are called ' odd ' because they go in odd numbers ( i.e. 1 , 3 , 5 etc . ) . Fields that start from the second line to fill the gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in even numbers ( i.e. 2 , 4 , 6 etc . ) . Fields that start from line 1 are more often also called " Top " fields because they start from the first " top " line on the screen . Whereas single fields that start from the second line down are called " Bottom " fields . Okay , now everything you read should make perfect sense = ) <p> TELECINE <p> As I have already mentioned , a motion picture camera captures its images at 24 frames every second . Each frame is a full image . An NTSC television , however , must play 30 frames per second , and these frames must be interlaced into two fields both top and bottom ! So basically what we are saying is we must play 60 half frames ( or fields ) every second . The only way we are going to be able to play a 24 fps motion picture on NTSC television is to change it from 24 fps to 30 fps and interlace these frames into two fields making 60 half frames per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a Telecine . A Telecine machine does something called pulldown , which , in its simplest explanation , " pulls down " an extra frame every fourth frame to make five whole frames instead of four ! <p> 3:2 Pulldown NTSC <p> 3:2 pulldown is a name that confuses people basically because the term " pulldown " is rather ambiguous - in other words , it 's not really pulling down anything ! The process sounds complex but its really quite straightforward and I have designed a picture to illustrate . The top row in the picture below represents four frames from a motion picture camera . These are full frames and not yet interlaced they are represented as A , B , C , D. <p> Now look at the second line in our picture below . The Telecine machine takes the first whole frame A and splits it into three fields ( stop reading and take a look now ) . For the first field it uses the top field ( T ) which means it takes lines 1 , 3 , 5 etc. , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the bottom field , so it will take lines 2 , 4 , 6 and so on . The third file we see labeled ( Tr ) is just a copy of the first field again ( so I labeled it T(r) to mean : top repeated ' ) . <p> Now the Telecine machine goes onto the next frame B. This time it just takes the top and bottom fields . Then we move on to the third frame C ; it splits it up into three fields , bottom ( B ) top ( T ) and a repeat of the bottom one again ( Br ) . Finally , the forth frame D is split into the top and bottom fields . That 's it , that is all a telecine machine does ! <p> So that is why it is called 3:2 pulldown , it goes in a sequence of 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 and so on . It can be said to " pull down " a whole frame and split it into three fields and two fields . Finally , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will start the process all over again with the next four pictures of the movie . <p> In short we end up with : <p> At Ab At / Bb Bt / Cb Ct CB / Dt Db <p> But because it always goes : top , bottom , top , bottom , top , bottom etc. , we would just say it without indicating top or bottom fields . So instead of the above we would describe it as : <p> AAA BB CCC DD <p> Whatever way you look at it in the end you end up with 5 whole frames instead of 4 . This turns a 24 fps movie into a 30 fps movie ! <p> Interlacing the picture back together <p> Let 's look at the picture again . Look at the third line down . Here we can see how these fields would be woven back together to produce a whole picture again , as we would see on a TV or computer screen . The top field of frame A is woven together with the bottom field of frame A. Then the repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom field of frame B. The top field of frame B is woven with the bottom of frame C. The top field of frame C is woven together with the top repeated field of frame C. And finally , the top field of frame D is woven together with the bottom field of frame D. <p> That 's quite a mouthful to explain in words but examine the picture , it should really explain itself . Since each frame is stuck together instead of describing telecine by saying it uses top , bottom , top , bottom in the order : <p> AAA BB CCC DD <p> We would say : <p> AA AB BC CC DD <p> The change is only how we group the letters of course and means nothing more . <p> A Weird Framerate <p> This is not quite the end of the saga . The old black and white TV 's used to play back at a perfectly round 30 fps . But as usual NTSC found a way to destroy that perfection ! With the introduction of color TV it was decided ( because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie must be played back at 29.970 fps ( 59.94Hz ) which is basically only 99.9% of its full speed . As a result NTSC movies still have the same amount of frames they did when they were telecined , but they are played back at a fractionally slower rate . <p> 2:2 Pulldown PAL <p> PAL movies also get telecined but not in the same way an NTSC movie does . A Telecine machine will use what is sometimes called 2:2 Pulldown ! This basically turns every frame into two fields so they can me played on a standard PAL television . This makes 25 frames into 50 field which when played on a TV set at 50Hz will produce 25 whole frames per second . So instead of going 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 it will go 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 ! This produces the fields : <p> At Ab / Bt Bb / Ct Cb / Dt Db <p> Or just : <p> AA BB CC DD <p> Again , a PAL movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no additional ones , but it will still play those frames back faster at 25 fps . In a way of speaking it is just as correct ( or wrong ) to say that a PAL movie is 24 fps because no frames have been added to it , they are just played back faster . <p> INVERSE TELECINE ( IVTC ) <p> I think I 'm correct in saying that there is no such thing as an Inverse Telecine machine : ) . But , as the name suggests , inverse telecine is a process that turns a 30 fps movie back into a 24 fps movie . Basically what it does is take out all those extra fields that were added to the movie to make it 30fps . Its about now that I start spluttering because this is an awkward subject and I ca n't find any information on exactly how Inverse Telecine is performed ! So instead I will describe what " looks " like should be done based on how it was telecined in the first place . <p> Let 's go back to our picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to turn the 24fps movie into 30fps we have to separated the pictures into 10 single fields ( or half frames ) by adding two fields that should n't normally be there . Counting from left to right , all we would need to do to turn or 10 fields back into 8 fields ( to turn 30 fps into 24fps ) is to delete fields 3 and 8 . Remember we are talking fields here not frames . <p> But taking out fields 3 and 8 would produce a movie that had a field order of : top , bottom , bottom , top , bottom , top , top , bottom ! Since you can not weave together two bottom fields or two top fields we would need to swap them around . So imagine the order of the numbers as : <p> If the only framerates we use are 24 , 25 and 29.97 then why to people speak of using 23.976 ? This is to do with how the movie has been created . A 25 fps movie still has the same amount of frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nevertheless a PAL television chooses to play them back at 25 fps . This makes the PAL movie play back at a slightly shorter length and means the audio will be out of synch slightly . To compensate for this , when a movie is telecined they apply to it what is called a ' pitch-correction ' which speeds up the audio to match the playback speed , in the case of PAL this means they perform a pitch correction of about 4% . <p> The amount of frames a 3:2 pulldown telecined movie has is 30 fps . But an NTSC television will play them back slower at 29.970 fps ( 59.94Hz ) . The amount of actual frames has n't changed , none have been added or taken out ! Here is where the 23.976 part comes in ! If we inverse telecine a 30 fps movie we would end up with 24 fps . But if we inverse telecined a 29.970 fps movie , because it has a slightly slower speed , instead of getting 24 fps as we should , we will end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROBLEMS WITH INTERLACED MOVIES <p> Interlaced movies look fine on a standard TV but they appear terrible on a PC monitor ! ? Let 's take a look at our example one last time to see why . Look at the last row where it shows how the top field of frame B is interlaced together with the bottom field of frame C. <p> We are getting the top and bottom fields from two completely different frames ! ! Imagine taking half of one picture and half of the next and trying to put them together into a single picture , its impossible ! On a PC this produces what we see below . Here we have Star Treks William Riker walking across the room from left to right . Notice that the top field from the previous frame shows him a little to the left and the bottom field of the next frame shows him a little to the right . This is what produces this combing effect and no amount of shifting the lines to the left or the right will fix it ! <p> Inverse Telecine Troubles <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulldown movie can also be encoded as 2:3 which produces exactly the same result but is done backwards - instead of getting 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 we will get 2 , 3 , 2 , 3 ! But this does n't matter because since a 3:2 pulldown movie can be cut and edited after it is made the very first frame does n't always start with the top of field of A anyway ! It could , for example , start with the next one across - the bottom field of A. In fact , it could start with absolutely any of the 10 fields in the sequence ! <p> Hence as far as I can see there must be at least 10 ways to perform inverse telecine . Five assuming the first field is top and five assuming the first field is bottom . It is possible to determine all sequances using such programs as AVISynth and then perform IVTC that way . The AVISynth instructions explain basically how this is done . <p> Adaptive IVTC <p> When videos have been captured on a PC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD extras , the field order can get switched . Since we do not know where it switches we need to have an adaptive IVTC filter that will compensate and guess how to stick the fields together correctly . For doing this I believe VirtualDubs Telecide filter seems to do the best job I 've seen so far . <p> OTHER ISSUES <p> Some of the specials and extra features of a DVD seem to have been recorded from a telecined 29.970 fps source ! This means that the interlaced picture is actually edited as an interlaced picture on a computer and then reinterlaced again ! There is absolutely no way to fix such a problem because the lines are literally a part of the original picture now . For example , I have taken this frame from the trailer of one DVD and separated the fields into two . When I squash all the lines together from one single field I get the following picture : <p> Of course , I could be completely mistaken about this , but that is what appears to be the case . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuners and Video Capture hardware we use to record video to the PC will not perform any kind of IVTC . Neither do they seem to give a standard order in which they whack the TV fields together . Determining the IVTC is a matter of trying all 10 combinations until the correct one is found . This field order problem applies regardless of if you use PAL or NTSC , if you want to capture any video footage at above 240 pixels high ( for NTSC , PAL is 288 ) you will get at least some interlace problems that need solving ! When you are capturing below 240 pixels some capture card will only use one field and hence interlace problems will be almost impossible , but this is not always the case . Usually a normal IVTC can be performed on any video cature card , all you need to know is what field order it starts with . <p> Deinterlace filters <p> Since to perform inverse telecine ( IVTC ) to make a 30 fps movie back into a 24 fps movie is so awkward there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just about any movie . There are only two types of deinterlacer that I know : <p> Bobbing:To Bob basically means to enlarge each field into its own frame by interpolating between the lines . So from one field we are producing a full frame . Because the top fields are a line higher than the bottom the image may appear to " bob " but this is usually fixed by nudging the while frame up or down a pixel . You are only really getting half the resolution with bob but the interpolation is usually very good quality . If you are stuck for a way to bob your video my AVISynth guide offers a bob feature , check it out Here . <p> Blending:Flask Mpeg 's &amp; VirtualDubs basic deinterlace filter look for the parts of a picture where the two fields do not match and blends the combing effect together . The lower the threshold the more the two parts are blended and the less of a combing effect appears . The problem with this method is that the final picture can quite often end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DVD &amp; TELECINE <p> DVD 's offer a strange twist to the whole Telecine and 3:2 pulldown business . Almost all DVD 's will have the movie stored as whole pictures at 24 fps . This is the original format of the film with no Telecine . At the start of every Mpeg-2 DVD file there are certain header codes that tell it how to play back the DVD . Since it is stored digitally it can give the fields or frames from the DVD and to the hardware or software in any order it likes . It can split the movie into two fields and perform telecine instantly . To do this has three flags that can be applied to the header code : RFF ( repeat first field ) TFF ( top field first ) and FPS ( frames per second ) . <p> For a PAL DVD the FPS flag can be set to 25 and the DVD will send the picture information to the hardware at 25 fps instead of 24 fps as is stored on the DVD . <p> For NTSC DVD 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag is set to 29.970 . But this looks odd because the movie is over far too soon . Imagine it like playing cards , if you throw 4 cards on the floor every second the whole pack will be finished in half the time than if you threw 2 cards onto the floor . The solution is to telecine the movie with 3:2 pulldown to increase the amount of " cards " we have to start with . To do this it uses the RFF and TFF flags are set in the header code . By setting the DVD to Repeat the First Field again you make the video display the fields in the order 3 , 2 , 3 , 2 . By setting the TFF flag you set the DVD to start from the top field so the order always goes : top , bottom , top , bottom . <p> Theoretically then , it should be possible to patch the header code of a DVD 's Mpeg-2 file and make it play back at 24 fps instead of the 29.970 fps ! In fact some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interlaced together ! <p> I do n't think I have mentioned what a progressive image is yet ? A progressive image is a whole frame that it is not interlaced . Motion picture camera 's capture images that are progressive . They are not telecined or split into separate fields . Computer monitors do not need to interlace to show the picture on the screen like a TV does it puts them on one line at a time in perfect order i.e. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 etc . <p> Many DVD 's are encoded as progressive pictures , with interlaced field-encoded macroblocks used only when needed for motion . Flask Mpeg tries to take advantage of this fact , because if you set it to 24 fps ( or 23.976 ) it will give the option to reconstruct progressive images . This does not perform any deinterlacing on the video but ignore all the flags and just reads the DVD one progressive image at a time . <p> This is another confusing issue for me . I have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by the fact that a progressive movie can be played back as interlaced due to control flags . If I learn any more about this I will update my articles accordingly . <p> VHS , VCD &amp; DVD <p> To finish , perhaps it would be nice to say a few words about the video formats too . It was n't long after TV that VHS video recorders appeared on the scene and a yet a while latter when the Video CD-Rom 's did . Of course , there were other video formats , but VHS ( Vertical Helical Scan ) and MPEG ( Moving Picture Experts Group ) won the battle , at least as far as home video was concerned . This is a little strange really because Sony 's Betamax video was probably the better quality ! Anyway , all video formats to date have required one form of compression or another to be able to record the huge quantities of information needed to store full motion video . <p> VHS <p> VHS video is stored just like audio on a reel of plastic tape impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of an electromagnet that replicates the strength of the TV 's electric beam as they would appear scan across the screen . This caused magnetic ' kinks ' in the iron parts of the tape that are almost identical to the original TV signal . A reversal of this storage process would produce the image back on the TV screen . The signal is simplified before it reached the tape therefore making it take up less space . <p> As anyone who has ever used video tape knows it soon looses quality . It appears grainy , looses colour accuracy and starts to produce white glitches and audio waver - a better solution was needed . <p> MPEG-1 <p> As computer technology advanced CD-Rom video formats became popular and the Moving Picture Experts Group designed a compression format that could store over an hour of VHS quality video on a single CD-ROM This soon become very popular in the east but never truly caught on anywhere else . This was due to the fact that recording it was difficult and slow and the quality was not really any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mpeg-1 video was that it was almost impossible for it to loose picture quality like a VHS videotape ! It could last perhaps over 100 years of use without any noticeable degradation of image quality ! <p> MPEG-2 <p> Since ( at the right bitrate ) Mpeg-1 was able to produce TV quality pictures superior to VHS , the Mpeg organization decided to design another version that allowed Mpeg-1 back with interlaced images so it could be used for TV broadcasts . This format was called Mpeg-2 . Other features were added to Mpeg-2 to make it compress slightly better and higher quality , but the main difference was the addition of interlace support . <p> Since Mpeg-1 VideoCD 's showed that a CD based digital video was not only a viable option , but also a very preferable that is one if the storage space was enough . When CD-ROM designs were upgraded to be able to store 4.38 gigabyte or more of information , it was decided that these new CD 's would be the new storage media for video . It was called DVD to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital Versatile Disc because it was ' versatile ' enough to hold other data besides video . <p> Resolutions <p> Resolutions are an important issue for amateur video enthusiasts who want to capture their video at full TV quality . Professional video editors are told to capture at 640 x 480 pixels for highest quality . But a PAL TV resolution is 576 lines down . Then we have the Mpeg group saying that 352 x 288 is the full VHS video resolution ! The problem seems to lie in the fact that its hard to equate a TV resolution with a computer image . The TV is built up of lines but the dot definition is rather " fuzzy " looking . So rather than me rattling on about the pro 's ' n ' cons again I will merely end this article by quoting what the Ligos corporation ( the creators of the LSX Mpeg-2 encoder ) say in regard to this subject : <p> " The resolution of computer video , however , does n't generally equate to the video world of televisions , VCRs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally focused on the horizontal resolution ( the number of scan lines from top-to-bottom that make up the picture ) . Here are some numbers for comparison : <p> Video Format <p> Horizontal Resolution <p> Standard VHS <p> 210 Horizontal Lines <p> Hi8 <p> 400 Horizontal Lines <p> Laserdisc <p> 425 Horizontal Lines <p> DV <p> 500 Horizontal Lines <p> DVD <p> 540 Horizontal Lines <p> With these numbers in mind , it is important to remember this rule when bringing the worlds of computer and video together : the quality of an image will never be better than the quality of the original source material . <p> We suggest capturing at a resolution that most closely matches the resolution of the video source . For video sources from VHS , Hi8 , or Laserdisc , SIF resolution of 352x240 will give good results . For better sources such as a direct broadcast feed , DV , or DVD video , Half D1 resolution of 352x480 is fine . There are other advantages to following these guidelines . Your files will be smaller , consuming less space on the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll also be able to encode more quickly " .

@@98121025 @2321025/ <p> As I 'm sure you are starting to realize , VirtualDub is one of the easiest to use and yet most useful video editing tools you will ever find . But I still get quite a lot of emails asking how you can crop and resize video files , reduce noise , add logo 's or other cool effects with it . This is what this article is about . VirtualDub can do all these things and much , much more ! There is no need to explain in detail absolutely everything it can do , because once you 've read through this guide you will get the idea and be able to apply that knowledge to everything you want to do . <p> Video Editing Formats <p> If you are going to edit and/or compress a video using VirtualDub or any video editing package then the better the original video the better the final result will be . If you are capturing from a TV Tuner or Video capture card use the highest settings you can without going overboard . For example , there is probably no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are going to resize it to 352 x 240 anyway because not only will this take a lot of time to do but it will take twice the hard drive space too . Whenever possible you should capture with CD quality audio ( 16 bit 44100Hz ) and at the TV standard framerate ( 25fps for PAL TV and 29.97fps NTSC ) . Usually capturing to MJPEG will produce the best results and will be the easiest format to edit . For more details on video capture check out my capture guide Here . <p> Compressing a Compressed File <p> Why not just compress straight to Mpeg or DivX I hear you cry ! ? Well , you can , but do n't forget that if you are going to resize or apply any filters to a video file it must be recompressed again ! This is not VirtualDub 's fault , every existing video editing package is the same ! For example , its no good compressing a DVD video into DivX and then opening it up to resize it or crop it because to resave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you can imagine if the video is long then this could take a long time . And since all formats I know ( except Huffyuv and uncompressed AVI ) compress by discarding fine details , each time you recompress the video some quality will be lost ! As you can see , it makes sense to make sure that the initial file as good as we can get it . <p> Up pops a list of all the filters that can be applied to a video file . Choose the one called : Null Transform . <p> Yes , I know , a weird name that ' null transform ' is n't it . But press OK and we 're back to this box . Press the Cropping ... button ( B ) <p> Up pops the cropping box ( below ) . Use the slider bar and frame movement buttons to find a good part in the video where you can see clearly where you need to crop . Then change the numbers any of the four number boxes X1 , X2 , Y1 or Y2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . Simply increase or decrease the amount needed and you will see it crop before your eyes : ) <p> When you are done press OK . <p> That 's it ! When you resave the video in VirtualDub the newly saved video will be cropped . But do n't forget that you need to recompress again when you save it or it wo n't work . Cropping is especially useful for getting rid of any hum-bars from the edges of the screen that usually appear with TV Tuner captures . <p> Resizing is just as easy , go to : File &gt; Filters <p> This time press Add ... and select the resize filter . <p> Up will pop this box . Just type in the new width and the new height . Then select Precise bicubic from the filter mode . Bilinear is best for shrinking images and bicubic is best for enlarging . Nearest neighbour is the fastest but gives lowest quality for everything but simple shapes . <p> You can choose the show preview button too to see how it looks . It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video into Divx ( or in fact many other formats ) , your final movie sizes should be multiples of 16 pixels ! Sometimes they only need to be multiples of 8 pixels and sometimes ( very rarely ) they need to be multiples of 32 pixels . As an example , a 352 x 288 video will compress into Divx without problems , but a 351 x 288 will not ! <p> Filter Order <p> VirtualDub filters are executed in a specific order . The one at the very top will be executed first and the one at the bottom of the list will be executed last . <p> It may not seem to matter what order they effect the video , but it is an important point . Let 's say , for example , you wanted to resize a video from 704 x 576 to 352 x 288 , but you also wanted to apply filters to sharpen the image . If you put the sharpen filter first in the list it would take twice as long to convert when you tried to save it ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture twice the size . It would be far quicker to sharpen the image after it had been resized smaller . Because of this , VirtualDub has two buttons called ' Move up ' and ' Move down ' that allow us to move the order of the filters up and down . <p> PROCESSING IT <p> When you are finished all the filters will be applied to the video file you save . Now you must choose the final format you want the video to be . You can , of course , use any video format VirtualDub offers , but just to illustrate , if you wanted to make it to Divx this is how you 'd do it . <p> Then up pops the codec options . Use one of the bitrate calculators that can be downloaded from Digital Digest to make sure the movie will fit into the size you need . 650kbps will usually fit any movie on a single CD , but you can usually get away with between 900 and 1000kbps for a 352 x 240 VCD movie for better quality see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 
@@98121027 @2321027/ <p> There are two major problems with audio either it is stretched or displaced . This can be illustrated thusly : <p> When the synch is perfect both the audio and video will match , as seen in the first image above . Video frame1 matches to Audio frame 1 as does frames 2 , 3 and so on . In the second picture it shows the audio as displaced , which means that both audio and video are correct length , but either the video or audio will start at different times causing displacement . In the third sinerio we have an audio and video sequence that are different lengths because one of them has become stretched somehow . <p> To fix these problems you must check out the film very carefully . If the audio is equally out of synch at the start of the movie as it is the end of the film , then you have an Audio Displacement problem ( see Fixing Audio Displacement below ) . If the audio is very close to correct at the beginning of the movie , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vise versa ) you probably have a Stretched Video problem ( see Fixing Stretched Audio below ) . It is possible to have both problems of course ; -P . So if you are sure you have both I suggest you fix the Audio Displacement at the very start of the film first and then fix the Stretched Video problem once you know somewhere in the film is absolutely correct ! <p> Stretched audio is the most common reason a video will be out of synch with a video . Luckly the first release of the Terabit AVI Info tool is now ready : ) . Designed by yours truly and programmed by my own brother - all credit goes to him , though , for all his hard work . Terabits AVI Info tool is designed to make manual synching much easier and also to make easy some of those little things you 'd like to do but do not know how . I will explain these other features at the end of this synching article though , so we can stay on track . <p> Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up of your original AVI file in case something goes wrong . Once installed you do not run AVI Info like most programs , it is more like an extension to Windows . Just find the AVI file you wish to synch and right-click with the mouse . Up will pop an option saying AVI Information - select that . <p> Note : For Windows ME or 2000 users the right-click option currently does not work . As a temporary work around for this you can use the Launcher.exe application bundled with this download to open your AVI files . <p> Alternatively , you can use this replacement clickme.reg file to try and solve this problem under Windows ME or 2000 . Special thanks to Jimbo for submitting this tip . <p> Then the following box will appear . It is a convenient way of finding out all those little bits of information that neither Windows Media Player nor VirtualDub are tell us about our AVI files . <p> Click on the Synchronize Audio tab and we get a preview of the video we want to correct , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synching . <p> Examine your movie carefully using the AVI Player . Preferably very close to the end of the movie to better see how far the audio is out . And also be sure to find a section where their mouths are large enough to see clearly . Locate the frame number of a part just before they are going to speak and put it in the ' From ' box below ( 1 ) . Then take note of the frame number from after they stop talking and enter that into the ' To ' box ( 1 ) . Great , now the movie will loop between these two ponts . This make life much easier because feedback is instant and we do not need to keep opening the file , finding the right place , guessing how much it is out , changing it , and then starting all over again like we need to do with all other synching methods ! Oh , by the way you have to press the apply button or it wont start looping : ) . <p> Take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it comes after their mouths move . <p> 1 . If the audio comes after they speak we must decrease the frame rate a little ! <p> 2 . If the audio comes before they speak we must increase the frame rate a little ! <p> It does n't sound logical at first , so just to clarify : to make the video longer we decrease the framerate . To make the video shorter we increase the framerate . Imagine it like this : if you had a pack of cards and threw 5 cards onto the floor every second , it would take longer for you to finish the pack of cards than it would if you were to throw 10 cards onto the floor every second . In the same way , a movie will finish earlier if it shows more frames per second . This means a higher framerate makes a shorter movie . <p> Now the synching is quite straight forward . Play your movie , if the audio comes after the mouth moves hit the -0.001 button ( 4 ) once , and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the -0.001 button again , and again , and again etc. , until it is almost perfect . Then use the fine tuning arrows ( 2 ) to get the final perfect audio . Conversly , if the audio comes before the mouth moves we must use the +0.001 button in the same way as already described . <p> If you want to make really huge changes you can use the slider bar ( 2 ) or the increase by a whole frame per second with the +1 and -1 Frame buttons ( 3 ) . There is also the option to enter any framerate you like with the ' Enter Desired Frame Rate ' option . <p> But usually we will only change the framerate by avery small amount ! I usually only use 0.001 . So if my movie was 25.000 fps and I wanted to make it shorter I would change the framerate to 25.001 . If that was too long I 'd go to 25.002 then 25.003 and so on . If you want to make the movie longer I would try 24.998 then 24.997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use even smaller amounts such as 0.0001 . So imagine 25.007 is the almost perfect , but just needed slightly more . I would try 25.0071 or something like that . It should n't take long for you to become an expert . <p> If you think you are totally out you can reset any section back to how it originally was by using the ' reset ' button . <p> To apply it or not to apply it , that is the question ? <p> Whether it be nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous framerates or not . If we apply it now , the movie will play correctly in Media Player and , in fact , on all PC players . But what if we were synching our AVI file not because it was a DivX movie but because we wanted to convert the AVI to Mpeg or SVCD etc ? It is unlikely that the VCD we created would be in synch ! This is because all VCD , SVCD and DVD files must be exactly 25 or 29.970 fps to play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framerate such as 25.998 will not work ! <p> Other synching tools offer to change the audio samplerate instead . Changing the audio samplerate may be able to put the movie in synch just as effectively as changing the framerate . But again this causes conversion problems . A VCD , DVD or SVCD will only take 44100Hz or 48000Hz respectively . Feeding an encoder 11025Hz will almost always end up with synch problems ! <p> For this problem Terabits AVI Info tool is the only utility so far that can offer a solution . Notice that , as you change the framerate to get the movie in synch , it offers a streach ( stretch ) amount ( 5 ) . <p> So we use the framerate controls as usual to get the movie in synch but this time wedo n't save the framerate changes ! Instead write down ( or copy and paste ) the ' streach ' number exactly . Now we will use this number to stretch the audio in Cool Edit . But before we do that we must extract the audio . <p> Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the wave , enter a name for your extracted wave file , and hit the ' Extract Audio To Wave File ' button . Alternatively you can use VirtualDub to extract the Wave , but I see no need because this is basically the same thing . <p> Paste the stretch amount into the ratio box ( encircled in red ) . I suggest you use ' Low Precision ' option unless you wish to spend many more hours stretching the audio . <p> Note : The ' High Precision ' uses interpolation to keep the audio higher quality , but after we have recompressed it , it will not make any audiable difference so choosing higher quality will probably just waste time . <p> Cool Edit 2000 automatically converts the audio to PCM Wave for editing . So be careful because this takes over a gigabyte of space ! If your are using another audio editing program then you may have to convert the wave to PCM first . Using Winamp is probably the easiest way so check out my ' Converting Audio ' section for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the most reliable method now is to save our newly stretched audio as PCM Wave and multiplex it back to our video file . Go to my Multiplexing section for details on this . <p> PART 2 : Fixing Audio Displacement <p> Open your video in ( you guessed it ) VirtualDub . Choose a piece of the movie where people are talking . Their mouths should be clear so you can see easily when the synch is correct or not . <p> Go to Audio &gt; Interleaving <p> Up pops the box below . Leave everything as it is except the ' Delay audio track by ' part . Look at the movie and see if the sound comes before or after the video . If the sound becomes before they speak we will use normal numbers to slide the audio forward . If the audio comes after they speak we will use minus numbers ( - ) to slide the audio backwards . <p> 1000 represents one second of time , 500 represents half a second , 250 represents a quarter of a second etc . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To solve this we must slide the audio to the left a bit . So we can put in minus 250 ( ie. -250 ) . Press OK and play the movie in VirtualDub . Is it correct ? If not , does the sound come before the person speaks or after ? Let 's say it is much closer but still comes after the persons mouth moves , we could try increasing the delay by putting in -300 . Press OK and check the movie again . Keep doing this until the audio slides into the perfect place ! <p> Now let 's assume the persons mouth moves and then the audio comes after they speak . We do exactly the same thing except we no longer use the minus sign ( - ) . So we start off small with 250 and press OK to see the results . Then , if its not right , try some more like 300 then 400 or 500 etc .

You already know how to extract a wave from an AVI with it and how to use its synching functions . <p> Delay Audio <p> We have put in a delay audio function ( 6 ) but it is only partially working so use it at your own risk . It can only delay the audio 's start time and will not slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest you use VirtualDub for audio displacement problems . <p> Change FourCC codes <p> If we go back to the ' Utilities tab ' we are given the option to change the Header code of the AVI file ( A ) . As you probably realise Windows knows what codec to decode the AVI with by its FourCC codes . <p> If , for example we wanted to join a High Motion DivX movie clip with a Low Motion DivX movie clip , it would be possible to do this ( provided they were the same resolution ) by changing one of them to the FourCC code of the other !

@@98121040 @2321040/ <h> Article Category : <h> Page 1 of 2 : Introduction + Installation and Configuration <p> The PS3 is an excellent media hub , playing all sorts of video formats , either off the console of streamed from your PC . But one of the things it does n't handle too well is subtitles support , especially for AVI files . With some other media players , all you need to do is to put the SRT or other subtitle file in the same folder as the video file , usually with the same filename , and the subtitle will automatically be loaded . But this wo n't work on the PS3 . <p> But thanks to a timely firmware release , firmware 2.20 to be precise , you can now add subtitles to your AVI files without having to re-encode your AVI . And these subtitles files are n't hard-coded , meaning they can be turned off in the same way you turn on/off DVD subtitles on the PS3 - and a single AVI file can support multiple subtitles . As SRT files seem to be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files . <p> Best of all , you can do all of this using a single freeware tool called AVIAddXSubs . <h> Step 1 : Installation and Configuration <p> Before you start adding subtitles to your AVI file , please first make sure the AVI file plays on your PS3 . This method only works on AVI files that work natively on the PS3 ( that is , if you copied the file over to your PS3 , it will play ) . It does not work on AVI files that only plays through a live transcoder like TVersity ( that is , if the AVI file contains a video stream that is n't DivX/XviD and PS3 compatible , then this method wo n't work ) . After you add subtitles using AVIAddXSubs , then the file will still be playable in the same way as before ( by either copying it straight to the PS3 or played via USB/external HDD , or streamed via TVersity and other streaming tools ) . Also , I 've assumed that you 've already got your subtitle file , if not , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SRT and idx/sub subtitle files . <p> Download the AVIAddXSubs ZIP package . Extract the contents to a new folder ( for example , C : Program FilesAVIAddXSubs ) . Click on the AVIAddXSubs.exe executable to start AVIAddXSubs and that 's all there is to it , installation wise . <p> We will now configure AVIAddXSubs . Click on the " Configuration 2 " tab in AVIAddXSubs . Let 's go through each of the options . <p> Unpack packed bitstream : This has nothing to do with subtitles , but enable this option gives you more compatible AVI files <p> Use . avi for output file(s) if possible : Without this option , AVIAddXSubs will convert your AVI files to . divx files , which still play on the PS3 . On the other hand , and this is what I prefer , I can enable this option so that AVI files are kept as AVI files . The only thing you have to make absolutely sure is that the output folder is different to the input folder , otherwise you run the risk of a failed process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're confident that you wo n't need the original AVI file anymore ( not recommended ) <p> Move srt to output directory : This option when enabled copies the original input SRT file to the same folder as the output file , but this is n't necessary at all unless you want to keep a copy of the original SRT file <p> Do not copy avi when no XSUB : This option skips copying the original AVI file if you did not add any XSUB subtitles to the file <p> Do not convert idx/sub in XSUB : Use this option if you do n't want the idx/sub subtitles to be converted and added to the AVI file <p> YUV values at idx/sub color palette : This enables the use of YUV color palettes for idx/sub subtitles <p> Start at once : This starts subtitle processing the second you add in AVI files . Otherwise , you 'll have to press the " Start " button to start the process <p> Subtitle Time : <p> Time Shift By : This adds ( or removes ) X milliseconds from the start time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your video and subtitles do n't match at the beginning . The number here is in milliseconds , so if you want to delay the showing of the subtitles for 12 seconds , you need to put " 12000 " in this box . On the other hand , if you want the subtitles to show up 12 seconds earlier , then you type in " -12000 " <p> Increase Duration By : This increases the duration between lines of subtitles , but this only works if your video and subtitles are gradually going out of synch ( for example , if your video was 23.976 FPS , while your subtitles are for the PAL 25 FPS version of the movie ) <p> Mark DivX as : This changes the FourCC tag of the AVI file , which some players use to identify what kind of file it is .

@@98121041 @2321041/ <p> This effect was made famous by the movie The Exorcist . It rotates the whole head a full 360 degree turn ! This effect is easier to do than it looks and builds on your previous knowledge of editing pictures in the Adobe Photoshop Filmstrip format . To save me time this tutorial assumes you have already read through the star wars light saber guide found Here . <p> The first step , as always , is capturing your subject . In my case I asked Tony to stand facing the camera and then to keep as straight as possible whilst turning his whole body a full turn until he faced the camera again . There is no need to take more than one shot since all the footage we need is here . <p> You may find that its hard to turn smoothly so another way to get the shot is to sit your subject on a swivel office chair so they can be turned very smoothly in a circle . <p> The background <p> The first step is to get a shot of your subject just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need an uncompressed AVI or best quality MJPEG to work with . Open your video clip in VirtualDub and select and resave just two frames ! Select the mark in frame , move using the frame by frame buttons and then select the mark out button . Now you can use direct stream copy and Save AVI . My VirtualDub guide explains how you 'd do this in more detail so if you have problems check that out Here . <p> Now you must open these two frames in Adobe Premiere and resave them here is how to do it again . Open Adobe Premiere and right-click your mouse button inside the Project Window . Up will pop a bunch of options ( as in the picture below ) , choose : Import &gt; File . And choose your first video clip . <p> Next we drag our video clip into the timeline window as shown below : <p> Once that is done you can save your video as a Filmstrip by going to : File &gt; Export Timeline &gt; Movie ... <p> Up will pop the browser box asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not want to save it as an AVI file we must press the settings ... button encircled in red below : <p> Up will pop the following dialog box . Choose Filmstrip from the drop down menu and then press OK . <p> That 's it ! You can now save your video as a Filmstrip that is able to be opened in Adobe Photoshop ! Once done just close Adobe Premiere . <p> Editing the background <p> So why did we just convert two frames of Tony standing facing the camera ? Surely we want to convert all the frames , right ? ! Wrong ! For this effect to work we need to get rid of the original head . To do this we must photo-retouch the original head out leaving nothing but the wall . It would take ages and ages and ages to do that to every single frame . So instead we are going to delete the head from just two frames and create a background movie that repeats these two frames over and over again . Technically we could create a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a video such as this it would look odd . The reason repeating just one singe frame would look odd is because even a clear camera picture has some slight changes in noise that must be reproduced for the audience to believe it is the same shot . <p> Note : We could also do this head deleting magic using " blue screening " traveling matte techniques ( which I will explain in another article ) but since there is so much noise in this video , blue screening like this is an even greater task and requires extra equipment and planning ! <p> So open your two frames in Adobe Photoshop and let 's get to work . Were gon na keep it simple . Select the clone tool ( encircled in red below ) . Now choose a hard brush shape and a high opacity setting of about 90% ! If you are a novice to Adobe Photoshop my starters guide should give you enough info to get going so check that out Here . <p> To delete the head hold down the Alt key and Left-Click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area you wish to clone from . Now let go of the Alt key and use the mouse to draw over the head ( as you can see in the above illustration ) . Paint in a horizontal left and right manner rather than up and down since most cameras have noise in the horizontal position and it will also match the colour level beside the head better this way . <p> You do n't need to delete the whole head , just get rid of the hair at the top and some of the sides of the face so what is left of the head is about the same thickness as the neck , do n't forget we are sticking a head over the top so we will not need to spend time making it perfect . <p> Once you are done save the Filmstrip and reconvert it back to an AVI file again in Adobe Premiere . Check out my light saber guide again if you are having trouble remembering how to do this ( found Here ) . <p> Repeating the background <p> Now we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it as long as the clip I have done . So load VirtualDub and open this two frame clip once by going to File &gt; Open Video File ... Then open the same file again by choosing File &gt; Append AVI segment ... Notice that the video is now four frames long instead of two ? ! So do it again and again until you have a video as long as you want it ! Obviously if you have hundreds and hundreds of frames then this is impractical . So what you 'd do in this case is open the same video until you had about 20 frames , then re-save these 20 frames as an avi file . Then you can open these 20 frames over and over until you have 20 , 40 , 60 and so on . I 'm sure you get the idea . Once you have your background completed save it . <p> We will need to edit this new long background clip in Adobe Photoshop again so convert it back to a filmstrip in Adobe Premiere just like we did before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our original movie of Tony turning around on the spot . You must convert this to a Filmstrip file so it can be edited in Adobe Photoshop . <p> So just to recap you now have two video clips converted to Filmstrip files ( *. flm ) . <p> 1 . The background file without the head . <p> 2 . The original video of your subject turning around . <p> Open them both at the same time in Adobe Photoshop . Now all we do is copy each head from the original clip as it turns and paste it over the background we created for it , as shown in the example below : <p> To do this task I suggest you use the polygon selection tool ( encircled in red above ) . I strongly suggest you make sure the anti-alias box is checked to make the pasting smooth , for close ups you may wish to add some feathering too . <p> Every time you paste a face in Adobe Photoshop it adds it as a new Layer . This layer can be seen in the layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases but when you are positioning lots of heads at once you will soon be cursing Photoshop . The easiest way around this is to merge the layers together every so many heads . So click on the little ' eye icon ' beside the background layer ( as seen in our picture above ) . When you click on this eye icon the background will disappear . Clicking on it again will make it reappear . So first make it disappear . and then hold down Ctrl+Shift+E ( or go to File &gt; Merge visible ) . This will merge all the heads into a single layer . Once they are merged just click the background eye icon once more to see the body again ! <p> It is hard to teach all the Photoshop skills needed in such a small article as this , so I will have to assume you know how to use it . Do n't forget that the merged heads can still be repositioned separately while on the same layer , you just need to select each head ( with a square marquee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far top-right of the tools palette . Please do n't merge the background layer with the heads layer until we are totally finished . <p> Final Retouching <p> Even after you have finished cutting and pasting the heads over the body you are not quite done . You will find that there are still some parts of the neck and head that do n't quite match up perfectly . I suggest you touch these up frame by frame by hand . This need not take a long time , just a few strokes over each fame is usually enough ! In clear detailed pictures you will need to use the clone tool to do this effectively , but since my video is small I have decided to just use the quick and dirty method , namely , using the Smudge Tool ! <p> If you take a look at the example picture above there is a line where the neck of the head touches the neck of the body below it . In my video I simply set the smudge tool ( encircled in red ) to blend the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole picture when you are done to help delete any of that super smooth effect you sometimes get with smudging . This will seal the deal and fool the eye into thinking that the neck is truly attached to the head . <p> Putting it all together <p> Once you are done save your final Filmstrip and reconvert it to a normal AVI file using Adobe Premiere . To make it completely realistic I have used VirtualDub to join the first part of the video ( my cousin Tony smiling ) onto the part I created with the head spinning . This greatly adds to the effect because its starts with a normal video clip and then suddenly turns into something superhuman ! <p> I also did a version where Tony had glowing green eyes . These eyes were done using the exact same method I already explained in my light saber article . Namely , I added a single green dot over the eyes of each frame and used Photoshops effect options to make them glow ! <p> That 's it really !

@@98121042 @2321042/ <p> Uncompressed audio quality is usually dependent on the samplerate and bit depth that it was sampled with . Let 's me first explain what these are : <p> Samplerate <p> When you record sound into the PC it is broken up into a series of slices . These can be likened to the framerate of a video file , each moment in time is frozen and the information about it is recorded . In the same way , each audio slice represents a number that defines how high or low the audio is at that moment in time . These slices are called samples and the number of samples per second is measured in Hertz ( Hz ) . <p> Bit Depth <p> A ' Bit ' is a standard storage size used by your computer just like kilobytes and megabytes , it is actually the smallest unit of storage . Each bit can define itself as on or off ( 1 or 0 ) . Eight bits make a byte , 1024 bytes make a kilobyte ( 1K ) and 1024K make a megabyte ( 1 MB ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Samplerate is how many " frames " the audio has , then the bit depth is how large the frames are , the resolution or the amount of memory allocated to each frame . The large the bit depth the more possible amplitudes each audio ' slice ' can have . Eight bit audio uses 256 amplitudes , 16-bit allows 65536 and 24-bit can have 16 Million ! <p> Flask Mpeg and Samplerates <p> Firstly , it means that the higher the samplerate and the higher the bit depth the higher the quality audio you will get . It also means it will take much more storage space too ! 44100Hz 16-Bit represents CD quality audio and 48000Hz is actually even higher than CD quality . This means to get the best quality audio you should also aim for the highest samplerate and bit depth your sound card can handle . But more seriously the analogy to framerate and samplerate is almost perfect because just as a higher framerate will produce a smaller video length a higher samplerate will produce a smaller audio length ! ! <p> I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 44100Hz or at 48000Hz its should still last an hour ! And in fact it usually does because it was recorded that way . But when you start converting samplerates that is a completely different matter . Unless the converter takes into account this framerate change there will by audio synch problems . <p> This is a very common reason Flask Mpeg will give audio synch problems . If you convert a DVD 48000Hz audio down into 441000Hz will very often result in audio synch problems . If you find the audio has been recorded at the wrong samplerate with Flask Mpeg it may fix it if you convert it back to the original DVD samplerate i.e. 48000Hz . Theoretically , the same film of 60 mins recorded both separately at 44100Hz and 48000Hz will play for exactly 60 minuets . But when it comes to downsampling i.e. converting 48000Hz down to 441000Hz , then problems arise because many programs do not seem to keep the file length the same ! Solution ? Grab a DVD audio at 48000Hz 16 Bit only ! You may then use VirtualDub to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep the audio length perfect ! <p> Fixing that Dull Sound <p> Because many sound cards can not handle 48000 Hz very well you may find that any method you use to extract the sound will give a fairly dull sound output . This can be prevented by converting the audio to 44100 Hz in VirtualDub . This can be done at the same time that you multiplex the audio and video files together or after when the movie is finished . I 'm assuming you are fixing a finished movie here . So open VirtualDub as usual by going to File &gt; Open video file ... <p> We do n't want to effect the video itself so we use Video &gt; Direct stream copy . Whenever we select an option , VirtualDub adds a black dot by it to tell us it is selected . <p> Then select Audio &gt; Full processing mode . <p> Choose Audio &gt; Conversion ... <p> Choose 44100Hz and make sure the ' High quality ' is selected , and press OK . <p> Fixing Crackly Sound ! <p> Actually , cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoded sound and can not be fixed other than getting the sound all over again ! Ac3Dec is usually the culprit , and since Flask Mpeg uses the same decoding engine as Ac3Dec then it is possible that it will also get some crackly sound . <p> To be fair I think perhaps Ac3Dec has improved since it was first made , so you may not need to worry . But nevertheless , if you do get bad audio from it I suggest you try another method . The best way I have found is to get the audio with GraphEdit , the quality is much better in my option . Check out my ' Audio with Graphedit ' section for details on this . Then follow the ' multiplexing ' guide to merge it to the video file . <p> Fixing Very Quiet Sound ! <p> As you would expect , DVD audio has a much higher Dynamic Range than normal TV or Video . This means that it can go from mind-numbingly loud to so quiet that you can not hear anything ! This is fine for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give enough range . So what you end up with is a soundtrack that is mostly quiet with some very loud bits in it ! Software DVD players such as WinDVD have a built in ' Dynamic Normalizer ' which usually makes sure the audio is loud enough to hear at all times . <p> Since you probably used Flask Mpeg or Ac3Dec to create your audio it may be the case that your audio is just too quiet to hear . Again , the best way ( in my opinion ) to fix this is to get the audio again using GraphEdit and the WinDVD audio filters . Of course , if the audio is badly quiet this still may not be enough ! The alternative ( slower way ) is to normalize the sound . Normalizing is a way to make the sound as loud as it will go without clipping . Clipping is when the audio goes off the scale and looses parts of its information . Clipping would cause pops , clicks and other annoying glitches that we obviously do n't want . So normalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old method I suggested was to use Cool Edit or SoundForge or a similar audio editing software to normalize because they have this option built in . But there is a more effective way and it does n't require you buy such expensive software like Cool Edit either = ) . There is a really good free tool called DeDynamic . It does standard normalization , but it is also able to perform dynamic normalization ! What this means is instead of just normalizing the whole file , it normalizes and also adjusts the quiet to loudness ratios . So a loud sound will remain just as loud but a normally quiet sound will be made louder , cool huh ! Whatever method you use , the only problem with fixing the audio by normalizing is that it takes anything upto about 4GB of hard drive space to do for a whole movie ! <p> Step 1 . Extracting the Audio <p> I 'm assuming you used Flask Mpeg to create your movie so before we go any further we need to extract the audio from your finished movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save Wav ... <p> Do n't worry about size yet , it should n't be larger than about 100MB ; in fact , its usually only about 60MB . VirtualDub does n't change the audio to uncompressed PCM audio , it literally takes out whatever is in there . So if you used Mp3 that is exactly what it will extract ... although it will still call it a something.wav andnot something.mp3 . <p> Step 2 . Converting it to a PCM Wave <p> Now we must convert it to uncompressed PCM . For this we can use Winamp because everyone knows how to use Winamp and its free of course ; ) . Open your Wav file and press the stop button to stop it playing . Right-click and choose : <p> Options &gt; Preferences ... <p> Choose the Audio I/O tab . Now instead of the normal OUTWAVE.DLL option , choose OUTDISK.DLL . Press ' Apply ' and Winamp will ask where you wish to save the file . <p> Choose a location and wait until the audio is converted into a huge one and a half Gigabyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The bad news is DeDynamic is a DOS operated tool . The good news is I 'm gon na show ya how to use it : ) . Make a folder on your main hard drive ( usually C : ) and call it something simple like dynamic . Cut an paste the gigabyte Wave file you just created with Winamp into it ( if you did n't already extract it to there ) . Also put the DeDynamic.exe file in there as well , so you will have something like this in your dynamic folder : <p> Type : CD and press Enter . Type : CD dynamic and press Enter . Now , cut and paste the following line into the DOS prompt : <p> DeDynamic.exe-a 6C : dynamicaudio.wavC : dynamicfinal.wav <p> ( I have encircled the DOS paste button in red in the picture below ) . <p> Obviously the text will not be those colours , I 'm just using colours so you can see what the line you pasted means . The -a 6 ( highlighted in green text ) is the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a setting of 1 to 50 without any problems . If , for example , you wanted to dynamically normalize by 50 you 'd put -a 50 where the -a 6 was in my above line . If you just want to normalize without the extra dynamics just put -a 0 . <p> Using an amount of 50 is severe overkill and it was n't really designed to do that much . But I 've tried it at 50 and above and it sounds quite good , very loud and there is no audio corruption either . But this is a very powerful program , so I would suggest you try a setting of between 4 and 6 and see how that goes . If you still want it louder then you can keep going up until you are happy with it : ) . <p> Anyhoo , when you 've decided on the setting , paste it , press the ' Enter ' key and it will ask what output you 'd like it converted into with the following box : <p> I would choose the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( all DVDs use this format ) , then I would choose it again . You can choose another format such as MP3 if you want but this may cause synch troubles and/or difficulty on merging the audio back to the video . <p> In the end we should end up with another huge gigabyte file , but this time it will be normalized to a really loud kick ass level ! That 's it ! Now go to my ' multiplexing ' guide to see how we use VirtualDub to recombine the new audio to the old video file =o ) .

@@98121045 @2321045/ <p> PgcEdit has implemented an advanced version of jeanl 's method of jumping to the title/menu of your choice , which was also supported by 2COOL 's stand-alone program JMP2PGC . <p> This method allows you to jump to any menu or title on insertion of your DVD , setting the audio and subtitle streams of your choice and by-passing anything in your way ( e.g. annoying FBI warnings , studio promos and Dolby Digital trailers ) and having all the DVD 's internal registers set exactly as they would be if the commands followed the original path . <p> Here 's how to use it . <p> 1 . Load up your DVD in PgcEdit . <p> 2 . Start trace mode with Ctrl-T or with the Trace toolbar icon . <p> 3 . Trace through your DVD until you get to where you want it to start ( press -&gt;&gt;&gt; Run gets to menus/titles quickly or you may prefer the more leisurely -&gt;&gt; Next PB which stops at every playback point , allowing you to see what goes on ) . You will notice that every PGC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Take a note of the exact PGC where you want the DVD to start ( this could be a menu or a title ) . In the example below , I have chosen the Root Menu VTSM 1 , LU1 ( en ) , 1 which has 8 buttons and a playing time of 1 minute and 14 seconds . <p> 5 . Note If you want the DVD to start at the menu but it actually starts directly with the main movie , just let it run through until it gets back to the main menu . <p> 6 . When you have reached your desired PGC , stop the trace ( just click on the -&gt; Break button in the trace window ) . <p> 7 . Now in the PGC navigator window ( usually on the left ) , select the PGC where you want the DVD to start ( left click on it once ) . <p> 8 . Press Ctrl-Shift-T or , in either the Breakpoints menu or the Trace menu at the very top , select Trace Toggle PGC Pre/Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See below . <p> 9 . Now start the trace again by pressing the load/eject button and Run . Eventually PgcEdit will stop at your pre-defined breakpoint . If you need to set your audio and subtitle preferences after your breakpoint is reached , simply trace through to them and back to your breakpoint . Using this method , you can even start the DVD in the audio or subtitles setup menu ! <p> Tip : It 's usually a good idea to select your audio and subtitle preferences , even if it is just " no subtitles " , as some players do not like working with just the defaults . <p> 10 . On the main menu , select PGC Jump to PGC upon DVD insert <p> 11 . Note the warning to do an incremental backup ( see paragraph 18 below ) and the hints ( see paragraphs 7 to 9 above ) . <p> 12 . If : <p> ( i ) your target PGC is a menu ( VTSM or VMGM ) ; and <p> ( ii ) your DVD jumped through a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DVD 's commands do not contain an RSM ( resume ) command ; and <p> ( iv ) the DVD is programmed so that it is impossible to resume with the GoUp button of the remote from any menu PGC that is not a dummy ; and <p> ( v ) the last visited title is not the longest title in the DVD , <p> PgcEdit will display the following message : <p> The last title visited may not be the longest one , so ( subject to the above constraints ) PgcEdit allows you to pick the longest title as the default title to initially resume to ( i.e. the title that would play if you immediately pressed " Root Menu " from the remote after inserting the DVD ) . You should normally accept the default suggestion as this is the safest course . You should especially not modify the default resume point on episodic DVDs ( the longest title may not be the first episode ) or DVDs that have advanced protection ( the longest title may be fake or , if it is the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be precisely set to enable proper playback ) . <p> If you decide to change the default resume point , carefully test that it plays back correctly via Trace after concluding the Jump to PGC procedure ! <p> Note that if PgcEdit detects that the navigation has implemented explicit methods to resume from any menu , it assumes that changing the resume point is not safe and this option will not be offered . <p> Note : This option is only available for PgcEdit versions 9.3 and above . <p> 13 . PgcEdit will go through some calculations and insert the commands for you in the relevant PGCs to enable you to immediately jump to your selected PGC . <p> 14 . However , if the PGC you have selected jumps out of the PGC before playing , you will be warned and no commands will have been inserted . <p> Just press Run again and you will eventually return to your PGC , at which time you can repeat paragraph 10 ( sometimes you will need to do this 2 or 3 times ! ) . <p> 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the following and offer to remove your breakpoint ( the note about the title to resume to is included only if a resume point has been defined ) . Answer yes . <p> 16 . Do n't save just yet . Press the Load/Eject button on the trace toolbar and run through the DVD step by step to ensure it starts where you wanted it to . Watch the registers to see that your selected audio and subtitle streams ( SPRM 1 and 2 ) are selected . If all is as you want it , save your DVD ( Ctrl-S ) and test in a software player . <p> Notes : <p> 17 . Sometimes , there are no free GPRMs for PgcEdit to use to hold its commands ( to perform this procedure , in the past a free GPRM was necessary ) . However , due to its advanced technology , PgcEdit can now use GPRMs that have already been set ( it will give you feedback about this , if required ) . As well , thanks to 2COOL , PgcEdit has overcome potential problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds its way back to the First Play PGC . So , there is nothing to worry about in this instance . <p> 18 . Although there is little risk in performing this procedure ( especially if you do not save ) , it is wise to do an incremental backup of your DVD . Just choose File Backups New incremental backup from the menu ( or Ctrl + n ) . This renames your PgcEditbackup folder as an archive of sorts ( time and date stamped ) and saves your current IFOs in a newly created PgcEditbackup folder , which are easy to restore with the File Backups Restore backup command ( or Ctrl + Alt + b ) if things go awry .

Blu-ray discs ( BDs ) that uses MPEG-2 ( most of the earlier BD releases ) will require less CPU cycles , while the BDs/HD DVDs that uses VC-1 or H.264 will stress even the latest CPUs ( especially H.264 ) . Then you have your graphics card , which can provide accelerated decoding . And of course , you 'll need a Blu-ray or HD DVD drive to be able to read the movie in the first place . <p> Before we go into detail about what 's required , there is actually a tool you can download and run which will test your current system for Blu-ray and HD DVD compatibility . Download and install the CyberLink BD / HD Advisor . Run it and you will be presented with two options - one to test Blu-ray compatibility and another to test HD DVD compatibility . Run the test and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tests show a " green " light , then you have a very good chance of playing back a Blu-ray or HD DVD movie on your system . The only thing that is slightly misleading might be the CPU test , because it will often return a " yellow light " ( needs upgrade ) even though the CPU should be fast enough . <p> The new version of WinDVD , WinDVD 9 , also now adds Blu-ray and HD DVD playback . And it also comes with a similar tool called the WinDVD High-Definition Advisor Tool . It is a very similar tool to the CyberLink BD / HD Advisor , except it will test for WinDVD compatibility rather than PowerDVD Ultra compatibility . <p> We will now go through the individual computer component requirements one by one : <h> CPU <p> Generally speaking , any dual-core or better part will be good enough .

A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found here . It is worth noting that with video acceleration ( see below ) , the CPU requirements drop dramatically . <h> System Memory <p> 1GB or better is what you need - you might get by on 512MB in Windows XP , but it is not recommended . 2GB or more on Vista is recommended . <h> Graphics Card <p> This is where things get a bit tricky . There are actually 2 different set of requirements for graphics cards . The first is the most important : HDCP output compatibility . HDCP is a copy protection system designed to protect the digital pathway between your graphics card and your monitor . Both your graphics card and your monitor must support HDCP if you are using a DVI or HDMI connection , in order for a full resolution picture to show up ( generally , a HDMI connection includes HDCP support ) . Otherwise , you have to use a VGA connection path ( eg. using a DVI to VGA connector ) and have the playback resolution reduced . Notebooks with internal paths are exempt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are connected using a HDCP compatible pathway ( " Video Connection Type " ) . <p> PowerDVD Ultra requires fairly new GPUs to be present before it would even run , regardless of HDCP support , VGA output or otherwise . WinDVD is a bit more forgiving , and older cards will run as long as it has full HDCP support through DVI output or if you connect using a VGA cable . <p> The second requirement is technically optional , but you may find that playback will suffer quite a bit if you do n't have it . Decoding acceleration will take some of the load off your CPU and shift it onto your GPU - the CPU usage can decrease from a constant 100% to a more manageable 10 to 30% . ATI cards that have AVIVO HD ( ATI Radeon HD 2x00 range ) and NVIDIA cards with PureVideo HD will benefit most from the acceleration . Below is a list of cards that is recommended ( according to Cyberlink ) , but we 've highlighted our recommended ones ( the ones in bold are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both HDCP and non-HDCP flavours so you need to check with the manufacturer , and the rest are unlikely to have HDCP except for a few specific models ) : <p> Please note that you will still have to satisfy the HDCP requirements even if your card is one of the cards listed above - it is up to the card 's manufacturer ( not the GPU chipset manufacturer ) to put in HDCP hardware , so check your video card 's manufacturer 's website for more information . Also note that PowerDVD Ultra does not like any ATI cards that are not listed above , even if they offer no difference in playback performance to the minimum listed card - so for those with ATI X800 , for example , you will most likely get an error about incompatible graphic drivers in the Cyberlink BD / HD Advisor ( and a similar message when you try playback in PowerDVD Ultra ) . <h> Monitor <p> If your monitor is connected digitally ( DVI or HDMI ) , then you will need to ensure your monitor is HDCP compliant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should support HDCP because HDCP is mandatory for HDMI . <p> The second requirement for your monitor is the supported resolution . To get the best out of high definition DVD , you need a display that is capable of at least 1920 x 1080 resolution , as this is the native resolution of high definition films . The picture will still look good on monitors that have lower resolutions , but you wo n't be seeing the full resolution . <h> Sound Card <p> The CyberLink BD / HD Advisor does not test your sound device . While you will be able to listen to high definition movies using only a set of stereo speakers or a headphone , to get the best out of it , you need to invest in a 7.1 audio system . A modern HD onboard audio will work fine with 7.1 output , an 7.1 audio card is even better as DSP can be done on the card , as opposed to your CPU . <h> Blu-ray / HD DVD Drive <p> And of course , you will need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this requires a drive that is capable of at least reading Blu-ray or HD DVD discs . Your DVD-ROM drive will simply not work . One of the cheaper alternatives to buying a dedicated HD DVD drive is to buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on drive . This drive enables HD DVD playback for your Xbox 360 , but not only that , it doubles as an external HD DVD/DVD reader drive for your computer ( compatible with Windows XP/Vista , and Mac OS if you can find a HD DVD player software for it ) . You can read our guide on Setting up the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on drive under Windows XP.

You can get them on E-bay for around $50 Aus . <p> To play on non Divx dvd players , you need to convert avi to DVD or ISO format , there are many program online that can burn avi file to dvd , I personally use aimersoft dvd creator to convert popular video to dvd . <p> there are many converter software products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best results is Convertxtodvd .

Maybe someone can then tell if you have bad input . <p> 14hrs seems a very long time to me but then on the other hand i would n't know how long ( runing time ) the avi files were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is which is doing this work <p> an empty audiots folder is absolutely normal and nothing to worry about as the audiostreams itself are stored within the vobfiles - the subfolder " audiots " is only created for compatibility reasons <p> i go with miles in terms of letting programs convert as one task and bruning to disc as another , separate step which i never liked to be done prior to my checking the results <p> I burn with Nero 7 Ultra , and transcode AVI 's to DVD using a part of that suite , Nero Vision 4. ( yes , still ! 3 OS 's later ! ) It too also creates the audio folder , usually empty . In fact , the audio folder is empty on most of my commercially purchased DVD 's . I do n't even know why it is there . All the audio streams ( english , french , spanish , commentary , etc. ) are contained in the VOB files which , you already know are in the video folder . The splitting of your AVI 's into several VOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOB 's are at 1,048,574 KB or less . Your AVI 's must be split into several VOB files , if the transcoded VOB exceeds that size . That 's a DVD standard and is done for compatibility reasons . <p> I 've actually deleted that empty audio folder from the burn list so it never ends up on the burned DVD . Still no problems with playing the DVD 's . Ca n't really hurt anything to leave it there either . <p> I 've tried DVD flick just for ships and giggles to transcode AVI 's to a burned DVD . It took friggen forever , ( About 4 hours for a 2hr movie ) . and do n't even get me started on the mediocre encoding quality of the DVD . Nero does it in about an hour on the same computer , and better quality . <p> Yes , I paid an outrageous amount of money for Nero 7 Ultra , but geez , I 've got YEARS of use out of it across 3 windows versions , no updates required , and I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2000 , NT ) , Vista32 bit . Need Nero 9 for Windows 7 though . <p> I do n't think the transcoding part is your problem . It 's obvious that the data has been converted and burned . For some other reason , the burner ( or DVD flick ) could n't close the session ( finalize the disk ) . Perhaps DVD flick does not lock the drive ( ? ) and an antivirus scan , or other process interrupted the burn . But drag-N-drop VOB files to burn ? I do n't think so . That sounds like it would just create a DATA dvd with VOB files on it . Not the same as creating a Video DVD . <p> @DrinkOrDie for some reason I read audio folder is empty but my mind saw no audio . The audio folder is there for audio ( music only ) DVDs . <p> A good diagnostic is try to set " lock drive exclusive access " in Imgburn . If it wo n't let you start a burn because another software has the drive , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look for InCD . Nero works vastly better if InCD is not installed . <p> I have to tell you though , I do n't have money to spend $500 for a video converter so I have n't sampled the professional suites , but the best looking video I 've seen so far is AVStoDVD using the latest HC encode beta ( Oct. 20 2009 ) Set it to 2 pass HC in the video options and lock it with the Lock Button . If the input is good the output is like glass on my HDTV . <p> Another cool thing about AVStoDVD I put an . mkv file with subtitles as input and got DVD output with the subs burned in . I totally forgot to take any account of the subs . I did n't extract the subs to do anything . AVStoDVD took care of it . I just dropped the . mkv file on the program . <p> The last consideration would be if there 's new firmware for the burner . On one of my old PCs if I used any version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until I updated the firmware . Of course firmware update always has some risk .. so I only do it if it 's really a stumbling block . <p> @DrinkOrDie for some reason I read audio folder is empty but my mind saw no audio . The audio folder is there for audio ( music only ) DVDs .. <p> Really ? I 'm not doubting you at all . I 've seen NO commercial video DVD 's that had that folder on them . I do know that in the early days of DVD 's , ( afterall , it stands for Digital Versatile Disk ) the idea was that DVD 's would be used for music/soundtracks AND movies . Of course , they got away from the idea of music on DVD 's and gravitated towards more options for the movie audio track , special features such as camera angle choices , stereo or surround , etc. and had no problem filling up a DVD with that stuff . In fact , many DVD 's now take two layers , even for just a 2.5 hour movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " audio only " DVD 's . I think it 's there so you can have the best of both worlds on one disk . Nero even gives me that option . Something about a " mixed mode " where a DVD can contain your typical MPEG2 video ( VOB ) but also can contain an audio-only portion ( much like a CD ) AND computer data . I think this is why they called it a " versitile " disk in the beginning . Thanks for sharing . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by A Dodgy Dude <p> Thanks . everybody , for your input .

Does this mean that it is impossible to lose quality when converting VHS to DVD ? Similarly , would it be pointless to use the highest quality setting of the converter ? <p> A lot depends on your source . Badly lit hand held home made VHS needs a much higher bitrate than good clean steady HollyWood produced footage . In other words , noise does n't compress well . Blank DVDs are pretty cheap so if it 's home made stuff you 're recording I 'd go 90 minutes ( or less ) to a DVD . <p> There really is n't any way to get increased quality from VHS onto a DVD . The VHS should be as clean as possible for a decent transfer to any digital medium . <p> Some stand alone DVD recorders do have circuitry that cleans up some noise and other junk in analog video sources . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With 240 lines going into the DVD recorder , your gon na get 240 lines onto the DVD disc .. period . Without the use of a very expensive line doubler encoder , which just doubles the scan lines of every other field , you still end up with less than pure DVD quality . <p> The s/n ratio also contributes to dubbing quality . Analog VHS , even the hi-fi units using the top notch quality blank tape , had a very poor s/n ratio even in SP mode . This noise is also transfered to your DVD copy . <p> Any analog source is gon na have some noise level to it which gets copied along with what you want to copy . There are filtering devices that can reduce this noise floor somewhat , usually with brick-wall filtering techniques and A/D-D/A conversion and resampling . Other than that there really is n't much you can do to purify a 240 line VHS signal . <p> Bottom line as Chew said , ; Garbage in , garbage out so even with some noise reduction , your spoiled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of analog vhs , super vhs stuff and in the end no matter what I do , still looks analog video .. but , I must say , my old camcorder 8mm tapes from 15-17 yrs ago look as good as they did the day I filmed and on tv or monitor PLAYBACK looks sharp as hell but , after tranfered to dvd ? not as good .. <p> When copying from VHS to DVD , how do I maximize the quality of the recording ? I learned that the horizontal resolution of VHS is 240 lines and DVD is 540 lines . Does this mean that it is impossible to lose quality when converting VHS to DVD ? Similarly , would it be pointless to use the highest quality setting of the converter ? <p> I never understood stood the old way of measuring horizintal luminance resolution . It was not across the full screen but 3/4 of the way across . So to convert the old method into " full screen " , one I think makes more sense , if I remember correctly VHS was approx 320 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD is 720 . <p> Are you going to burn on a PC or stand alone DVD recorder ? <p> I 'm use to using some of the tools once discussed here that took a long time to process but permitted optimal compression . DVD recording on the fly ... especially at the 4 hour mode , introduces unacceptable artifacts . They are less noticable at the 2hr speed but still there . <p> For recording I would oversample at the highest bitrate you can but not below the 2 hour mode . I do n't know what your source tapes are like but does your recorder have VBR ? My Panasonic has it so I can record a 90 minute show using the entire disk instead of in 2 hour mode and wasting some of the disk . <p> But rago is right ... do n't expect miracles . Remember that the only video format worst than VHS was Fischer Price .... that is unless there 's some intermediate Yugo format . LOL <p> It is possible to lose quality when going from VHS to DVD because , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I will now try out different quality settings to see the effects . <p> I can only add that you may be better off NOT running the VHS video through any luminance or chroma DNR because it may apprear to improve the source signal , but you ca n't get rid of it once it 's recorded . I expect most DVD players have options to use DNR in playback anyway . I still remember when I first bought my first VCR back in the early 80 's and wanted to make copies of various things . I bought a video enhancer thinking it would improve the quality . Well it looked better on the screen but that 's not the way it recorded . I could have always sharpened the signal afterward ... but doing so before ruined the picture . <p> Does your playback machine have a Time Base Corrector ? I know digital video has it built in , but I 'm not sure if it can apply it to the incoming analog signal that may have some timing issues . <p> A quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correction on my machine , Panasonic DMR-EZ47VK . They said that it indeed has the function . The sites are unofficial , though . <p> Like I said it 's standard in digital video ... but then why mention it unless it 's for the analog video ? TBC was once a big deal in prosumer equipment back in the mid-90 's but it should be easy to include these days . <p> Quote : <p> I compared 4 quality settings ( 1- , 2- , 4- , and 8-hour modes ) in converting from VHS to DVD with the original VHS . The study was non-blind . Results : LIST*1- and 2-hr modes looked the same . I could n't distinguish them from VHS. *4-hr mode noticeably dropped the quality . <p> I was not impressed with Panasonic 's Diga . It promised full resolution in the LP 4 hour mode but they did n't mention it was at the cost of excessive compression loaded with artifacts . <p> Quote : <p> If it is , I will return my machine for one that has Flexible Recording in VHS-to-DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . It 's a great feature . Yours does n't have it ? It seems you 're stuck between wanting the best transfer from analog which in my opinion requires TBC ... and getting optimal bitrates on the DVDs . I would not exchange TBC for VBR . I 'd just record at higher bitrates and end up with extra disks . Of course I do n't know what source video you want to transfer . <p> If your box is like mine then the Nav structure is not very well thought out . You might also be able to access FR through FUNCTIONS &gt; OTHER FUNCTIONS . I used it for some trials converting old Hi8 tapes from my editing deck to DVD .

You can feed it various video formats ( asf , avi , avs , mkv , mov , mp4 , ogm , vdr and wmv ) and it will convert them to a DVD folder or image , ready for burning . It gives you the option to use QuEnc or HC as the MPEG-2 encoder , and will even create a simple menu for you that you can customize . <p> FAVC is fairly straight forward and easy to use . While it helps to know a bit about DVD authoring and video conversion , you do n't need to much knowledge to follow this guide . <p> If you want alternatives to FAVC , please read our DVD Authoring Tools Roundup to find out which DVD authoring tool is best for your needs . <h> Step 1 : Checking your input files <p> Before you load your inputs into FAVC , it is best to make sure that these input files are all of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , files that are 23.976 , 24 , 29.97 or 30 frame per second are NTSC . While PAL video is at 25 FPS . Multiples of these frame rates ( eg. 15 FPS and 60 FPS =&gt; NTSC ) are sometime used as well . There are many ways to check for the frame rate of your video file , for example , using GSpot for AVI files . I prefer to organise my videos before even starting FAVC , so I will know beforehand what kind of DVD I am making . Normally , your video player software will also show you the frame rate of the file . For example , in Windows Media Player , you can find out the frame rate of the video by accessing the " Statistics " options from the " View " menu , go to the " Advanced " tab and the " frame rate " will be displayed there . <p> If you are using Media Player Classic , you can find out the frame rate by going to the " File " menu , selecting " Properties " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FPS will be shown there ( the screenshot below shows : " Video : MPEG4 Video ( H264 ) 720x384 25.00fps Video " ) . <p> Another method to find out details about your video file , that will work for almost any kind of video file , is to use MediaInfo . Simply download and install MediaInfo , load in your video file , and the details about the video will be shown , including the framerate ( fps ) . <p> Once you have found out the frame rates of your video files , separate the NTSC and PAL ones , as you do not want to mix them together when making a single DVD . You should probably also separate the widescreen and full-frame videos . So each DVD you make should only contain widescreen PAL , widescreen NTSC , full-frame PAL or full-frame NTSC content . It 's also probably a good idea now to check your input video to see if they have any audio synch issues , and fix them before loading them into FAVC.

Test with another demo software to rule out software as the cause . If two software programs have the same symptom , your recorder may need service . <p> If the drive is being polled by another software 's driver , it could hang the bus . Uninstall any other CD recording software you may have had on your system , as well as Nero . Then use Registry cleaner software to clean you registry .

Only solution would be to send the drive in for service to the recorder manufacturer . <p> Run " ScanDisc " and " Defrag " on your hard drive . This minimizes the possibility of " Buffer Underrun " errors . <p> Close any program running in the background ( e.g. anti-virus programs ) . You can do this manually by using the ' Ctrl-Alt-Del ' . For Win95/98/ME : Just close all programs except for Systray and Explorer . For Windows 2000/XP systems use Ctrl-Alt-Del , go to Task Manager and close all programs . But sometimes for Windows 2000 and XP its not enough to close all programs in the background . A good program to help in these cases is " EndItAll " ; please search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try different media brands . The one that you are using may not be compatible with your recorder . <p> Update the firmware version on your recorder . Please check the manufacturer 's website for the latest release . <p> Try using a different data source ( different hard drives , CD-/DVD-ROMs or network drives ) to see if it is corrupted or too slow . <p> Test your drive speed or use a simulation in order to obtain the optimal speed for your system and recorder . If not the maximum possible write speed of the recorder is kept as default . <p> Important notes Upgrades to the latest versions of Nero 5.5 are free of charge . The Nero 5 serial number does not work for Nero 6/Nero 6 Reloaded . To upgrade to Nero 6 Reloaded from a previous version - 5.0 or 5.5 - you have to buy the program . <p> If you do a search on SCSI Command Errors , you will find that many others have had the same issue as yours with USB Recorders , regardless of the software used .

The first thing we will do is to set up the project , so click on the " Project Settings " button . <p> In the " General " section first . You can specify a title for the project here - note that this is not the disc 's title ( separately configured in the " Burning " section ) . You can also change the target size to match the kind of DVD media you will burn to ( most likely " DVD ( 4.3 GB ) " ) . You can also specify a custom size if , for example , you want to burn other types of files to the DVD . <p> The " Encoder Priority " will determine how much resources Windows will allocate resources to DVD Flick - the " Normal " setting should be good enough if you plan on doing light work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to work normally . If you are sure you wo n't be doing anything while DVD Flick is working , you can select a higher priority , but the performance gains might be minimal . <p> Thread Count specifies how many CPU threads you wish DVD Flick to use . Those with dual or quad core processors should enable 2 or 4 threads for maximum performance . <p> The " Keep intermediate encoded audio and video files " option , when selected , tells DVD Flick to keep the encoded audio ( AC3 ) and video ( MPEG-2 ) files it uses to create the DVD . Otherwise , these files will be deleted . Keeping these files are good if you plan on using these encoded files in other authoring or editing tools to create other DVDs . <p> On to the " Video " section . The " Target Format " will need to be changed to match your input file ( see " Step 2 " ) . <p> " Encoding profile " determines encoding quality , and therefore , speed . " Fastest " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the slowest and highest quality . " Normal " is recommended . <p> " Target bitrate " allows you to set a constant bitrate for the encoding , which is not recommended unless you know what you are doing . Bitrate determines quality and file size . As an example , most commercially produced feature movie DVDs use a bitrate between 7 and 9 Mbit/s . Selecting the " Auto-fit " option is your best bet , as DVD Flick will try to fit all your video files using the highest bitrate possible and not use a bitrate that is less than 2.5 Mbit/s . You can also set your own custom bitrate . <p> Click on the " Advanced " button to access the advanced video options . " Add overscan borders " will add a border around your video . The reason for doing this is that many older TVs have overscan , that is to enlarge the picture slightly so that the border area is not viewable . If you do not have overscan enabled , then parts of your video might be cut off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have overscan and if you select this option , you will see a black border around the picture . I would leave it unselected . <p> " Log PSNR values " will log certain an objective quality measurement value in dvdflick.log , not necessary unless you need to know . <p> " Half horizontal resolution " will half the horizontal resolution from 720 to 352 , lower quality , but allowing more video to be stored ( standalone DVD recorders often use this mode to the extra long record settings ) . Not recommended unless your source video is already at 352 resolution or lower . <p> " Deinterlace source " can be used if the source is indeed interlaced . If you 're not sure , then do n't enable this option . <p> " Copy MPEG-2 streams " can be used if your source is a DVD compliant MPEG-2 file - this then will make DVD Flick skip the encoding process and use the input MPEG-2 files as it is . Please be extra careful here and make sure your MPEG-2 input is indeed DVD compliant , otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD players . <p> " Apply 2:3 pulldown " can be used if your source material is 23.976 FPS ( NTSC-Film ) and you wish to make a NTSC DVD ( 29.97 FPS ) . In most cases , you 're better off selecting " NTSC-Film " as target format in the " Video " settings section&gt; <p> When you 're done , press " Accept " to close this window and return to the main settings section . <p> Now on to the " Audio " section . " Volume modification " allows you to adjust the volume of the audio output , as a percentage of the input volume ( so 100% would be the same volume , 10% would be greatly reduced volume , and 200% would be double the volume ) . For " Channel count " , select " Auto " match the number of channels from the input file , or you can force Mono , Stereo or 5.1 audio to be used . If your source has more channels than what you select here , then the number of channels in the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your source was 5.1 channels and you select stereo here , the output will still be 5.1 channels ) . Lastly , you can select a bitrate to use - 384 kbit/s is fairly standard on DVDs for 5.1 audio , 448 for extra quality , and 192 kbit/s for stereo is also common . <p> Onto the " Playback " section . You can specify what happens " After a title has finished playing " . This depends very much on the type of disc you are producing . If for example your disc is a series of continous holiday videos , then you might want to select " Play the next title " after each video ends .

@@98121108 @2321108/ <h> AVI to a DVD Compliant MPEG-2 File Using QuEnc 11152 @qwx871152 <h> Page 2 of 3 : Steps 5 - 6 <h> Step 5 : AviSynth Script Creation <p> We will now use QuEnc to transcode our AVI files to a DVD compliant MPEG-2 stream . However , QuEnc only accepts AviSynth scripts inputs , not AVI files directly . This is not a problem at all though , because AviSynth scripts are basically just text files that one can create with any text editor . What is more difficult , it working out the aspect ratio and resolution settings , which due to DVD 's way of storing and displaying video , can be somewhat confusing . Doom9 has a guide which explains the process quite well , but what I have done here , and it 's a first for a guide here on Digital Digest , is to provide a function that will generate the AviSynth script for you with all the resizing parameters filled in based on your source file 's input size . <p> To use this function , simply enter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempBoratBorat-fixed.avi ) , the source resolution in width/height , whether it 's NTSC or PAL ( as determined all the way back in Step 1 ) and whether you want an anamorphic encoding or not . <p> The last point need to be expanded upon further before we proceed . Since most AVI inputs are using square pixels , there 's only a little bit to be gained from anamorphic encoding unless your input video exceeds the DVD resolution ( 720x480 for NTSC and 720x576 for PAL ) or if your input video uses high bitrates and you do n't want to lose valuable available bitrates by using too much of it on the black borders . But it makes very little difference to encoding time and authoring ( if your DVD authoring tool supports anamorphic video , which it should ) , so it might be worth the effort . If your input video is already anamorphic , then do not select the " Encode Anamorphic ? " option . <p> The function below is encased using iFrames , so if your browser does not support it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you generate your AviSynth script , simply copy it into your favourite text editor and save the file with the . avs extension . This script is now ready to use in QuEnc in the next step . Note that if you decided to use QuEnc to encode your audio as well , then change the part of the script where it says " audio=false " to " audio=true " . <h> Step 6 : QuEnc MPEG-2 Encoding <p> Start QuEnc . Load in your AVS script that was generated in the last step . Make sure the " Codec " setting is set to " MPEG-2 " . For your bitrate settings , you will need to calculate the bitrate to use so the size of the file fits into your DVD project . This involves the length of your video , the bitate already used by the video , the amount of space you will use for menus and other videos on the disc . But if you already known the amount of space your video file will occupy ( and the video length , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculation is ( if you are using QuEnc to encode the audio too , then do n't minux the " Total Audio Bitrate " as the bitrate entered here will include the audio 's bitrate ) : <p> There are many bitrate calculators available to use if you 're having trouble . When you have arrived at the bitrate you want to use , enter it into the box . I like to select all the other options ( use VBR , High Quality , Use Trellis Quant and 2 Pass Encoding ) . These are all settings that will improve quality when enabled , but will slow down encoding quite a bit ( so for fast , no nonsense encoding where quality is n't paramount , deselect all these settings ) . <p> Now , click on the " Advanced " button . Let 's go through the settings that might need changing in this section . <p> The " Extreme &amp; Slow " setting can be selected if you want maximum quality at the cost of encoding speed . " GOP " and " Max B-Frame " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closed GOP " should not be used unless you are encoding the multi-angle part of the DVD . " Scene Detection " places an I-Frame at scene changes , which might be useful for placing chapter stops at these places . <p> Select " 16:9 Aspect Ratio " if you decided to use anamorphic encoding in Step 5 ( or if your source video was already anamorphic ) . Otherwise , select 4:3 Aspect Ratio . We 'll leave the GUI settings alone since it has nothing to do with encoding . <p> Over on the other side , change the DC Precision setting to " 10 " . <p> Change the " Max Bitrate " to a value that is 9800 kbps minus your audio bitrate . For example , if you have one audio file at 384 kbps , then the max bitrate should be 9800 - 384 = 9416 kbps . If you have two audio tracks , two at 448 and another at 192 , then the max bitrate would be 9800 - 448 - 448 - 192 = 8712 kbps . If you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable " Auto Max Bitrate " to let QuEnc determine the max bitrate automatically . <p> The other options here can be left alone . Skip to the bottom , and the " Mux Profile " setting can be changed . If you want a single MPG file that includes audio ( if using QuEnc to encode the audio ) , then choose the " DVD " profile or " Separate Passes " if you want individual video/audio files ( good for authoring tools like DVD-Lab Pro ) . If you 've followed this guide and already encoded your audio , then you will only have the " No Audio " profile . If you did decide to encode the audio using QuEnc , then you can select the output audio format : AC3 @ 192/256 kbps for stereo and 384/448 kbps for 5.1ch is recommended . <p> Press " Apply " to apply the advanced settings and return to the main QuEnc screen . <p> Press " Encode " to start the video ( and audio ) encoding ) . When QuEnc finishes , you will have a DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file or a MPEG-2 file that includes both streams . <p> The next steps provide instructions for performing 3:2 pulldown on 23.976/24 FPS video which is needed for making NTSC DVDs , and also instructions on how to multiplex your separate M2V/AC3 files into a MPEG-2 ( MPG ) file for certain DVD authoring tools that only accept this type of input .

The first thing to do is to click on the " Source &amp; Output " button at the top . Use the big button marked " Open AVI " to load in your input AVI file . Use the button marked " Save AVI " to specify an output location for the output file ( try to at least ensure input and output files have different names , preferably different folder locations ) . You also need to select and output size ( by default , it will be set to the same file size as the input file ) . <p> An useful feature of AVI ReComp is that it will show you information regarding the input file on the right hand side . Things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ( which should help you diagnose why your file may not work on standalones ) . <p> Click on the " Additions " button at the top . This is where you can access many of the AVI ReComp features , such as cropping or subtitles . <p> Under the " Resolution " section , you can use the buttons to crop or resize the video . Normally , you probably wo n't need to do this , but for the purpose of this guide , I will show you how anyway . Click on " Cropping " to open up the cropping option window . A preview of the video is shown ( use the slider to skip to a section where the black border is visible , if your intention is to crop out the black border ) , as well as the cropping options . The four text boxes ( where use the up and down arrows to select a number ) is used to determine how many pixels you remove from the four sides of the video . You use this to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting rid of black bars will help make the encoding process more efficient ( and hence , give the video better quality ) . For the example video I 've used for this guide , you can see from the screenshot below that I 've cropped all four sides slightly . You can press the " preview " button to preview the crop ( previews the video , not just a still ) . " Restore " will reset the cropping setting , and " Use " will tell AVI ReComp that you want to use these cropping settings for your encoding , so click on this or click on " Cancel " to return to the main AVI ReComp interface . <p> Similarly , pressing the " Resizing " button will open up the resize option window . The options here are similar to what 's under cropping . Check the " Keep ratio " button to make sure the aspect ratio of the video has n't been altered ( so the picture becomes too fat or too skinny ) , which basically will automatically change the width setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way around too . Be sure to check the " Keep ratio " before changing either the width or height if you truly want to keep the aspect ratio , because once you change the aspect ratio and then check this option , the resulting changes will be locked to this new aspect ratio ( as opposed to the original video 's aspect ratio ) . You can use this feature to upscale your video to HD resolutions , which obviously wo n't give you increased quality , but may give you HD video for playback devices that can not upscale video . If you do increase the resolution above the standard size for DVDs , then you will get a warning box telling you that standalone player compatibility may have been sacrificed . <p> Moving on to the " Black Borders " section - this does the opposite of cropping and allows you to add black borders to the video , which sometimes may be necessary if your playback device does n't like certain aspect ratios and wo n't scale properly ( for example , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything too tall ) . You wo n't normally need to use this option , as most standalones will deal with the aspect ratio properly . You can specify a border based on certain standard aspect ratios ( 4:3 for fullscreen , 16:9 for widescreen ) , or use your own custom resolution . <p> The " Audio conversion " option allows you to convert the audio to another format . Again , this is only necessary if your player does n't like certain types of audio ( audio support is usually a lot better than video support on standalones , so you most likely wo n't need to use this option ) . Click on the " Audio conversion " button to open the option window , and enable audio conversion by checking the " Convert audio stream(s) " option . The most compatible option would be to use CBR audio , at 128 Kbps or under , with 44100 Hz audio . But this would be for the most antiquated standalone , or one that 's extremely picky . You can also adjust the volume if necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpredictable , as a variable bitrate will be used , but only the audio file size is affected , so the file size differences will not be huge ( if you really need a file to be a specific size so it fits somewhere , and you want to use VBR , then go back to the " Source &amp; Output " area and select a slightly smaller file size than what you require to ensure the file produced is n't too big ) . Using CBR or ABR will make the final file size very close to what you specify , with the audio file size exactly as set . <p> Now on to the subtitles options . You can load in subtitles files to add burnt-in subtitles ( subtitles that ca n't be removed ) to the video . The " Auto-load " option is useful if your subtitle file is in the same directory as your input video and has the same file name , and if you want to batch convert a bunch of files like this ( otherwise , you 'll need to specify each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your subtitle files are in the SSA or ASS formats , then you will have access to further subtitle options via the " Settings " button , things like position , font , size , colour ... <p> The logo option does what it suggests , by adding a logo to your video ( again , it 's burnt-in ) . The logo has to be in BMP format , and obviously the exact size as you want it to appear on the video . Press the " Settings " button to adjust the properties of the logo , such as the position , transparency and even the fade in/out property . You can of course preview the output . <p> We are nearly ready to start the re-compression process . Click on the " Queue " button at the top . Press the " Add to Queue " button to add the current settings to the job queue ( the job queue is a list of re-compression project ) . Once you have added the current job to the queue , you can go back to the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , and so on and so on until you have a list of jobs to do one after the other . This is useful if you need to convert a batch of files unattended . You can even use the option available to shut down your PC after all the jobs are finished automatically . Please note that the " Preview " button previews the currently loaded input file and settings , not the actual job you have selected from the queue . Whether it 's one job or 10 , once it has been added to the job queue , you can press the " Start " button to start the encoding process . And all you have to do afterwards is to wait for your video to finish encoding , which could take a few minutes or a few hours depending on your PC 's power and the length of the video .

BUt the overall file size is too big for the DVD , coming in at 5.5GB . <p> I checked another thread through a Google Search and it said to export it as AVI and then run it through DVD Shrink . The file created was so huge that it took up the remaining 200GB on my hard drive &amp; never finished converting due to lack of space . <p> Something did n't seem right since it was greater than even the originally recorded size so I decided to post in hopes those of you with expertise in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do specifically to get this to fit on DVD ?

Once that 's done , do I want to use DVD Shrink to get to a size that will fit on DVD ? <p> Assuming you need a DVD that plays on DVD players , I 'm sure there would be an option within Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum to choose the output quality/file size . I do n't really use the tool , but having had a look at a few videos on YouTube ( quite helpful if you need hints on how to use various aspects of Vegas Movie Studio ) , there are some settings you can adjust when you select to render the video - there should be templates you can select , with a " customize templates " option . When you do that , there should be options to change the bitrate , which will affect the output file size . I 've seen quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if there are some for AVI or ( more importantly ) MPG or DVD . <p> Looks like the AVI you created was done using uncompressed video , which explains the large file size . You should n't convert to AVI anyway , as DVD Shrink wo n't accept AVi files , and other DVD authoring tools will prefer the MPG ( MPEG-2 ) format . <p> Thank you for the details . Okay , new stumbling block . Even for MPEG-2 I have number of sub-choices like ... Program Stream NTSC or Program Stream PAL , DVD Architect NTSC Video Stream , DVD Architect 24p NTSC Video Stream or DVD Architect PAL Video Stream . In addition to the above , each comes in Widescreen versions and as if that were n't enough , there 's HDV 720-25P , HDV 720-30P , HDV 1080-24P . HDV 1080-50i , and HDV 1080-60i <p> I do n't know if these are common formats or specific so I listed them anyway . Any idea which one I should choose ? <p> " there should be templates you can select , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , there should be options to change the bitrate , which will affect the output file size . " I did n't see that option , but may have overlooked it . What bitrate size should I choose to get teh file to fit ? <p> Forgot to mention a really really simple solution which somehow escaped me before - instead of trying to fit the video onto a 4.7GB single layer DVD , why do n't you just use a dual layer DVD-R ( or DVD+R ) ? That will definitely fit the video you produced ( 5.5GB ) , with plenty of room to spare , and the dual layer disc should work on most DVD players . It 's easy to sometimes forget the simplest solution ! <p> But if that 's not something you want to do , then continue reading <p> Ignore the HDV options , since you 're not producing a HD disc . I would say that the DVD Architect profiles are the ones you need ( to produce files that works with Sony 's DVD Architect software , but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAL/NTSC , do you know which system your video was shot in ? If you 're in the US/North America though , I would say there 's a 99% chance it was NTSC . <p> As for not being able to find the customize option , there are various versions of Vegas , so perhaps only the most expensive one has that . Just in case though , can you post a screenshot of the window that contains these profiles ? ( using Windows snipping tool in Vista/7 ) <p> The required bitrate can be calculated based on the length of the video . The bitrate is usually expressed in kbs , which can be worked out by finding out how many seconds the video has , and using this formula ( 4.2 being the size of a single layer DVD , in GB ) : <p> If there is n't an option to actually change the bitrate , then you might have to just render the MPEG-2 file as it is , then use another DVD authoring tool to get the file size down , for example , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be re-encode by these tools again , so there will be some quality loss ) : <p> Based upon what you described , I used the MPEG-2 DVD Architect NTSC setting and exported it and the resulting file size was small enough to fit on DVD . From there I used WIndows Movie Maker to make the DVD from the file .

@@98121118 @2321118/ <p> The aim of this guide is quite simple - it is here to help you make your PC-DVD system region-free , so you will be able to playback DVDs you have legally purchsed from anywhere around the world . <p> For a Korean translation of our old region-free guide ( v1.0 ) , please refer to this page . <p> To navigate this guide , please either use the " index " at the bottom of every page , or use the Prev Next navigational controls at the top/bottom right hand side of the page . Sometimes , you 'll be presented with an option , for example : <p> Before you proceed with this guide , there are some frequently used technical terms you should familiarise yourself with : <p> Firmware - This refers to a small piece of software that is embedded in your hardware ( eg. A DVD-ROM drive ) . This firmware can be usually updated through software to fix any bugs or problems that may arise . <p> Hardware/Software DVD player - You should know the difference between a hardware DVD player ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or RealMagic Hollywood+ ) and a software DVD player ( eg. PowerDVD or WinDVD ) . A hardware DVD player will usually be a PCI card , and has outputs on the back of the card/your computer for connection to your TV/external sound system . A software DVD player , on the other hand , depends on your available hardware ( eg. CPU , Video/Sound card ) . For more information on this , and other PC-DVD related issues , please consult The PC-DVD Guide <p> Jumper - A jumper is a small plastic plug that is place over the pins on your hardware ( eg. A DVD-ROM drive ) to control certain functions . <p> Region Counter - A counter in hardware or software that stores the number of region changes still available . Everytime you change the region settings , the counter will decrease . Counter usually starts at 4 , and when it reaches 0 , you 'll no longer be able to change the region settings . <p> Region Free - Region-free can mean that your DVD device ( eg. DVD-ROM drive ) will not check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will infact playback any movie from any region . Note that this is different to " automatic region detect " , some standalone DVD players use - the region setting is not checked at all with these kind of region-free devices . Region-free can also mean that you have the ability to change the region settings of your DVD device ( eg. Hardware/software DVD player ) without decreasing the Region Counter ( see above ) , and hence , have the ability to change the region settings of your DVD device for an unlimited number of times . <p> Region Locking - If your DVD device ( eg. DVD-ROM drive or Hardware/software DVD player ) is said to be region-locked , then it means that you can no longer change the region settings for this device . If your DVD device is said to be region-locking , then it means that while your device may not be locked yet , if you continue to change its region settings , then it will be locked after the number of changes allowed ( stored in the Region Counter - see above ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Phase 1 refers to region-free status , where region control solely rests with the software/hardware decoder . Phase 2 refers to region-locked status , where region control rests with both the DVD-ROM drive and the decoder . <p> Setting a region - With some firmware , a region must be set before you can use it . " Setting " a region simply means that your drive has a region setting ( as detected by Drive Info ) set as the current setting - it does not mean that the drive needs to be " locked " to a certain setting ( ie. you can still have a number of user changes left ) . Most RPC-2 DVD-ROM drives comes with a region changing/setting utility - if you do n't have one , you acan use the Toshiba Region Change utility , which should work with all RPC-2 drives . <p> Basics <p> DVD DIGEST <p> It is expected that you should at least know what regions mean for DVD movies . If you do not know this , please consult The PC-DVD Guide on what regions are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region system is organized in the following ( and sometimes confusing ) manner : <p> Your RPC-2 DVD-ROM drive has a region setting , and has a region change counter , with 4-5 possible region changes . The region setting and counter on your drive are stored in hardware memory , and can not be modified easily . They are also completely independent of any other region settings/counters you may have in your system ( so changing one will not affect the other ) . <p> Your Hardware/Software DVD player will also have its own region setting and counters ( again , with 4-5 possible region changes ) that is independent of any other region settings/counters on your system ( eg. your DVD-ROM drive may be region 2 with 3 changes left , while your hardware/software DVD player will be region 5 with 4 changes left ) . Most software/hardware DVD players are designed so that it will try to match the region setting of your DVD movie automatically ( or prompt you to change the region setting ) , and decrease the counter appropriately . Some may also change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> Your operating system ( eg. Windows 98 or above ) will also have its own internal region settings and counters ( but perhaps with only 1 possible change ) that is independent of any other region settings/counters on your system . <p> In order for a DVD movie to play , the region setting of the DVD movie must match that of the above 3 region settings ( note that not all DVD players , eg. PowerDVD 3.0 , checks for the Windows internal region setting ) . So for example , in the extreme case where your DVD-ROM drive 's region settings and your hardware/software DVD player 's region settings and Windows 's own internal region settings do not match , all 3 will have to be changed to match the region setting of your DVD movie in order to playback that particular movie . Confused yet ? <p> Note that you can first try the DVD Region-Free or the Pro version of DVDIdle , which claims to make all DVD-ROM drives region-free , although since my DVD-ROM drive is already region-free , I could not test for sure .

The iPhone supports both H.264 video and MPEG-4 ( Simple Profile ) video - H.264 is the new codec which is more efficient than MPEG-4 SP , and you should use H.264 whenever you can .

Here is where you can configure the video settings for this profile . Let 's go through the options : <p> Video Codec : Select H.264 for MPEG-4 SP as your video codec . <p> Profile : For iPhone video , only one profile is available for each codec ( Simple Profile for MPEG-4 and Baseline Profile for H.264 ) . <p> Level : The " Level " determines the maximum resolution that is supported ( and taking into account the supported resolutions of the device/encoder ) . Level 2.1 and 3 are available to select for H.264 , 2.1 limits the resolution to 480x320 , while Level 3 limits the resolution to 640x480 <p> Bitrate ( kbps ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video - the higher the bitrate , the larger the file size ( you can use a bitrate calculator to work out the file size , or do it manually - 1 MB/s =&gt; 1024 KB/s =&gt; 8192 kbps ) . The bitrate is also dependent on the video resolution - 768 kbps should give you acceptable ( at least when viewed on the iPhone ) quality video for H.264 @ 480x320 . <p> Resolution : You should keep all the settings at " Original " , unless you want to resize the video . <p> AutoResize : Keep this enabled , this will automatically resize your video .

In that case try my method that does n't require illegal software or the need to shell out megabucks ! <p> I wo n't lie to you , though , there is no easy way to convert every Quicktime movie .

You can crop the image to a certain size ( C ) - it does n't support resizing unfortunately . If you need to resize or edit the video in any way I suggest you convert it and then do so in VirtualDub . You can also select how much of the video is to be converted ( B ) by selecting what frame to start the conversion from and what frame to end it . Finally we have the Audio Samplerate conversion ( D ) . This is not really needed most of the time because it may cause synch problems if we change it from the original .

@@98121136 @2321136/ <p> How to recreate a multi-title DVD into a single title DVD with free tools <p> Using DVD Shrink compiling technique , we can easy divide a DVD or DVDs into many different clips or titles and combine them into a single DVD . However , compiling technique with DVD Shrink does have a little drawback too : DVD Shrink still keeps these clips in separate titles and a quick but noticeable delay when DVD player goes from one title to another is completely annoying . To eliminate the delay , we can use DVD Shrink to compile and create multi-title DVD , remake it into a single-title DVD with all the free tools : VobEdit , IfoEdit , and rebuild and create the chapter points you like with Chapter Edit . <p> In this guide , I used the movie Finding Nemo for this guide . Below is the whole procedure step by step in detail : <p> Open the DVD in DVD Shrink , went to Re-author mode , and select the Title 1 main movie which has total 33 chapters At random , I save chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 for Title 1 ( 2 ) , chapters 28 and 29 for Title 1 ( 3 ) , and back them up to my hard drive . See the screenshot : <p> To recheck my work , I open the backup with DVD Shrink and here is what I have : a DVD with 3 titles . See the screenshot : <p> Next , I create the Renamed VOB Files folder and transfer all my . VOB files from the backed up VIDEOTS folder there and rename them into VTS01001.VOB , VTS01002.VOB , and VTS01003.VOB . Remember each VOB will become a separate chapter . See the screenshot : <p> Now let 's load VobEdit to join all the . VOB files together . Click Open and select the first . VOB file , VTS01001.VOB . Then go to File and select Join Clips . When the Save As dialog appears , create a new folder in HDD and name it as VIDEOTS , and type VTS011.VOB as the File name . Click Save when ready . See the screenshot : <p> A dialog will open and ask to specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1 ' to let the TitleSet start with VOB-ID 1 . Just press OK . See the screenshot : <p> When the joining process finishes , I close VobEdit and open the newly create VIDEOTS folder and here is what I have : A single VTS011.VOB . See the screenshot : <p> As you can see that the VIDEOTS folder in the above screenshot has only one VTS011.VOB without . IFO files . I now need IfoEdit to create IFO files . Start IfoEdit , press the Create IFOs button near the bottom to open the Create new IFO files window . On the " 1st VOB of Title-Set , press the button , select the VTS011.VOB in the VIDEOTS folder , and press Open . Make sure to select " Same as source " option . Press OK to start the process . See the screenshot : <p> Look at the VIDEOTS folder again , now I can see IFO files , BUP files , and VOB file . See the screenshot : <p> Well , it is time to use the 2COOLs excellent Mock Strip to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IFO in question ( VTS010.IFO ) . Click VOB Extras , make sure a to check only the options showed on the screenshot below , and browse to the Destination directory other than the original VIDEOTS folder , the Mock Strip Backup folder .

See the screenshot : <p> When the second Stream List which lists the VOB IDs appears , just press ( 1 ) Check All and ( 2 ) Strip it buttons again , and close IfoEdit after the process finishes . See the screenshot : <p> When IfoEdit finishes the Mock Strip process , I will have the new files in the Mock Strip Backup folder . Drag and drop or copy all the new files into the VIDEOTS folder and click " Yes to all " for the Confirm File Replacement . See the screenshot : <p> Open DVD Shrink and open the VIDEOTS folder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and happily without any error and there is one title only in the whole DVD instead of 3 titles like before . See the screenshot : <p> Now I want to see how many chapters the IfoEdit has created for my new file . I go to the Re-author mode , drag and drop the Title 1 , and start the Set Start/End Frames . You can see there are totally 15 chapters in all . See the screenshot : <p> It looks OK like that . What if I like to have my own chapters created at different parts of the movie ? Well , I need a different tool for this job the Chapter Edit 1.10 <p> Open Chapter Edit 1.10 , press the Ref button on the upper right side , click Root and browse to where I saved my file , and then click select . See the screenshot : <p> Press the Read VOB files ( R ) button and the Chapter Edit will show entire chapters in the Time List . See screenshot : <p> You can scroll down the entire movie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters you do n't  want to keep by pressing the Chapter on/off button . Or you can press the Clear Chapters button to clear all the original chapters and make all the new chapters after that . This process can be easily and accurately done with the programs preview window <p> I clear all the chapters first by pressing the Clear Chapters button and then add 4 new chapters by pressing the Chapter on/offbutton as mentioned above at frame 00001 , 00510 , 01002 , and 01500 . See the screenshot : <p> On the Output folder setting , choose where to save output and press the Create DVD Image ( G ) button and for the Chapter Edit to complete the process . Click Exit to close Chapter Edit when done . See the screenshot : <p> Now I used DVD Shrink to check if the DVD file created by Chapter Edit is in compliance with DVD format and how the chapter editing turned out to be . DVD Shrink could open the Chapter Edit created DVD file beautifully without error and there were exactly 4 chapters in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file and tested with my DVD player . The movie played smoothly without time delay and all the chapters responded correctly under my command with the remote control <p> Please help me attach those pictures to the guide . I hate myself so much for not being able to do that . I do n't know why I keep getting error uploading the URL for attachments . It just drives me nut . BTW , in the guide , I tried to use the Get VTS sectors only without the Mock Strip , the Get VST sectors could n't fix the Invalid Data error with VOB file . I had to run the Mock Strip to fix it and no need to use Get VST sectors . I agree with you 100% that using VobEdit way better than using IfoEdit only . Once again , much and much mahalo for your help <p> When you do the Mock Strip , you will strip stream and VOBID , correct VOB Unit or Navigation Pack pointer in the VOB file(s) , correct original IFO files , adjust VOB Unit pointers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , is somewhat similar to an IfoEdit Mock Strip , except that it 's faster , does not adjust as many things ( just the minimum in fact , to allow Shrink to load ) and does not mess the cell flags or the cell commands . <p> Thnx Ben &amp; Blu.I am very new to this.Till now FixVTS has served my purpose . And Ben , excellent guide.BTW , why do I need Shrink in the first place ? Ca n't I go straight to merging with Vobedit ? Another question.After creating my ifos using ifoedit the colour and font of the subtitles have changed.Any way to preserve the original format ? <p> Thanks for the nice compliment . The reason I would like to use DVD Shrink because , with DVD Shrink , you can use the Set Start/End Frames and sliders to select and compile different segments or clips of the DVD without having to use the whole . vob files . It 's strange to see that IfoEdit alters the subtitle 's font and color . In that case , I hope jeanl 's DVDSubEdit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to try this nice tool yet <p> In order to compare how the Mock Strip and FixVTS do to fix DVD Shrink error " Invalid data in VTSxxx file " , I redid the process of joining . vob files with VobEdit , created the new . ifo files with IfoEdit , and chose the default language . Testing with DVD Shrink , the " Invalid data in VTS011.VOB " did appear . In stead of using the Mock Strip , I ran the FixVTS and the result was : FixVTS did FIX the problem completely and beautifully . Please look at the screenshot of Step 10 in the guide , the Mock Strip created two zero byte files : VIDEOTS.VOB and VTS010.VOB . FixVTS fixed the problem without creating any extra files or altering the files sizes . Both of the tools can fix this particular kind of problem well . It 's up to you choose which tool to go for

@@98121138 @2321138/ <p> There is no such thing as a perfect solution but this one comes pretty close . For those of you who have small hard disks this is an effective way to convert a DVD to DivX directly from the CD ! Its been made possible by a non-official " hacked " version of Flask Mpeg . Its called FlasKMpeg Decss 0.594h1 . This version actually has some improvements on the old FlasK Mpeg . For one it seems to have fixed the aspect ratio problems for NTSC movies . <p> Other great features are that it can outline in white where the cropping will be on you image rather than just deleting it as the old Flask did . This feature is useful because before you did n't know how much of the image you may be loosing . Also , the slider bar above the image allows you to select any part of the movie , so instead of getting some crud dark scene that is no good for resizing , you can check anywhere you like to see if it is cropped correct and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Radium MP3 and the DivX codec 's you may as well do so now . Remember to run the " run me first " option on the DivX install too or it will not be installed correctly . <p> Flask Mpeg has two main modes : <p> Open File : This will open any mpeg file and try to convert it to whatever you want . <p> Open DVD : This is a special mode that reads a DVD in the same way a DVD player would . This means you will be able to select to convert with subtitles ; it will also make sure it only rips one angle in a multi-angle DVD . This prevents repeated scenes spoiling your movie ! <p> IMPORTANT NOTE ! ! : There have been reports about DVD drives overheating when forced to read at a much slower pace than single-speed DVD . Flask DeCSS has been tested on a few DVD-Rom 's without problem . And I 've never heard first hand of a drive being damaged in this way , but you might want to keep an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD-ROM . If you decide to try this program it is your own choice , I take no responsability for any damage you may do to your hardware by using this program ! You have been warned ! <p> AUTHENTICATE THE DRIVE <p> Basically just run SmartRipper but do n't try and rip anything with SmartRipper , just run it and hit the minamize button . Bingo ! Your drive is authenticated ! <p> OPEN THE FILE WITH ' Open DVD ' <p> Select ' Open DVD ' and find the . IFO file for your movie.Up will pop something like the picture below : <p> Select the movie Duration , in this case 1.51.53 . This will usually be the first one in the list , but you can usually see from the length which one to choose . <p> Next choose the language . Obviously they can not ALL be English so choose the first and encode a minuet of the film and listen to it . If its not English choose the next in the list , and the next and the next etc. , until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DVD player and see the order they are in , usually it will be the same . <p> Lastly we have subtitles . I do n't usually select any because I do n't want them on my movie . If you choose subtitles then you will not be able to turn them off , they will ALWAYS be on your movie ! Flask is not always able to do subtitles correctly , so again , you will have to try it and see . There are other ways to get subtitles , though ; why not check out my subtitle ripping section for this . <p> Now Press FlasK this DVD ! <p> GETTING THE DECRYPTION KEY <p> This is the only annoying bit : ) . Up pops a dialouge box asking for the decryption key to the DVD . <p> We must use the command line utility Vobdec ( which , by the way , is what 99% of GUI rippers use as their ripping engine ) . Anyway , its not that hard . Make a folder on your main hard drive ( usually C : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file into it and we are ready to go : <p> Go to Start Menu &gt; Run and type Command.com to bring the DOS Prompt up ie : <p> Type : CD and press Enter . Type : CD vobdec and press Enter . <p> Now , cut and paste the following line into the DOS prompt and press Enter : <p> vobdec d : videotsvts011.vob <p> Note that the green d is the name of the drive you have the DVD in . Its usually d : but change it to whatever your DVD drive says . After searching vobdec will find the key and give a number like this : <p> E1 69 03 06 00 <p> Just type them into the boxes below . <p> Its easy to find any key with vobdec because all you do is type the location of the vob file and it will decrypt it . Often the main movie will be on the vts011.vob file . But if it is not , just change the vob name to whatever vob file you wish to find the key . To illustrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file vts021.vob then you paste into the DOS Prompt : <p> vobdec d : videotsvts021.vob <p> If you wanted to check out the second in the list you put : <p> vobdec d : videotsvts022.vob <p> When you have a key , encode a 30 second clip of the movie . If you see bright green mess on the screen and / or Flask crashes you have been given the wrong Key ! You have just been unlucky . Keep trying different vob files on the DVD and writing down the key 's , eventually one of them should do the trick . <p> SETTING UP YOUR RIP - GLOBAL PROJECT OPTIONS <p> Select Global Project options . <p> VIDEO TAB <p> Frame Size : In the Width and Height sections you can put the size you wish your final video to be . If you wish to crop your movie too you can select the ' Show Output Pad ' at the bottom right . For detailed information on how to resize a movie in Flask read section 2nd of this guide : " resizing the video " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose the best framerate for your movie . All PAL movies ( European ) are 25 frames per second ( fps ) . So if you know your movie is PAL make sure your movie is set to 25 . All North American movies are NTSC which means they are 29.97 fps . BUT because of the way they are encoded to DVD most will appear Flask will choose 23.976 fps . This is usually correct so do n't change it . Flask DeCSS sometimes chooses PAL instead of NTSC so be careful . And as always test a short clip before you do a whole movie to make sure its ok . <p> iDCT Options : Just leave these alone its overkill to use IEEE and the quality will not look better . <p> Video Structure : Do not check the deinterlace button unless you really need it because the video will decode very slow . For a full explanation of the interlace problem , check out my article : " Video Formats : NTSC &amp; PAL / Telecine " in the appendix section . <p> Deinterlace video <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Threshold setting is basically how much it blurs problem lines . The lower the number the more it blurs it . If the interlace problem is really bad you should use a setting of 1-5 instead of 20 . If its not very bad you could use 15-20 . <p> If Flask ( or you ) select the Time Base of 24 or 23.976 fps then there will be the extra option called ' Reconstruct progressive images ' . This option is grayed out in the above picture . Flask automatically tries to detect the real framerate inside the DVD . This setting is not an IVTC ( inverse telecine ) ; it just forces Flask Mpeg to 24fps progressive mode , avoiding potential interlace problems if the movie is 24 but the playback is set to 29.976 . <p> So you want to know what you should do with them , right ? ! For PAL movies , I have found that there is no point selecting anything but 25fps and you will not need ' reconstruct progressive images ' . In fact , you will almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure , I think the general opinion is to let Flask choose or ignore it . <p> AUDIO TAB <p> On to the Audio tab always select ' Decode audio ' if you want sound . For DVD 's un-check the ' same as input box ' and select 48000 Hz ( just to make sure you have the right setting ) . For Mpeg-1 you 'd use same as input or 44100Hz . Never use 44100Hz with DVD 's or you will get audio synchronization problems . <p> If you just want to copy the DVD 's AC3 audio across instead of converting it use the ' Direct Stream copy ' option . <p> POST PROCESSING TAB <p> This section deals almost exclusively with resizing . Never use ' Nearest Neighbouring ' unless you are not resizing the picture because the quality is crud . Contrary to popular belief Bilinear looks just as nice as Bicubic , except it is twice as fast . JASC ( makers of Paint Shop Pro ) recommend Bilinear for shrinking images and Bicubic for enlarging them . But use what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAL users should always tick this box unless you know you do n't need it . This is even more important with Widescreen DVD 's . If you use NTSC DVD 's the image may become stretched slightly wrongly . If you notice this uncheck the ' keep aspect ratio ' and work out the ratio yourself . See the article " Resizing DVD 's with Correct Aspect Ratios " in my appendix . <p> Crop &amp; Letterboxing : All the settings for cropping and letterboxing the DVD can be entered here or the output pad can be used . For detailed information on how to resize a movie in Flask read section 2nd of this guide : " resizing the video " . <p> FILES TAB <p> Choose where you want to save your final movie . The audio save option is grayed out because you are encoding the video with audio in it . If you selected ' Direct Stream Copy ' on the previous Audio Tab then you could say where you wanted it saved . <p> GENERAL TAB <p> Compiling Time : This speaks for itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box it will convert the whole DVD . If you uncheck it you can say how many seconds to encode . Obviously 60 is one minuet and 120 is two mins . The frames to compile is basically the same thing . There are 25 frames to one second of video for PAL and either 23.976 or 29.970 for NTSC . Using these options you can encode a small clip to test the quality etc . I recommend you shut down and restart Flask just before you encode a long movie to reduce chances of it crashing . <p> Search Size : This searches the DVD for the audio . As it says , if you have problems make the number bigger . If all else fails and you can not find audio you can try one of the other methods I explain in the section : " DVD Audio Extraction " . <p> Miscellaneous : Like the thing says , it 'll shut down the computer if it can when its done : ) <p> That 's it you 're nearly ready to encode ! Let 's set the output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Output Format Options . <p> And up will pop the box shown below : <p> Features and Future Features : Flask has an option to ' Split files after ' a certain amount of seconds . This is useful if you want a VCD to be split in half so that one part can be put on a single CD . I do n't use it for Divx because I prefer to split them in VirtualDub . To use it , just work out how many seconds there are in the movie . If the movie is 131 minuets then multiply 131 by 60 and you have the seconds ( 7860 seconds ) then just divide that in half and you have your split number ( 3930 ) . <p> Enable Watermark : This let 's you use any bitmap picture you want as a logo . So you can make a little picture saying made by ' smiffy ' or whatever you like . The X and Y boxes let you say where the logo will appear on the movie . Then you have three options on how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sticks the bitmap on top . It can " Mask " which let 's part of the image become transparent . Or it can " Alpha " which makes the whole image transparent . I do not recommend using logos because they increase the filesize of the picture and degrade the quality . <p> Select Codec : These are the important buttons ! Hit the top one and the following box appears : <p> Choose the Divx ; - ) MPEG-4 ' Low or High Motion codec from the drop down list depending on what you want . For getting the best setting you can look at my article : " Best Divx Quality &amp; Bitrate Guide " in the appendix . But in short , use a bitrate calculator to determine the best bitrate to put in here . I 'm using the ' Advanced Divx Bitrate Calc ! Version 1.5 ' . It seems to give a more reliable amount and will not make a movie larger than you intend . <p> Just put the DVD movie length in minuets in the top box . Select the audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always be 96 kBit/s Stereo ) . Then it will tell you the amount to use ! In the above picture the calculator says 581 so you would move the ' Data Rate slider bar to 581 instead of the 750 it is in the above picture . As for keyframes , I tend to use a keyframe every 1 second , but you can use one every 10 seconds to saves more memory . Then set the ' Crispiness to 75% and you are done ! <p> Choose ' MPEG Layer-3 ' at 96 kBit/s 48,000Hz . You can choose what you like here , 128 or 190 etc. , if you prefer , but there is no need it will just make the file size larger . <p> There are two problems with converting the audio to Mp3 . First , the audio must be 48,000Hz . Some sound cards can not handle the format and so it may play the audio back dull and buzzing . Secondly , because of the dynamic range of a DVD the audio level will sound very low and may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dull Audio , Normalization &amp; Samplerates " for a detailed explanation and a solution to all this . In short , you can choose PCM audio instead of mp3 and add it later . So here is where you would do that . Instead of choosing Mp3 choose PCM 48,000Hz 16bit , Stereo . No other audio format will work in Flask without potential problems ! <p> Warning ! PCM Wav audio is uncompressed and creates a seriously large movie file 1-2GB ! If you are making a single CD rip you will probably be okay using PCM audio . If you are making a 2 CD rip , your file may be so large that VirtualDub will not open it and Windows will not play it ! This is annoying because Divx Mpeg4 can be larger than 2GB and would normally probably work okay at anything upto 4GB . But Flask seems to create a file that is corrupted at these sizes ! So , the PCM Wav is an advanced option that should be treated with great respect ! If you are a beginner just use Mp3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up your movie just go to Run &gt; Start Conversion . <p> Up will pop the following screen . <p> If you are going to leave your computer alone to compress then select Highest in the ' Priority settings ' . This will hog ALL CPU power to make compression faster . This CPU option only really works if other programs are running when Flask is though ! When using idle or normal , you will be able to do basic tasks while it is compressing , such as checking Email etc . Be careful not to do too much because if your computer crashes because of another program then you 'll need to start over again . Unchecking the ' Display output ' box will also help speed things up a little . But if you are using a Dual Processor computer system just leave it on normal otherwise it slows it down . <p> That 's it !

Maybe I do n't know enough about the topic of filters but since I use AVISYNTH and its various filters , my question was more specific as to what type of resize filter is being used ?

In your post it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you can add different resize filters for example . <p> Weel , I 'm still new to this and do n't know too much about this stuff , but the resize filter setarip is talking about looks like an internal one . However , Virtualdub does have a plugin folder for adding filter plugins with the " vdf " file extension , if that 's what you mean . 
@@98121144 @2321144/ <p> The amount of filters available for VirtualDub is growing fast . If you want to see the latest selection get ' em Here . To install new filters is really easy , just download , unzip , and put them inside the the VirtualDub folder called ' Plugins ' . Then the next time you run VirtualDub they will appear . And just to recap , to use the filters we go to : File &gt; Filters . If you have n't read my last article on Filters go Here . <p> Let 's face it most video capture has at least some noise or sharpness problems unless we are using very expensive equipment or have a very good quality source to record from . This is why VirtualDub has a selection of useful filters designed to correct bad colour , brightness , saturation , noise , smoothness and a whole bunch of other things . So here I will give you a few tips on some of the filters that I use and how they can be applied effectively . <p> SUBTLE NOISE REDUCTION <p> Ideally we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to make it look good . Its very easy to go overboard and stick five or more powerful filters in the hope that the final result will look great . In actual fact the least changes necessary will usually results in the best results . Using filters seriously slows down compressing time so I suppose this will help to limit your use of them a little too . <p> Do n't expect any of these subtle noise reduction filters to work miracles because they wo n't . Noise reduction without loss of detail is almost impossible because the original information is not there . There are another selection of what I like to call ' Hard Core ' filters that will do some amazing things but these work by making large changes to the original image . But it is possible to use these in conjunction with the more subtle ones to achieve a good balance . <p> Using the Dynamic Noise Reduction Filter <p> Most noise reduction filters work on the idea that the same noise disruption will not appear in two or more frames in exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second frame in the sequence and get rid of minor changes . This is basically what the Dynamic Noise Reduction filter does . It does n't need much explanation , really , because it only has one slider bar . The higher you set it the more it will reduce subtle noise errors found in your video . The only problem with this is the higher you set it the more it will tend to merge two frames together . This produces an annoying ghosting effect like this : <p> The one on the left is the original . The one on the right has ghosting because of the high level of noise reduction ! <p> Using the Temporal Cleaner Filter <p> The Temporal Cleaner is a bit better than the Dynamic in some ways although its based on the same idea . The reason it is slightly better is mainly because it is designed to only copy across parts of the image that do n't move at all . This helps greatly to reduce the ghosting effect . The down side is controls are more confusing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A threshold is how different one part of the picture is to the one next to it . If you are used to using the ' magic wand ' option in Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro then you should have a good idea of what this means for a picture . Imagine a light colour and a dark colour ten times darker than it . If we set a threshold of 10 then both colours would be considered as exactly the same . If the threshold was set to 9 or below then the colours would be considered as not the same . The average threshold of any high colour image is about 35 pixels which is Adobe 's default setting for Photoshop . <p> ( A ) This defines how different whole one frame is to the one next to it . It describes the whole frame and not just parts of it . If it decides one frame is totally different from the next it restarts the comparison between it and the next frame . This is designed as a safety function to prevent parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if its too high you will get some ghosting effects , if its too low it will lessen the amount of noise it can delete . <p> ( D ) Process in YUV colorspace allows you to set both the brightness thresholds ( luminance ) and colour threshold ( chrominance ) more exactly . Basically you should check this box for best quality and uncheck it if speed is more important . <p> The settings are now split into two parts . Brightness thresholds are listed on the left hand side of the GUI and Colour thresholds are described on the right hand side . <p> ( B ) Luminance Threshold . This can be any number from 0-255 . Luminance basically means brightness . Just imagine the picture was only black and white . In that case this threshold ignores all colour decides just how different the shadows are between one frame and the next . <p> ( F ) Brightness pixel lock feature . This keeps pixels that are almost the same brightness between two or more frames locked exactly the same position for as long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will start to see a spray of dots where things move from one frame to the next . <p> ( C ) Colour threshold setting . This refers to how deferent colours are from each other between two or more frames . The human eye is less sensitive to colour settings than it is to brightness so these can be made higher thresholds than the same brightness settings on the left . This seems to be the main reason the default settings are higher . <p> ( G ) Colour pixel lock feature . This keeps pixels that are almost the same colour between two or more frames locked exactly the same position for as long as it can . This setting should usually be very low because you will start to see a spray of dots where things move from one frame to the next . <p> ( E ) Allow to lock luminance . This is a kind of add on feature that may not help much with noise reduction . It compares the chrominance threshold to the luminance threshold on any locked pixels and tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well that 's about it ! The show motion area is not a noise reduction option . It is only there to show you what area of the picture is being changed by the noise reduction . Unchanged parts will appear as blue . Moving parts will be black . Gray shows brightness locked pixels . Usually it produces one big mess but it may help you to see what is going on with the setting you are using . <p> Phew ! After all that explaining you 'd expect some big results from this thing ! But , again , I 'm sorry to say that no noise reduction can truly reduce noise because noise has become part of the picture . You can no more tell a computer to remove the noise dots then you can tell it to remove an eye from a person . <p> HARD CORE NOISE REDUCTION <p> Using the Smart Smoother Filter <p> Take a look at the picture on the left . I captured it when the aerial was not tuned in correctly to simulate a lot of noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Threshold 200 ) to clean it up . Its not perfect , but I 'm sure you will agree that the noise is a lot less . <p> The filter work 's with two settings the diameter and threshold . The Diameter is how many pixels it effects at a time . The more you use the more blurry the image will appear . And the Threshold is a check to see how different one colour is from the next . A lower threshold is quite good for cartoons because it tends to make solid blocks of colour . As always experimentation is he best method . <p> Using the 2D Cleaner Filter <p> This is one of my favorite filters because it can be very subtle and yet powerful at the same time . Its basically very similar to the previous Smart Smoother in operation but after a while of using I think you will prefer it for most stuff . <p> All these filters are basically selective blurring filters . They allow you to control how much of the picture is blurred and how much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 enough , in fact a radius of 1 may be better if the noise is not too bad . The higher the radius the longer it will take to reduce noise and the more blurry the overall picture will be . The threshold does n't exactly say how blurry the picture will be but defines how sharp fine details will be . In laymen 's terms this means that the higher the threshold the smoother the look at the expense of fine detail , but the lower the threshold the more ' plastic ' the picture will appear . The first thought is to use a threshold setting that is lowest so as to keep the sharpest edges , but this results in a plastic cartoon-like effect . I suggest you start at in the hundreds . I usually start at 150 and work my way down a little until it looks good . But again , this is all dependent on the picture you may need to go even higher or much lower . <p> The picture below is a good example of how it works . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encoded a video clip with very low bitrate to get some macroblocks and then I used the 2D Cleaner ( Radius 2 ; Threshold 90 ) to try and delete them . As you can see , the 2D cleaner is able to blur out the small block-like areas but still keep a fair amount of detail . <p> HUE , SATURATION , LEVELS &amp; FOCUS <p> Saturation <p> Saturation is the strength of a the colours in a video . If you have too much colour ( as is very often the case with video capture cards ) then you may need to turn the saturation down . A completely non-saturated image is gray and a totally saturated image is almost solid blocks of colour . <p> This first image is deceptive because it still looks quite nice ( I 'm talking about the colour not the girl ... well , her too : ) . Anyhoo , people are naturally drawn to highly coloured images and it gives over a dreamy effect . Nevertheless , there is far too much colour in this image and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . To fix it you must use the Hue / Saturation / Intensity filter . Just turn the saturation down a little and it will look okay . <p> This next image has far too little colour in it and is starting to look almost black and white . This is a more obvious problem and the saturation needs to be turned up a little this time - be careful not to overdo it though . <p> This final image has a good balanced saturation and matches the original video well . Provided you have a good video and TV , its always a good idea to view the captured image alongside the original so you can be more objective about the true colours . <p> Hue <p> Hue is basically the overall colour tendency . You rarely need to adjust the hue of a video but just to keep it complete I 'll explain a bit about it . Sometimes a image will be a little more red than it should be or a little more green etc . If you notice that this is the case then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hue / Saturation / Intensity filter again . Usually you will only need to adjust it by a very very small amount . Its really just a matter of looking and seeing what is right . Forget about the intensity option with the Hue / Saturation / Intensity filter because the levels filter is more exact in this area . <p> Levels <p> Take a look at the picture below , no , do n't adjust your computer screens its meant to look like that : ) . A photo can be described as being made up of three parts shadows , midtones and highlights . I have simplified the picture below to show them better . <p> Forget colour for a second , the level control only effect the brightness and grey tones of an image . Let 's say a black and white photo is only 255 tones . Tone 0 is pure black and 255 is pure white . Now look at the two bars below : <p> These bars represent the brightness of the picture from left being darkest to the right as the lightest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , that is , how dark 0 starts at and how light 255 will finish . Remember that 255 represents the brightest colour and 0 the darkest . So if 0 actually starts as a gray then the overall picture will look much lighter ! <p> If we move the black arrow of the bottom left bar to the right , it will make all the dark parts brighter . This gives almost exactly the same effect you would get from turning the brightness up ( but without increasing the intensity ) . Conversely , the white arrow on the bottom right will move the bright values down . The main difference between this and adjusting the brightness is that the contrast ( the ratio between how much dark and how much light exists ) is not effected - it just ' washes ' the image darker or lighter . <p> Next the ' input levels ' bar above still represents all the tone values in the image from 0-255 as the one below , but this time it let 's us change the ratios between them . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will increase the shadows in the picture . If you move the far-right arrow left you will increase the highlights . The center arrow represents the ratio between the two . If we move it to the left it will give us much less shadows , making the picture appear more flat . If we move it to the right it will give much more shadows , making the picture appear hard and defined . The default value is 1.0 . <p> As I 'm sure you already realise , this filter is more powerful than just changing the brightness and contrast of a picture and gives you a lot of control to fine tune your image and get the best effect . <p> Using the Unsharp Mask Filter <p> To sharpen or blur an video using a sharpen or blur filter is easy enough to do , just set the amounts . But if you really want control over how your image is sharpened then you can not beat the unsharp mask filter . It has a strange name but it let 's you control what areas are sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you sharpen a video it sees the edges of the picture as black . Because sharpening increases the difference 's between adjacent colours it will automatically make a white mark around the edges that could get annoying ( see the picture below ) . Edge masking simply let 's you take out the sharpening effects on each edge . By moving the Top , Bottom , Left and Right slider bars you can delete all sharpening effects to any of these areas . <p> Now edge masking is explained all we need to worry about is the top three slider bars , the Diameter , Strength and Threshold . But first , take a look at the original captured image . It looks a little too blurry and we want it to look sharper . <p> To see just what is going on I think its best to start with quite a high sharpening strength . So keep everything on its lowest setting and turn it up until you see large changes . I 've used the full strength of 250 below ( Diameter 3 ; Strength 250 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Diameter does . It basically shows what parts of the picture will become sharpest . A setting of 3 is the smallest amount and 11 the largest . Usually you will not need to go much higher than 3 unless you want to get a certain effect like to enhance highlights etc . But the picture below is Diameter 7 ; Strength 250 ; Threshold 0 . <p> Finally we can see what the Threshold does . The Threshold controls what percentage of the picture is effected by the sharpening . If you have a large threshold only the finest details of picture will be affected and the rest of the picture unaltered . If you have a very small threshold then most of the image will be sharpened . The picture below has Diameter 7 ; Strength 250 ; Threshold 4 . <p> Okay , 250 Strength is far too strong , so let 's lower it a bit until the picture looks normal again . Then all we need to do is increase the strength a little bit at a time until the picture looks nice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the final sharpened version ( Diameter 5 ; Strength 31 ; Threshold 2 ) . <p> This picture could actually look a lot sharper but I felt that the diagonal lines ( due to the aerial signal ) were too noticeable so I used a slightly more blurred effect . <p> Final Notes <p> Well , I have explained some of the more complicated but most useful filters for video enhancing . There are a whole bunch of others too but doing a guide on them all would be crazy and take ages . I recommend you take some time to try out each filter . Read the instructions about them on the creators websites or instructions . The links to each website will be found on the VirtualDub homepage . For those with interlace problems do n't forget that there are a bunch of smart deinterlacer filters . And for those who struggle with flickery video there is at least one anti-flicker filter . <p> I think it is important now to give one final warning ! A small picture may look great with just about any filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie ( or a small clip of it before you apply the filter to the whole movie ) . Do this by playing it full screen with your monitor brightness both normal and turned up much higher than you normally would have it .

@@98121152 @2321152/ <p> AVISynth is a really cool utility , yet it seems very few people are using it ! The reason many have n't started is probably not because AVISynth is hard to use , but basically because they downloaded it , double-clicked on each file to try and get it working only to find that it does n't seem to do anything ! ? So perhaps it may be a good idea if I explained what AVISynth does and how it can be used ! <p> What can we do with AVISynth ? <p> Let 's say you downloaded a weird format video file and wanted to edit it with VirtualDub or convert it to Mpeg with Panasonic Mpeg encoder or with some other Mpeg / AVI etc. , encoder . It would normally be impossible to do this because neither VirtualDub nor Panasonic Mpeg Encoder supports this format . Windows Media Player , however , is usually able to play just about any file with no problems . If it can not play it there will usually be a codec you can install that will allow Media Player to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it usually AVISynth will let you open it in whatever application you need ! This even applies to Mpeg-2 files ! Yep , that 's right ! If Media Player can play your Mpeg-2 file then AVISynth will let you open them in almost any video editing or converting utility ! <p> But that is not all ! Before it sends the video to be opened in VirtualDub ( or whatever application you want ) it gives you the option to do all sorts of things to the video ! You can resize it , crop it , sharpen , blend , separate interlaced fields , delete frames , duplicate frames , add 3:2 pulldown , reweave interlaced fields , bob deinterlace , convert between YUY2 and RGB and a whole host of other interesting and useful features ! <p> How does it work ? <p> AVISynth acts as a go-between between your video file and any video application you wish to use . You install AVISynth by putting a small . dll program in the Windows System folder . This is almost like a Windows upgrade , it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through AVISynth . In turn AVISynth decodes them using Media Players codec 's and sends them to the application you were opening them with - cool huh ! <p> Basically to do this you need to write a simple text file saying what file you wish to open ( just like making a . lst file for Mpeg2avi ) and rename the text file with an *. avs extension . Then , when you open this file in VirtualDub or Panasonic Mpeg Encoder ( or whatever application you are using ) AVISynth will take over and covert it for that application . <p> Do n't worry , it may not sound too clear to you right now , but its not hard and after you have followed my step-by-step examples you will be able to set it up and open any file in seconds . So without further delay let 's get started . <p> Lesson 1 : DVD to AVI with AVISynth ! <p> Since we are Mpeg-2 obsessed at Digital Digest , what better than to show you how to open a DVD in VirtualDub . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or edit Vob files ... we will soon change that ! <p> Can you open DVD or Mpeg-2 in Media Player ? <p> As I mentioned , AVISynth can open just about any file that Media Player can handle . But if you can not open a Vob file in Media Player then you will need to install the Ligos and WinDVD codec 's first so Media Player can . This is easy enough to do : <p> After you have downloaded and unzipped AVISynth you should end up with a folder containing the following files : <p> Cut and paste the first file called avisynth.dll into your C : WindowsSystem folder . Then double-click on the install.reg file and the program will be installed . To uninstall it double-click on the uninstall.reg . To uninstall you can also delete the avisynth.dll file from your WindowsSystem folder but that 's up to you . <p> Can not find the DLL file ? <p> If you can not find the avisynth.dll file then its very likely that windows is hiding it from you . Windows hides all files that have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and cause windows to become corrupted ! To view all files you should open windows explorer and go to : <p> View &gt; Folder Options ... <p> Hit the View tab button and select the option : Show all files <p> This will allow you to see the avisynth.dll file and place it in the Windowssystem folder : ) . If you are worried about people accidentally deleting DLL files you can turn the ' hide hidden or system files ' option on . <p> Creating an AVS File <p> Okay , all the hard work is done ! Make a folder on your main drive ( usually C : ) and put the Vob file you wish to open inside it . I have called my folder vobfilesand the file I 'm going to open is called VTS0101.Vob . <p> So open windows notepad ( or any text editor ) and type the following into it : <p> DirectShowSource ( " C : vobfilesVTS0101.Vob " ) <p> As usual the colours are mine and here to help explain this line means . The DirectShowSource is a command that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in brackets and quotation marks , we say what file we wish to open . In this case I said look for the Vob file in the folder C : vobfiles and called VTS0101.Vob . <p> Save it ! <p> Anyway , save the file as whatever you like but put the extension . *. avs on it instead of . txt or . doc etc . I 'm calling my text file movie.avs . So when I choose Save in notepad I will type the filename " movie.avs " make sure you use quotation marks ( " " ) to force notepad to save it as avs instead of txt . Again , it will not work if the text file is called movie.avs.txt or movie.avs.doc or something like that . <p> Opening the File in VirtualDub <p> Okay , time to open our Vob file . Were are going to use VirtualDub , but , as I said before almost any program will open the avs file . Load VirtualDub and go to : <p> File &gt; Open <p> Find the avs file you made : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just like it was an AVI file ! <p> That 's right ! Has he discovered how much his son likes apple pie , or has he just learnt about what AVISynth can do ? You decide ! <p> AVISynth does n't offer the ultimate solution for DVD conversion . For one thing it can not handle subtitles or multiangles directly like Flask Mpeg can . Also , if Media Player can not open a Vob file or if it can not play the sound you will not be able to get it in VirtualDub either ! All in all VirtualDub may not be as fast or versatile at manipulating Vob files another dedicated program such as Mpeg2avi because it was designed solely for that purpose . Nevertheless , have a play and see what you can come up with : ) . But do n't forget , AVISynth is not just for opening Vob files it can handle almost any file . <p> Advanced avs Files <p> That introduction tells us the basics , but there is so much more AVISynth can do with these files before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open them in . I will not explain every possibility because that 's a mammoth task . Instead , I will explain how to use some of the basic commands and then you will know how to design your own better . <p> Opening ASF and MOV files <p> Its not an exact science but you can often open many MOV or ASF files . Both MicroSofts ASF and Apples QuickTime are generic codecs . This means that different codecs are used for both ASF and QuickTime files but they are still called ASF or MOV . What I 'm trying to say is you can open some but not others . To open them you usually need to specify the Framerate . You do that like this : <p> LONG ... <p> Opening Multiple Files <p> If you want to open lots of files so they open as one single file like making a mpeg2avi . lst file , all you need to do is add a plus ( + ) sign and tell it which files to join . For example , instead of this in out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vob files : 01 , 02 , 03 &amp; 04 as though it were a single file . <p> Other File Opening Options <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) . As we have already seen , this command will open just about any file that Media Player can play . This includes audio files such as WAV , MP3 etc . For example , you could open just about any audio file in an audio editing package such as SoundForge even if SoundForge did n't support that format . Just make an avs text file like we did before and open it in SoundForge the way you did VirtualDub . Unfortunately ASF files do not work correctly and look upside down and ma not have any sound : ( . <p> There is also an experimental Vob opening command called : <p> VOBVideoSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> But this may or may not work for you so you may wish to swap DirectShowSource and VOBVideoSource . <p> AVISynth also offers other AVI opening commands . The reason for this is because handler may be able to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may be supported better by the application AVISynth is opening it in . <p> AVISource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> AVIFileSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> OpenDMLSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> So between this lot you should be able to open almost anything . <p> WAVSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> This command is designed for opening wave files . <p> Video Editing Commands <p> Once you 've decided how you will open the file you can command AVISynth to do stuff with them beforeit sends them to the application you wish to open it with . This is very useful if you need to crop or resize or something like that but the application you want to open it in does n't let you . All this crap may sound a little like we are about to learn a programming language , but really its just a matter of listing what things you want done . For example , say we want to open the file but make it half the size it was originally , we could put : <p> DirectShowSource ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to do ! Save the avs text file as usual and open it in VirtualDub to see how it looks . You will find that it opens the video file but at half of its original size ! <p> Okay , let 's add to that . Let 's say the application you wish to open the file in prefers the RGB AVI format but your original file is in YUY2 format we could put : <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> ReduceBy2 <p> ConvertToRGB <p> This time it will open the file , half its size and change the format to RGB . Notice also how I have just added this new command to the last one like a shopping list : ) . Each command can usually be just stuck underneath the last and AVISynth will perform them in that order . <p> File Command Order <p> The order in which you ask AVISynth to perform commands can affect both what the final result looks like and how fast the option is completed . For example , say we opened a huge 720 x 576 pixel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resize it to 352 x 288 according to a bicubic resize . We could do it like this : <p> AVISource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> Sharpen(1.0) <p> BicubicResize(352,240) <p> But that is a slow way to do it because this way the sharpen filter comes first in the list . Obviously it takes longer to sharpen a 720 x 576 image than it takes to sharpen a 352 x 288 image ! So instead its better to do it in this order : <p> AVISource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> BicubicResize(352,240) <p> Sharpen(1.0) <p> This way the image is shrunk first and then sharpened after . <p> We can also repeat effects . For example , if you wanted to make it twice as sharp you could do this : <p> AVISource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> Sharpen(1.0) <p> Sharpen(1.0) <p> Note : Not all programs will be able to handle every option or some repeated sequences of options so its trial and error . For example , VirtualDub will often crash if you try and feed it a Vob file with multiple AVISynth alterations added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't finish this article without saying a few words about AVISynth 's Field and Framerate commands . So here are a few that should help you get started . <p> Bob <p> This is one of the easiest ways to solve those NTSC interlace problems when opening the file in an application that can not deinterlace it . You could use : <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> Bob <p> Simple as that ! You may be interested to know that Bob is the method that PowerDVD uses most often to solve those annoying interlace combing problems . This will fix all interlaced files that look corrupted like the following picture : <p> Another handy little feature that let 's you separate the top and bottom frames of an interlaced picture . If for example you will be resizing an video file from 576 pixels high to 288 pixels high or lower an easy way to both speed things up and completely solve all interlace problems without any loss of detail s literally to separate fields . This can be done thusly : <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames in the movie because its now giving you frame 1 ( top field ) frame 2 ( bottom field ) . So a 30fps movie becomes a 60 fps movie . So you may want to use the SelectEven or SelectOdd commands to fix this . Either command will select every other frame in the file . So select odd may just leave you with only bottom or top video fields . To use it just add SelectOdd to the list , like this : <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> SeparateFields <p> SelectOdd <p> This will make the 60 fps back into 30 . All these options should n't take very much processing power because AVISynth is only taking the information from the file in a certain order , it does n't need to do heavy calculations on it . <p> You may be wondering why your movie now looks like a pancake ! This is because it only has half the lines it did originally . Like I said you intend on resizing the movie anyway and this solves both interlace problems and cuts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resize : ) . To make the final image complete we simply use a BilinearResize option like this : <p> DirectShowSource ( " filename&amp;location " ) <p> SeparateFields <p> SelectOdd <p> BilinearResize(384,208) <p> LEARNING MORE COMMANDS <p> Want to Learn More about AVISynth commands ?

@@98121162 @2321162/ <p> Not sure if this is the correct place to post this but I 'll give it a shot . I recently got married and we just got our proofs back from our photographers . So here 's the situation : The first photographer , Michelle , gave us a DVD-R with 550 jpg images on it . We tried putting it into our computer but it tells me it 's a blank CD . I tried many times to get it to work and was about to call and complain when I decided to try it in our DVD player . Low and behold , it works ! We sat for 4 hours looking at the pics but it kind of sucked because our TV does n't really let us see what they would look like in real life . But it was better than nothing . <p> Now , for the real problem . Our second photographer , Jesse , gave us a DVD-R of his pics and when we tried it in the computer nothing happened . It did n't even think it was blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed red and would n't open . We eneded up manually ejecting it with a paper clip . When we try watching it in the DVD player it also wo n't work . So what can we do ? Bill , our contact for the photographers claims they should work in the computer just fine . I 've tried finding new drivers but the DVD drive shows up simply as " ATAPI DVD DD 2X16X4X16 " in the device manager and I do n't remember what company it was from . After reading a bit I used dvdinfo to find that the firmware revision is G7C9 which I ca n't find much about . <p> I 've read some on updating the firmware to BenQ , would this work for me ? We 've have n't had many problems with our DVD recorder in the past . The only thing I can think of is sometimes when I buy a new CD it wo n't recognize it at first . Once I eject it a few times it works though . <p> Thanks for the quick replys . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows on the tv . It cycles through the 550 pics although you can type a number and jump right to a pic . I decided to just go buy a new DVD drive and give it a try . I think I got my current one a year and a half ago pretty cheap so it would n't hurt to have a newer one . If it does n't fix the problem I could always return the drive . I 'll let you know what happens . <p> if the second does n't open in my computer so you can see the files with a new drive and it does the same on another computer get another dvd burned for you , tell them to use verbatim and burn slower ? ? ? <p> your old drive is already a benq 1620 oem , but your firmware is older than the hills <p> boot into safe mode and update to the latest G series with drive empty <p> OK , so I got a Samsung SH-S203N and installed it . The first DVD ( from Michelle ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys were right about the second DVD ( from Jesse ) , it does n't show up under My Computer when I put it in .

I know he uses a Mac Powerbook , could that be causing a compatability problem ? It 's getting late so I will try updating my old drive 's firmware tomorrow afternoon . Thank you so much for the help , she 's going to love seeing these pictures tomorrow ! <p> I guess I 'll call him tomorrow and try to get another one with the settings you told me . I know he uses a Mac Powerbook , could that be causing a compatability problem ? <p> being a professional ( which i hope is true ) he should be more than familiar with how to burn pc compliant data disc <p> thus the question is : is anyone fooling around with some sort of protection scheme ? <p> is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for providing high resolution images on a medium like cd/dvd ? <p> but no matter if this medium was supposed to hold the final and proper pictures or whether it was just for demonstration purposes : you should be able to view the content or otherwise make sure to get your money back or do n't pay the guy <p> concerning firmware upgrades or alike : do n't  fix it if it ai n't  broken - talk to jesse first and tell him to provide decent content <p> if he is a pro he should be able to take care of this problem in no time at all - let 's hope he is not just an amateur with a dslr and a mac <p> Well I called Jesse and he says he checked to make sure the disc worked before he sent it to me .

@@98121170 @2321170/ <p> The Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) has confirmed that watching pirated video streams online does not break any copyright laws . <p> The ruling comes via a legal battle between rights holders and European media service company Meltwater . Copyright holders including the Associated Press charged Meltwater with copyright infringement when the company extracted headlines from various news sources and sent these via email to users . <p> In an interesting twist , the media groups suing Meltwater , led by the U.K. based Newspaper Licensing Agency ( NLA ) , also argued that users receiving these emails should be liable for licensing fees , an argument which led to this week 's ruling . <p> Early court rulings initially favored the NLA , but the Supreme Court of The United Kingdom eventually ruled against the NLA , confirming that viewing copyrighted content online is not copyright infringement . The court cited existing EU copyright law which that temporary copies are given a specific exemption from copyright law . The court did refer the matter for further comment to the CJEU . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright exemptions for temporary copies applies to viewing and streaming online . Viewing or streaming , the court says , is different to making a copy and would be exempt from copyright laws , but the copies " must be temporary , that they must be transient or incidental in nature and that they must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process . " <p> While this ruling provides clarification on this issue , the ruling may anger rights holders who have in recent times devoted more resources in tackling the piracy problem caused by the increasing use of streaming services .

It rips 10 times faster than ac3dec and there is almost never any synch problems ! As always the DVD Vob files need to be decrypted to your hard disk or GraphEdit will not be able to read them . <p> Put GraphEdit in a folder somewhere and register all the filters with RegDrop . This is easy , you simply drag the . ax file over the RegDrop program and your files are registered . Like this : <p> Or you can just use the DOS line command Regsvr32 ( ie. regsvr32 " C : folderfilename.ax " ) . <p> Install all of the following files that you downloaded : <p> Wavedest.ax <p> Dump.ax <p> Mpeg2Decoder.ax <p> Iviaudio.ax <p> MAKING A LIST FILE ( * .

For example , you can save the file as " dvd.lst " , but please remember to add the quotation marks to force the text editor to save the file as a . lst extension , otherwise it will save it as dvd.lst.txt or dvd.lst.doc or whatever and it wont work ! We do this so that , instead of choosing just one individual . Vob file at a time , we can just select the dvd.lst file instead ! Then all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one whole file ! <p> GETTING THE AUDIO <p> GraphEdit looks baffling to the newbie because its vague about what it says it does ! Basically , all windows media files need codec 's to play them ; that is why you need to install the DivX codecs so you can play or encode to DivX . GraphEdit let 's you connect one decoder directly to another by dragging a line between them . Each codec is represented by a box with the codec 's name writen on it . By connecting the correct encoder and decoder boxes between your Vob file and the output ' File Writer ' filer you can convert any Vob audio to a Wave . <p> So , open up Graphedit . Go to Graph &gt; insert filters and up will pop the following box . All of the files you need will come under the category of Directshow Filters because they are designed to play Audio and Video . <p> First , insert the ' I-Media Multiple MPEG2 Source ' filter . It will ask you for the location of the . lst file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Then the first box ( top left of the picture below ) will appear . If you only have one Vob file , you can use ' File Source ( Async. ) ' instead of a dvd.lst file . <p> Next , tell it the output location by inserting the ' File Writer ' filter . Again another browser window appears and ask you where you want the audio saved . You can see this box at the far right of the picture below saying C : ripoutput.wav . <p> Next we must choose all those conversion filters placed in-between the in and out . Choose the following : MPEG-2 Splitter ( or Ligos Mpeg Splitter ) ; WAV Dest and InterVideo Audio Decoder . Finally , you must drag the arrow from the first ' Output ' box to the Mpeg-2 box ; then drag from the AC3 peg to the Intervideo Audio Decoder ; then finally again to the in box where you save your file . Well , as long as it looks like the image above you are fine . <p> Notice also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative audio tracks ( ie. German , French etc. , ) if you do n't get the audio track you want , try the next one in the list until you find it .

This can be useful if you are running short on Hard Disk space . Let 's say you want to extract an AC3 file but its too large as a PCM , you could convert it to Mp3 . But before I show you that , let 's see what we need to change a PCM Wav into Mp3 , select : <p> Then go into the Audio Compressor 's section and choose MPEG Layer-3 . <p> Select either an wave audio file or an .

@@98121184 @2321184/ <p> Everyone is looking for the ultimate settings ! The ones that will make their DivX movie have the very best possible picture quality for the smallest possible file size ! I too have spent much time searching this dark road . And now I feel its about time I gave everyone a few pointers from my experience = ) . These are just a handful of tips that I have made and should not be taken as though I am to telling you what settings you should be using . Rather , I hope to save you some time and help you to make good choices for yourselves . <p> INSIDE THE DIVX CODEC <p> Before we can decide on the best setting to use for our movies , it would be good idea to start by looking at what all those settings on the DivX codec do and what the differences are between the Fast Motion and Low Motion codecs . <p> KEYFRAMES <p> Most video formats that use compression will have keyframes . These help the video player to seek to various parts of the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also take up the most amount of memory of any video frame . Most codecs will use one keyframe between every 5-10 seconds . The default setting on the DivX codec is 1 keyframe every 10 seconds . This is fine most of the time and changing it will not really increase the image quality enough to notice . In the past people started making DivX 's with a keyframe every 9999 seconds to keep down the file size . The result was that you could n't resume watching the video from where you left off ! Every time you played it you had to watch it from the start again ! The position of the keyframe is important . If a keyframe is put at the start of a scene change then all frames after it will generally look better . In view of this fact some hacked DivX codec 's ( such as VKI ) have been designed to detect the scene changes and put a keyframe there . This produces only a minor improvement of course . <p> BITRATE <p> There are two kinds of bitrate setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Variable Bitrate ( VBR ) . <p> Constant Bitrate : constant bitrate represents how much memory per second a codec will use to encode a movie . Obviously , the higher the bitrate the better the picture quality . Say , for example , one second of video was 25 frames . If I set a bitrate of 1000 Kilobits per Second ( kbps ) and encode 1 second , each frame would use 40 Kilobits of memory each . If I used a bitrate of 2000 kbps each picture could use 80 Kilobits . Obviously an 80 kilobit frame will look much better than a 40 kilobit frame . <p> Notice too that it does n't matter what resolutions we use ! Let 's say we encoded one second of video at 1000 kbps at a resolution of 352 x 288 pixels - the final filesize would be exactly 1000 kilobytes ! Again , if we encoded one second of video at 1000 kbps , but this time we use a cinema resolution of 5000 x 5000 pixels ; the final movie clip would still only be 1000 kilobytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we set only ' 1000 kilobits ' for one second of video and that is all it will use ! <p> Variable Bitrate : a variable bitrate codec sets its own bitrate in accordance with the movie . To illustrate , mpeg compresion works basically by saving only the differences between sequances of frames . In non-action scenes there are very few differences between frames . Hence , if the total amount of differences are " small " the kilobits needed to store them will also be small . On the other hand , if there are lots of differences between frames it will take " lots " of kilobits to store them . <p> It is impossible to know how much memory a Variable Bitrate encoded movie will take because it all depends on the amount of Fast Motion and Low Motion scenes it has . Nevertheless , most variable bitrates codec have limits . For example , DVD 's are often encoded with a certain maximum and minimum bitrates that will make sure they do n't use too much memory and go over the target filesize or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> SMOOTHNESS &amp; CRISPINESS SETTINGS <p> One trick people use on AVI files to reduce the filesize is to use a smaller framerate . For example , NTSC movies use a framerate of almost 30 frames per second ( fps ) . If we only used 15 fps then we have effectively halved the filesize ! This does n't look too bad either especially on cartoons which are usually only produced at 15fps anyway ! <p> But although this worked for uncompressed AVI 's , no Mpeg format could do this ! Say , for example , we tried to encode an Mpeg-1 file at 15 fps . The mpeg codec would automatically add extra frames to make the video at least 23.976 fps which is the speed captured with a motion picture camera ! Then it would add a code at the start of the movie to tell the video player to only play it back at 15fps ! In other words , the movie would still take the same amount of space as a 23.976 movie but play back at 15 frames a second ! When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also applied to DivX , but this was not quite correct . The DivX codec is able to " drop " frames in order to save space ! <p> And here is where the DivX smoothness and crispiness settings come in . The smoothness and crispiness settings seem to be a pre-filter that softens noise in the picture . The softer the picture the better it compresses . The sharper the picture the harder it is to compress . Most Mpeg encoders offer some sort of prefiltering like this . The DivX codec encodes each movie in small sections at a time , each containing only so many blocks of information . If the picture is too clear and sharp it will tend to ' drop ' frames to compensate to fit the movie into the block size . This frame dropping produces a clean crisp image but a slightly jerky looking one . If the picture is smoothed it will be able to compress better and keep all the frames making it more blurry but also much smoother animation . Before you start panicing and turning the smoothness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at very very low bitrates . At the bitrates we would normally encode a DivX , dropped frames are not a big problem . Nevertheless , while I used to say just use 100% crispiness for best quality , now I think keeping it to about 75 is safer . My tests have convinced me that you should not suffer from any dropped frames or jerky playback this way . <p> Framerates and Bitrates : Finally this brings me to a strange fact . If we encode a DivX at 30fps it will actually end up smaller than the same DivX encoded at 25fps ! I can not really explain this , but I have a theory . A 25fps movie encoded at 1000 kbps would ( at a constant birate ) use 40 kilobits per frame . But a 30fps movie encoded at 1000 kbps will use about 33 kilobits per frame . 30fps movies are basically 24fps movies with " repeat " frames added to take up space . Now , since , for the most part , Mpeg-4 only records the differences between frames the total differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30fps is zero ! But the codec is now still only using a bitrate of 33 per frame . This is possibly what makes the smaller filesize , which in turn , gives a lower picture quality . <p> WHATS THE DIFFERENCE ? ! <p> " Hi Folks ! <p> Always the same question , always the same answer ... The LowMotion codec is a hack from version 4.1.00.4920 of the M$ MPEG4v3 , the HighMotion codec is a hack from version 4.1.4917 of the M$ MPEGv3 . <p> I really do n't know the internal difference between the low-motion and the high-motion . I NOTICE the difference and decide to make two version , the low-motion which came from the beta version and the high-motion witch is the version 4.1.00.3917 , the newer builds looks like be an low-motion style ... The low-motion and the high-motion are the same file but with differents builds ! As you know I 'm not the coder of this thing so I could not help you more ... I mainly use the low-motion which produce better half-toning results , and the high-motion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremly related to the CONTENTS of the video , a fast moving , very detailled picture is harder to code than a almost still , very clean picture ... I think that the requested bitrate is a MAXIMUM bitrate , and the differences are in the way the encoder try to match this bitrate , the low-motion seems to allocate more bit to color and is ' tighter ' to the requested bitrate , the high-motion codec allocate more bit to the luminance but is not as ' tight ' as the low-motion is . <p> Gej <p> http : //divX.ctw.cc " <p> As you probably guessed the above quote is from Gej the person who made the DivX codec ! All Mpeg-4 codec 's are just hacks of the Micro$oft ASF codec . This includes SmR ( nAVI ) and even the Angel Potion codec ( according to Avery Lee ) which claims to be the first one that is n't a hack . To be fair the Angel Potion does seem to perform a little differently from the rest and is perhaps a highly altered ASF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article it was filled with bugs and so is not , in my opinion , a good choice to use . When I say they are " hacks " the only real differences are they allow just about any program to use the codec to encode Mpeg-4 files . There was no alteration to the codec at all - its just like making a hack for a time limited trial , the hacked program itself remains unchanged . So there is no real difference in quality between various Mpeg-4 hacks - all look basically the same quality ! <p> This brings us to the big question of which is better , ASF or DivX ! And why bother to hack it anyway ? Well , Micro$oft decided no one could use Mpeg-4 unless it was encoded with their crappy encoder . ASF files were only permited to be produced at very small resolutions . ASF 's when compared to pure Mpeg-4 files would add almost 100MB 's of extra data to the average 650MB movie ! This was due to bulky overheads and all the stuff designed to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP3 audio and almost always ended up with serious audio synchronizatioin problems . Later versions of Media Encoder only allowed usage of the Fast Motion codec which produced bad image quality for low motion scenes ! In short , DivX solved all these problems and anyone who says DivX is just a joke and ASF 's look better just does n't  know what they are talking about ! <p> FAST MOTION VS LOW MOTON CODECS <p> Gej was correct in his observations of the Fast and Low Motion codecs . BOTH codecs are variable bitrate which means the final filesizes are very hard to predict . <p> Fast Motion Codec <p> The Fast Motion codec is the hardest codec to predict a final filesize . You could encode one movie at 6000 kbps and another at 900 kbps with the Fast Motion codec and still end up with two movies of almost the same size ! Or the one at 6000 kbps could end up double the size of the 900 kbps one ! There is just no way to tell ! When we set the Fast Motions bitrate we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always use an average bitrate of about 300 kbps until it reaches a high action scene and only then will it increase the bitrate to the maximum level ! This is why people get confused , because it does n't use the bitrate they put in until it finds an action scene ! <p> Low Motion Codec <p> The Low Motion codec , on the other hand , uses a Minimum bitrate . This means that it will hardly ever go higher than what we set it . So if we set it to 800 kbps it would use 800 kbps on most scenes and only use a very little more or less depending on the action . This means the Low Motion codec is a lot more predictable . <p> COMPARING THE TWO CODECS <p> The following examples will make clear the strengths and weaknesses of the two codec 's . <p> Fast Motion codec <p> Here is a high-action scene compressed with the Fast Motion codec at 6000kbps : <p> Here is a non-action scene compressed with the Fast Motion codec at 6000kbps : <p> Low Motion codec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low Motion codec at 600 kbps : <p> Here is a high-action scene compressed with the Low Motion codec at 600kbps : <p> From the above examples it is clear that the Low Motion codec always looks better on non-action scenes even if it uses a bitrate as low as 600 kbps . It is noteworthy too , though , that when the Low Motion codec goes below 600 kbps it will not look significantly better than the Fast Motion codec unless the Fast Motion codec is set to the same bitrate too . <p> The Fast Motion codec also has an upper limit of about 2000 kbps . It does n't seem to make much noticable difference to quality whether we choose Fast Motion at 2000kbps or 6000kbps ! It does , however , make significant demands on filesize . <p> Finally , as we can see from the examples below , when the Low Motion codec is set to between 1000-1500 kbps it starts to look overall better quality than the Fast Motion codec no matter what we set it to ! <p> Fast Motion 6000 kbps <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONCLUSION <p> The Fast Motion codec saves the most space and does very well on high action scenes . If you are going to use it for movies always set it to 2000 kbps . There is little point using any other setting and it has the best quality to size ratio . You might consider using the Fast Motion codec for putting long movies on a single CD . <p> The Low Motion codec set at 600 kbps will do better job than the Fast Motion codec on just about all low action scenes . It can not compete with the Fast Motion codec on action scenes until we set a bitrate of between 1000-1500kbps . After which , it starts to produce much better results than the Fast Motion codec . <p> Final Note : At very small resolutions such as 320 x 240 the Fast Motion codec does a very bad job . It is probably better to use the Low Motion codec all the time in such cases . But , as always , do some testing and see what you think . <p> QUALITY AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up the picture into 16 x 16 blocks called macroblocks . Each block is allocated a certain amount of memory based on the bitrate we enter into the codec . The more the bitrate the better the quality . Let 's see what happens to the macroblocks when we allocate less and less bitrate to them . The best way to see this is to enlarge the video so we can see better , like this : <p> Take a look at the images below . The first one was given the highest bitrate and the lowest was given the least bitrate . As you can see , the less bitrate we give it the more simplified the macrblocks get ! <p> Ideally we would love to encode all movies at 720 x 576 full DVD resolutions . But at this resolution the image is broken up into 1,620 macroblocks . It has an effective resolution of 45 x 36 blocks . <p> Let 's say we have decided that to fit a movie on a single CD as DivX we needed to use a bitrate of 800 kbps . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can still see many of these macroblock artifacts . We can not increase the bitrate or it will not fit . Many think if we make the image big ( i.e. full sized ) the blocks will be smaller . This is wrong ! Larger images means more blocks which means less memory is given to each block . When each block has less memory allocated to it , it becomes simplier and simplier until in the end most of the blocks become nothing more than blank colours ! <p> The only solution is to make the image smaller . Smaller images means less blocks which means more memory is allocated to each block and each block looks more like the original picture . A resolution of 480 x 384 would give us 30 x 24 macroblocks , which is 900 less macroblocks . This can make a big difference in quality ! <p> The above methodology is nothing new to DivX , the same has always applied to all Mpeg formats since they were designed . Because of the way it is compressed the picture resolution is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures actually look better than larger ones at the same bitrate . The technique for making the best quality image is simple mathematics : <p> 1 . Use the highest bitrate you can . <p> 2 . If the image shows too many macroblocks shrink the resolution a little . <p> 3 . Check it again . If there are still too many macroblocks shrink it a little more until they are not noticable . Its unlikely you will get rid of all macroblocks on a single CD DivX but you can get rid of most of them . <p> Commercial Video CD 's ( VCD ) are considered by experts to be almost VHS quality video . Yet they only use a resolution of 352 x 240 ! This is possible even though a TV resolution is something like 576 lines . It is hard to compare an analog image to a digital image by mere resolution . For one thing VHS uses signal compression , yes , that 's right , VHS is also a compressed format ! But the response curve of VHS places -3 dB at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 samples / line . VHS chroma is considerably less dense in the horizontal direction than MPEG source video . And from a sampling density perspective , VHS is superior only in the vertical direction , but when taking into account interfield magnetic tape crosstalk and the TV monitor Kell factor , not by all that much . Well , that what I read anyway ! But the conclusion of the matter is using small resolutions than TV lines can still produce video 's almost as good as VHS . <p> I have only a couple of rules I always follow for deciding video resolutions . I never make it larger than 640 x 480 ( which is higher than TV resoloutions ) and I never go lower than 240 pixels high unless absolutely nessasery . <p> CROPPING THE VIDEO <p> Considering the previous facts about macroblocks , it makes sense that cropping out the black bars found at the top , bottom and sometimes at the sides of a movie would allow the codec to allocate more memory to image quality . But the amount of memory allocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vital thing to remember for optimal compression is to always crop a few pixels into the image so as to delete all of the black bars . Mpeg compression works best on blurry images ; so if a hard black line is seen at the edge of your cropped movie it will not compress as effectively . In fact , if you can not crop into the image then I 'd say do n't bother cropping at all , because the memory saved is so small . <p> Warning on Cropping <p> It is only fair to warn you that , athough in my opinion cropping improves the image quality of the DivX rip by a lot , before you decide that cropping is the best way to go , you must consider these four facts : <p> 1 . A cropped movie is sometimes harder to convert into another format . This is because you may need to re-add the black bars to the top and bottom of the movie first or the movie may be stretched out of shape . <p> 2 . A cropped DivX movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other Video players . On the other hand , Media Player , MicroDVD and many other players will play back a cropped movie perfectly . <p> 3 . VCD 's and SVCD 's can not be cropped if they are to be played in a standalone DVD player because it will not accept them . <p> 4 . Finally , Mpeg-4 files ( and DVD files for that matter ) have problems playing back on some hardware if they are not encoded in sizes that can be divided by 32 .

If the order of the " fields " is incorrect you will get the annoying combing effect we see above . So far there is not complete solution to this . You can try resizing the picture smaller or you can use Flask Mpeg 's deinterlace filter . There is also a super slow annoying way to fix this using DVD2AVI .

This section of the guide is for more advanced users though , so beware . Xbox 360 owners should be skipping this page since the 360 can not play M2TS files . <p> The process is as follows : first , we extract the H.264 and AAC track from the MP4 file created using the earlier parts of this guide using YAMB .

So YAMB it is . Download YAMB and install it . Start it up and click on the " Editing " button on the left hand side , select the " Click to extract streams ... " option ( demuxing ) . <p> From the Input box , load in your MP4 file . The info box below will now list all the streams found in this file , which should be a H.264 stream and an AAC stream .

Then select the AAC file and repeat the same step . After YAMB processes both streams , you should now have two additional files - one . h264 and one . aac in the same folder as your original MP4 file . <p> Now if your AAC file was 5.1 channels , we will now have to convert that to AC3 so the PS3 can decode it properly ( the PS3 can not decode AAC 5.1 at time of publishing ) . I 've searched around for a good tool to do it , and ffmpeg is the best but it is a command line tool . None of the GUIs I tried supported AAC input , so basically I 'm going to use MeGUI .

Click on the " Queue " tab at the top and then click on the " Start " button to start the encoding . Once it is done , you will now have a new 5.1 channel AC3 file . You do n't need the original AAC file anymore , but better keep it around until we 've finished everything . <p> Now we should have an . h264 file and either an . aac or . ac3 file . We will now recombine these two files into a M2TS file using tsMuxeR . <p> Download and extract the tsMuxeR ZIP file to a folder on your hard-drive , and run the " tsMuxerGUI " executable file to start tsMuxeR .

How to verify the NAL unit conetnts in the h264/avc file i.e does the NAL unit have one entire frame in it or the data is distributed in multiple NAL units . 2 . To stream , I am planning to packetize one nal unit per RTP packet , ( because it is the simplest way to packetize ) . How to extract each NAL unit from a H264 encoded file ? <p> This question may sound naive , but I would really appreciate any guidance on how to go about this . <p> I have been working on studying the h.264 bit stream format . As far as I understand , we can identify the nal units containing sequence parameter sets by looking at the nal header octet after **25;358;TOOLONG . I think the value should be x67 for a sequence parameter set . The 3 bytes after that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere in a sample h.264 file . Please do correct me if I am going wrong somewhere . <p> I am using a tool hexedit to view the 264 stream and trying to make some sense out of it according to the 264 spec . I am looking for nalunittype 67 and 68 to determine the spropparamterset . I have some concerns 1 . The SPS and PPS are not separated by 000001 . Currenlty I am thinking the SPS ends until I encounter a 68 which indicates start of PPS . I know my understanding is wrong , but I am lost how else to read the stream . 2 . How do I know the length of SPS ? There are variable length parameters in the stream . 3 . Are the spropparamterset just a base 64 endoded version of these two , seprated by comma ? Here is the portion of the stream with the parametrs 00 17 67 4D 40 33 9A 73 80 A0 08 B4 20 00 32 E9 E0 09 89 68 11 E3 06 23 C0 01 00 04 68 EE 3C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 04 4A 3E ... How do I know where the SPS ends when there are no NAL separators ? Can anybody explan what this stream means ? Please help . <p> Some inputs which may help you The 4-byte sequence 0x 00 00 00 01 is the AnnexB header . It may or may not be present in the bit-stream . It is optional . SPS starts with 67 . PPS starts with 68 . And the length of SPS is variable and dependent on the toolsets enabled . The length of SPS can be known by the no of bytes between 67 and 68. in the sample bit-stream shared , SPS size is 17 bytes . I think using the elecard stream analyser would help you a lot <p> How do we know the NumBytesInNALunit ? Also , how to identify the nal unit start in a packet oriented H264 encoded file . I read from the Annex B that in byte stream oriented files , the delimiter is used , but what about the packet oriented formats ? I seem to have hit a road block here : ' ( 
@@98121204 @2321204/ <p> HDTV2DVD is a new freeware tool to simply convert your HDTV material to DVD . HDTV captures are MPEG-2 Transport Streams at either 1280 x 720p or 1920 x 1080i resolution yet DVD is typically MPEG-2 Program Streams at 720 x 480 ( for NTSC ) .

For a movie 2 hours or less it 's tough to beat for one pass encoding to DVD9 . I recommend sizing down using BilinearResize AviSynth filter .

The technology allows you to avoid buffer underruns by suspending and restarting the write process when the recorder 's buffer is about to empty .

@@98121221 @2321221/ <p> Hi , I 've been using Nero Vision to build DVDs for years now , and i am finally completely fed up . Too many ' failure to burn errors ' , and now the last straw . I had several DVD project files created in Nero Vision , which i managed to get to burn to my hard disk at one point , with the resulting VideoTS folder -- this is what I want , That can then be used to burn more than one DVD with Nero Burning Rom . But , simply loading the project file and subtracting a couple videos and adding a couple , i got the burn error . The added files had been successfully burned before . Last straw was when tech support told me to update my version of Nero 10 Multimedia suite . After i did that , i loaded previous Nero Vision 10 project files . The Custom menus I had created and successfully burned were now STRIPPED from the project file , which reverted to it 's default Orbit menus . I had spent hours creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames for the menu items , font and color choices , etc . I have several projects like this . <p> Long and short of it is -- i refuse to redo menus every time Nero decides to update ! If i have no choice but to redo these DVDs , then I want to purchase new software which will do at least as much , and as conveniently , as Nero Vision , but not be as buggy and ill-conceived . <p> I like how Nero Vision works , other than the bugs , difficult burn issues , and absurd oversights in their ' upgrade ' releases . I 've had it . I need a decent authoring program which will do the same things as Nero Vision , but without the stupidity . Basically , I want to drag in separate video files like . flv , . vob , . mov , . mpg , . mp4 , etc . I want to make menu buttons for them , so that you can select which you want to to play , preferably ones that animate a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make compilations of music performance clips , videos , etc , of our favorite artists , because our family enjoys watching these . The clips come with video and audio , but often each clip needs to be ( non-destructively ) trimmed at the beginning and end -- without affesting the original file of course . And the encoding needs to be top-notch -- preferably not re-encoded when that is unnecessary . <p> Can anyone recommend the appropriate software for my use ? I am willing to pay for something with the features i need , and which is useable , burns reliably ( with a burn VideoTS folder to hard disc option ) . <p> AVStoDVD is another freeware that has some menu making features . I 'm not much into menus myself as I generally have a single title DVD for output . I find myself using FitCD to create an AviSynth Script , then using a free video encoder such as HC Encode or QuEnc depending on the size of the output and if the audio is usable as is . <p> I use DVDAuthorGui for simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audio is ok as is then basically you just need to convert the video to . m2v and mux it together with the audio . The muxer or authoring program should then set the navpacks while writing a VIDEOTS folder . <p> If you want fancy motion menus that 's usually where it gets easier with paid programs . Depends on the input you want to handle but as far as DVD video quality conversion you can get very high quality with free encoders . <p> I mention FitCD because even though it has n't been updated in awhile it 's still a very good resize calculator . Set the output as 16x9 anamorphic ( if that 's what the output should be ) and just load in a video file . Even if it gets an error it still generates the AviSynth script lines for resize and adding borders . Paste the script lines into any encoder that can use AviSynth , such as HC Encode or QuEnc . <p> Generally I try to stay away from those one click $50 converters that make you stick the DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output looks good in some cases but more often than not they 're a waste of time . Better to use a tool that does most of the stuff for you but let 's you adjust the AviSynth script ( .avs file that 's used as input instead of the video file . ) AviSynth you can take as much control as you want . Has tons of free filters to clean up , unblock , get rid of jaggies , resize , add subtitles , and on and on . <p> AviSynth also has the ability to do some stuff with audio . But I 'm still a beginner . I just use it to help me encode the video . As I gain experience maybe I 'll mess with all those braces and variables and assigning streams and whatever . Right now my scripts are elementary . <p> Thanks for all the information , but I 'm not looking for freeware , which tends to involve a lot more technical effort than I want to put into it . I 'm also not looking for those simple wizard type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much DO need menus -- I need to bring in background pics , have thumbnails for my videos ( which animate , showing a portion of the video ) , i need to be able to resize and place those thumbnails on the screen , and I need to be able to drop in a variety of formats , such as flv , mov , mp4 , mpg , vob . I want the software to re-encode for DVD where necessary , and leave it alone when it 's not. * <p> I also need to non-destructively edit ( meaning cut off the beginning and end of . vob files especially , leaving just the section I want to use . ) All within the program. * <p> I do n't want to use different programs to edit , reencode and then bring them into another program to make menus and burn a Video-ts folder . All this is not only tedious for compilation DVDs with a lot of videos , but also degrades the quality . Also , my videos contain the audio , as they are music performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audio separately , and the audio quality needs to be preserved . <p> Nero Vision does all these things , now if only it worked ... Its always been iffy , but now it seems they 've broken it altogether -- I ca n't get anything to burn . It goes throughout the whole process and craps out at the last minute . <p> Is anyone familiar with Sony DVD Architect , or Corel DVD Movie Factory 7 ? Do these programs do the kind of things I describe , straightforwardly , with intelligent transcoding ? It 's very hard to tell from their websites . Is there anything else which would fit my needs ? <p> The direct commercial competitor to Nero Vision is TMPGEnc DVD Author ( now called TMPGEnc DVD Authoring Works ) , and there 's also Cyberlink PowerProducer . But most of these are consumer level solutions , and so it 's pretty inflexible as to what you can and can not do ( for example , if you really want a button on the main menu to take you to chapter 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapters menu page ) . <p> DVD-Lab , on the other hand , is for semi-professionals that want a bit more control over what they can produce , but as it 's not aimed at home users , it 's a bit quirky and you have to get the sources prepared first . Here 's a roundup of the commercial and free DVD authoring tools , it has n't been updated recently , but most of it is still accurate :

@@98121225 @2321225/ <h> Article Category : <h> Page 1 of 4 : Introduction <p> Now that Blu-ray has won the HD format now , this is one of the fist articles on Digital Digest dedicated to Blu-ray . But even had HD DVD not folded so quickly , this guide would still be a Blu-ray only guide . Why ? Simple . It 's because this guide is about how to make play Blu-ray movies region-free on your PC - there can never be a HD DVD equivalent of this guide because HD DVD is region-free . <p> It 's still very early for Blu-ray playback on PCs , and even earlier for making it region-free , so please bare with me . Hopefully , as new techniques and software solutions become available , this guide will be updated accordingly . If you are still confused about HD and Blu-ray in general , these following resources may be of help : <p> Future versions of this guide will even features region-free instructions and tips for Blu-ray standalones , but for now , this guide concentrates on making Windows PCs region-free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coding System <p> Blu-ray has 3 different regions , which are different to that of DVDs . While DVDs use region numbering , Blu-rays use region lettering - the letters A , B and C represent the 3 regions of Blu-ray . Region A consists of North American , Central America , South America , East Asia ( except for China ) and South East Asia . Region B is Europe , Africa , Middle East , New Zealand , and of course , Australia ( where I am ) . Region C is for everywhere else , but mainly China , Russian and India . As with DVDs , you can find the region coding information on the back of the movie cover . <p> Note that not all Blu-ray movies are region coded . Movies from Warner Bros. , and upcoming releases from Paramount and Universal will most likely all be region-free . Disney and Sony 's catalogue title releases are usually region-free as well , and only their new movie releases are region coded . All Fox Blu-ray titles are region coded , even catalogue titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing than with DVD drives . Some Blu-ray drives do not have region locking in hardware ( eg. some LG drives ) , while others are hard coded into the drive 's firmware ( eg. Matshita drives ) . All still carry the same DVD region locking system as DVD drives . As such , only the Blu-ray drives without hardware locking can be unlocked through the various techniques for software based players ( PowerDVD , WinDVD ) covered by this guide , so if your Blu-ray drive is region-locked , the instructions for PowerDVD/WinDVD will probably not work . On the other hand , if you do have a drive without hardware region-locking , then the solution is quite simple to perform in software . <h> Bypassing AACS <p> AACS is the copy protection system used on Blu-ray . If you bypass AACS , you can then be allowed to remove region coding as well during playback . Bypassing AACS is illegal , and as such , this website will not cover these instructions . Unlike the defeated HD DVD , Blu-ray also uses BD+ copy protection . BD+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed on the fly to detect the absence of AACS , and so on titles that use BD+ ( some Fox Blu-rays ) , the methods which bypasses AACS will not work . <p> There is a new tool that , once you bypass AACS , allows you to strip region coding from the Blu-ray files . This tool can even strip BD-J based region detection . You can download the Blu-ray Region Code Remover tool here .

@@98121237 @2321237/ <h> Article Category : <h> Page 1 of 2 : English Version <p> INTRODUCTION : **26;450;TOOLONG <p> A few different factors must be considered when capturing video from a VHS source . I 'm no expert in digital video , but I 've been through the painfull process of chosing a resolution for my captures , and I 'll share my experience so you wo n't waste all the time I did capturing and compressing over and over . <p> LEGAL STUFF : **26;478;TOOLONG <p> Be aware that you MUST have the rights to make a copy of any copyrighted material , such as movies or video clips . If you own the copyrights , go ahead . If you do n't , proceed at your own risk . Talking about risks , I will take no responsability about the procedures described in this document . This is provided just a a guide to help you with your captures . Any damages caused to your system by the procedures suggested bellow will be your problem , not mine . <p> THE VHS RESOLUTION : **26;506;TOOLONG <p> If you search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will find basically 352x240 at 29.967fps ( Frames Per Second ) for NTSC and 352x288 at 25fps for PAL-M . Yeah , right . You capture with that resolution and you get a video that looks like shit . So all those documents were wrong ? No , they were inaccurate , or maybe just incomplete . The VHS video works with the interlaced system ( not progressive ) , which means it draws every frame twice on the screen . In fact , every frame of an interlaced video is divided in two fields ( the reason for this is a long story that comes from the first TV sets . You can find more information about this in the articles session of www.divx-digest.com ) . Those two fields mean that every frame carries much more than just 240 or 288 lines of information . If you capture at 352x240 or 352x288 you 'll be skipping every second field , which results in only half of the resolution . <p> THE COMPRESSION ARTIFACTS : **26;534;TOOLONG <p> Another interesting point is the compression you use . Compression algorithms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ATI 's VCR1 and VCR2 , etc. ) break the video color information into 16x16 pixel blocks . The smaller the resolution you use , the bigger the aparent size of those blocks will be . So , even if your video source has a very low resolution , you should capture it with at least 320x240 , or the results will look weird . Also , if you are going to recompress that video later , or if you intend to edit it , try to capture with the least compression you can . If you have enough free space and you HD can keep up with high transfer rates , use uncompressed formats . When capturing a movie that has subtitles or any small text with the standard 352x240 resolution , you 'll get those little " ghosts " all arround the text when you compress it to a higher compression system , such as Divx ; - ) . Just like a jpg picture with high compression . The same effect ( defect ) will show up arround hard edges . There 's also a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ripped from DVDs : the noise . If you compress a DVD ripped video at 352x240 with divx , you get a good result , because the source video did n't have any noise . On the other hand , if you compress a VHS source video at the same resolution , the noise will seem to be amplified , and will take a lot of the stream bandwidth . <p> THE SUGGESTED SOLUTION : **26;562;TOOLONG <p> If you want your capture to look just like the VHS source ( unfortunately it ca n't look any better ) , capture at 640x480 at 29.967fps , and then DEINTERLACE it . You can do that with softwares like Adobe Premiere or VirtualDub ( this one is highly recommended - get it at the software session of www.divx-digest.com ) . However , that resolution demands a lot of processing power and free disk space . Some experts would say that such a high resolution for a VHS source is a waste of time and space , but I insist : if you like things perfect , try that resolution . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your system ca n't keep that up , use 512x384 at 29.967 and the result will look quite as good as 640x480 . I have an ATI ALL IN WONDER PRO with 8Mb in a K6 2 400 MHz with 128 Mb RAM and this resolution works just fine with the ATI VCR2 codec . At last , if you are out of disk space , or running on a slow system , or even if you want to make a VCD compliant video stream ( which MUST be 352x240 at 29.967fps ) , capture at 352x480 at 29.967fps ( this way you get both fields ) , and then resise it to 352x240 using VirtualDub with the " precise bicubic " filter on . This procedure is also discribed at the Divx-Digest home-page . <p> CONCLUSION : **26;590;TOOLONG <p> The capture resolution will depend on the final quality or purpose you need . Capturing at the standard VHS resolution will skip every second field of the video , resulting in quality loss , since the interlaced system draws " half frames " at 60 Hz , and not actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 512x384 at 29.967fps will get both fields , give a good result and wo n't demand too much system power . When capturing from a VHS source with higher resolutions ( ie. : 512x384 ) , it 's recommended to deinterlace the captured video afterwards to save space and improve quality . <p> TROUBLESHOOTING : **26;618;TOOLONG <p> -If your capture card ca n't capture in resolutions like 352x480 or 512x384 , use VirtualDub to do it by choosing the option " set custom format " under the " video " menu . -If your using the ATI VCR2 codec ( only ATI boards users ) , you may experience some system lockups when recompressing the video or even when seeking through it . ATI ca n't explain it , and they suggest you to update you ATI video player to it 's newest version , but it did n't seem to work for me . The solution I found was to " downdate " my ATI video player to version 530005 ( I was using 5350002 before ) . I really ca n't tell the difference among the 5xxxxx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions have more bugs . -If you are capturing a long movie , you 'll be facing the 2Gb limit for AVI files ( yeah , when Microsoft created AVI , they thought that 2Gb would be more than enough ) . Even if you can save your files to AVI 2.0 ( which breaks that barrier ) , you 'll still face the Windows 95/98 4Gb file size limit . To solve that problem you can either use Windows NT or just capture with VirtualDub ( as I said before , it 's highly recommended ) . VirtualDub can split the video file in 2Gb or smaller files in real time while capturing . It reads those files as if they were only one big file as well . <p> CONTACT : **26;646;TOOLONG <p> You can send any comments or suggestions to dgfig@brturbo.com All I can tell you is in this document , so please do n't send me any questions or troubleshooting problems .

As mentioned previously , we 'll create a title screen consisting of white text on black background with a small section of the TNG music theme as the background , and then it all fades into the start of the episode . <p> To get a clip of the TNG theme , we 'll have to extract a clip of the video ( from episode 1 ) containing the theme . <p> First , drag the file " TNG - Finale Ep 1 " to the Input window . Use the input controls to mark in and out the segment of music that needs to be extracted ( add a couple of second before and after ) , and then with the segment marked in green in the Input window , drag the video onto the timeline , but into the " Music track " section ( the third track ) .

Click and hold the text colour button and change the colour to white . Change the font options to whatever fits your need , and click on the title preview window to the right to start typing .

You can now play the project using the Output window , notice the rather abrupt end to the title track , and the beginning of the episode proper . We 'll fix this by using the fade in/out option . <p> Right click on the object on the title track , and select " Fade " .

You might want to set a longer fade out for the music track as it will sound better . You might even want to add fade in to the episode video as well . <p> Now if you did n't have transparencies enabled for the title track , then you might notice the transition between the title and the video still is n't very nice looking - the video sort of pauses while the title fades away .

@@98121241 @2321241/ <p> This is a very basic guide intended to help those new to encoding . This guide will work for various file types ; DIVX &amp; XVID compressed AVIs , MPG/WMV/MOV formats .

This step is critical to ensure a smooth playback . An easy way is to simply right click the file , go to Properties&gt;Summary . As you can see this File is 23 fps and has AC3 audio . To encode a file with AC3 audio , you need the AC3 ACM de- compressor installed , and I suggest the AC3 filter for playback . <p> NOTE : If your avi with AC3 audio crashes TMPGenc , Use " AC3FIX " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are very finicky about correct AC3 headers - and it seems that most XVID-AC3 files do NOT have the " perfect " AC3 headers . <p> Another option is to change the audio to a .

Under " audio " &gt;full processing mode , Click " audio " again . click Conversion check 48,000Hz and check " high quality " and ok . Go to " audio " &gt;compression , select " no compression " ( PCM ) and ok . Finally go to FILE&gt; save WAV. this will produce a . wav file ( audio only ) . You will use this as the audio input for TMPGenc. see screenshots below . <p> Finally , the method I use is to keep the AC3 audio unchanged when making a DVD . I use the wav file method outlined above as the audio input , sort of like a " dummy " file , for the mpeg-2 conversion , but when I AUTHOR the encoded file I use DEMUXED AC3 audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Authoring a DVD with TMPgenc DVD author ( different than TMPgenc plus ) is the second and final step to making a DVD . <p> There you see a list of various reader plugins installed for the TMPGEnc . The one that 's called DirectShow Multimedia File Reader is the one that we 're looking at . As a default , its priority is -1 . Select the item and right click on it . Choose Higher priority and repeat this until the " Priority " for this item is higher than any other plugin 's priority in the list ( usually 2 ) . LEAVE this set always . I have found 50% of files wont even open or produce write stream errros unless this is set . <p> Since my source is 23 fps we select NTSC ( same for 29.97 fps ) , if it were 25 fps , select PAL .

Make sure the audio is in sync throughout , and has smooth playback . Any files with bad frames or corrupt headers may cause TMPGenc to make the audio go out of sync , but this can be corrected by using some of the more advanced features , which I wo n't get into in this guide .

@@98121243 @2321243/ <h> The Pirate Bay , isoHunt Responds To Google DMCA Demotions <p> The Pirate Bay and isoHunt not worried about Google 's decision to demote websites that receive " too many " DMCA notices , but point to corporate censorship and antitrust issues <p> Following Google 's announcement that websites receiving " too many " DMCA notices will be demoted in their search engine ranks , the two top torrent indexers , The Pirate Bay and isoHunt , have both issued responses to the Mountain View giant 's latest anti-piracy measures . <p> Writing on their blog , The Pirate Bay laughed off suggestions that this latest move would see traffic plummet on the popular website . Reiterating an earlier expressed view , TPB says that the Google demotion will most likely end up driving more traffic to The Pirate Bay . <p> The rationale behind this somewhat counter-intuitive prediction is based on the fact that , currently , TPB only receives 10% of their traffic from search engine including Google . In these search results , TPB have to compete with other torrent sites , and while TPB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrent sites are likely to receive some traffic as well ( as high as 30% of search users do not click on the first available result ) . But with most torrent sites being demoted , users may simply directly visit the torrent site that 's most well known , which would be The Pirate Bay . <p> As a result , the more popular brand of The Pirate Bay would allow the site to take away visitors from smaller torrent sites that once could have competed more evenly within Google search results , and this perhaps may end up driving more traffic to TPB . This is also perhaps why The Pirate Bay refers to search engines like Google as " competing search engines " . <p> But while TPB looks to stay relatively unaffected by Google 's anti-piracy measure , they are still firmly against the idea of search result censorship . " The thing we do n't like with this is that a corrupt industry is deciding what another industry has to do , " they write on their blog . <p> Gary Fung , owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . Writing on the isoHunt forum , Fung notes that , like TPB , most of their traffic ( 75% ) come from users typing the domain name directly into their browsers . Only 21% of traffic comes from Google ( ' and much of that being searches on " isohunt " and " isohunt.com " , ' Fung posted ) , even if Google completely delists isoHunt , " we 'll survive " . <p> But the biggest concern Fung has is with Google 's definition of what a " valid " DMCA notice is . " What is really wrong with downranking/censoring websites based on " valid " DMCA notices however is that what 's valid is simply notices that has not been countered , " Fung posts . <p> Fung is referring to the DMCA take-down process that Google uses , in which any properly formatted DMCA notice is assumed to be " valid " , unless a counter-notification is filed . Websites that have a lot of web pages , but still receiving a sizable number " valid " but incorrect DMCA notices to pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but under Google 's new rules , this would land the website into big trouble . <p> In isoHunt 's case , Fung admits to never having filed a counter-notification before , but " That does not mean all links under isohunt.com which Google has filtered by notices are valid , just because we have n't countered them . " <p> Fung also hints at possible " antitrust " issues with Google 's latest move , in regards to their own properties not being subject to the same rules as other websites . While Google has since issued a statement saying that all Google properties will be subject to DMCA demotions , Google 's own DMCA notification page clearly redirects complaints towards YouTube 's own internal DMCA system , and so filed notices would not be part of the Google search engine 's DMCA system and demotion rules . Other video websites , like Vimeo or Metacafe , may be affected , although large branded websites may have enough " clean " pages to significantly water down any demotion effects ( compared to smaller , niche websites ) , if not overcome them entirely .

@@98121245 @2321245/ <p> I have an analog capture card that I want to capture video footage at 720x480 in order to transfer to DVD . The card came with some software called PlayTV which allows you to capture the analog source to an AVI file . The problem is that every minute of footage is using 1.2gb of space , which is too much for my hard drive as I do n't  have enough space .. I have also WIN DVR which allows you to encode straght to an 720x480 mpeg2 but there is alot of flickering on the outputted mpeg2 file , which I think is down to my PC not being able to keep up with the realtime encoding .. Does anyone know of any software that can capture the analog source to 720x480 AVI with something similar to a DV codec which would give me a file size of about 1 gig per 5 mins of footage which I can then convert to mpeg 2 afterwards ? I 'm really struggling at the moment , any help appreciated , <p> I made one SVCD using Nero Express , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format apparently was off by enough to make the subtitles appear very low on the TV screen , so low that they get cutoff. what do i do ? <p> there are no settings except the capture resolution .

I only have about 40Gig of free space on my HD and would need to capture up to 2 hours of footage . What would be perfect would be if I could capture to the DV codec ( 5:1 ratio ) , but is there such a program that would do that from an analog capture card ? <p> Originally posted by Kosiji I made one SVCD using Nero Express , it came out pretty good without any modification , except the format apparently was off by enough to make the subtitles appear very low on the TV screen , so low that they get cutoff. what do i do ? <p> hey , thanks alot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captures analog to DV codec . I tried it out , but for some reason the quality really drops down ( to the point where it is n't useable ) , so looks like I need to use no compression at all and buy a bigger hard drive , but now I am wondeing if I should look into buying a analog to digital external USB2 converter . Have you used one before ? I beleive that there are some that can even convert your source directly to mpeg 2 . Does the USB box do all the processing when that happens ? At the moment when I try to go direct to mpeg 2 with windvr there is a lot of flickering and stalling on the outputed file which I figured was down to my PC not being able to cope with the demand , so if this box takes care of all the processing then hopefully it will give a much improved mpeg2 right ? <p> mike722 : I am surprised that your files sizes are that big ( " 1.2G / 1 min " ) .

@@98121246 @2321246/ <p> DVD2AVI is actually about the best application there is for decoding a DVD . So if its so amazing why has it not been mentioned before as the best method of making DivX ? Basically because it has too few options to make a good quality movie . For example , you can not just crop and resize the video . To do this you must frameserve your movie first to other applications such as TMPGEnc . Neither does it have MP3 audio support or IFO parsing like Flask Mpeg . It was also slightly slower than both Flask and Mpeg2avi . But since everyone now wants to make movies from DVD using Nandub it has become necessary to introduce this method because its by far the easiest way to decode a movie to Nandub - so let 's get started ! <p> DVD2AVI can not parse IFO files and will only open Vob files . This means that you need to rip your DVD to your hard disk first using the IFO ripper such as SmartRipper ( check out how Here ) . <p> Then its a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Up will pop this selection box . Make sure you select all the Vobs for your movie in the correct order . <p> DECODING AUDIO ( optional ) <p> DVD2AVI can do audio decoding but its probably better not to use it because of synch problems . These are more due to Telecine problems with NTSC movies so if you use PAL you may want to try , but I think its better not to . If you decide to try audio select an audio track to decode from the following section : <p> If you are not gon na use audio just check the none option . A word of warning the audio will be decoded to uncompressed PCM audio and will take at least a gigabyte of space . If you do audio seperately you can save space . The best alternative is to use Graphedit for audio , check that guide Here . <p> DECODING THE VIDEO <p> If you would like to look at the movie you can play it by choosing:Option &gt; Preview . <p> An information window will also appear when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if its FILM , NTSC , PAL etc. , and looks like this : <p> NTSC MOVIES &amp; INTERLACE PROBLEMS <p> I 'm not very experianced with NTSC movies because most of mine are PAL . But after with the ones I 've tried recently I suggest you always try and use the force FILM option , go to : Video &gt; Field Operation &gt; Forced FILM . <p> If it works you will not have that horrible combing effect from an interlaced video . Not sure what interlaced video is ? Check my guide Here . If it does n't work , you will know soon enough when you open it to check . Make sure you check action scenes or those with lots of motion . <p> The best method to solve interlace problems is probably to use AVISynth 's Bob deinterlace filter . The method is described Here . Or you can use one of VirtualDub 's ( or Nandub 's ) not so good built in deinterlace filters to solve this problem . The hardest but best solution for this probelm is to perform correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pal Purpleman 's guide a go for that it can be found Here . He also has a good DVD2AVI guide and some excellent SVCD guides too ! <p> You do not need to do this for PAL movies unless you are converting the specials section , which have almost the same problem ! <p> SAVE THE PROJECT <p> No its time to decode the DVD by choosing : File &gt; Save Project please do NOT choose Save AVI ! <p> Give it a name when it asks and it will save the project file as : Something.d2v . It should take under an hour to decode the DVD . <p> CONVERTING TO A FAKE AVI <p> This is the amazing part ! We are now going to make a " fake " AVI file ! This is not a real AVI file because that would be huge and take a long time to create . Instead we are going to convert the information in that DVD2AVI project file so that it can be opened in any application that supports AVI ; that includes VirtualDub , Nandub or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AVI file you can use all the VirtualDub filters on it , resize , crop , deinterlace and so on . It may not be a real AVI no one can tell the difference ! <p> To do this conversion we must install the program called VFAPI . To install it double-click on the file that says : vifpset.bat . To run it just double-click on theVFAPIConv.exefile . <p> Then up will pop the following dialouge box . Choose the Add Job option and find the project file you just saved using DVD2AVI ( called something.d2v ) . You do n't need to do anything else , just press OK . <p> That 's it ! You will find that the " fake " AVI file you have just saved will now work in almost any video application as can be seen below : <p> Yes , I 'm sure you will be amazed ! The fake AVI will only be 10-20MB in size but will act as a frameserver to the DVD . This means you can not delete the original VOB files until all your encoding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> From here the sky 's the limit !

I still can not comprehend that a player which can play DivX encoded avi will not play XviD encoded avi . Can you upload a very small file ( about 1 min. or so ) which I can then encode with XviD and see if that plays in your player .

Maybe someone here knows something about it ? I would be very interested to find out more . <p> I am a french post-production manager ( I am not quite sure of the translation ) in a DVD publishing company and I use the - so called - technology lock and pay quite often . The company that is suppose to own the patent , belongs to a guy called Bonnant . I know the guy and the system , I am not sure there is anything to be patented in what he does , so I personaly believe this is pure bluff . <p> The visible process is simple : when you pick a video to watch it ( or when you insert the DVD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dial a reference number to get the unlocking code , then you use your remote control to enter the 4 digits of this code and if it is the right one the video starts playing . The background process is quite simple too , it 's only authoring. it is just a set of slighly different menu where the user selects a digit from 0 to 9 ( as regular DVD buttons ) and 4 holes showing wich of the 4 digit you are going to fill . the first menu ( the 1st digit menu ) asks to call the phone number and gives the reference code , after he had call , the user enter the first digit . if the right first digit was selected you go to a similar menu ( with an ordinary DVD link ) where the first hole is checked and the second highlighted , meaning the first digit is already filled and the second one will be next ( this one we 'll call the 2nd digit right menu ) . In case the first digit is wrong , you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second digit right menu ( so the user does n't know he is wrong ) , but that will lead to a dead end whatever digit will be entered next ( the 2nd digit wrong menu ) . concretly , 9 of the 10 buttons of the first digit menu will lead to the 2nd digit wrong menu , and the button corresponding to the right digit will lead to the 2nd digit right menu . then 9 buttons of the 2nd digit right menu will lead to the 3rd digit wrong menu and 1 will lead to the 3rd digit right menu and so on for the 4th digit , the right button of the 4th digit right menu will lead to the video , and all other to a " wrong code " message page . if at any point you end up in a digit x wrong menu all of the buttons , in this menu , will lead to the next digit wrong menu till the 4th digit where you lead to a page warning the user he entered the wrong code . So if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will need to have 4xN + 4 menus just to handle the codes . ( 1 per digit right for each video : 4xN + 1 per digit wrong - these can me common to all of the videos ) . It is not easy to handle so I considerably improved the system with scripts .

The whole movie is recorded at full resolution but the image is literally squashed out of shape and no fine details are lost ! It is only with the relatively new introduction of wide screen TV 's that it has been possible to view anamorphic movies at full resolution . A DVD player has a built in function that allows it to re-stretch an Anamorphic movie out to full size again . This way anamorphic DVD are able to take full advantage of whatever extra resolution specifications advances in TV technologies make . If your TV is not wide enough to take an anamorphic image , then the image will just be Letterboxed and look like any widescreen movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your computer , you will probably find that the picture is still squashed . It is not an error with the ripping process , but rather the computers inability to resize the image as would be done on a normal DVD player . The above picture is a 720 x 576 PAL rip , but when opened in a DVD player it will be resized to something like 852 x 480 ! <p> If you find that the DVD of your favorite movie does n't say widescreen , it may be an idea to wait a bit before you buy it . Sometimes they are replaced by the widescreen versions later on , and you will end up buying the movie twice , no doubt to the joy of the movie industry = ) . <p> Aspect Ratios <p> Yes , many of you have looked on a DVD box and read Anamorphic Widescreen 16:9 2.35:1 and thought ' what the Fu*k ! ' Nevertheless , most of you will be familiar with the idea of ratios even if you think you do n't . Imagine , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four parts vodka to three parts of soda . That would be a ratio of 4:3 . It does n't matter if you used four gallons of vodka to every three gallons of soda , or four egg cups of vodka to every three egg cups of soda , it would still be a ratio of 4:3 ! <p> Aspect ratios work exactly the same way . Interestingly enough , your TV screen is probably an aspect ratio of 4:3 too =o ) . That is , three parts down by four parts across . But to say a picture is always four by three parts makes it hard to make exact measurements . Instead an alternative system is used ; we measure the height and the width . For example , in the image below we have a ratio of 1.33:1 ( or 1.33 to 1 ) . The 1 can be anything . Imagine , for example , the blue rectangle below was 1 meter high . The width would then be 1.33 meters across , or , if you like : 1 meter and 1 meter 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on DVD 's . It does n't matter what measurements we use , it could be millimeters , centimeters , pixels , points , whatever . It always remains in perfect shape if we resize it by the aspect ratio it was originally . There are a couple of 4:3 aspect ratios , for example 1.25:1 , 1.36:1 , but DVD 's that say a ratio of 4:3 will usually use 1.25:1 . <p> A second very often used aspect ratio is 16:9 . That is , sixteen parts to every nine parts . This is basically what you will get from a widescreen TV . <p> There are a myriad of possible ratios for widescreen . But probably the most used of them for DVD 's will be 1:85:1 ( American ) , 1.66:1 ( European ) , 1.77:1 ( British ) and especially CinemaScope at 2.35:1 ( worldwide ) . CinemaScope are also sometimes called Panavision or just WideScreen . Of course , it could be a mistake to say any aspect ratio is just British or just American etc. , because studios just use the ratios they feel are best for their audience . 
@@98121253 @2321253/ <p> You may remap PGCs within a domain ( from the Domain menu ) , TTNs within a VTS Titles domain ( from the Title menu ) , whole titlesets ( from the DVD menu ) and title numbers ( from the Title menu ) . You can also change the VOB-Cell IDs for any cell from the PGC Editor ( this is explained in the help file ) . <p> The basic function is the same ; just the calling procedure is different . We will illustrate by remapping a PGC . <p> REMAPPING PGCs <p> STEP 1 First , make sure you have parsed all menu buttons and Buttons Over Video . This is critical in all remapping functions . <p> Next , position the PGC selector on any PGC in the desired domain and click Domain ? Remap PGC ( if you wanted to remap title numbers you would click Title ? Remap Title numbers and if you were remapping titlesets , you would call DVD ? Remap Titlesets ) <p> PgcEdit first searches ( silently ) for occurrences of SPRM 6 or 10 ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of these SPRMs , PgcEdit will display the following : <p> Answer OK to continue . <p> ( In the unlikely event that this function will risk navigation errors , a warning will appear enabling you to easily search for the offending commands and edit them manually , if you wish in this case , proceed at your own risk ) . <p> STEP 2 <p> Once you have clicked OK , the following dialogue will appear , showing the remapped and original PGC numbers , their designations , playing time ( or dummy ) , number of buttons , title number ( if in the titles domain ) and PGC comment ( if any ) . <p> STEP 3 In this example , I am going to move all the uncalled PGCs to the bottom . Or , I could select one or more PGCs and move them anywhere I liked by clicking Move up or Move down as many times as necessary . <p> Ctrl-click to highlight the desired PGCs . If you want to select the majority of PGCs , you can select the ones you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> STEP 4 Click To bottom . You can do other manipulations if you like . When you are finished , click OK ( or if you messed up , click Cancel ) . <p> PgcEdit fixes all the commands in the DVD , including the button commands which are stored in the menu VOBs . It also ensures the PGC comments are aligned with the correct PGCs . In the status bar , it will tell you what it has done . <p> STEP 5 Ctrl-S to save . If the button commands in a menu VOB have been altered , PgcEdit will save the affected menu VOBs . In addition , if copies of the original menu VOBs are not already in the backup folder , PgcEdit will offer to back them up ( its very important to answer Yes in case you need to restore things later ) . <p> Special note regarding TTN remapping : <p> If you are remapping PGCs that are TTNs ( internal title numbers ) of a VTS , an extra step is required <p> In the above , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of VTS 1 . TTNs 1 and 3 have swapped places so TTN 3 is now PGC 1 and vice versa . While this is perfectly legal , you may wish to remap the TTNs within the VTS ( for example , you will not be able to remove the last PGC in the domain if it is not the last TTN ) . With PgcEdit , this is simple . <p> Simply , click Title ? Re-order TTNs in domain <p> PgcEdit does another internal check ( this time for SPRM 5 ) to see if the function is safe ( if it is n't a warning will appear and you can search for , and if necessary fix , the offending commands ) . <p> Click OK to re-order the TTNs and Ctrl-S to save your work . <p> As you see , PGC 1 is now TTN 1 ( Title 15 ) and PGC 3 is now TTN 3 ( Title 1 ) . <p> REMAPPING TITLE NUMBERS <p> You can remap the title numbers using the same methodology with the command Title ? Remap Title numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since you may only remove the highest title number , it may need to be remapped ( see below for an easier method to remove uncalled titles ) . <p> Notice how new title 2 is old title 3 ( in VTS 2 ) , while old title 2 ( in VTS 1 ) has been pushed down to be new title 5 . <p> REMAPPING TITLESETS <p> The same procedures apply to remapping VTSs . Call DVD ? Remap Titlesets and make your adjustments . <p> Answer Yes when asked if you wish to make an incremental backup and the VTSs will be remapped . <p> Note : Be sure to scan for BOVs first , otherwise their commands may not be remapped . <p> B. Removing Uncalled PGCs <p> There are 2 ways of doing this . <p> AUTOMATICALLY BULK REMOVAL <p> STEP 1 <p> Call the command DVD ? Delete Uncalled PGCs . <p> STEP 2 <p> If you have n't scanned for buttons over video ( BOV ) , PgcEdit will display a dialogue asking if you wish to do so . Unless you know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer to scan now . <p> Note : This warning is displayed only once per DVD . If you ignore it , you will need to scan the DVD manually for BOVs to ensure PGCs that are only called by BOVs are not deleted . <p> STEP 3 <p> Once the BOV scan is complete , PgcEdit will scan the DVD iteratively for PGCs that are never called ( either in the PGCs or menu buttons ) and highlight them in pink . It will then bring up the following dialogue , which you should read carefully . <p> Simply click OK to get rid of all Uncalled PGCs in the DVD . If PgcEdit finds a menu is uncalled , it will delete that too . When removing PGCs , PgcEdit will remap everything correctly , including title numbers and buttons in menu VOBs . As usual , Ctrl-S to save and accept the prompts regarding saving menu VOBs . <p> When PgcEdit discovers that a whole VTS can be deleted , it will pause on the last PGC and display the following : <p> Just answer OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> Save and reload the DVD ; <p> If necessary , move the VTS to the end and remap title numbers ; and finally , <p> Delete the VTS and save the DVD . <p> All in a couple of clicks ! <p> CAUTION : <p> This function is an extremely efficient way to tidy up your DVD . However , make sure you have scanned for menu buttons and BOVs or else some PGCs may be identified incorrectly as uncalled and therefore will be deleted ! As well , this function might be risky if there are commands which call certain SPRM registers in the DVD . PgcEdit will notify you if this is the case . <p> MANUALLY ONE PGC AT A TIME <p> To manually remove a PGC , you can use the command Domain ? Delete last PGC in domain ( after having remapped your uncalled PGC to be the last one and assuring yourself it is uncalled ) . However , if it is a title PGC , it must be the highest numbered title in the DVD and the last TTN in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and reorder the TTNs in the VTS ) . <p> Answer Yes and , as usual , Ctrl-S to save when you are finished deleting PGCs . <p> Its a good idea to ensure your DVD navigation is not broken after these actions . Click Info ? Find jumps to nowhere to assure yourself there are no broken links in the DVD . If there are , you should restore your backup ( File ? Backups ? Restore backup ) and start again by searching for uncalled PGCs ( Info ? Find Uncalled PGCs ) . <p> Another good thing to do is to fully test your DVD via a Trace to see if it behaves as expected . This is explained in detail in the PgcEdit help file . <p> C. Restoring backups <p> If you realise that you 've done something you did n't  want to do , or worse , messed something up , PgcEdit has a backup system that can restore you to an earlier state . The easy way to do this is thru the File ? Backups menu . <p> Understanding backups <p> PgcEdit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called PgcEditbackup . Other backups in your project folder are older ones and are labelled with a date and time suffix in the following format **25;702;TOOLONG . The date and time are the last time that folder was modified before renaming . <p> You can create an Incremental backup manually ( File ? Backups ? New incremental backup ) or automatically when you are remapping titlesets . This creates a new PgcEditbackup based on the current state of the DVD and renames the old backup folder to one with a date and time suffix . <p> As a rule , it is always better to restore the current backup ( File ? Backups ? Restore Backup ) before trying to undo the previous incremental backup . This is because there may be VOBs or other important remapping information in it . However , PgcEdit will determine if it is safe to undo an incremental backup . If so , you will receive this message . <p> Answering OK will replace the PgcEditbackup folder with the next most recent backup folder and reload the DVD ( do n't  forget to parse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you try to undo an incremental backup and PgcEdit determines that you should n't because there are VOBs in the latest backup , it will warn you : <p> If you see this message , its best to answer Yes and PgcEdit will automatically restore the ( latest ) backup otherwise you will lose important VOB files . <p> When restoring a backup , select the option to Move VOBs back . <p> Once the latest backup has been restored , reload the DVD and you can Undo last Incremental backup safely . Undoing an incremental backup will make it the latest backup and rename it back to PgcEditbackup . If you have many incremental backups , you can continue on in this vein until you are back to where you started , where your only backup folder will be named PgcEditbackup and you will get this message . <p> At this point in time , you may only restore the original backup created when you loaded the DVD and you have returned ( safely ) to the point where you originally loaded the project . <p> " Alien " Backups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project folder . These include FixVTS , VobBlanker and MenuShrink . Based on the timestamp of these backup folders , PgcEdit will inform you of whether or not you should manually restore one of these backups instead of a PgcEdit backup . <p> Click Yes and cut and paste all the files in the relevant backup folder ( e.g. FixVTSBackup ) to the project folder and reload the DVD in PgcEdit ( Ctrl-R ) . If you click No , the other backup will be bypassed , probably resulting in a corrupt project . <p> Note : Not every program makes multiple backup folders so this process may not yield perfect results . VobBlanker does , and it is recommended that you configure it to do so , and multiple FixVTS backup folders will be created if you launch FixVTS from PgcEdits Tools menu . For maximum safety however , we recommend that you run these programs once your editing in PgcEdit is complete ( or at least until you have finished making structural changes to your project ) . <p> D. Reclaiming Space in the VOBs <p> After you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run the DVD project through FixVTS to remove the cells from the VOBs ( but note the caution at the bottom of this guide ) . <p> After you have saved your project , select Tools ? FixVTS and click Full DVD . Its a good idea to have In placeunticked so you can have a backup ( this is the default if calling FixVTS from PgcEdits Tools menu . As well , if FixVTS is called from the Tools menu , PgcEdit will be able to make multiple FixVTS backup folders ) . <p> CAUTION : It is recommended that you use FixVTS or VobBlanker to cleanup the VOBs only when you are entirely comfortable with the final structure of your DVD . This is because these programs alter the VOBs and perhaps you may not have even saved backups of the VOBs . If you do run FixVTS or VobBlanker during the middle of an editing run , save backups of the VOBs and transfer them into the PgcEditbackup folder . <p> IMPORTANT - Things to watch out for <p> Make incremental backups and backups of menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case things go wrong . <p> When restoring backups , its wise to do a " Restore backup " before starting to undo incremental backups . <p> There may be a file in an incremental backup folder called remapvtsinfo.tcl . Do not delete or modify this file ( it is read only ) , as this will certainly ruin your chances of restoring a backup successfully . <p> Before deleting or remapping anything , make sure you have scanned for menu buttons and BOVs ( buttons over video ) the default is to scan for these on loading a DVD . <p> PgcEdit will warn you if it is potentially risky to remap or delete anything . If this happens , search for and , if necessary , modify the offending commands and then re-call the relevant function . <p> It is safest to reclaim space with FixVTS or VobBlanker after editing in PgcEdit has been completed . However , to reduce risk , make sure VobBlanker is configured to make multiple backup folders ( see the more settings screen ) and have " In place " unticked when running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tools menu ) .

Just follower the instructions in the installer and you 'll be fine . <p> Start Womble EasyDVD . You 'll be at the introduction screen . You have the option to create a new project or open an existing one . But before we do either , we 'll configure some of the global options for the software . To do this , click on the " Options " button near the top right corner of the software . <p> The " General " options tab allows you to set whether to load the previously edited/saved project at the start , and whether to check for new updates at the start . Moving on to the " Source " tab , the only option here allows you to set the default minimum chapter duration , which is useful when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next tab , " Menu " , here you can set the default , minimum and maximum menu duration settings . And lastly in the " Output " section , you can allow for the export of non standard DVDs ( not really recommended ) and a couple of other non essential options . You can now close the options window . Most of the important options will be set later on , so do n't worry . <p> Press the " New " button to start a new project . We 'll be forwarded to the " Source " section . Note at the top there are 6 sections , " Start " , " Source " , " Menu " , " Preview " , " Output " and " Burn " . For those that have used DVD authoring tools before , these sections will be pretty familiar . If not , then these represents the various steps in DVD authoring , " Source " is where we add in the input video files that we will create a DVD from . <p> LONG ... <h> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation <p> We 'll now add in our input video files , perform some basic editing if needed , and create chapter points . All of this can be accomplished at the " Source " stage . Before we add in our input movies , you might notice that there are actually two " Add " buttons here , and this requires an explanation of the data management structure of EasyDVD , which is very similar to that of most other authoring packages . The top " Add " button , with the movie reel icon , is for adding what EasyDVD refers to as " Movies " . The bottom " Add " button with the film strip icon is for adding " Clips " . <p> A " Movie " consists of one or more " Clips " . So what is a movie and what is a clip ? Well , a movie generally contains one or more clips that will play continuously and have the same property ( same resolution , aspect ratio , audio ... ) . Let 's use the example of taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main movie will consist of several VOB files on the DVD , each of these VOB files will be a clip , but will belong to the same " Movie " . So in this case , you 'll first press the " Add Movie " button to add the first VOB file for the main movie , and then you will use the " Add Clip " button to load the other VOB files . For the bonus features , you can group each bonus feature as their own movie , so the documentary would be a movie consisting of one or more VOB files , the trailer would be another movie and so on . Basically , a " Movie " will have it 's own menu entry , whereas " Clips " will not , apart from being in the chapter select menu . <p> Once you add a movie , an icon is added below to represent the movie . You can right click on this icon to change some of its properties . The first thing to do is to select or deselect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play item is something that plays at the start of disc insertion , before any menus are shown . This could be a studio trailer , a copyright notice , or if you prefer movies to start right away without the menu , the main movie . You can also edit the label of the movie to make it easier from an organisation point of view . <p> Selecting the " Encoder Settings " option opens up the encoder options for this movie , where you can modify the audio and video encoder options . If EasyDVD detected that your input files are already DVD compliant , then you should see two blue bars which represent " Stream Copy " ( or no re-encoding ) . Otherwise , parts or all of the video ( and audio ) may require re-encoding . While EasyDVD will do its best to detect whether your source is PAL or NTSC , you should check to make sure that the right settings are selected here , and do the same with the aspect ratio setting . If you 're not sure what these options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . <p> So load in all your input files first ( it might take a while to load in , depending on the length of your input files ) , and then label and adjust the encoder settings . Below is a screenshot of the example I used for this guide , which consists of a main movie , a studio logo trailer that will be a " first play " and a featurette for the movie ( my source files were from an unencrypted DVD , so no re-encoding necessary ) . Note that the main movie I had consisted of 5 VOB clips . <p> We 're not done with the source section just yet . Clicking on the movie or clip icon allows you to edit and add chapters . The editing facility is pretty basic compared to say Womble MPEG Video Wizard , but extensive editing should not really be performed in a DVD authoring tool . Editing is basically limited to trimming away parts of the video that you do n't need , and you need to first click on the clip icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to trim . A video preview of the clip is shown on the right , and below that , you have control buttons . For editing , the three buttons we need are the mark-in , mark-out and the trim button . Use the mark-in and mark-out buttons to select the part that you want to cut out , and then use the trim button to remove that part . The Undo and Redo buttons are useful if you 've made a mistake . <p> The last thing we will do in the source section is to create the chapter points . These are the points that can be skipped to using the next/previous chapter buttons on your DVD remote , or selectable in the chapters menus . You can manually add in chapter points , or to automatically add them in based on duration ( for example , add a chapter point every X minutes ) or the number of chapters ( set Y number of chapters and EasyDVD will create them with equal durations ) . Note that the start of each clip in your movie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if you need do . You can click on the movie icon or the clip icons , and then use the chapter control buttons to add/remote chapters , or to create chapter points based on duration . To remove chapter points , use the prev/next chapter control buttons and then click on the " add/remove chapter " button . Chapters are noted as yellow points on the timeline . <p> Now is probably a good time to save your project . To do so , go back to the " Start " section and select the save option . Next , skip to the " Output " section , and note the size of the project listed under " Project Information " - you need to control this so that the compilation fits onto your DVD , otherwise you may need to re-encode everything ( if your input is n't DVD compliant , then it does n't matter as much , since it will require re-encoding anyway ) . Click on the " Menu " button at the top to go to the menu section . Remember to save the project often from now on .

This statement from you above shows me one thing : <p> Originally posted by MrCreosote Christian , you are THE MAN ! VLC plays my OGM and MKV for the first time ever on my PC ! <p> Be aware though , VLC cant play MKVs with Realvideo ( RV9 / RV10 / RV40 ) as its developers refused to break the GPL license by linking to closed decoder libraries , like the DLLs coming with Realplayer , to be able to decode Realvideo . Alternatives are the win32 compiles of Xine and mplayer , both are the most known Linux players and their developers do n't  follow the GPL license to the letter here and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As far as my sytem being completely screwed - you wo n't get any arguments from me . It looks like I could remove codecs thru Control Pane . I could uninstall all players and remove all codecs and start over . <p> You have to understand , that these codecs you can access from the control panel do n't  have any meaning for playback , this list only contains the ACM ( Audio Codec manager ) and VCM ( Video Codec Manager ) encoder and decoders , which can be used by Video for Windows ( VfW ) based applications like Virtualdub , for audio and video compression . <p> Most players for Windows today , and that includes Windows Media Player , rely on DirectShow and suitable DShow filters for playback , and those codecs/filters ca n't be accessed from control panel . <p> You will need special tools to cleanthem up , like the filter managers coming with Zoomplayer ( http : //www.inmatrix.com ) and Radlights ' Filter Manager .

If you google for it , run it ( it does n't  need installation ) and make a ' file ' ' render media file ' on your OGMs and MKVs , and post a screenshot here of the filter graph , i am convinced i can find out from looking at the graph what filter is causing problems for you . <p> If you then deactivate or lower the merit of this filter , all might work fine again . If not , your DirectShow may be messed up completely , and upgrading to latest DirectX ( Ver . 9c now ) may be the only rescue .

@@98121259 @2321259/ <h> Page 10 of 10 : TVersity : Playing the H.264 file on your PS3 <h> Step 8 : TVersity : Playing the H.264 file on your PS3 <p> There are two main methods to getting the MP4/VOB/MPG/M2TS to play on your PS3 . The first is to use a USB drive/CD/DVD and play it from these media on your PS3 - this is the easiest way to set up , since you all need to do is to copy the MP4/VOB/MPG file to the USB/CD/DVD , and then insert it into your PS3 . When using the USB method , make sure you put the video file in a folder named " VIDEO " , otherwise you will have to select the USB drive , open up the options using the triangle button , and then select " Display All " . <p> The other way is a bit harder to set up initially , but it will make it easier in the future to play your MP4/VOB/MPG/M2TS files , since you can play them directly from your computer . Basically it involves setting up a UPnP server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the media server - the PS3 will then be able to read all the media files on your computer and play them back by streaming it across the network . <p> We will be using TVersity as our media server , mainly because it includes built-in support for the PS3 and supports H.264 MP4/VOB/MPG/M2TS files quite well . I 'm using the latest Release Candidate ( not final release ) version of TVersity due to it being able to support the latest PS3 firmware updates . <p> At this point , I shall refer you to our TVersity Setup Guide , which features instructions on how to install and configure TVersity . When you have finished following the TVersity tutorial , come back and continue on with the instructions below . <h> PS3 Setup <p> We must first set up the PS3 so that it accepts the media server connection . Go to the Settings -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; and make sure the " Media Server Connection " option is set to " Enabled " . <p> As mentioned before in the MeGUI audio encoding section of this guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to accept a PCM 5.1 audio through HDMI , then you can enjoy 5.1 channel audio from your H.264 MP4 file , but you will need to configure the PS3 to output the required audio . If you followed the guide with the alternative VOB/MPG/M2TS file technique , then you do n't need to select AAC or PCM 5.1 from the steps below , you only need to ensure AC3 is selected . <p> If you have an AAC/AC3 compatible decoder/receiver , go to the Settings -&gt; Sound Settings -&gt; Audio Output Settings -&gt; select the type of audio output you are using ( HDMI or Optical ) and then proceed until you get to the screen that ask you which audio formats your TV/decoder can accept - make sure AAC and/or AC3 are selected . <p> If you do n't have an AAC compatible decoder/receiver , but you do have one that supports PCM 5.1 through HDMI , then go to the Settings -&gt; Sound Settings -&gt; Audio Output Settings -&gt; HDMI -&gt; proceed until you get to the screen that ask you which audio formats your TV/decoder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options are selected ( depending on which is supported by your decoder ) . <h> Connecting to TVersity from the PS3 <p> We finally move on to playing our MP4/VOB/MPG/M2TS file on the PS3 . This tutorial assumes you 've already setup the PS3 for network and Internet connections . Start TVersity and make sure sharing is enabled . <p> Now on the PS3 , go to the " Video " section . The TVersity icon should show up as one of the video options , with the name of your computer and the words " TVersity Media Server " next to it . If you do not see this , use the " Search for Media Servers " option to get the PS3 to find your computer that is running TVersity . <p> Select the TVersity server you want to connect to ( you can have multiple TVersity servers running , one per computer ) and then browse the folders until you get to your sharing folder ( eg. Video -&gt; My Video -&gt; Folders -&gt; ... ) . Your H.264 files should show up and you can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the " Display " option during playback ( using the " Display " button on the Blu-ray remote control , or using the controller to bring up the options select screen and select the " Display " option there ) to display information about the current file - the screenshow below shows an AVC ( H.264 ) file playback with the current bitrate at 20.8 Mbps and with AAC 5.1 48 kHz audio . <p> TVersity also shared pictures and audio files , and you can browse for those as well if you added them into the TVersity sharing section . Audio and image playback should be much more compatible than video playback , so you should n't run into any problems there .

@@98121271 @2321271/ 11152 @qwx871152 <h> Page 6 of 7 : HD Audio <h> Chapter 7 : HD Audio <p> The two HD formats not only improves the picture quality , the sound quality has also been massively improved . Unlike the " matrixed " 7.1 sounds on DVDs , Blu-ray and HD DVD both support true 7.1 channel audio , and sometimes in either lossless or uncompressed format . Being lossless of uncompressed means standard audio compression techniques ( needed to get the audio file size down to something acceptable ) will no longer be needed , as this " lossy " type of compression reduces quality . <p> Before we get to the new HD formats , let 's go through the many ways which you can enjoy these HD ( or high bitrate ) audio formats and the requirements of each method . <p> Raw Bitstream Transport : Also known as " pass-through " mode . This method sends the raw unprocessed digital data over HDMI 1.3 or newer connections , so the receiving device ( your AV receiver/decoder ) can do the decoding . HDMI 1.3 is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formats . Note that eventually , there will be audio tracks that require audio mixing to be done on the player , and as such , bitstreaming may have limited usage . <p> Decoding to Linear PCM : The HD audio can be decoded by the player to Linear PCM 5.1/7.1 ( uncompressed ) audio and sent through the HDMI connection . HDMI 1.3 , despite some reports , is not required since all versions of HDMI supports up to 8 channels of PCM audio at 192kHz , 24 bits per sample . <p> Transcoding to legacy format : The HD audio can also be transcoded/converted to an older format that your amp/receiver will support , like Dolby Digital AC3 or DTS . This type of audio will only require an optical/SPDIF connection , since the bitrate used is the same as standard DVDs ( and so technically , this not " real " HD audio ) . Sometimes a legacy track is provided alongside the HD track to prevent the need for any processing to get to a legacy format . <p> Ok , so let 's now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the new HD formats ? <p> Linear PCM : LPCM has existed since the days of CDs , but now with HDMI 's higher bandwidth , it can now carry 5.1 or 7.1 channels of audio , as opposed to the 2 channel audio found on CDs . LPCM is uncompressed audio , so it requires a lot of storage space . Linear PCM 5.1/7.1 requires HDMI due to the increased bandwidth required that optical/SPDIF can not handle . <p> Dolby Digital Plus : Also known as E-AC3 or DD+ , this is a lossy compression format designed to replace the Dolby Digital AC3 system . The advantages of DD+ over AC3 are several encoder based enhancements , as well as support for higher bitrates and up to 13.1 channels of audio at 96 kHz with 24-bit depth . Up to 6 Mbps streams are supported . DD+ is mandatory for HD DVD , meaning all HD DVD players must be able to decode DD+ to LPCM or downmix to a legacy format . DD+ is only optional for Blu-ray , meaning all discs with DD+ audio must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolution Audio : DTS-HD HR is the DTS 's answer to DD+ . It is also a lossy format that supports up to 7.1 channels of audio at 96 kHz with 24-bit depth . Up to 6 Mbps streams are supported as well . DTS-HD HR support is optional on both Blu-ray and HD DVD players . <p> Dolby TrueHD : TrueHD is a lossless audio format employing the MLP technique . It features 8 channel support at 96kHz/24-bit with a maximum bitrate of 18 Mbps - most movies so far have only used 5 or 6 Mbps of the maximum allowed bandwidth . TrueHD is an optional audio standard for Blu-ray , while it is mandatory for HD DVD . All HD DVD players must be able decode Dolby TrueHD to LPCM up to 2 channels as part of the mandatory specifications , although all current ( as of December 2007 ) HD DVD players will decode up to 8 channels of LPCM through HDMI output . <p> DTS-HD Master Audio : DTS-HD MA is a lossless audio format , and DTS 's answer to Dolby TrueHD and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie studio 's master audio track , which signifies the highest level of audio quality achievable . It supports virtually unlimited channels of audio , while also supporting 96kHz/24-bit audio . Bandwidth support is up to a massive 24 Mbps . It also features a lossy " core " DTS soundtrack for legacy compatibility . DTS-HD MA is optional for both Blu-ray and HD DVD . <p> So with the above information , what kind of audio equipment should you need ? Since all the formats supports legacy output in one form or another , you existing AC3/DTS amp/receiver will give you multi-channel audio for all of these formats , but perhaps not at the higher bitrate , resolution and channels that these HD tracks may include . So if you are wary of spending more money on your sound system , then you do n't need to upgrade to achieve a more than acceptable level of Blu-ray and HD DVD audio performance . <p> Please note that while the PS3 is recommended several times in this guide , the older " fat " variety can not bitstream any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models can . All can decode Dolby TrueHD to PCM , and the same for DTS-HD MA ( when updated to firmware 2.30 or later ) . <p> Then there is the issue of audio mixing , which basically means that player decoding support is preferred to bitstreaming and receiver decoding . An example of audio mixing is the interactive elements such as the audio in menus - bitstreaming will mean no such audio is heard , while player decoding will mix the various sound elements together before sending it all out as a single PCM stream . With increased interactivity , audio mixing will become more and more important . In other words , a player doing the decoding is a more future proof way of handling audio than bitstreaming , so keep this in mind . <p> However , if you are in the market for a new sound system , the recommendation would be to get a system that supports at least PCM 8 channel audio input via HDMI . Note that not all HDMI receiver/amps will process the audio component of the HDMI signal - some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your amp/receiver can accept 8 channel PCM audio through the HDMI connection , then you will be able to enjoy a high level of audio from Blu-ray and HD DVD . <p> But if money is no object , then you will want a HDMI receiver that supports the decoding of all of the above HD audio formats , and of course a Blu-ray and HD DVD player that supports raw bitstream output for all of these formats to feed your receiver ( not all do , unfortunately - for example the Toshiba HD-A30 does not support bitstream output while the Toshiba HD-A35 does , even though both has HDMI audio output ) . But prices for such receivers are dropping all the time , and you can pick a TrueHD and DTS-HD MA decoding receiver like the Onkyo TX-SR605S for less than $380 from Amazon . Is there really a huge difference between letting your player decode the TrueHD/Master Audio stream and feed it to your receiver via LPCM , versus feeding the receiver the bitstream and letting the receiver decode it ? Both are handled differently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " better " or " worse " is a bit subjective . Then there is also the issue of audio mixing outlined above , and so bitstreaming is of limited use .

@@98121278 @2321278/ <p> Many standalone DVD recorders on the market today have problems when recording widescreen content that may not be at first apparent . The problem occurs when a true widescreen input ( not a letterboxed one ) is fed into the DVD recorder , which then records it as if it were 4:3 ( fullscreen ) content without setting the 16:9 ( 16x9 ) flag . <p> When playing back this recorded DVD on a 4:3 screen that has manual 16:9 switching ( allowing to you manually vertically squeeze the picture ) , everything appears to be fine . But when playing it back on a widescreen monitor with a DVD player that automatically corrects the aspect ratio ( eg. adds black bars to the left and right to make the 4:3 content appear correct ) , then what you get is something that looks like this : <p> When it should actually look something like this : <p> When playing back the DVD on a 4:3 monitor that does n't have manual 16:9 mode switching , you may get something like this : <p> When it should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is because the recorded DVD 's aspect ratio ( the ratio of width/height ) is set to 4:3 mode , instead of 16:9 . Your DVD recorder has actually managed to record the widescreen content in an anamorphic fashion without setting the anamorphic/16:9 flag . <p> Solutions : <p> The simplest solution to solve this problem for your widescreen display is to setup your standalone DVD player 's " TV Output " setting to " 4:3 " ( either pan-scan or letterbox will do ) . The problem with this approach , other than the fact that you have to keep on switching between this setting , is that some DVD players ( eg. computer based software DVD players like PowerDVD , and certain " big brand " DVD players ) either do n't have this option or the options does n't actually work . And if you are making this DVD for a friend or you wish to lend it to others , then it is troublesome to expect them to make the same switch on their DVD players . There are no simple solutions if your TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( other than to get a new TV set ) . <p> The solution outline in this guide is one that will allow you to change the recorded DVD 's mode from 4:3 to 16:9 , or otherwise referred to as " setting the 16:9 flag " . This can be done using a free tool called IfoEdit . <p> Because you 'll be editing files on a DVD , it is recommended that you do the following first : <p> 1 . Use a DVD rewritable disc to initially make the recording in your standalone DVD player 2 . Finalize the disc 3 . Copy the files from the disc to your computer and then proceed to edit these copied files <p> The DVD files you copied from the recorded DVD should look something like this ( you may have more or less files than shown in the screenshot ) : <p> You can try to play back these files within a software DVD player like PowerDVD ( in PowerDVD , use the " Open DVD files on hard disk drive " option ) , and you should immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspect Ratio " option ( that normally allows you to set if 16:9 anamorphic content should be displayed normally or vertically stretched ) wo n't work . <p> There might be several files you need to edit within IfoEdit to set the 16:9 flag . The first file is usually VTS010.IFO ( VIDEOTS.IFO and VIDEOTS.VOB are the files for the menu , and all the BUP files are BackUP files for all the IFO files ) . There might also be VTS020.IFO , VTS030.IFO and so on - these indicate more than one title set on your DVD ( eg. if you have recorded more than one show/clip using the DVD recorder ) . You will need to edit each and every title set ( IFO file ) that has the 16:9 problem , following the instructions below on each of the IFO files/title sets . <p> In IfoEdit , click on the " Open " button and open the VTS010.IFO file <p> IfoEdit should now display the information for this file . Look for the line shown in the screenshot below ( marked in red ) , notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title set . <p> Double-click on this line to edit it . A new window should open , and it is here that you can select the correct ( 16:9 ) aspect ratio for your widescreen DVD . You should also select ( check ) the " Automatic Pan&amp;Scan " and " Automatic Letterboxed " options . Enabling these options will allow your DVD player to set how this DVD should be played . <p> When you have finished editing , press " OK " to close the window . <p> Click on the " Save " button to save your edited IFO file , and select " Yes " when IfoEdit asks if you wish to create a BUP ( BackUP ) file . <p> Now repeat steps 2 thru 5 for each title set you need to modify . When you are finished with these title sets , you will then need to open up VIDEOTS.IFO , and then repeat the changes for each of the title sets you have modified - it will be fairly obvious where you need to make the changes . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that need to be changed . <p> After you have finished editing all your IFO files , you can close IfoEdit and try to play back these files again within a software DVD player like PowerDVD ( in PowerDVD , use the " Open DVD files on hard disk drive " option ) , and you should immediately find that the content plays back at the correct aspect ratio , and that the " Keep Aspect Ratio " option now works properly . <p> Now all you need to do is to burn your copied and edited DVD files to a DVD disc , using Nero Burning ROM or a similar DVD-Video burning software . And we 're done . <p> For some reason changing the aspect ratio flag in IFOedit to 16:9 does not work . Clicking " ok " after setting the flag leaves the line of video MPEG-2 unchanged , Any ideas why this is not working please ? <p> IMHO , it is easier to change the 16:9 flag with PgcEdit . Just right-click on any PGC of the domain and select " Domain Streams Attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current VTS and in the copy of the streams attributes in the VMGM ( in VIDEOTS.IFO ) . With IfoEdit , you have to do the two modifications by hand , and IfoEdit has a lot of bugs in its GUI . <p> Thanks Ben . We click " ok " after setting the ratios but the VTS file remains unchanged whereas previously we saw it change over from 4:3 to 16:9 . Clicking " save " makes no difference . It is as if the programe just is n't working , and we have downloaded it four time now . <p> It was fantastic when it worked ! <p> BTW how do you delete the programme ? It does n't  show up in the remove file listing . <p> Have found out what went wrong and have successfully flagged files to 16:9 . <p> We now have adapted video filesand audio file on hard drive . But want to burn dvd from DVD workshop 2 for dual layer facility.How do we get the adapted files in a format ( eg single . avi ) to import into Workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 16:9 Quicktime files . Then adding those quicktime files to Nero which then ( for some godforsaken reason ) will squeeze or stretch the video so that it is neither 4:3 nor 16:9 . I would assume it 's more like a 14:9 . Because it either has letterbox on the top or the sides no matter what I do . So I burned the DVD and followed your steps . Then I played the TS video back on my computer with Power DVD . This time it still had Nero 's stupid added letterbox but now it was playing extra wide . What looks to me like a 2.35:1 . Definately wider than my original Quicktime files . I played it on the DVD and it looked exactly like the first copy . With a 14:9 letterbox video which looks squeezed ( horizontally ) . So your changes had absolutely no effect on my DVD players ability to play the DVD . To triple check I put the DVD back into my computer and opened the files and sure enough the Ifoedit software says " 16:9 " Pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't work . It plays extra wide on Power DVD and exactly the same as before on my DVD player . <p> The above quote comes from a the comments section of the article on Digital Digest , which I will reply to here . <p> Dewandeler did you encode your QuickTime MOV files as anamorphic widescreen , or are they just plain old widescreen ? I have a feeling that the problem you are experiencing is not exactly related to this guide , and that this guide might not actually be relevant to your problem . <p> Is the native/proper aspect ratio of your video 1.85:1 ? <p> And when when you say you loaded it in Nero , is that Nero Burning ROM or Nero Vision ? <p> If your QuickTime files were anamorphic with an internal flag set by Avid/QuickTime to indicated this , and let 's say you load this file into Nero Vision . Nero Vision might fail to understand or read the internal flag , and so when loaded in . If the aspect ratio of your video file it taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting Nero Vision to " 4:3 " mode ( in the video configuration section ) might mean that Nero adds black borders to the left and right to make the video 4:3 . If you set the option to 16:9 , then it will add black borders to the top and bottom as well . Neither of these will look right , and it 's mainly because the input video 's resolution is one that Nero Vision fails to treat properly ( this is more of a Nero Vision bug , which seems to add borders to the left and right in 16:9 mode , when it should n't ) . <p> So assuming the native AR of your video is 1.85:1 ( or thereabouts ) , then my suggestion is that in Avid , export your video to a resolution of 720x480 ( if it is an NTSC clip , ie. it has a framerate of 23.976/24/29.97/30 FPS or multiples of these ) or 720x576 ( PAL clip , with framerate of 25 or a multiple of this ) , with the same options as you used before ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nero Vision and use the 4:3 mode ( in the preview , the video should look too tall ) . Encode it to a set of DVD files , and then edit the DVD IFO files using this IfoEdit method . Test again in PowerDVD , and hopefully , it should look correct now with the " keep aspect ratio " option turned on . <p> I 'm still not 100% convinced that Nero Vision treats input videos properly ( Nero Vision seems to always want to add a top/bottom border to the videos I 've tested , even in 720x576 ) , so perhaps using another DVD authoring tool is a better idea . <p> I like TMPGEnc DVD Author ( TDA ) - when you load a video file in it , it will actually ask you to specify the AR of the video file with a preview to show you . TDA does n't support making anamorphic DVDs though , but you can make one yourself with the help of this IfoEdit method : <p> 1 . Load in your anamorphic video file , and select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DVD as usual in TDA ( output to folder ) <p> I read your thread but it wo n't let me respond on the other site so I 'm responding here . You have the right info on the other page . Maybe Quicktime knows its anamorphic but Nero does n't . But I thought on this page or another page on this site it said that Ifoedit could fix Nero DVD 's . And that is fix the DVD after Nero adds the letterbox on top or the bars on the side . It seems what is happening is when I open the IFO file on my computer it shows the menu , I click the video and it plays the MPEG too wide . This is because Nero added the letterbox to the MPEG ( distorting my original quicktime ) . When I open the MPEG directly with Power DVD ( bypassing the IFO file ) it plays it stretched ( vertically ) just like the DVD player . I spent all day yesterday trying every possible combination of numbers like 720X480 , 720X540 , 950X540 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing every time . I ca n't even get the 4:3 ( 640X480 ) quicktime files to fill the screen ( because nero adds the letterbox ) . I set Nero to 4:3 and I load a 4:3 video and Nero adds the letterbox . This makes no sense to me . So it sounds now like Ifoedit can not fix Nero DVDs . I would rather not have to get new DVD software since I already paid for Nero and its been too long to get a refund . But if I have to it 's possible . Is there any free DVD authoring software out there that knows how to handle anamorphic 16:9 ( I 'm sure there is n't ) ? Or do I have to buy professional software and how much would that cost ( $600 ) ? <p> This IfoEdit method is not really to " fix " whatever bugs Nero Vision has , but rather , to allow anamorphic DVDs to be made after authoring in Nero Vision or TDA , and also to fix your DVD recorder recordings of widescreen content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anamorphic flag , and so you end up recording widescreen 16:9 content in 4:3 format ) . <p> However , from some testing , I 've found that when loading in existing VOB ( and possibly MPEG-2 ) sources , Nero does n't suffer from the same problem . So a solution might be to use a freeware MPEG-2 encoder ( or to output to MPEG-2 in Avid , if possible ) to encode the files first to a DVD compliant MPEG-2 stresm , and then load them up in Nero Vision , author and then edit with IfoEdit to add the 16:9 flag . I tested using DVD Flick , and it worked well ( DVD Flick is good because it allows you to manually override the AR or the input video - I set it to 4:3 to retain the anamorphic video ) - unfortunately , DVD Flick is a big buggy . <p> Take care . With IfoEdit , you change the AR in the IFO files only . It is also in the VOB files . Theoretically , the IFOs have precedence , but some players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files are flagged as 4:3 . To patch the VOB files , you can use DVDPatcher . <p> What about the menu flagging , I suppose the same goes for that as well you need to set the flags right if you have 16:9 menus ? <p> Do we need to set the 16:9 flag for the menu at the VIDEOTS.IFO file as well ? I 've authored a DVD in Encore having 16:9 menus , but the flag at the VIDEOTS.IFO was as 4:3 like in the sample image ( see the attachment ) I have here for some reason . In the VTS010.IFO etc. files the menu ( even though they do n't even have menus , so why is that ? ) aspect ratio setting was 4:3 as well ... <p> The menu AR is independent of the title AR . You do n't need to change it . Furthermore , if you have menu buttons in a menu , you can not safely change the AR , as the button highlights will be at the wrong position . <p> I do n't know Encore , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have specified 16:9 only for the AR of the movie . <p> If there are no menus in VTS 1 , 2 , etc , the menu AR is not used , and must be 4:3 . <p> Ok , so the VTS Menu attributes does stand for the DVD Menu attributes of the current VTS we are viewing right ? What then is the actual " Video Manager Menu attributes " of the VIDEOTS.IFO ? <p> As you said " If there are no menus in VTS 1 , 2 , etc , the menu AR is not used , and must be 4:3. " , then this explains why it 's like that for some of the VTS that do n't have menus , fine . <p> In Encore you are able to choose the aspect ratio for the menu , or it actually recognizes it by itself and it checks the 16:9 option for it . But in another authored DVD project of mine , there is no 4:3 content in it at all , no 4:3 menus or 4:3 timelines , but only 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are all in 16:9 . Why there is still the " Video Manager Menu attributes " flagged as 4:3 ( being the Video Menu Manager attributes in the VIDEOTS.IFO ) ? And as it is so , would it then be OK to change the aspect ratio flag of it to 16:9 ( letterbox ) ? <p> I 've also viewed other commercial titles with IFOedit and if they have 16:9 menus in them overall , their Video Menu Manager attributes of VIDEOTS.IFO are also flagged as 16:9 . <p> VIDEOTS.IFO holds the " Title Menu " . It is global to the whole DVD , and should theoretically contains the menu that allows you to jump to any title in the DVD . It is almost never used that way in commercial DVDs , but you can certainly create a Title Menu with Encore . <p> If Encore can flag the menu as 16:9 , then it 's because there is a 16:9 flag in the MPEG file you provide . Of course , the MPEG file must have been encoded with that flag correctly set . Encore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of still frames , as they do not have AR flags . <p> Again , if a menu has no video content ( and therefore no VOB file ) it must be in 4:3 . Otherwise , the AR depends of the authoring you did . You can not change it with PgcEdit ( or IfoEdit ) if it has menu buttons , or the highlights will be at wrong places . <p> Any theory why the other commercial titles which have 16:9 menus have the VIDEOTS.IFO Video Manager Menu flagged as 16:9 even if they have menu as their DVD TITLE ? How come it is possible not screwing things up if the menu ca n't indentify itself as 16:9 if it is a still image ? To be exact , DVD TITLE is the one where you get when you press the TITLE MENU button when viewing DVD from your remote controller , right ? Well , at least in a test case the IFOedit recognized a intro video as the DVD TITLE from the IFOEdit 's " DVD play " mode as I pushed there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD with normal DVD player the TITLE MENU button takes me to the actual main menu instead ... ? What 's the logic in that ? <p> Anyhow , I tested to change the VIDEOTS.IFO from my own project 's VIDEOTS.IFO file to that 16:9 and it did n't at least in the IFOEdit 's " DVD play " mode really change the button highlights at all ? And this current menu is my first play on dvd and the TITLE BUTTON action takes always the user to this menu . After all , it really is a 16:9 menu , even though originally the IFOEdit has the 4:3 flag for it for some reason . IS it ok to change this Video Manager Menu attribute flag if it doe n't mess up the DVD ( at least how the dvd seems to work in a player ) when you try to re-play it after the change ? Meaning , is it against the rules and " not legal " to do so ? <p> Hope you bear with me , trying to just get this cleared up once for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clicking the Title Menu button . Most of the time , the Title menu PGC is just a dummy , that calls the Root menu of the main VTS . In this case , there are no difference between the Root Menu and the Title Menu buttons . <p> In commercial DVDs , the other PGCs of the VMGM are usually filled with intros , logos , FBI warnings , and junk , but rarely with real menus with buttons . Of course , if the VMGM has some video content and even if it does n't have real menus with buttons , the AR flags are meaningful . It 's only if it has no video content at all ( no VIDEOTS.VOB ) that the flags are meaningless , and must be 4:3 to be standard compliant . <p> I have n't said that a DVD can not identify a still image as 16:9 . It 's the purpose of the flags in the IFO , and the AR is also written in the VOB when the still image is converted to VOB format . I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ) can not guess the aspect ratio of a still image , and therefore that you have to specify it manually when you build your project . <p> Changing the AR flag of the VMGM has probably no effect on your DVD because your menu is authored in a VTSM domain . The VMGM probably contains just nothing , or only dummies that call the VTSM menu . <p> If you want to understand that , I strongly suggest you use PgcEdit instead of IfoEdit , as PgcEdit offers a much more clear view of the organization of the DVD , and it can simulate the DVD playback . It will be ( relatively ) easy for you to understand what happens when you click the Title menu , and you will see exactly which PGCs are played and when , and in which domains they reside . Furthermore , you should understand that I prefer to explain the DVD insides using the terminology and the GUI of PgcEdit . I am its author , after all ! ( BTW , IfoEdit is not at all a bad program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand and to master , especially for a newbie . ) <p> Again , you can not change the AR of a menu with buttons . You will easily see if the menu has buttons with PgcEdit ( but it 's impossible in IfoEdit . ) In the PGC selector pane , a PGC with buttons has the number of buttons in its label . For example VTSM 2 , LU 1 ( en ) , 3 ( 1:03 ) 4b means that the third PGC of the first language unit of the VTSM menu of VTS 2 has video content ( duration 1:03 ) and has 4 buttons . You will know for sure that you ca n't change the AR of VTSM 2 . <p> BTW , to change the AR of a domain with PgcEdit , just right-click on any PGC of that domain , and select " Domain Stream Attributes " . The flags will be modified in the IFO of the current VTS and in VIDEOTS.IFO , in one operation . ( You have to edit both files with IfoEdit. )

When I record the vhs onto a dvd , some scenes are choppy , like frames may be missing or is it something else ? Any suggestions ? <p> To make that a true DVD video file you will need to rip that video to your hard drive on your computer . And then convert to a DVD Video file format , other wise you will get SVCD quality . <p> now I could be wrong on this but you may just be better off capturing the video from the VHS to your compter and doing the whole thing from scratch again . The type of DVD recorder that you are using will never give you a true DVD quality . <p> Make sure you 're using good quality media , maybe Verbatim or Taio Yuden . And although it will write to both +R and -R discs it may have a built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit with your media . That can be a big factor . <p> You did n't mention what quality mode you were using for recording but if you recorded at the 4 or 6 hour time try dropping down to the 2 or even 1 hour time .

@@98121283 @2321283/ <p> Cutting any DivX , AVI or ASF file can be done without problems using VirtualDub . But to cut ASF files you will need VirtualDub version 1.3c because Microsoft put the thumb screws on Avery Lee and so he took it out of all his later versions . Another great program that can chop some mpeg formats is TMPGEnc . Again , all these utilities are free . <p> As a word of warning , please do not use AVIChop , Pecks Power Join or AVI Devil to try and chop an AVI because you are likely to get corrupt files . The following will describe how to cut and join Divx files , but the same method will work with any AVI , MJPEG , ASF or popular format that VirtualDub can open . The exception to this is Mpeg-1 &amp; 2 but I 'll explain how to do that in another article = ) . This method does n't require that we re-encode any file , all we are doing is cutting them . <p> Note : ASF 's are a very twitchy format and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft Media Encoder . If you have trouble chopping up an ASF file in VirtualDub try Windows Media Indexer instead , it can be downloaded Here . If you have trouble joining two ASF files try opening them in VirtualDub and resaving them again using the Direct Stream Copy option for both Audio and Video . Then you should be able to join them together without problems . If the ASF does n't open at all there is not much you can do , perhaps its just a corrupted file ? The following guide will show you how to do everything spoken of here anyway . <p> Make sure all previous options you have selected , such as filters etc. , in VirtualDub are not selected . The best way to do this is to shutdown VirtualDub and then load it again . <p> SET IT TO COPY <p> Select File &gt; Open <p> Go to Video &gt; Direct stream copy . ( Note that VirtualDub puts a dot by the options we select ) <p> Go to Audio &gt; Direct stream copy . <p> SELECT WHERE TO CUT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain point , instead it just let 's us save any part . So to cut a movie in half we must select the first have , save it , then select the second half and save that . The beauty of this cutting method is we can select exactly where we want to cut it . All the old cutting methods just cut the movie exactly in half at a certain point . The problem with that was it often cut it in the middle of an action scene and totally spoil the movie because we would have to change CD 's . With this method you can select to cut it wherever you like . Naturally it is best to cut a movie where one scene ends and another starts . The only thing you have to watch is that each half is not too large for the CD after it is cut = ) . <p> If you are unfamiliar with VirtualDubs controls take a look at the picture below . No , its not an alphabet revision . If we look a ( A ) we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two play buttons , one plays the input movie and the other plays both the input and output movies together . If you click on the pictures you can stop them playing , and if you right-click on the picture you can select to zoom in or out . This , of course , is just for viewing purposes . Next ( B ) we have the jump to start and jump to end of the movie buttons . And ( C ) allows us to move frame by frame either way . <p> To cut the movie in half we must move to the middle . First move to the end of the movie by pressing the jump to end button ( B ) . Divide in half the number of frames it then shows at ( H ) . This gives me something like frame number : 77229 . So I use the slider bar ( E ) to move very close to that number , which will be the middle of the movie . Now this is the important point we must use the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut our movie . If you do n't you could end up with a few seconds of corrupted video where the cut was made ! For more information on why check out my article in the appendix called " Key Frames &amp; Delta Frames Explained " . In short , if move using the keyframe buttons you can not cut it wrong ! <p> Okay , so we are at the point we wish to cut the movie . Write down the frame number you have selected to cut the movie , I have selected frame 77575 because it fades to black here . Hit the ' mark end point ' button ( G ) ( also called the " mark out " button ) . Next , press the jump to the start button ( B ) . Then press the ' mark start point ' ( also called " mark in " ) . You will notice that the slider bar ( E ) now shows a blue line next to it - this is your selection . You have marked from the middle to the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Save AVI ... <p> Bingo ! Now if you look at the file you just saved it will be the first half of your movie . <p> Next go to the middle again to the same frame number you cut it before ; for me this was : 77575 . Hit the ' mark start point ' button ( F ) . Then press the ' jump to end ' button ( B ) . And finally the ' mark end point ' button ( G ) . <p> And again we select : File &gt; Save AVI ... <p> Look at the file you just saved it will be the second half of your movie . That 's it ! You have cut a DivX movie in half ! <p> Final Note : You may have noticed that cutting movies using the keyframe buttons can produce a repeated keyframe both at the start of the second file and the end of the first ! But , considering there are 25 frames to every second of a movie , this will not even notice , especially when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want to delete this , use the ' frame by frame ' buttons ( C ) to do so . The only rule to remember here is to never delete a keyframe from the start of a movie clip always delete it off of the end of the clip . <p> JOINING DIVX FILES <p> Joining together Divx , AVI or ASF clips is just as easy with VirtualDub once you get the hang of it . Again , if you are cutting up files you must do so on the keyframe to avoid corrupt files . But to join the clips just open them in VirtualDub in the correct order and use the append option . For example : <p> Open the first file by File &gt; Open video file ... <p> Then to join each file to the previous one . You open them one at a time by going to : File &gt; Append video segment ... <p> WHAT CAN &amp; CAN NOT BE JOINED ? <p> It is very very important that the files you join together are exactly the same format ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example an DivX will never join with an MJPEG , one of the two must be recompressed first into the others format . Neither will movie clips of two different sizes join together . So you can not join a 352 x 288 movie clip with a 352 x 240 clip ! You can not join two movie clips together if the audio is a different format . So if one Divx uses Mp3 audio and the other uses WMA audio they will not join and so on . Finally , VirtualDub does n't support the editing or the joining of Mpeg-1 or Mpeg-2 files yet . To edit them you will need to use TMPGEnc , for that see my guide : " Cutting &amp; Joining VCD ( Mpeg-1 / 2 ) " . <p> To find out exactly what format a file uses just open it in VirtualDub . <p> And choose File &gt; File Information ... <p> To join any file to any other all you need to do is write down the file information from one and re-encode the other ( preferably the shortest clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYNCHRONIZATION <p> Sometimes when you join two files together the second file will go out of synchronization . I think this is because sometimes the audio is clipped too short and does n't match the video file length . Often you can get around this by creating an offset . To do this , open the first file you wish to join in VirtualDub . <p> Select File &gt; Open <p> Go to Video &gt; Direct stream copy . ( Note that VirtualDub puts a dot by the options we select ) <p> Go to Audio &gt; Direct stream copy . <p> Go to Select Range ... <p> In the ' End offset ' of the picture below ( encircled in red ) type in about 15 frames . <p> Then save your newly created first file . <p> That 's it . Now open this new file as your first file to join . Then open the next file you wish to join to it with the Append video segment option as already explained . <p> 15 frames should be enough of an offset to keep it in synch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number a little . If the offset is too much you will get a jump in the movie as it skips a keyframe . If it is too small the picture will freeze and the audio will continue going ! So please make sure it is correct before you save your final movie . <p> COOL THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH JOINING <p> One of the things I have found fun to do with this joining method I created is to re-add the cut scenes from movies . These cut scenes are usually added to the DVD as specials . But I thought it would be a great idea to put them back in and create my own special edition movies = ) . For example , I have added all the cut scenes from the Alien movie to my DivX including that Cocoon scene everyone is talking about . <p> I would also love to add the other Cocoon scene from Aliens , but that was not on the DVD specials as expected . If anyone has it on video from a documentary please compress it and send it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine : <p> ADDING THE SPECIALS <p> Sometimes adding the specials is not as easy as it sounds . So , just for you , I 'll let you in on a few tricks I have used that will also help you join specials or compile lists of any files seamlessly . <p> First thing to do is to get the specials off of the DVD . SmartRipper can extract individual chapters and Vobs so this should n't be too difficult . Since most specials are very short its best to either encode them as uncompressed avi , or if hard drive space is limited , as highest quality MJPEG with the Huffyuv or PicVideo codecs etc . This is mainly because we can do perfect frame by frame editing with these formats . It is also an idea to do use PCM audio until all editing has been done . This way we will avoid sound degradation and audio synch problems . Finally , watch out for interlacing effects on special which were not on the main movie , and if necessary , deinterlace them . <p> CROPPING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special if both have black bars on them ! Ideally you should crop both the specials and the original movie to exactly the same size so no boarders exist at all ! If the specials are smaller than the movie when cropped , resize them larger and crop them to the same size the original movie was encoded to . This may loose a bit more of the picture than we wanted but wo n't notice on the final version . <p> COLOUR MATCHING <p> Okay , open VirtualDub twice ! Once with the Divx you wish to splice the extra scenes into and once with the cut scenes . Find the original scene in the movie , or think of a good place you could cut your new scene into and go to it . Specials and cut scenes are usually good quality video conversions and hence will not always look the same as the main DVD movie . The colours , saturation and brightness ' of scenes may be a little different to match . Colour matching is absolutely vital if they are to look natural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . For detailed explanations on video editing with VirtualDub see the articles I have written in the advanced VirtualDub section . <p> You should be aware of : <p> 1 . Brightness , Contrast &amp; Levels : Try and get the overall tones to match the original movie . <p> 2 . Hue &amp; Saturation : Sometimes there will be too much colour flair in the image and reducing the saturation a bit helps . Also , at least in the case of the movie Alien , I needed to cut out some of the red to match the more blue-green trend of the original DVD . <p> 3 . Sharpness : Specials are almost always slightly more blurred than the original DVD . The unsharp mask filter gives us the most control here and is probably the one to use . <p> 4 . Noise &amp; Clarity : Specials usually have more noise than original movies . Using such filters as the 2D cleaner can do wonders in this area . <p> You probably will not need to adjust all of the above , but these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the cut scene with the original . When you are happy save the filter settings ready for when you encode from AVI to Divx <p> SPLICING <p> Ideally we want frame by frame accuracy . But as you know this will corrupt your Divx so you must edit from keyframe to keyframe . We could encode the whole movie to uncompressed AVI but at something like 1GB per minuet this is not possible . Just to clarify , if you set your keyframes to 1 every second when you encoded your original Divx you should be able to splice in most parts without frame by frame accuracy . This may require you chop out a second or two here or there from the special or original move . But for those tricky scenes try this method . <p> Open the original movie in VirtualDub and use the keyframe buttons to chop the movie into three parts using nothing but the keyframe buttons ! <p> 1 . From the start to where you want to insert the cut scene . <p> 2 . The area where the cut scene will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The part from after the cut scene to the end of the movie . <p> The second in the above list may be a little confusing at first but you 'll see what I mean . Imagine you have found a scene change perhaps , for example , a scene that flicks from the office to one walking home . You think , ' this is the perfect place to add this cut scene ' . So we cut out 5-10 seconds of it using the keyframe buttons . So we have a little bit of the office and a little bit of walking home in this clip . Then open the clip again and resave it as an uncompressed AVI or MJPEG . <p> Bingo ! Now it can be edited it frame by frame . Chop it into two parts : <p> 1 . Before the change <p> 2 . After the change <p> Finally , open the ' Before the change ' in VirtualDub . Append the new cut scene you wanted to put in-between . And append the after the change . Resave and compress it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your original movie . <p> MATCHING THE AUDIO <p> Nearly done ! Just one more thing needed to create the perfect seamless join . Sometimes the audio does n't quite fit right . For example , the background music may carry on from one scene to another and the cut scene may not have any background music at all ! To solve this we must open the audio file in an audio editing program such as Cool Edit or sound Forge . This is another good reason to keep the audio as uncompressed PCM until the cut scenes are done . Save the audio from the newly joined cut scene by opening it in VirtualDub and choosing : <p> File &gt; Save Wav ... <p> Open it in Cool Edit and find the part where the music , noise , etc. , is located . And select just before the change like this : <p> Then with that part selected use : Amplitude &gt; Amplify ... <p> Up pops this crazy box . Just hit the fade out button and press ok . <p> If you selected the area correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Then , if necessary , select the bit after the scene change but this time choose ' fade in ' . This will make the background music fade smoothly in and out between the two scenes leaving no final traces of editing = ) . Once done just choose File &gt; Save . <p> To add this audio back to the clip open the clip in VirtualDub . And choose : <p> Video &gt; Direct stream copy <p> Audio &gt; Wav Audio ... <p> Browse for your altered wave file and press Open : <p> Audio &gt; Direct stream copy <p> Save it baby ! <p> THE FINAL JOIN <p> Finally , we can join our seamless clip back to the original cut Divx movie by joining :

@@98121291 @2321291/ <p> All Mpeg movies are built out of 16 x 16 squares . To save space the squares that are " almost identical " to the same squares in the next frame of the movie are discarded . This makes a very high compression ratio , because in a scene where two people are talking and not moving very much the only squares that need to be copied across one frame to the next are those around the mouth . But because only squares are carried across from one frame to the next you do not have a complete picture , just squares ! For example , to view frame five you must load frame 1 , 2 , 3 &amp; 4 and stick all the squares together to make frame 5 ! Many ASF ? s and some of the early DivX movies were made almost completely like this . The only problem with this method is that you couldn ? t select where you wanted to watch the movie from . You couldn ? t , for example , watch half a movie and then come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left off . You had to watch it from the beginning ! This was because to fast forward Media Player ( or any player ) had to examine EVERY frame before it could reconstruct the movie at the point you left off ! <p> ( picture above ) The top row represents frames 1-5 in an uncompressed AVI file . Notice how each frame is a complete frame . Now look at the frames below from an Mpeg file . Frames 1 and 5 are Keyframes showing a complete picture , but frames 2 , 3 &amp; 4 contain only the bits of information ( delta frames ) that are different from the previous . <p> Here is where Keyframes come in ! A keyframe is added every so many seconds to keep track of the position of the movie . It also provides a perfect picture on which the half frames ( delta frames ) can be based . Mpeg encoding methods call keyframes I-Frames or Intra-frames . The half-frames for mpeg come in two kinds : B-frames or the backward frames and P-frames the predicted frames . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to only store the difference between the frames in front and behind the keyframe as small blocks . <p> Most compression software use 1 keyframe every 5 to 10 seconds . Because keyframes , as full pictures , hold so much more information than partial frames they will increase the file size quite a bit . So obviously the fewer you have the better the compression . If you chop an mpeg file " in-between " keyframes the player will not be able to reconstruct the movie frames until it reaches the next keyframe frame in the list ! Some smart mpeg software are able to reconstruct the final keyframes from the parts given and get around this problem , but you have to watch out for those who do n't . <p> VirtualDub can usually fix a film without keyframes if it ? s opened in repair mode , but it can not yet cut in-between keyframes . This means we must cut on the keyframe . <p> With this in mind is useful to know that , provided you use the VirtualDub keyframe buttons to move forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut and join you can not possibly cut in-between a keyframe because you are moving only by keyframe jumps = )

Movie buffs ' collections include not even hundreds , but thousands of items actually : Can you imagine how capacious your memory should be to manage properly such a number of films ? But , as is often the case , the cause of the problem ( fast-moving information technologies development ) helps to find the solution . Nowadays there is movie organizer software which is capable of making your collection just perfect . So , would you like to have a clear and presentable overview of your collection ? Then let me introduce All My Movies - it knows the answers to all your questions and helps you to orient yourself better in the moviedom . <p> Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first launch there appears the window which contains brief information concerning how to buy the license and one more piece of advice , which will further help you not to lose the movie database created . The thing is that you should n't use sample.amm database delivered with the program for your own movies , because this file will be rewritten every time the program will be updated or reinstalled . That means that sample.amm is only meant for familiarization with the program and its functionality before buying the license . A new database can be created only in a licensed version . All minor updates are free for registered users . <p> All My Movies having been launched , it displays the " Tip of the Day " window and opens the sample database which includes several movies . If the " tips of the day " get on your nerves , there is an option not to show them in the future . <p> The program 's interface gladdens the eye and is available in more than ten languages - so , if your English is not perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's start with adding a new movie into your All My Movies collection . There is no typing needed here , except just entering the name of the movie - all the other information about the film is picked up automatically . Well , let 's stop " riding before the hounds " : and consider everything step-by-step . <h> Adding a Movie to the Database <p> There are actually several ways to add a new movie into your collection . Some of them are available from the " Movie " menu . The simplest one is to add a movie using " Movie - Add ... " menu . At that an empty movie card opens with a number of fields . But do n't worry - you wo n't have to fill them in all manually , except the title - the software is trained to search information independently and fill in all the other fields automatically with no efforts of yours needed . So , you are to fill in only " Original title " field and hit " Enter " : <p> The program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the movie card there is a small button next to the " Original title " field , which allows choosing the online database , in which the search of the movie is going to be performed . For each language several online databases are available . Besides , there are plug-ins for other popular databases . <p> So , let 's try to find the movie " Armageddon " in the largest online database IMDb.com . Type the word " Armageddon " in the field " Original Title " . The program finds several movies and offers to make the choice needed . <p> Double click on the movie needed and several seconds later full information about the movie is found and all the fields of the movie card are filled in . Press " Ok " ! <p> As it was mentioned above , there are other ways to add a movie to the database as well . Thus , you can also add a movie from a file by choosing " Movie - Add from File ... " , the program offers to specify the directory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the file like duration , file size , resolution , aspect ratio , data about audio - and video streams codec info , frame frequency etc . This way of adding movies allows making certain stills from the video file and saving them in the movie card ! You are welcome to add any stills from the movie you like best of all . This option seems to be extremely useful , because it 's sometimes really hard to remember what a movie is about , but having a quick look at some stills , you remember everything in a twinkling of an eye . The next screenshot displays it . <p> By moving the scroll box , we find the most representable still , press the button " Save Screenshot " and it is immediately added to the movie card . You 're welcome to make as many stills as you like . This way has one more advantage - the movies added in this way can be run right from the All My Movies , there 's a special " Play " button for this at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Add DVD " works in a similar way , being meant for adding DVD discs , not separate files . This way also presupposes the option of adding your own screenshots and picking up technical information from DVD . <p> And the last way to add movies into the collection is by using menu item " Movie - Add DVD by Bar Code ... " . In this case the program searches movies in online databases not by title , but by bar code . Those users possessing bar code scanners can use them . All My Movies supports the majority of widely-spread models . <p> So , enter the bar code and the information about the movie is available . Very easy and fast ! <p> Now that all the movies needed are added to your database , let 's study the abilities of the program . <h> Working with the Program <p> The window of the program can be visually divided into two parts : the left part is the entire list of movie titles in the collection and the right part is the movie card giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . Let 's consider both parts in detail . <p> Title list of your collection in All My Movies can be modified to your liking . You may add some more columns there , for example , year of release . You can do that in the menu " Tools - Preferences " - " Display Area " tab - Additional Columns . Just tick the needed columns and they will appear in the title list . <p> Different variants of grouping and sorting movie titles by various criteria make the program really flexible and user-oriented . Thus , you can group movies by year , for example , by right click on the title list and choosing " Group Movies By - Year " . As a result , the title list looks like a tree , the number of movies being specified for each branch . For example : <p> One of the most popular modes of title list representation is Cover Thumbnails which enables viewing the covers of your movies in miniature . It gives a real aesthetic pleasure to work with the program with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some types of filtering and sorting are available directly from a movie card . Thus , if you left-click on the name of an actor , the program offers to show all movies with this actor or find the additional information about him . Having selected any genre in the movie card , you may either group movies by genre , or show only movies of the genre selected . <p> If you are a real movie lover , then you will probably want to learn some additional information about actors , directors , writers . All My Movies automatically finds all possible information in seconds and stores it in the database , including actors ' photos , biography and filmography . Pop-up photos of actors and brief information about them appearing when you point to his/her name with the mouse . The option is active only when the actor 's card is filled in . <p> Now coming back to the movie card templates . The program has got several possible types of HTML templates - you are sure to find one which suits you best of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " View-HTML Template " . <p> Besides , in the program there are various modes of export your movie database to one of the formats : HTML , CHM , Plaintext , Microsoft Excel , PDF , and even to your mobile phone . So , you will be able to place your collection of movies at your site or just print the cards with the movie information needed . <p> There are also opportunities for import of your databases from Microsoft Excel or text . All these options are available from " Tools " menu . <p> All My Movies has also got a smart loan manager which allows not to forget whom you give this or that movie and when it 's going to be back . The program reminds you of the movies loaned and keeps the history of movies taken and returned for each friend . It 's extremely easy to work with this option . When you give a movie to one of your friends , find it in the database , then choose " Movie - Loan/Return " or press F12 . There appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the friend 's name and set the number of days , on expiration of which the program reminds you to take the movies back . When you press " OK " , the program marks the movie as lent . When the movie is returned , you should simply use the same menu item and mark this movie as returned . It 's very convenient and highly useful . <p> As a conclusion , it is necessary to note that All My Movies is really one of those flexible and tunable instruments in the hands of a movie fan , which can masterly organize and harmonize any movie collection , no matter how large it is , right to user 's liking and in accordance with his/her needs .

@@98121304 @2321304/ 11152 @qwx871152 <h> Page 6 of 7 : HD Audio <h> Chapter 7 : HD Audio <p> The two HD formats not only improves the picture quality , the sound quality has also been massively improved . Unlike the " matrixed " 7.1 sounds on DVDs , Blu-ray and HD DVD both support true 7.1 channel audio , and sometimes in either lossless or uncompressed format . Being lossless of uncompressed means standard audio compression techniques ( needed to get the audio file size down to something acceptable ) will no longer be needed , as this " lossy " type of compression reduces quality . <p> Before we get to the new HD formats , let 's go through the many ways which you can enjoy these HD ( or high bitrate ) audio formats and the requirements of each method . <p> Raw Bitstream Transport : Also known as " pass-through " mode . This method sends the raw unprocessed digital data over HDMI 1.3 or newer connections , so the receiving device ( your AV receiver/decoder ) can do the decoding . HDMI 1.3 is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formats . Note that eventually , there will be audio tracks that require audio mixing to be done on the player , and as such , bitstreaming may have limited usage . <p> Decoding to Linear PCM : The HD audio can be decoded by the player to Linear PCM 5.1/7.1 ( uncompressed ) audio and sent through the HDMI connection . HDMI 1.3 , despite some reports , is not required since all versions of HDMI supports up to 8 channels of PCM audio at 192kHz , 24 bits per sample . <p> Transcoding to legacy format : The HD audio can also be transcoded/converted to an older format that your amp/receiver will support , like Dolby Digital AC3 or DTS . This type of audio will only require an optical/SPDIF connection , since the bitrate used is the same as standard DVDs ( and so technically , this not " real " HD audio ) . Sometimes a legacy track is provided alongside the HD track to prevent the need for any processing to get to a legacy format . <p> Ok , so let 's now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the new HD formats ? <p> Linear PCM : LPCM has existed since the days of CDs , but now with HDMI 's higher bandwidth , it can now carry 5.1 or 7.1 channels of audio , as opposed to the 2 channel audio found on CDs . LPCM is uncompressed audio , so it requires a lot of storage space . Linear PCM 5.1/7.1 requires HDMI due to the increased bandwidth required that optical/SPDIF can not handle . <p> Dolby Digital Plus : Also known as E-AC3 or DD+ , this is a lossy compression format designed to replace the Dolby Digital AC3 system . The advantages of DD+ over AC3 are several encoder based enhancements , as well as support for higher bitrates and up to 13.1 channels of audio at 96 kHz with 24-bit depth . Up to 6 Mbps streams are supported . DD+ is mandatory for HD DVD , meaning all HD DVD players must be able to decode DD+ to LPCM or downmix to a legacy format . DD+ is only optional for Blu-ray , meaning all discs with DD+ audio must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolution Audio : DTS-HD HR is the DTS 's answer to DD+ . It is also a lossy format that supports up to 7.1 channels of audio at 96 kHz with 24-bit depth . Up to 6 Mbps streams are supported as well . DTS-HD HR support is optional on both Blu-ray and HD DVD players . <p> Dolby TrueHD : TrueHD is a lossless audio format employing the MLP technique . It features 8 channel support at 96kHz/24-bit with a maximum bitrate of 18 Mbps - most movies so far have only used 5 or 6 Mbps of the maximum allowed bandwidth . TrueHD is an optional audio standard for Blu-ray , while it is mandatory for HD DVD . All HD DVD players must be able decode Dolby TrueHD to LPCM up to 2 channels as part of the mandatory specifications , although all current ( as of December 2007 ) HD DVD players will decode up to 8 channels of LPCM through HDMI output . <p> DTS-HD Master Audio : DTS-HD MA is a lossless audio format , and DTS 's answer to Dolby TrueHD and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie studio 's master audio track , which signifies the highest level of audio quality achievable . It supports virtually unlimited channels of audio , while also supporting 96kHz/24-bit audio . Bandwidth support is up to a massive 24 Mbps . It also features a lossy " core " DTS soundtrack for legacy compatibility . DTS-HD MA is optional for both Blu-ray and HD DVD . <p> So with the above information , what kind of audio equipment should you need ? Since all the formats supports legacy output in one form or another , you existing AC3/DTS amp/receiver will give you multi-channel audio for all of these formats , but perhaps not at the higher bitrate , resolution and channels that these HD tracks may include . So if you are wary of spending more money on your sound system , then you do n't need to upgrade to achieve a more than acceptable level of Blu-ray and HD DVD audio performance . <p> Please note that while the PS3 is recommended several times in this guide , the older " fat " variety can not bitstream any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models can . All can decode Dolby TrueHD to PCM , and the same for DTS-HD MA ( when updated to firmware 2.30 or later ) . <p> Then there is the issue of audio mixing , which basically means that player decoding support is preferred to bitstreaming and receiver decoding . An example of audio mixing is the interactive elements such as the audio in menus - bitstreaming will mean no such audio is heard , while player decoding will mix the various sound elements together before sending it all out as a single PCM stream . With increased interactivity , audio mixing will become more and more important . In other words , a player doing the decoding is a more future proof way of handling audio than bitstreaming , so keep this in mind . <p> However , if you are in the market for a new sound system , the recommendation would be to get a system that supports at least PCM 8 channel audio input via HDMI . Note that not all HDMI receiver/amps will process the audio component of the HDMI signal - some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your amp/receiver can accept 8 channel PCM audio through the HDMI connection , then you will be able to enjoy a high level of audio from Blu-ray and HD DVD . <p> But if money is no object , then you will want a HDMI receiver that supports the decoding of all of the above HD audio formats , and of course a Blu-ray and HD DVD player that supports raw bitstream output for all of these formats to feed your receiver ( not all do , unfortunately - for example the Toshiba HD-A30 does not support bitstream output while the Toshiba HD-A35 does , even though both has HDMI audio output ) . But prices for such receivers are dropping all the time , and you can pick a TrueHD and DTS-HD MA decoding receiver like the Onkyo TX-SR605S for less than $380 from Amazon . Is there really a huge difference between letting your player decode the TrueHD/Master Audio stream and feed it to your receiver via LPCM , versus feeding the receiver the bitstream and letting the receiver decode it ? Both are handled differently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " better " or " worse " is a bit subjective . Then there is also the issue of audio mixing outlined above , and so bitstreaming is of limited use .

@@98121311 @2321311/ <p> Cutting any DivX , AVI or ASF file can be done without problems using VirtualDub . But to cut ASF files you will need VirtualDub version 1.3c because Microsoft put the thumb screws on Avery Lee and so he took it out of all his later versions . Another great program that can chop some mpeg formats is TMPGEnc . Again , all these utilities are free . <p> As a word of warning , please do not use AVIChop , Pecks Power Join or AVI Devil to try and chop an AVI because you are likely to get corrupt files . The following will describe how to cut and join Divx files , but the same method will work with any AVI , MJPEG , ASF or popular format that VirtualDub can open . The exception to this is Mpeg-1 &amp; 2 but I 'll explain how to do that in another article = ) . This method does n't require that we re-encode any file , all we are doing is cutting them . <p> Note : ASF 's are a very twitchy format and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft Media Encoder . If you have trouble chopping up an ASF file in VirtualDub try Windows Media Indexer instead , it can be downloaded Here . If you have trouble joining two ASF files try opening them in VirtualDub and resaving them again using the Direct Stream Copy option for both Audio and Video . Then you should be able to join them together without problems . If the ASF does n't open at all there is not much you can do , perhaps its just a corrupted file ? The following guide will show you how to do everything spoken of here anyway . <p> Make sure all previous options you have selected , such as filters etc. , in VirtualDub are not selected . The best way to do this is to shutdown VirtualDub and then load it again . <p> SET IT TO COPY <p> Select File &gt; Open <p> Go to Video &gt; Direct stream copy . ( Note that VirtualDub puts a dot by the options we select ) <p> Go to Audio &gt; Direct stream copy . <p> SELECT WHERE TO CUT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain point , instead it just let 's us save any part . So to cut a movie in half we must select the first have , save it , then select the second half and save that . The beauty of this cutting method is we can select exactly where we want to cut it . All the old cutting methods just cut the movie exactly in half at a certain point . The problem with that was it often cut it in the middle of an action scene and totally spoil the movie because we would have to change CD 's . With this method you can select to cut it wherever you like . Naturally it is best to cut a movie where one scene ends and another starts . The only thing you have to watch is that each half is not too large for the CD after it is cut = ) . <p> If you are unfamiliar with VirtualDubs controls take a look at the picture below . No , its not an alphabet revision . If we look a ( A ) we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two play buttons , one plays the input movie and the other plays both the input and output movies together . If you click on the pictures you can stop them playing , and if you right-click on the picture you can select to zoom in or out . This , of course , is just for viewing purposes . Next ( B ) we have the jump to start and jump to end of the movie buttons . And ( C ) allows us to move frame by frame either way . <p> To cut the movie in half we must move to the middle . First move to the end of the movie by pressing the jump to end button ( B ) . Divide in half the number of frames it then shows at ( H ) . This gives me something like frame number : 77229 . So I use the slider bar ( E ) to move very close to that number , which will be the middle of the movie . Now this is the important point we must use the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut our movie . If you do n't you could end up with a few seconds of corrupted video where the cut was made ! For more information on why check out my article in the appendix called " Key Frames &amp; Delta Frames Explained " . In short , if move using the keyframe buttons you can not cut it wrong ! <p> Okay , so we are at the point we wish to cut the movie . Write down the frame number you have selected to cut the movie , I have selected frame 77575 because it fades to black here . Hit the ' mark end point ' button ( G ) ( also called the " mark out " button ) . Next , press the jump to the start button ( B ) . Then press the ' mark start point ' ( also called " mark in " ) . You will notice that the slider bar ( E ) now shows a blue line next to it - this is your selection . You have marked from the middle to the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Save AVI ... <p> Bingo ! Now if you look at the file you just saved it will be the first half of your movie . <p> Next go to the middle again to the same frame number you cut it before ; for me this was : 77575 . Hit the ' mark start point ' button ( F ) . Then press the ' jump to end ' button ( B ) . And finally the ' mark end point ' button ( G ) . <p> And again we select : File &gt; Save AVI ... <p> Look at the file you just saved it will be the second half of your movie . That 's it ! You have cut a DivX movie in half ! <p> Final Note : You may have noticed that cutting movies using the keyframe buttons can produce a repeated keyframe both at the start of the second file and the end of the first ! But , considering there are 25 frames to every second of a movie , this will not even notice , especially when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want to delete this , use the ' frame by frame ' buttons ( C ) to do so . The only rule to remember here is to never delete a keyframe from the start of a movie clip always delete it off of the end of the clip . <p> JOINING DIVX FILES <p> Joining together Divx , AVI or ASF clips is just as easy with VirtualDub once you get the hang of it . Again , if you are cutting up files you must do so on the keyframe to avoid corrupt files . But to join the clips just open them in VirtualDub in the correct order and use the append option . For example : <p> Open the first file by File &gt; Open video file ... <p> Then to join each file to the previous one . You open them one at a time by going to : File &gt; Append video segment ... <p> WHAT CAN &amp; CAN NOT BE JOINED ? <p> It is very very important that the files you join together are exactly the same format ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example an DivX will never join with an MJPEG , one of the two must be recompressed first into the others format . Neither will movie clips of two different sizes join together . So you can not join a 352 x 288 movie clip with a 352 x 240 clip ! You can not join two movie clips together if the audio is a different format . So if one Divx uses Mp3 audio and the other uses WMA audio they will not join and so on . Finally , VirtualDub does n't support the editing or the joining of Mpeg-1 or Mpeg-2 files yet . To edit them you will need to use TMPGEnc , for that see my guide : " Cutting &amp; Joining VCD ( Mpeg-1 / 2 ) " . <p> To find out exactly what format a file uses just open it in VirtualDub . <p> And choose File &gt; File Information ... <p> To join any file to any other all you need to do is write down the file information from one and re-encode the other ( preferably the shortest clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYNCHRONIZATION <p> Sometimes when you join two files together the second file will go out of synchronization . I think this is because sometimes the audio is clipped too short and does n't match the video file length . Often you can get around this by creating an offset . To do this , open the first file you wish to join in VirtualDub . <p> Select File &gt; Open <p> Go to Video &gt; Direct stream copy . ( Note that VirtualDub puts a dot by the options we select ) <p> Go to Audio &gt; Direct stream copy . <p> Go to Select Range ... <p> In the ' End offset ' of the picture below ( encircled in red ) type in about 15 frames . <p> Then save your newly created first file . <p> That 's it . Now open this new file as your first file to join . Then open the next file you wish to join to it with the Append video segment option as already explained . <p> 15 frames should be enough of an offset to keep it in synch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number a little . If the offset is too much you will get a jump in the movie as it skips a keyframe . If it is too small the picture will freeze and the audio will continue going ! So please make sure it is correct before you save your final movie . <p> COOL THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH JOINING <p> One of the things I have found fun to do with this joining method I created is to re-add the cut scenes from movies . These cut scenes are usually added to the DVD as specials . But I thought it would be a great idea to put them back in and create my own special edition movies = ) . For example , I have added all the cut scenes from the Alien movie to my DivX including that Cocoon scene everyone is talking about . <p> I would also love to add the other Cocoon scene from Aliens , but that was not on the DVD specials as expected . If anyone has it on video from a documentary please compress it and send it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine : <p> ADDING THE SPECIALS <p> Sometimes adding the specials is not as easy as it sounds . So , just for you , I 'll let you in on a few tricks I have used that will also help you join specials or compile lists of any files seamlessly . <p> First thing to do is to get the specials off of the DVD . SmartRipper can extract individual chapters and Vobs so this should n't be too difficult . Since most specials are very short its best to either encode them as uncompressed avi , or if hard drive space is limited , as highest quality MJPEG with the Huffyuv or PicVideo codecs etc . This is mainly because we can do perfect frame by frame editing with these formats . It is also an idea to do use PCM audio until all editing has been done . This way we will avoid sound degradation and audio synch problems . Finally , watch out for interlacing effects on special which were not on the main movie , and if necessary , deinterlace them . <p> CROPPING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special if both have black bars on them ! Ideally you should crop both the specials and the original movie to exactly the same size so no boarders exist at all ! If the specials are smaller than the movie when cropped , resize them larger and crop them to the same size the original movie was encoded to . This may loose a bit more of the picture than we wanted but wo n't notice on the final version . <p> COLOUR MATCHING <p> Okay , open VirtualDub twice ! Once with the Divx you wish to splice the extra scenes into and once with the cut scenes . Find the original scene in the movie , or think of a good place you could cut your new scene into and go to it . Specials and cut scenes are usually good quality video conversions and hence will not always look the same as the main DVD movie . The colours , saturation and brightness ' of scenes may be a little different to match . Colour matching is absolutely vital if they are to look natural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . For detailed explanations on video editing with VirtualDub see the articles I have written in the advanced VirtualDub section . <p> You should be aware of : <p> 1 . Brightness , Contrast &amp; Levels : Try and get the overall tones to match the original movie . <p> 2 . Hue &amp; Saturation : Sometimes there will be too much colour flair in the image and reducing the saturation a bit helps . Also , at least in the case of the movie Alien , I needed to cut out some of the red to match the more blue-green trend of the original DVD . <p> 3 . Sharpness : Specials are almost always slightly more blurred than the original DVD . The unsharp mask filter gives us the most control here and is probably the one to use . <p> 4 . Noise &amp; Clarity : Specials usually have more noise than original movies . Using such filters as the 2D cleaner can do wonders in this area . <p> You probably will not need to adjust all of the above , but these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the cut scene with the original . When you are happy save the filter settings ready for when you encode from AVI to Divx <p> SPLICING <p> Ideally we want frame by frame accuracy . But as you know this will corrupt your Divx so you must edit from keyframe to keyframe . We could encode the whole movie to uncompressed AVI but at something like 1GB per minuet this is not possible . Just to clarify , if you set your keyframes to 1 every second when you encoded your original Divx you should be able to splice in most parts without frame by frame accuracy . This may require you chop out a second or two here or there from the special or original move . But for those tricky scenes try this method . <p> Open the original movie in VirtualDub and use the keyframe buttons to chop the movie into three parts using nothing but the keyframe buttons ! <p> 1 . From the start to where you want to insert the cut scene . <p> 2 . The area where the cut scene will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The part from after the cut scene to the end of the movie . <p> The second in the above list may be a little confusing at first but you 'll see what I mean . Imagine you have found a scene change perhaps , for example , a scene that flicks from the office to one walking home . You think , ' this is the perfect place to add this cut scene ' . So we cut out 5-10 seconds of it using the keyframe buttons . So we have a little bit of the office and a little bit of walking home in this clip . Then open the clip again and resave it as an uncompressed AVI or MJPEG . <p> Bingo ! Now it can be edited it frame by frame . Chop it into two parts : <p> 1 . Before the change <p> 2 . After the change <p> Finally , open the ' Before the change ' in VirtualDub . Append the new cut scene you wanted to put in-between . And append the after the change . Resave and compress it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your original movie . <p> MATCHING THE AUDIO <p> Nearly done ! Just one more thing needed to create the perfect seamless join . Sometimes the audio does n't quite fit right . For example , the background music may carry on from one scene to another and the cut scene may not have any background music at all ! To solve this we must open the audio file in an audio editing program such as Cool Edit or sound Forge . This is another good reason to keep the audio as uncompressed PCM until the cut scenes are done . Save the audio from the newly joined cut scene by opening it in VirtualDub and choosing : <p> File &gt; Save Wav ... <p> Open it in Cool Edit and find the part where the music , noise , etc. , is located . And select just before the change like this : <p> Then with that part selected use : Amplitude &gt; Amplify ... <p> Up pops this crazy box . Just hit the fade out button and press ok . <p> If you selected the area correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Then , if necessary , select the bit after the scene change but this time choose ' fade in ' . This will make the background music fade smoothly in and out between the two scenes leaving no final traces of editing = ) . Once done just choose File &gt; Save . <p> To add this audio back to the clip open the clip in VirtualDub . And choose : <p> Video &gt; Direct stream copy <p> Audio &gt; Wav Audio ... <p> Browse for your altered wave file and press Open : <p> Audio &gt; Direct stream copy <p> Save it baby ! <p> THE FINAL JOIN <p> Finally , we can join our seamless clip back to the original cut Divx movie by joining :

Well , the rep figured the drive was bad since I could n't even run the test with the blank media that I had been using ( but was no longer able to ) , the drive just made noises and eventually stopped trying to read it .

@@98121327 @2321327/ <p> The video encoding speed of Mpeg2avi is much much faster than that of Flask Mpeg . It also gives a slightly smoother playback and picture quality . There are a few downsides of Mpeg2avi , mainly that we have to get the audio and add it to the video separately . This may sound hard but it not too difficult , and , if done correctly , will have just as few synchronization problems as Flask Mpeg . Of course , getting audio separately with Graphedit gives better quality audio . And for reasons of speed and quality Mpeg2avi is my preferred choice . But before you switch you should realize that Mpeg2avi has no DVD .

Hopefully this should make it more compatible with Windows long filenames ( i.e. by adding quotation marks ) . <p> Next check the box where it says Divx Auto ( C ) . This automatically sets the bitrate you want to encode your Divx with so you do n't have to keep putting in the same values for each vob file ; ) . Set it and press save . <p> For getting the best setting you can look at my article : " Best Divx Quality &amp; Bitrate Guide " in the appendix .

Firstly , it can select an individual Vob file and encode it . But there are problem with encoding individual Vob files if they are parts of a whole movie . For a detailed explanation of this read my " Key Frames &amp; Delta Frames Explained " section of the appendix . <p> Unless you only have one Vob file to encode , you must make a list file . This is easy to do and , in fact , if you used SmartRipper in " movie " mode , then one would have been created for you . To make a list file , open notepad and put the names of the files you want to encode all together in order like this : <p> C : foldervts031.vob <p> C : foldervts032.vob <p> C : foldervts033.vob <p> C : foldervts034.vob <p> C : foldervts035.vob <p> The colours are mine , of course , and the blue parts represent the location of the Vob files and the red parts represents the names of the Vobs you need to encode .

Choosing a new Logical Block Address ( LBA ) basically jumps 2048 bytes forward to allows you to skip by the garbage . If Mpeg2avi can not find a system header it will automatically scan to the next LBA until one is found . <p> Below the LBA option is the Frames Range option . This will allow you skip to a frame in the movie . To do this put the frame number in the ' Start ' box . ( 25 frames make 1 second for PAL and 23.976 or 29.970 make 1 second for NTSC ) . Putting a number in the ' End ' box tells Mpeg2avi what frame to stop encoding . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your movie with . PAL will almost always use - f2 25.000 fps except some DVD specials .

For a detailed explanation of this problem read my article : " Video Formats : NTSC &amp; PAL / Telecine " . Most PAL DVDs do n't have interlace problems except in the specials section . So far I have n't managed to solve this interlace problem . The Mpeg2avi ivtc text files recomends using the -s4 setting to telecine NTSC movies , so try that and see what happens .

Anything else is overkill and in fact this is the most bug free option anyway . <p> THE FINAL VIDEO <p> Finally press the Create my AVI button ! <p> A window like the one below will appear and the movie will encode . <p> That 's it ! = ) The next step is to extract the audio from the DVD and multiplex to your DivX. 
@@98121328 @2321328/ <h> Denuvo 's Latest Efforts a Performance ' Abomination ' Say Cracker <p> Latest version of Denuvo making hundreds of thousands of protection calls , potentially causing performance problems - but still gets cracked in record time <p> Image/Photo Credit : Grey Box Games <p> The latest iteration of Denuvo used in the game RiME may be making hundreds of thousands of " trigger " calls during game loading , possibly crippling game performance as a result . <p> The highly rated game RiME , produced by game developers Tequila Works , has been making all the wrong kind of headlines recently . The game is one of a few recent games that has started using the latest version of Denuvo 's anti-tampering system , designed to prevent the game 's copy protection from being cracked . <p> Interestingly , Tequila Works promised to rip Denuvo from the game if/when the game 's Denuvo protection is cracked . This acted as a clarion call to game crackers everywhere . <p> Game cracker Baldman answered the call and it was he who managed to beat all others to crack RiME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage everyone to still buy what he called a " super nice " game , but when it came to Denuvo , Baldman discovered something sinister in this latest iteration , describing it as a " huge abomination " . <p> While how exactly Denuvo works remains a tightly controlled trade secret , most theorize it 's based on a system of " triggers " built into the game 's code . The Denuvo system checks for the presence of these triggers to ensure the game has not been cracked , and crackers will need to individually disable each trigger in order to completely disable Denuvo . Since each game will have an unknown number of random placed triggers , the task of cracking Denuvo games is therefore less than trivial . <p> In recent Denuvo games , the number of trigger calls seems to hover around the 1,000 mark . For RiME , Denuvo has upped the ante and to Baldman 's surprise , the number of trigger calls rose quickly to over 300,000 just on initial launching and save game loading . <p> The count rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gameplay . <p> Baldman estimates that Denuvo now makes around 20 to 30 calls per second , up from the 1 or 2 every couple of minutes in games like Sniper : Ghost Warrior 3 and NieR Automata . <p> This , Baldman says , is a huge performance drain , with the CPU and memory busy calling triggers and having less resources available to the actual game itself . To make matters worse , the trigger calls are obfuscated under a virtual machine , which causes a further performance hit . <p> True to their word , the developers of RiME have now removed Denuvo from their game . <p> " Upon receiving this news that the Denuvo protected game has been cracked , we worked to test this and verify that it was , in fact , the case . We have now confirmed that it is . As such , we at publisher Team Grey Box are following through on our promise from earlier this week that we will be replacing the current build of RiME with one that does not contain Denuvo , " said RiME community manager Dariuas.

Aloha <p> Regards , <p> hey good to see you too , ty for the help it seems my copy has all the same settings as you mentioned . it seems to brighten all the frames , because i can see it down below on the left on the " animation " window . when i go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . however when i open the . psd file imageready made in photoshop , i can see on the bottom right on the " layers " tab that only the one frame i lightened is in fact lightened . so it 's ligthening all the frames in imageready , i just do n't know how to save it as a new . gif. i 'm sure i 'm just saving something wrong . <p> Please accept my humble apology for suggesting wrongly about using the " Match " to apply the Levels command to all the frames in ImageReady . After checking the software carefully , I realized that I could n't brighten one frame and then apply it to all the frames at one time . In fact , I had to select one layer at a time and then adjust it with the Levels command individually . It is not bad if only a few frames but really time consuming for doing a large file with many frames . My suggestion is that , if you still want to use the Levels command for brightening , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings that you adjust , and then apply the same input settings to all other layers so that you will have the same brightness in all the frames . After getting everything done the way you like , save the file without modifying the original file , please select " Save Optimized As ... " ( Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S ) and save as the . GIF file . To do that , you still have the original one untouched in case . Once again , please forgive me for the inaccurate suggestion <p> Another suggestion : Select any one frame . Create a NEW ACTION by recording the desired changes made to that frame ( e.g. adjusting brightness ) . Assign a function key ( say F12 ) to the action . Now go on selecting each frame with your mouse and applying the action to that frame with F12 . You will still have to manually select every frame , but at least you will not have to make the adjustments everytime . <p> Yet another way : Open your file in IR . Create an action droplet ( involving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . ) . Save the droplet in Desktop.Now export all the frames of the GIF as separate images into a new folder in Desktop . Now drag the new folder upon the droplet icon . All the images in the folder will now have taken up the changes . Now open these changed images in IR and save as animated GIF . <p> My ImageReady version 7.0 allows applying the adjustments such as Levels , Brightness/Contrasts to any other layers by selecting the layer and then using the shortcut Ctrl+F to apply without going through the adjustment every time . I did check my friend ' s ImageReady CS2 , the shortcut Ctrl+F only available to Filters , not the adjustments though . Therefore , creating the Action would be handy as you suggested <p> no problem ben . i ca n't believe this fancy shmancy software ca n't even do this so easily lol. i appreciate all the help . i tried to find the procedures for your two suggestions paglamon , might you be able to expand on them ? i 'm willing to give this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CS2. 2 .

@@98121332 @2321332/ <p> I know people , including myself who have sticky labels on media from way back when CD stomper was born and have had no problems but , <p> My question concerns when you do have that problem and the media will not play correctly , Can you make a fresh copy of that disk since you are only copying digital info even if you need to go thru decryption/shrink or some of the gems we all use ? <p> In other words , does the label screw up the media and the digital info or just the media ? <p> also curious what many of you use as an alternative to stick-ons excluding HP 's Lite-on .... <p> I have read enough warnings and cautions on these forums from others that I decided not take any chances with any of the sticky labels . To be honest , this issue is one that is very difficult to actually get valid , documented information on . You can find lots of people who had problems with DVD discs that had sticky labels applied to them . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , even after two and three and four years of burning . This is the sort of issue which is very difficult to actually conduct any sorts of TESTS . <p> One can always argue , to those with problems , that their problems were due to poor media , or a bad batch of media , or burning to fast , or too slow , or errors in the burn from the start , or from the dye beginning to run , or to fade , etc. , and that their problems had nothing to do with the sticky labels . <p> One can also argue , to those who have never had a single problem , even after years of experiences , that they are just living on " borrowed time , " and their problems may begin next month , or next quarter , or next year ... <p> With so many conflicting reports from BOTH SIDES of this debate , who knows ? And , how can one possibly hope to " prove it " ? <p> I decided not to take chances , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeling at all ( each backup I make is stored in its own case , and in our house the DVD or CD always goes right back into its case , anyway ) . <p> Recently , I did invest in an Espon R200 inkjet printer ( on sale for $69.99 at Office Depot ) . It prints directly onto inkjet-printable DVDs . I am happy with this method , and wish that I had made this investment much earlier . <p> One could also factor this into the equation -- the current DVD is probably living on borrowed time . Although no one can predict how successful the upcoming HD DVD format will be , or the Blue Ray format will be , there is almost no doubt that one or the other ( or both ) will gradually make our current DVDs seem like " quaint old " relics of the past . This will not occur right away , in late 2005 or early 2006 , when those players are $1000 . However , the earliest VHS machines were $1800 and $2000 . The earliest DVD players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD Recorders were around $1000 , we all know what will happen , especially now that the growing number of high definition displays in people 's homes has become more than significant . <p> Based on my reading on this issue , you are likely to find roughly the same number of people who say " do n't stick a label on " as you are people who say " I 've been doing it ever since I began . " <p> HEY .. Would n't it be great if you could scan the dvd and print it out on a dvd envelope with no see-thru front ? or can that be done ? <p> Anyway , many good points you brought up about it all . Yes , the current dvd is living on borrowed time but " VHS is dead " has been the battle cry for sometime now so I do n't think it will that soon .. Ca n't see netflixs or blockbuster going strictly blue ray or HD for many yrs only because over 85% of households have not switched to High def tv 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it 's way someday .... <p> If you have a decent player that holds the disc in place securely . Then you will have no problems . I used to do labels and my Sony NS900 played every one flawless . The drive mechanism was very advanced in its day . Also , Sony players come with precision drive ( the latest one is version 3 ) . This can make the player read a DVD even if the disc is warped or off balance a lot easier . <p> However , too many players come with cheap DVD ROM drives and play up on labelled DVD 's . I had a 20 player that came with a rubbish Sanyo drive . It did't like labelled discs on bit . <p> I have read various reports about DVD labels " not working " . Everyone and there brother says it is because the DVD is " unbalanced " . While this maybe the easy dog to kick , I do n't believe that is the main reason for DVD labels causing problems . On my own I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but heavily weigh that " unbalancing " IS N'T the main culprit ( however unbalancing may contribute ) . <p> On a current project I bought Avery CD/DVD sticky labels and as been reported by many people before placing the labels on the DVD did cause the DVD 's to misread every time ( I tried 8 different AVERY labels ) I placed the AVERY labels on the DVD . Also , as reported by others , every time I removed the label the DVD began to work . However , the place it messed up on my DVD was ALWAYS at the end ( single layer 4.7G DVD+R ) . I suspected it was something OTHER than the perpetual kick the dog of unbalanced DVD causing the problem , since the problem occurred roughly at the same spot irregardless of carefully the label was applied . What I expected was that the label was applying mechanical stress . The only mechanical stress I knew of which the sticky label would apply which would be great enough to " distort " the DVD was surface tension ( lateral force parrallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glue/disk surface interaction . My guess is that the label was effectively pulling in towards the center of the disk , thus " bowling " the DVD . This would mean that the beginning of the DVD would read fine , which it did , but the end information would be distorted/pixeled and should lose track which it did . There is control servo information buried in the DVD such that the reading arm can keep track . Since the DVD was totally losing tracking at the end of the DVD , it would make sense that the outside of the DVD was being lifted thus bowling and losing total tracking . <p> To test this I took a " bad " DVD with a sticky label on it . With the label side up I grabbed the center of the DVD with one finger and then I pushed down on the outside edges of the DVD , uniformally along the outside edge . I placed it in the DVD , yeah you guessed it it played . To test the balance I sped it up to 16x , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason is in bending down the outside edge of the DVD and pulling up on the center of the DVD with one finger caused the center of the DVD to crack ( it did n't crack upto the information area just around the spindle ) . This I knew was bad and would n't be a solution , however it was an important affirmation that surface tension was most likely the culprit . Also one should gain a healthy respect for how much surface tension force there is since I effectively had to bend the DVD enough that it cracked around the spindle . <p> While it is important that DVD 's are balanced , it is probably more important that DVD 's are FLAT . To make a DVD player lose track of a 750 nm ( that is 750 x 10-9 meter ) does n't take a lot of " bowling " of the DVD . For people who are storing only a little amount of information on a DVD , let us say less than 2G they probably can pretty much use any label ( given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a CD/DVD label applicator which centers the label ) . For people like me who are using the whole disk , 4.3G or greater you will be very sensitive to WHO 's lable you use , the manufacturer . I also did one other experiments to see if it was surface tension , but I do not have room to describe this one but it pointed to surface tension being the problem as well . <p> Ok , what I did quite out of a Lark was buy another CD/DVD label manufacturers product , NEATO by Fellowes , which I bought at Target . Long story short I have tried 8 out of 8 of these labels and have had no problem , they all work . Since I believe the main culprit of the DVD labeling process causing problems is surface tension , I did some other experiments with Neato to see if they would hold up . I put the DVD in the refrigerator for one hour , took it out and played it right away ( yes at the end ) there was no problems . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was probably 100 degrees in my care all day , it played with no problems . I have a friend who has a tempermental DENTON DVD player and at first it would n't play then we popped it out and popped in again and it played fine . <p> If it is surface tensiong , which I believe it is then different temperature expansion rates of the two different materials can cause problems ( which is why I did the temperature test ) . The other is the drying and the type of glue , I suspect that NEATO accidentally used a glue on the back of their labels which exert a very small if any lateral force when applied . Also it maybe a function of the type of paper , I noticed NEATO has somewhat of a glossy surface so it might be that the NEATO paper has been impregnated with the " right stuff " to reduce surface tension . Almost everything can affect surface tension , the thickness of the glue maybe a variable or/and the chemical reaction of the glue with the surface the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AVERY CD/DVD label ) . <p> Time may also kill my DVD , it might happen that given enough time the current NEATO label I have may dry in such away to exert a lot of surface tension , thus bowling my DVD again . I do n't have enough time with these labels to say whether my DVD 's will die in 6 months or a year or so . The temperature testing however gives me hope . Also I did a pressure test on the NEATO label and again the DVD played , however the AVERY label when pressed on hard made the DVD tracking worse ..... so here I have hope as well . <p> Hopefully NEATO will not change their glue , paper , thickness of the glue or/and hopefully someone from AVERY will read this thread and investigate how much surface stress their labels create on a DVD . It is n't a lot but it is enough stress to lift the outside DVD edges such that the 750nm pits essentially disappear to the DVD reading head ( if one thinks about it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main lobe of light ) . <p> BTW , one maybe able to " see " the stress . The reason is that the pits and tracking is small enough ( I think it is on the order of visual light ) that you can see difraction grating ( phasing of the light ) when you look at the bottom of the DVD under a light . If there is a stress you probably should see patterns in a fully written DVD , especially compared to another DVD with no stress ( no label ) . I may try this experiment , if I am correct one should be able to see this . <p> There 's been a long , drawn-out argument at videohelp on that one . Without getting into too much detail , as a contractor I 'm familiar with certain pre-stressed materials , some involving various cellulose ( paper ) coatings . ( Medium Density Fiberboard , for instance . ) Now , some people simply refuse to believe paper can exert tension sufficient to warp something out of plane . I 'm here to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side only of a given material . Change temperature and/or humidity , and the paper , well , it moves . Expanding or contracting . Expanding 's no problem , paper ca n't " push " something out of plane . It can " pull " , however . <p> The cure is to remove the full-face label with WD-40 or warm soapy water , whatever you prefer . Chances are good your read errors will go away . Oh , and hub/core labels do n't seem to exhibit the same problem . <p> I guess in technical terms we are talking about something that increases jitter to outside acceptable limits ? <p> Regards <p> It would affect jitter measurements , but I think the actual term would be to say it can throw tilt out of spec : The disc tilt limit is 0.8in the radial direction , and 0.3in the tangential direction . The specification for the radial direction is larger in consideration of the fact that it 's easy for the disc to curve into a bowl shape . ... As a side note , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the use of improper cases and packing . from LONG ... <p> I just got done performing what I consider conclusive experimental proof that surface tension by sticky paper labels is the main reason putting labels on DVD 's is causing problems . <p> First let me go into why surface tension creates a relatively strong force . Surface tension is the combined force of each molecue pulling in the same direction , in this case the label is pulling the DVD towards the center of the DVD , thus bowling the DVD . A feel for surface ( BTW before I forget thanks for everyone who replied , I did read your replies and learned and appreciated your replies ) is to compare surface tension to a tug of war . If each individual is a 100lb weaking and individually can not lift a 100lbs , the 100lb weakling can exert a lot of force if you have a 100 of them pulling on a rope all in the same direction at the same time . <p> Given the model above we can reduce the tug of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us say we cut the rope in 10 equal lengths and therefore there is only 10 people per segment . We have reduced the force any rope can exert by a factor of 10 . Cutting the rope more will reduce the surface tension more . <p> Ok , you guys are probably ahead of me by now . What I decided to do is score the the label , essentially the same thing they do when they pour concrete is they score the concrete every once in awhile to reduce stress and expansion forces . I grabbed a DVD with an AVERY label , I verified it would n't play , in fact over half of this DVD would n't play , actually close to 2/3 of it would n't play . I decided to score the DVD label with a sharp knife . The pattern I chose was a checkerboard pattern . The 1st score was just a crosshair pattern centered on the DVD , the cross hair ran the length of the DVD . I then tried to play the DVD , it did n't play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring , but I did n't think of that until I was done ) . Then I scored the DVD again parallel to the x and y axis , if you are counting this was an additional 4 scores for a total of 6 scores . I tried playing the DVD , again it did n't play at the end ( but this time I noticed it played more , gave me hope but I did n't record how much more ) . I then scored parallel to the x and y axis 1/2 way between each segment , if you are counting this was an additional 8 scores for a total of 14 scores . THE DVD PLAYED ! ! ! No skipping , no pixeling just played like it should of . <p> Also , I went on the web and searched for DVD specifications . The DVD is only spinning around 3.5 m/S , in other words if you were walking a bit on the brisk side it would keep up with you . Essentially this means it is n't spinning that fast , some peoples comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds ...... it is n't it is relatively slow . This makes sense since the DVD 's are made of acrylic based material so it would have to spin " slowly " . This tends to dampen the arguement of the DVD being off balance as the major problem . I would however not totally discount this as a problem , I just do n't think it is the major problem . <p> Ok , I believe I have experimentally shown that surface tension bowling the DVD is the major labeling problem . Now I am going to work on some experiments to solve the surface tension problems . I already have one in mind and ca n't wait to try it . <p> well done , excellent forensic approach . it is VERY rare for me to read a post when i see one this long---but i noticed right away the technicalities . i 'm impressed . a lot of this depends on the drive mechanism of the player too . i use avery envelope labels on my discs ( therefore are off balance ) and my toshiba do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys stick REAL good . once they are on , you wo n't get them off without destroying them . <p> " Also , I went on the web and searched for DVD specifications .

However I 'd guess the majority of people here Know that labels can cause problems , and therefore recommend Not to use them . <p> In other words , does the label screw up the media and the digital info or just the media ? <p> It will only screw up the media , but this of course can cause problems when trying to rip the info from the media at a later date because the disk itself is bowed , which skews the foil layers tilt out of specification as I mentioned earlier in the thread . <p> If you 're having problems when trying to recover the data from a labeled DVD , you can try removing the label . I have n't personally done this but have read that products such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bond of the glue and allow you to remove the label , without damaging the disk . You should be very careful not to stress the disk too much since this could crack the internal foil layers , and should really only be used as a ' last resort ' if the data ca n't be read . Also if you do use any petroleum products on the disk be sure to give it a thorough cleaning afterwards . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by rago88 <p> curious what many of you use as an alternative to stick-ons excluding HP 's <p> I personally use a ' Sharpie ' marker , that 's probably what the majority of people use as well .

The HP lightscribe technology is still relatively new and although it 's cool , I do n't think many people consider the additional time it takes to scribe the label ( up to 30 minutes ) or the additional cost of the media are worth the results .

My tv is a USA television and so is my dvd player . Can I play DVD 's from europe ? What is PAL ? Will the DVD player automatically convert PAL to NTSC ? <p> I did more searching on the web , and I am finding all sorts of contradicting information . For example , I downloaded my DVD player handbook , and it says it can not play PAL at all . But it also said it could only play region 1 and nothing else ( and that is wrong since I found out how to change between regions using a code built into the dvd player ) . The I found some posts saying PAL dvds will play on NTSC tv 's , just that they will be in black and white . And another website said it will not play at all . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because I am learning to speak French , and I find the easiest way to get accustomed to the language is to hear as much of it as possible . I have some French DVD 's that are ntsc region one , and they are wonderful . I would like to buy some that are region 2 from France . I really liked the Three Colors trillogy , and look forward to more authentic French movies . <p> I wish I could know if it will play PAL or not . I do not want to spend money to buy a DVD which will not play . <p> Best bet is to try it out and see what happens . Regions are related to copyright control , but NTSC and PAL are two different color formats , and they are not mutually compatible on most stand alone players and TVs . There are , of course , acceptions in the various sorts of multi-system TVs and DVD players , but I think they might be expensive in the US ( in some places , they are the norm ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problem , and if they do n't work on your TV , you can copy and convert the DVDs using some of the methods that are discussed on this forum . <p> The DVD player on my computer is region locked , so I would not be able to play DVD 's from region 2 . That is why I was so happy when I discovered how to reset the region on my RCA DVD player that is attached to my TV . Plus , even if I could copy the DVD to my laptop , I do not have a dvd-r drive , just a cd-rw , and the RCA dvd player will not read any cd-r 's . <p> Someone wrote about a NTSC to PAL converter box , maybe that would work ? ? ? I do not have that much money , but it would be nice to be able to watch movies that are not from the USA , as hollywood does the same thing over and over . I would like to have more variety in choice . And I really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning their language . <p> I wonder why companies do this kind of stuff to us . I spent alot of money buying a nice 32 " tv . It took me a year to save enough to buy it and the DVD player . Little did I know they wanted to lock me out so I can not play movies from Europe . This sucks . <p> Hi there Harry . I bought my fiancee a DVD player for Christmas - just a cheapy mind ! Under 50 from Novatech but I believe Simply Computers are also selling it . It 's badged as Ronin and plays DVD , DVDR/RW , CD/R/RW and mp3 but the thing that should really grab you is it 's PAL/NTSC switchable. ... and it 's quite small too ! Hope this helps , Steve . <p> Depends on the dvd 's video structure : if it is progressive , it will play on an ntsc tv , if it 's pal interlaced , you will only see a rolling b&amp;w image . Some dvd players have progressive output to use with HDTV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be able to play pal dvd 's on a HDTV . Another solution is to use your computer ( or it 's tv-out ) to play region free pal interlaced dvd 's . If you deal with region locked pal dvd 's , you can use smartripper or dvddecrypter to remove region lock and play from harddrive . <p> Just to toss another thought into the mix , I have been using DVDIdlePro and DVDRegionFree on my Window 2000 laptop for about year and am very happy with them . One uses a cache to cut down wear on your DVD drive , and the other fools your computer into thinking the region is not yet locked . They are bundled together , I think , if you surf around the net for them . <p> Most Apex DVD players can play either NTSC or PAL DVDs by pressing the button ( N/P ) on the remote control to choose the correct video format if the player messes up . However , these players sold in NTSC lands have only NTSC hookups.

" We do n't want the Web to be a bunch of cordoned-off apps , " said W3C Chief Executive Jeff Jaffe when trying to explain the group 's backing of including Encrypted Media Extensions ( EME ) as part of the HTML5 specifications . <p> EME is a standardized framework that allows for the inclusion of third party Content Decryption Modules ( CDMs ) , such as Widevine . <p> For most end users , the inclusion of EME support and the use of the Widevine CDM will mean one thing : video streaming services will work directly on the Android devices directly via the Chrome browser , instead of via specially made apps . <p> In a related announcement , Google engineers also announced the decision to support the Media Source Extension ( MSE ) interface . The MSE interface will allow JavaScript based control of adaptive streaming , which allow the streaming quality to change to adapt to changing network conditions . 
@@98121349 @2321349/ <p> Anyway I recently downloaded a video file from a streaming video from a website . The streaming protocol was something like rtmp and the video file type was mp4 . The download seemed to go fine , but when i came to open the file with vlc , only the audio would play . I then tried to open it with media player classic and got the message " can not render video " . I am a bit stuck but I think the issue may be related to the one in the post titled " can not render movie " ( sorry I ca n't post a link I havnt been a member long enough ) but my file is a mp4 file . Is there a way to do this same thing but with a mp4 file . <p> I tried ffdshow and still got the same result . I also tried to redownload and still got the same result . Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated . Is it a problem that the video files were originally streaming videos on the Internet ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lite .

@@98121350 @2321350/ <p> I look to the MPEG-TS streams ( with wiresahark ) . I did n't find the Picture Hearder in the MPEG Headers . What I found is only the stream I 'd ( 0xE0 ) which is the MPEG-2 stream I 'd followed by the its extension . That 's all . <p> You should have a stream start code ( 01e0 ) followed by data , then the MPEG sequence header code ( 01b3 ) followed by data , then the 0x0100 picture header should be around byte 0x80 . Look at it in a hex editor . <p> Finally I found out how to identify iframes from a ts file . In a typical video ts file you 'll encounter something like the following : <p> ( in hex ) 00 00 00 01 E0 --&gt; This indicates the start of video PES packet .. .. 00 00 01 B8 --&gt; This indicates start of group of pictures header .. .. 00 00 01 00 --&gt; This indicates the picture start code as said by Blutach in the previous post . This is 32 bits . The 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So temporal reference will include the byte following the picture start code and the first two bits of the second byte after the picture start code ie one byte ( 8 bits ) + 2 bits . These we need to skip . Now the three bits present ( 3 , 4 and 5th bits of the second byte from the picture start code ) will indicate the Frame type ie I , B or P. So to get this simply logical AND &amp; the second byte from the picture start code with 0x38 and right shift &gt;&gt; with 3 . Voila .. you get your frame type ! ! <p> Here the first four bytes 00 00 01 00 is the picture start code . The fifth byte and the first two bits of the sixth byte is the temporal reference . So our concern is in the sixth byte --&gt; 0F Frame type = ( ( 0F &amp; 38 ) &gt;&gt;3 ) ; Frame type = 1 ==&gt; I Frame <p> What you said was perfectly right ! In fact what you gave was the only source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ google . But I recently happened to get a copy of the ISO doc of MPEG TS . I just wanted to elaborate on what you said . I did n't mean to offend you . <p> Hi guys , thanks for the great post .. I was wondering .. Has anybody tried to analyize the Adaptation Field in the MPEG2-TS ? And how is that we can find the sequence of a particular program as in sequence of the package .. As in first we find the PAT , then its find the PMT 's and then how is that we figure out the Elementary Streams in sequence ? ? <p> Hi for better understanding i started using an Mpeg-ps stream . Now in the PS stream i have i only seems to see Stream types with I 'd E0 , C0 and BE ... Can i get the iframes from the same ? ? If so it will be of great help .. Thanks

@@98121352 @2321352/ <p> Probably the best utility for chopping Mpeg files is TMPGEnc . You can also use M1-Edit , M2-Edit or IFilmEdit v1.4.5 if TMPGEnc fails , but TMPGEnc is usually better at it and is a free utility too . Some Mpeg files , especially those encoded using the hardware video compression of a capture card , will have problems being cut or joined together .

@@98121354 @2321354/ <h> If I were to buy a new computer today ( July 2010 ) <p> You can build a computer today that is compatible with Blu-ray 3D <p> Its been far too long since my last " If I were to buy a new computer today " feature . They say 2 month is a long time in computing , but add a year to that , and it might as well be a decade . For those that do n't  know , this feature aims to recommend a computer system that 's represents good value and future proofing , without costing the Earth . - The last computer I recommended featured a Phenom II processor , a Radeon 4850 and " only " 1TB HDDs , so its definitely time for an update . But instead of going with the past format , I think I will do things a bit differently . People have different opinions about brands , so instead of choosing a brand for you ( eg. Gigabyte motherboards ) , I will only list out the essential features and a rough price point of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample system with the specs picked out using brands that I like . This way , you can read this guide to find out what are the features you need to buy , at roughly what price , and then choose your own brands as you see fit ( or still use my recommendations ) . <p> Another change is that instead of providing just a single specification , I will be providing two specs . One will be the same type of system that I 've been recommending in this feature , one that has a good balance between value and performance , for gaming , multimedia ( Blu-ray ) and general use . There will also be some optional items for this system that takes it to the next level ( like SSD drives , or even 3D capability ) . The other will be for a home theater based system , where things like low heat/noise requirements are balanced with the need for extra processing power ( for Blu-ray and other functionalities ) . <p> So let 's get started ! <p> General Purpose System <p> Buying a motherboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the latest techs such as USB 3.0 and SATA 6Gbps <p> So what should one look for in a PC that does everything in the middle of 2010 ? The last thing anyone want is a PC that 's obsolete within weeks of purchase ( but given the speed technology moves , a few weeks may not be too bad ! ) . Then again , nobody wants to overspend on features that they will never use . And while the ultimate gaming rig can costs upwards of $5000 , its not to say that we do n't  want a system that 's totally incapable of playing today , and tomorrows games . And Blu-ray so many computer systems these days neglect to put in a Blu-ray/DVD combo drive that costs only a fraction above the price of the same drive without Blu-ray reading ( or writing ) functions . Sure , playing Blu-ray movies on your monitor may not be the best , but for $50 , it may just be worth the price ( and since this website/blog is very much in support of HD video , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  play Blu-ray , and with the optional 3D specs , you can get one that also plays Blu-ray 3D ) . So let 's look at what we think are the key features that you need to be looking for : <p> * CPU : The pick of the Intel bunch right now is probably the i5 750 . It has just the right mix of price and performance , and by getting an Intel 1156 socket motherboard to go along with it , there is a degree of future proofing with faster CPUs definitely on the way . <p> * 4GB of RAM : Whether its DDR2 or DDR3 , 4GB is really the minimum these days , although going to 8GB is probably a bit excessive . <p> * GPU : The ATI Radeon HD range is still where the perfect price/performance mix lies , as the Nvidia range simply is n't attractive enough . <p> * USB 3.0 : While chipsets from Intel and AMD are slow at bringing the next version of USB to motherboards , that 's not to say you should ignore this quite vital next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will offer transfer speeds for external drives that finally match speeds for internal ones . <p> * SATA III ( 6 Gbps ) : The SATA II 3 Gbps standard is just about not enough for todays super drives , namely SSDs . You do not want to be left with a motherboard that does not support SATA III , when all the new fancy drives all do . Apart from the optical drive and the case accessories , the HDD is the only mechanical device left in the PC. - Bring on SSDs ! <p> * Optional SSDs : I 've talked about how great SSDs are in the past , prices have dropped , and although still high compared to HDDs , they may just be entering the affordable stage if you use them for system drives . Having Windows and a selection of your frequently used programs on the SSD drive will mean super fast load and access times , while keeping a TB sized HDD array for mass storage . <p> * Optional 3D : The 3D hype is getting a bit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D movies . 3D gaming on the PC is often overlooked , but the most immersive- experience may very well be on the PC . This is because of a few factors . First , PCs , unlike consoles , are versatile and through software updates , even older games can be made to perform in 3D ( games are usually easier to make into " 3D " than movies , since most games are created and rendered in a 3D fashion already , whereas older movies are shot in a 2D format called . Namely film ) . And because we tend to sit in front of monitors much closer than TVs , the 3D effect is much more noticeable . With 3D , if you want 3D on your monitor , then you 'll need to get a suitable Nvidia graphics card ( that also accelerates Blu-ray 3D playback ) , as well as a 120Hz 3D monitor . <p> A good HTPC case like this Antec Fusion combines a nice look and compatibility with both Mini-ITX and Micro-ATX motherboards <p> For home theater PC systems , the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost as well , and that means sacrificing some processor power , especially when it comes to graphics card . Blu-ray playback is essential here , but almost everything else can be sacrificed for the previously stated criteria . Let 's have a look at the must have features of such a system : <p> * CPU : There are two ways you can go with the CPU . If you choose Intel , then you need one of the new Clarkdale CPUs , with the integrated GPU that can be enabled with the right chipset , it saves money on a dedicated GPU solution , and it even supports bitstreaming of the HD audio codecs via the motherboards HDMI output . The other route is with an AMD solution , using a Radeon HD 5000 series solution , which also works fine . <p> * Motherboard : The motherboard is important for home theater systems . First of all , it needs to be the right size , maybe a mini-ITX or Micro ATX , and it also needs to have the correct integrated solutions for our needs . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H55 , H57 or Q57 chipset to take advantage of the integrated GPU and bitstreaming support . For AMD solutions , if you do n't  need TrueHD/DTS-HD MA bitstreaming , then a 890GX solution with an integrated Radeon 42xx chipset is enough . <p> * GPU : An integrated solution is mostly enough , but if not , you 'll need to go down the low profile card route . But regardless , you will need a GPU that can accelerate Blu-ray decoding , as to avoid using your CPU as much as possible ( more CPU =&gt; more heat =&gt; more noise ) . For this , we need an Radeon HD solution , or the Clarkdale motherboard solution . If TrueHD/DTS-HD MA- audio bitstreaming support is required , then an entry level Radeon HD 5000 series is needed the Clarkdales support this when paired with the right chipset already . Another advantage of going with the Intel solution is that Blu-ray 3D acceleration is supported , assuming you have the required TV to connect the system to . <p> * HDD : We need a largish , but quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the requirements .

If you followed Step 2 , the AviSynth Script Creator tool should already be started with the D2V file created loaded . Otherwise , you 'll need to load the media file you want to convert into the " Video Input " section ( see hint below about opening files whose formats AviSynth does not natively support , including MOV files ) . <p> AviSynth is able to open almost any video file that you are able to play with a Directshow based multimedia player , such as Media Player Classic or Windows Media Player .

In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio codec and a splitter filter for the format you wish to convert . <p> For example , if you want to convert FLV files using MeGUI , you will first need to make sure you have the required video , audio and splitter filters to make FLV files playable in Windows Media Player . A good way to ensure you have all the right codecs and filters installed is to use the K-Lite Mega Codecs Pack . Download the package , and it will ask you to uninstall any existing filters which might interfere , and then install a set that is very compatible with tools like MeGUI . You can find instruction on how to install the K-Lite Mega Codecs Pack here . <p> The " Input DAR " is the aspect ratio of the input video . In most circumstances , it should be automatically set for you . Anamorphic DVDs will be set to " ITU 16:9 " , for example . <p> For DVD sources , press the " Auto Crop " button to remove the black bars from the input video if it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files wo n't ) . <p> Next , you have to decide whether you need to reduce the resolution of the output video as compared to the input . In most cases , especially converting from DivX/XviD , you do not need to so uncheck the " Resize " option . For DVD sources , you might need to reduce the resolution , but only if you have file size requirements ( eg. to fit a certain amount of video onto 1 CD ) . For DVD conversion onto a single CD ( 700 MB ) using H.264 , you can get away with using the maximum resolution ( 720x*** ) - so uncheck " Resize " in this case too . <p> If you do decide to decrease the resolution , check the " Resize " option and then check the " Suggested Resolution " checkbox too and change the resolution to one that you require . Recommended resolutions for the Xbox 360 include 640x*** , 720x*** , 1280x*** ( 720p ) and 1920x**** ( 1080p ) . <p> Click on the " Filters " tab .

Otherwise , if you chose to reduce the resolution , then you can choose how the resize will look like ( " Bicubic ( Neutral ) " is recommended as a middle of the road choice ) . If the source has lots of noise , you can choose to enable the noise filter and choose how much noise is present in your source ( usually not necessary , unless the original source is VHS or something ) . The other options can be left alone ( " Colour Correction " is automatically checked for D2V input sources ) . <p> If your source is not DVD , then you can click on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable audio ( you do n't need to do this with DVD sources if you have followed this guide , since we have already demuxed the audio using D2V Creator ) . Simply change the " audio=false " entry to " audio=true " . <p> Make sure the " On save close and load to be encoded " option and press the " Save " button to save the AviSynth script ( by default , in the same directory as the D2V file , the filename is not important ) . Do n't worry too much about the AviSynth Script Creator tool 's preview window - it can be a little buggy where cropping and resizing and concerned . After saving , the AviSynth file should be loaded automatically into MeGUI - MeGUI 's preview window does work fine and please make sure the video looks alright , especially for DVD sources with cropping/resize.

Luckily , through the wonderful Internet caching technologies of Archive.org , Homer 's original ( and wise ) remarks can still be read here . <p> ( Just in case the MPAA " requests " action from Archive.org again , I 've already saved a copy of this priceless web page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is if the MPAA does n't hack into my computer and wipe my files first ) <p> There is a new video compression codec that has been quietly closing in on DivX as the most popular video codec , confirmed by the fact that it is the 7th most downloaded software on DivX Digest . This new video codec is called XviD ( DivX backwards ) , and unlike DivX , is a completely open-source project . <p> As stated on DivX Digest 's XviD download page : " XviD is a continuation of Project Mayo and aims to develop a high quality open-source MPEG-4 codec . As you may already know , XviD comes from the same open-source project that was the basis for DivX 4. x/5.x , but instead of going all commercial , XviD remains open-source . The quality of the codec is extremely good , and encoding speed is very fast as well , so it is at least worth a try " . <p> Since both XviD and the new DivX 4. x/5.x codecs comes from the same source ( Project Mayo ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - so similar in fact , that both formats are almost interchangeable ( meaning you can use the DivX codec to playback XviD encoded movies , and vice versa ) . <p> Technically , XviD is still somewhat behind DivX 5. x in terms of compression , quality and efficiency . <p> But in my opinion , XviD 's open-source approach is much preferred over DivX Network 's closed-source/commercial licensing approach . Of course , DivX Network 's main goal is to make DivX profitable and a commercial licensing scheme is necessary - there is absolutely nothing wrong with trying to make money out of DivX , and in the process , promote DivX as a viable commercial video codec . But because XviD is an open-source project , many in the DivX/MPEG-4 community with programming skills are able to offer their skills in improving this codec - and this is an advantage DivX Networks does not have .

Most of the " extra " extras on the R1 version will be material that the DVD producers can find between the release of the overseas versions and the release of the R1 version , and the most important features will already be on the overseas versions ( eg. documentaries , most deleted scenes ) . Considering Universal has had years to come up with the extra features on the DVDs , I would n't expect the R1 version to have additional extras that fans of the movie ca n't live without - perhaps some newly recorded audio commentary will be the only thing that oversea fans will miss terribly . Also , the overseas versions seems to have a better looking cover . <p> BTTF - Rest of the World <p> While it still is n't clear what exactly is on the Region-1 version of BTTF , and whether the Region-2 version will be released earlier or later or have the same content as the R1 or R4 version of the DVD , below is a list of likely release dates and prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see , the Australian version is clearly the cheapest and quickest way to get your BTTF DVD fix .

You can cut and paste as many layers as you want this way , so you do n't have to be stingy with them . <p> LAYER PROPERTIES <p> Now that you have two layers , Photoshop will only paint on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer to paint on just click on it until it turns blue . In the example below I have ' Layer 1 ' selected . Notice also that on the layer you select a paintbrush icon will apear on the left of it ; this just confirms that this is the layer you will be painting on or editing . <p> Since we often need to work with lots of layers it makes life easier if we can rename each layer ( we can have something like 8,000 layers in a picture ) . For example , if we are Photo retouching a face we might have one layer with a cut out of the eye , nose , mouth and so on . It makes sence to rename these layers to eye or nose or whatever . That way when we want to edit the eye we can just click on the eye layer . <p> Renaming any layer is easy , just select the layer you wish to rename and right-click the mouse button . Up will pop the following options : <p> Select Layer Properties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also label a layer by a certain colour too . <p> Right-clicking on any layer will usualy bring up all the options that can be applied to it . It 's an easy and quick way do things . For example , you can right-click and delete any layer . Or you can right-click and duplicate a layer too . This is useful if you want to edit certain parts of a picture but want to keep the original untouched . For example , copying a face and deleting everything but the eyes , nose and mouth . If you do this it is possible to sharpen these features without sharpenintg the smooth skintones around them . Just remember , if you ca n't remember how to do something try right-clicking it . <p> Making Layers Invisible <p> When you start working with lots of layers sometimes it helps to be able to make them temporarily invisible . To do this we click on the eye icon to the left of the layer . Let 's do that now . Click on the eye icon on the background layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be presented with the following picture : <p> The background has not been deleted it has just been made invisible . The selection we pasted over the background is now on its own . The checkered squares behind it mean there is no background and the picture is completely transparent . Whenever there is nothing behind a layer the checkerd effect appears . The checker effect will not appear on your final picture it is only there so you know that around the graphic is transparent ! <p> Reordering Layers <p> Okay just so the idea of layers really hits home let 's reorder a few . Start a new blank picture in Photoshop and go to the Layers Palette . <p> Notice at the bottom of the layers palette there are a bunch of icons designed to add or remove new layers . Click on the add new layer pallete twice ( encircled in red ) . This should create two blank layers . So you should now have the white background plus Layer 1 and Layer 2 as shown in the picture above . <p> Now select Layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've chosen red ) and scribble over layer 1 . It will look like this : <p> Next select Layer 2 and draw a blue squiggle over the top of it , like this :

@@98121374 @2321374/ <p> I 'm sick to death with how people are claiming amazing results using FlasK and VirtualDub 's threshold deinterlacers . These can be used but its about time someone did some comparison tests on deinterlace methods . And since I 've been looking into this lately I thought I 'd share my test examples = ) . If you do not know what the interlace problem is I suggest you read my NTSC / PAL Interlace guide Here . <p> The problem with converting any DVD movie is that ( for rather complex reasons ) the field orders can get mixed up . In the ideal world we should be able to match the correct top filed to the correct bottom field and perform perfect IVTC on all NTSC movies . Then there would be no combing effects and we would have a truly perfect movie . However , since we can not know the top to bottom field order we end up sticking together two different frames together ! <p> The proposed solution to solving this is to use a standard Deinterlacer which merges two wrong fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a straight blend or , as in the case of Flask or VirtualDubs Smart Deinterlacer 's they will try to blend only moving areas and keep the non moving area 's unchanged . These Smart Deinterlacers use threshold settings . The higher the setting the less the moving area 's are blended and the more of a combing effect you get . The lower the threshold setting the more the motion areas are blended together and the more of a ghosting effect is produced ! <p> It is hoped that this selective blending will keep the greatest possible detail and make the best of a bad situation ! The following shows examples of the various methods . <p> As Picard moves to the right the top field of the frame with his head on the right is mixed with the bottom field of his head on the left . These fields are wrong . Let 's see how common deinterlacers try to solve this . <p> As you can see on the left , the normal VirtualDub deinterlacer does pure blending and produces a smooth picture but also a nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deinterlacer 's effect . It produces a crisper image but this is also destroyed by wrongly blended combing effects - there is no solution to this . If we turn the threshold up the lines look even worse ! If we turn down the threshold the effects of combing disappear and the ghosting effect appears . In effect turning down the threshold makes the final image look more like the left picture above and turning it up makes it look like the one on the above right . <p> The Flask Mpeg smart deinterlacer still does n't solve the problem , we get : <p> As you can see any solution that requires blending images is a bad solution at best . Its is impossible to blend two different frames together ! <p> THE BETTER SOLUTION ? ? <p> In my opinion blending images destroys picture quality ! But there is another solution . DVD players ( both hardware and software ) that can not perform IVTC opt for line doubling solutions because it 's cheaper . They literally separate both interlaced fields and copy the line above to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the equivalent of nearest neighbor resizing vertically . PC DVD players ( such as PowerDVD or WinDVD ) usually use Bob deinterlacing or a combination of Bob and Weave . Bob is really the best of a bad situation for DVD players but still guarantees deleting all possible remnants of combing and ghosting effects . <p> It works by separating all top and bottom fields of a DVD and making a new frame out of each of them . So a 30fps movie will now have 60fps ! Each field would normally only have half the amount of lines in them making them 720 x 240 to prevent this the computer interpolates between them filling in the gaps with guesswork . So far the only correct Bob deinterlacer that I have found is the AVISynth Bob deinterlacer . For more information on using AVISynth go Here . The following is the final image produced by AVISynth . <p> Looks much better do n't it ! And there are no combing effects or ghosting ! There is now also a VirtualDub smart deinterlacer filer now that has a bob function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality as AVISynth . On some commercial DVD players it is possible to play back at 60fps using the bob style interlacing . But for making DivX movies this is a wasteful way to do things . So to get back to the original framerate of 30fps you have to tell either AVISynth or VirtualDub etc. , to only display every other frame . This brings us back to the original framerate . Since the Telecine process has six repeated frames per second ignoring every other frame is very unlikely to cause choppiness in the same way it would with a PAL movie , and so we have probably taken the lesser of two evils . <p> I 'm not exactly sure how the interpolation between lines is achieved on bob deinterlacing but I 'd imagine that it uses some kind of bicubic filtering . For example , it may possible use these steps : <p> Step 1 . All fields are separated into top and bottom parts . Step 2 . The lines from all fields are then stacked 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 etc. , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This new picture looks like a squashed pancake and end up 720 x 240 . Step 3 . Each field is then High Quality Bicubically resized back to 720 x 480 ! Step 4 . The DVD is now played back at 60 frames per second . This means that even though each frame is only built from half a frame the details of both are displayed because both frames are shown in such fast succession . <p> Resize vs Bob ? <p> If that is truly how Bob deinterlacing works ( which I 'm am not 100% sure of the details ) , would n't it be just as good to ignore one field and resize the movie to 320 x 240 or 384 x 288 instead of resizing back to 720 x 480 ? That is since disregarding one field is ignoring half the information ? <p> Well there is a possible valid reason why we would want to resize the image back to 720 x 480 instead of using 240 . It will give a slight but significant difference in quality ! Bicubic resizing is done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the case , if we resized a picture from 720 x 240 down to 360 x 240 then we will end up loosing 86,400 pixels of information ! Do n't forget that there is still 720 pixels across ! <p> But if we resize a 720 x 240 picture back up to 720 x 480 then the bicubic interpolation will take into account these extra 86,000 pixels ( at least in the horizontal direction ) because it matches pixels above and below . <p> True Deinterlacing <p> The Bob deinterlacer is better than the threshold deinterlacers because it does n't blend the picture . There are , however , ways to perform true deinterlacing . That is to work out what fields belongs to what frames . I intend on writing more information on this soon in another article and solve the problem . But if you are using VirtualDub I suggest you check out the filters called Telecide and Decimate . I have only just recently found out about them so they are quite new to me . The Telecide compares frames to each other to determin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen have been great and the top and bottom fields match every time ! <p> Once the correct top and bottom fields are found and reconstructed into whole frames with Telecide , all that is needed is to delete every duplicate frame and you would have performed IVTC . The VirtualDub Deceminate filter can be used for this in conjunction with AVISynth . This method is not supposed to be 100% perfect but is very close to perfect . Anyway I will go into all that stuff when I have more time ... <p> As a final note , the only truly 100% perfect deinterlace method I have seen seems to be the one that uses TMPGEnc . It is very hard to do but produces perfect results . My friend Doom9 has a guide on how to do it . Check him out Here .

@@98121387 @2321387/ <h> If I were to buy a new computer today ( June 2011 ) Sandy Bridge Edition <p> It 's now all about Sandy Bridge , Intel 's second generation Core processors <p> Its been nearly a year since my last " If I were to buy a new computer " feature , and whereas the last one was about 3D Blu-ray , this one is all about Sandy Bridge , Intels second generation Core processor . The original Sandy Bridge launch was scuppered due to a manufacturing fault , and its only now that these new Intel CPUs are being launched proper . While normally , its never a good time to buy a new computer just after a new CPU/socket launch , due to the premium pricing , Sandy Bridge changes the equation because , for once , Intel is launching a new range of CPUs that not only undercuts AMDs offerings , but also its own CPUs , making the SB CPUs the best in terms of price/performance , despite the " newness " of the part . <p> Just like the last edition of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general purpose machine , another a Mini ITX build for home theater use , and what I called the " Lottery Winners Special " the last time , basically a system if money ( as well as power consumption/noise ) is not an issue . <p> Let 's get started . <p> General Purpose System / Lottery Winners Special <p> Our general purpose system is slightly higher specd than your average PC , because with this PC , we want to pretty much do everything on it . This includes playing the latest games , playing and burning Blu-ray discs , video editing and conversion , and also a system that is somewhat future proof . <p> So let 's look at what I think are the key features that you need to be looking for : <p> * CPU : Were choosing to go with a Sandy Bridge CPU . But which one ? The sweet spot at the moment , in terms of pricing and performance , appears to the Core i5-2500K . The K indicates an unlocked CPU , which allows for overclocking . The K version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For our Lottery Winner Special ( LWS ) system , were going with a top of the range i7-2600K , which despite being super fast , does not carry the usual super premium . <p> * Motherboard : Since Sandy Bridge uses a new socket type , well also need a new motherboard . And the best ones to go with SB utilize the Z68 chipset , which has only recently been released , but it allows you to get the best out of SB thanks to the support of hybrid graphics , SSD caching and overclocking of K branded CPUs . As for brand and model , were going with the ASUS P8Z68-V PRO , which has received good reviews recently . <p> * RAM : Our last general purpose system had 4GB of RAM . This time , were going with 8GB . It wo n't give you any performance gains , not much anyway , but with the low price of RAM these days , the real question is " why not ? " For our LWS syetem , were going to cram in 16GB of RAM just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radeon range has dominated the GPU market for quite a while now , and the last couple editions of this feature have all relied on this particular range of GPUs . However , with the release of Nvidias Fermi , the momentum has shifted somewhat back towards Nvidia . So this time , were going an Nvidia GTX-570 . For our LWS , were opting for the fastest single card GPU solution available , which is currently the Radeon HD 6990 , a dual-GPU solution . Then were going to put two of these in CrossFire config , for a total of 4 physical GPUs and 8GB of video RAM . Awesome . <p> * SSD : Thanks to the Z68s SSD caching feature , adding an SSD will increase disk performance dramatically . Unlike having a dedicated SSD boot drive , which means an expensive investment in a large SSD drive , caching allows us to use a smaller , cheaper SSD drive , and still benefit from the speed boost offered by SSDs , with transparent background caching . Think of it like a stepping stone between your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super fast RAM . For our LWS system , were still going with a large SSD as our boot drive for maximum performance . <p> So yeah , this system is $400 more expensive than our last general purposes system , but you 're paying for the latest CPU and chispet , which in the past , would have carried a lot more than a $400 premium ( plus we 've also included a SSD caching drive , along with double the RAM , an upgrade to a Blu-ray burner drive and up to 4TB of storage ) . <p> Just for the fun of it , here 's specs for a monster system where price is n't an issue . What I call the " Lottery Winner Special " . The total price of such a system , despite being upgraded with the latest second generation Core processor , plus a bigger SSD , more RAM , a huge 30 ? monitor , and the aforementioned dual monter graphics cards , ends up being about $1000 less than last years LWS system . The savings mainly come from the top of the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the home theater system , well need a Mini ITX form factor machine that 's capable of playing and burning Blu-ray , and that 's pretty much it . With such basic demands , we could have really just stuck with the specs of last years system , but let 's see what we can do with a Sandy Bridge CPU . <p> * CPU : Were going with an i3-2120 , as its overkill to go with anything faster for an HTPC system . <p> * Motherboard : I would like to stick with the Z68 chipset , but since its pretty new , the Mini ITX motherboard we need is actually not yet available . The alternative would be to go for a H67 Mini ITX motherboard , and these are more plentiful . Get one with built-in Wi-Fi for extra convenience . <p> So basically , you 're looking at an HTPC that 's similar in pricing to last years , but with the latest Intel CPU . The built-in Intel HD 2000 may not be much , but its good enough for Blu-ray and even 3D Blu-ray , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so this concludes another edition of " If I were to buy a new computer today " . Hopefully , I will have another edition of this feature ready for you when AMDs Bulldozer CPUs are out .

I always work with cells for animated menus , which I learned on the Internet . <p> I am recently using the PgcEdit and thanks to this program , I could create a resume in a movie by some POST they recommended me . <p> Well , for now I would no longer work with cells , otherwise work with two VTS ( VTS ROOT and VTS NORMAL ) that are linked , and for that , the structure is performed by in DVDlab PRO in the first image ( 01 Structure DVD.jpg ) . <p> In the second image , a wide shot , in the part of VTS ROOT linked to the VTS NORMAL ( 02 Connection -2 VTS ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal as the third image ( 03 Ojects ROOT.jpg and 04 in VTS in the VTS Ojects OPTIONAL.jpg ) is shown . <p> Looking in some post , I have not found information on how to pair the two VTS and I was trying to make connections and code entries to VMCOMMAND , but at the end only the Menu button worked me well with the jump to the other VTS , in contrast with the Title button to that function was not only repeated in the first VTS that would be the VTS ROOT , no navigation buttons were synchronized since supposedly if I give the right navigation button on the VTS ROOT , this automatically when enters the VTS NORMAL , should remain in the same position as the ROOT VTS , which it dose n't , but returns to its position where it was when it first enters the VTS ROOT . <p> I was told that the PgcEdit , you can make it work well with the Title button as also synchronizing the navigation buttons , and i do not know how it is done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be nice to help me because I am a novice , I 'm just learning . And the way to help me , is performing as a guide or tutorial . <p> Well , indeed , your English is not easy to understand . In fact , I understand nothing . <p> I do n't understand what are the " two VTS " you are referencing . In the first image , I see only a single VTS , with the main movie . I do n't understand either why you need two identical menus ( called MAIN and OPTIONAL ) . If they are identical , you should need only the main menu . Duplicating the menu makes things more complex , probably without reason . <p> And furthermore , I do n't understand what you want to do . <p> If I understand correctly the first image , the Title and Root menu buttons do exactly the same thing : They call the main menu . Do you want something else ? <p> What is your language ? Do you speak French ? If yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate for the other users , or send me a PM . Anyway , sorry , but currently , with the information above , I ca n't help . <p> I want to synchronize VTS ROOT with VTS NORMAL , as if it were a general main menu <p> Hello friend , as I said not much English , and I am Latin Spanish ( South America ) , and a little fight back , and yes , it 's terrible my translation , but if you know the Spanish or have Spanish speaking friends , you 'll understand what you I say . So I 'm trying to translate some for you to understand me . <p> Well , under this message ( in English ) , I leave in Spanish after the end of this message for you to translate , as it is the same . <p> OK aside , to summarize all this , I just want to create a main menu like the original DVD 's of Transformers 4 Passion of Christ and others as they come that kind of structure . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LU 1 peers ( except the serial number ) which are the 3b. , 3b. or 2b. , 2b. 5b. , 5b. , etc . And it is supposed to have been divided into two VTS ( one is the VTS ROOT and the other would be the VTS connected or related to ROOT ) , but they are well synchronized with the navigation buttons , like the " TITLE " button and " MENU " button to jump first in the ROOT VTS and then in the VTS which is connected to ROOT without errors jump back to VTS ROOT . <p> Well , I hope that with this you can translate multiple languages , and at last I can make a guide to what I 'm saying . Rather apologies for the translation . Sorry and Thanx <p> I do n't understand much . I have only very basic knowledge of Spanish , sorry . <p> If I understand correctly , in the DVDs you have given as models of what you want to do ( Transformers 4 and Passion of Christ ) , you see two LUs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LU 2 ) . Correct ? <p> " LU " means " Language Unit " , and unless you want to create the same set of menu several times in different languages , you do n't need several LUs . Anyway , only one LU can be played . The DVD player selects automatically the LU to play according to your preferred menu language . ( In PgcEdit , you can change your preferred menu language with Trace -&gt; Virtual Player Setup . In a real DVD player , it 's a setting that can usually be changed with the player 's menu . ) The preferred menu language is stored in SPRM(0) when a DVD is inserted . Later , the player uses that value to select the menu ( or , more precisely , the LU ) translated in your preferred language automatically . <p> For example , let 's say you have configured Spanish as your preferred menu language . If a DVD has 2 LUs , LU 1 in English ( language code " en " ) and the second LU is in Spanish ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a VM command or a menu button of the remote ) , the player will automatically jump to the second LU , in Spanish . <p> In the other hand , if the player has for example only a LU in English and another one in French , but no LU in Spanish , the player will select the first LU , or the first LU without language code . <p> Of course , when there is only one LU in the VTSM , it will be played anyway , regardless of its language code . <p> Anyway , there is no need to create several LUs if you do not want to create a DVD with the same menu in different languages . As far as I know , all authoring programs for casual users like DVD-Lab pro can only create a single LU , because there is no need for several menu languages . <p> If you want a multi-language menu anyway , you can do that with several LUs , but I suppose you will need to use a professional authoring program . And PgcEdit can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is also possible to create a single LU , but with different PGCs for the different languages , and then use the VM commands to examine the content of SPRM(0) and jump to the correct PGC . But that will require to edit many commands , and it 's complicated . Therefore , I do not recommend to try to create several LUs . It 's very complicated , for a very little benefit . <p> Have I replied to your question ? If I have not understood what you want , try to post images or text dumps from PgcEdit to explain what you want with examples .

@@98121399 @2321399/ <p> So you 're thirsty for more , eh ! Okay , there are a few more advance ways to make selections . The first is probably the most powerful way to select parts of an image and I probably use this method more than any other . It will give you absolute perfect control when it comes to selecting most natural objects . The option I am speaking about is quick mask mode - and you 're gon na love it baby ! <p> Let 's take our rubber ducky picture once more since its a nice crisp picture to work with . Then make any kind of selection you like in the middle of it , I 've used the lasso tool to quickly draw a circle like this : <p> Now we have to go into quick mask mode ! To do that we use the mask on and mask off buttons here : <p> When we click the mask on button the following picture will appear : <p> What has happened ? Photoshop has turned your normal selection into a kind of red masking paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular whole cut out of it . If you would like to go back to our first selection just hit the mask off button again . Feel free to switch between the two as you see fit . <p> So what 's so special about mask mode ? While you are in mask mode you can not actually paint on your picture ( though it looks like you can ) . Instead , when you paint it will change the shape of the mask . Try it , use the brush tool to draw a line across the middle of the ducks head , like this : <p> Now press the Mask Off button again and you will be presented with the following selection : <p> Bingo ! That 's really all quick mask mode does ! It allows you to paint the shape of your selections . Once you have painted the shape you need , you can just come out of quick mask mode and use that selection as if you had drawn them with the lasso tool ! <p> By default photoshop only shows black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because you are NOT painting over your picture . You are merely painting the shape of your new mask . Its a little bit like using that latex masking fluid artists use ; they paint it on their work to mask out certain areas and then peel it off after . <p> To paint more red masking over your painting choose black . To rub out the red mask choose white . To quickly switch quickly between white and black just press the switch colours icon as shown in the picture below : <p> TIP : In quick mask mode Photoshop will usually show the masking paper as red by default . But if you double-click on the Mask On button it will ask what colour you 'd like to have it and also how transparent you 'd like the paper . This is useful if you were editing something red like a rose because it would be hard to see . I suggest you keep the masking paper transparent enough to see the picture easily because this makes positioning better . <p> This Quick Mask mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it let 's you spend time literally drawing the perfect selection . You can change the size of your brushes and use all the shaping tools available in Photoshop . It really is the best and quickest way to select almost any complex object . <p> MAGIC WAND TOOL <p> The magic wand tool is yet another useful way of selecting areas of a picture , but why is it magic ? Well , let 's show how it works on our duck picture again . Choose the magic wand icon from the toolbox : <p> Now without messing with any settings just click the wand in the middle of the ducks mouth . You will probably get an effect like this : <p> The magic wand tool tries to select a single colour for you , but since most modern photos have millions of colours in them , and that even a single block of near pure colour ( like the ducks beak ) would contain hundreds of shades of red , the only way the magic wand can select this colour is to select a large groups of colours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim was to select just the red beak of the duck with one click we would have failed . So what do we do ? Well , look up to the options tool bar and you will notice that the magic wand tool has a special option called Tolerance . <p> Increasing the tolerance number will make the magic wand less picky . In other words with a high tolerance it will select colours that are less similar than each other . If you lower the tolerance then it will only choose colours that are more similar to each other . If we want to choose the whole of the ducks beak then we must turn the tolerance up a bit . In this case I have turned it up to 60 . <p> Notice that almost all of the ducks beak has been selected except the brightest white highlights . Using a lower number would no doubt leave the less bright highlights alone too . <p> There is usually more than one way to do something like this . For example , you could try leaving the tolerance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beak . To do this click in one place of the beak , then hold down the Shift key like we did to add selections in the previous article . Then click on another part of the beak that has n't yet been selected . Most of the time this method works very well . <p> Yet another method that is almost the same is to use the Grow command . Go to : Select &gt; Grow . This command automatically looks for similar colours near to the selection you already have . <p> Select Similar <p> Before we leave this subject , this looks like the best place to tell you about the Select &gt; Similar option . Let 's say we had two or more ducks in our picture instead of one . Maybe we would like to select the beak of every duck at the same time . All we do is select one ducks beak with the magic wand tool and then choose Select &gt; Similar . Photoshop will then select any colour that falls into the same range as the original ducks beak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option all that useful , but I 'm sure one day I will =o ) . <p> More Magic Wand Tricks <p> One last trick we can do with the magic wand is to take away from a selection we made . For example , let 's say we wanted to grab just the middle yellow balloon and make copies of it . <p> It would take quite some time to select the balloon with the lasso tool . It could n't be captured with the magic wand tool alone because its multicolored . You could n't easily select just the sky with the magic wand because of the other baloons in the way . If you could just select the sky you may be able to then choose Select &gt; Inverse . This would work on our duck picture because it is alone on a white background ! <p> So what do we do ? First we select the balloon with the normal rectangular marquee as shown in the above picture . Then we select the magic want tool and leave it at its default setting of 32 ( you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hold down the Alt key on your keyboard and click the sky area inside the rectangular marquee box . <p> Bingo ! As you probably recall from my first selection article holding down the Alt key subtracts from a selection . In this case the magic wand tool subtracted the blue sky around the balloon Try it yourself , its a very useful method . <p> Now if you wanted to copy and paste this balloon all over the place all you need do is go to Edit &gt; Copy and then Edit &gt; Paste . <p> Photoshop automatically pastes every new image in the exact same position you cut it from so you may not see it at first . So use the move tool ( encircled below ) to reposition the newly pasted image . <p> Note : Photoshop automatically pastes every new image on a new layer . This means if you paste more than one you will need to select that layer to move it . This is not important for now but all this will be explained in my tutorial on layers .

Say ' yes ' to the message on screen and voil+ - new super-size hard-drive . ( Go to Settings , System Settings , System Information to check ) . <p> 8 . Share your bought downloads <p> You can download anything you 've bought from the store to five PlayStation 3s . This is useful if you 've got more than one PS3 ( of course ) and also if you 've wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download twice ... <p> However , you can also choose to share your download with your mates . The PlayStation Store logs how many times each download has been downloaded by each user . On your mate 's PS3 Create New User and log onto the store with your I 'd . You 'll now be able to go to your download and see that you 've already downloaded whatever it was that you paid for . You can now download it again , using another of your downloads and giving it to your mate for free . Or a small optional charge ... <p> 9 . Force a PS3 to show your files <p> Put your photos in a folder called ' PICTURE ' or your videos in a folder called ' VIDEO ' or simply *force* your PS3 to look at your files on your stick regardless of what you called them or where you put them . Insert your stick and go to the menu option you want ( Photos , Music , whatever ) . Press triangle to bring up a menu and choose Display All . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It even works for a plugged-in iPod , though the multi-folder structure you 'll reveal is a bit baffling . Still , your songs are in there if you 've got the patience to find them . <p> 10 . Change your album art <p> When you import a music CD your PS3 automatically pulls down the album art and stores it with the tracks . Occasionally it gets it wrong , however , or it may simply not be able to find the art of your hipper , less commercial tracks . This is easily fixed however . <p> Download a pic of the art you need as a jpg on your PC and put it onto a stick ( in a folder called PICTURE , ideally ) . Copy it to your Photo menu ( press Triangle ) . Now go to Music and select the album folder with the offending art . Press Triangle and select Information . Go to the Photo menu and select your new picture . Bingo . <p> 11 . Save files from the web <p> Copying videos , music and photos is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ console " you can also save files directly from the web . See a link to an MP3 you fancy ? Simply click on the link with the X button and the PS3 will automatically offer to save it directly into your Music folder , ready to be played at any time . <p> It 's the same story with videos " so long as the PS3 recognizes the format , such as AVI or MP4 it will give you the option to save it directly to the video folder . For images , hover the pointer over a picture , press the Triangle button and select File , then Save Image and you 'll have the option to save out to the photo folder . <p> 12 . Visualizations <p> One of the PS3 's most impressive in-built features is missed by many people . The Gaia visualization is an option when playing music , and is a high definition 3D representation of the Earth , based on NASA 's stunning Blue Marble photography . <p> Simply hit the Square button while playing an MP3 or CD to flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaia is best suited to dreamy ambient tunes rather than pumping dance or heavy rock . <p> 13 . Turn DVDs into HD <p> Another fact that many PS3 owners miss is that their sleek black console is actually one of the finest DVD players on the market . In this era of high definition content , DVDs can look awful when they 're splashed across a large LCD or plasma screen , but the PS3 has the processing grunt to polish them up to near HD quality . <p> While watching a DVD through an HD display , press the Triangle button and choose the AV Settings button , you will then see options for frame , block and mosquito noise reduction , and also an option to perform a full upscale on DVD content . <p> Video saved to storage can also be run with frame and block noise reduction by tweaking the same menu options . <p> 14 . Set up a media server <p> If you have a computer loaded up with music , photos and video , but do n't fancy holding duplicates on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game installs , there 's a solution . Set up media streaming across your network . <p> What you need on your computer is software that has DNLA server capabilities such as Windows Media Player 11 or Tversity ( www.tversity.com ) . On your computer , set the software up to share the music , video and photo folders , then on the PS3 , select the Search for Media Servers option under any of the Photo , Music or Video columns on the XMB . <p> You should see a new option on your XMB any time your computer is switched on , which acts as the gateway to streaming your media . <p> 15 . Use other webcams <p> You may assume that the only webcam compatible with the PS3 's video chatting capabilities is Sony 's Playstation Eye . In fact , most standard PC/Mac webcams are supported , and many camera enabled games , such as Rainbow Six Vegas 2 , offer similar levels of compatibility . <p> You can even use the Xbox Live Vision camera from Microsoft 's rival Xbox 360 console if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a microphone , that 'll appear as a voice input device for chatting as well . <p> 16 . Playstation store on PC <p> Sometimes it 's simply not convenient to download items on the PS3 particularly when downloads might be interrupted by an online gaming session or video chat . <p> These days , though , the PlayStation store is available on your PC or Mac and you 're likely to find the interface and thumbnails load more quickly on your PC as well . <p> You sign in using your existing PSN account and can copy downloaded items using removable storage such as a USB drive or an SD card to transfer to your console . <p> 17 . Turn your PS3 into a PC <p> It 's actually quite easy to turn your PS3 into a fully fledged PC , which is great for adding media and productivity flexibility to the piano black box beneath your TV . If you dig into the Settings , then System Settings menu you 'll find an option to Install Other OS . <p> You 'll need to back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to a USB device , but then by following some simple instructions you can download a copy of the operating system , burn it to a CD or DVD and then install it to your console 's hard drive . <p> 18 . Access instant messaging <p> If you 're a slave to Windows Live Messenger when you 're online , but fancy browsing from the comfort of your sofa and television , Microsoft has a low profile version of Messenger available that is perfect for keeping in one of the PS3 browser 's six available tabs as you trawl the web . <p> Simply head to http : //mobile.live.com and select the Messenger option , then sign in as normal . Unfortunately , as yet there is no way to access Yahoo or AOL instant messaging networks via the PS3 's browser . <p> 19 . Transfer classic PS1 games to PSP <p> You may have noticed that classic Playstation games such as Command and Conquer and Wipeout have begun appearing on the PS Store and that they can be saved to the PS3 's hard drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have a large enough Memory Stick Pro Duo in your handheld , your purchase also gives you the right to transfer the game to a PSP registered with your PS3 . <p> This means you can genuinely play the game either at home or away without needing internet access for Remote Play . Simply find the PS1 game in the game column of the XMB and press Triangle . You 'll see the option to Copy , simply click it , connect your PSP via USB , then follow the on screen instructions . <p> 20 . Use PC peripherals <p> Browsing the internet on a console can be a drag , particularly if you 're lumped with using a control pad and the on screen keyboard to fill in online forms or hammer out emails . <p> Fortunately , the PS3 actually supports standard keyboards and mice , which work brilliantly with the PS3 's in-built browser and even some games , such as Unreal Tournament 3 . Sony 's system will even allow you to pair up Bluetooth keyboards and mice . <p> If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports ( or a USB hub connected to the PS3 if you 're short on free ports ) . If you 're using Bluetooth peripherals head to the Settings column , then select Accessory Settings and then Manage Bluetooth Devices and follow the on screen instructions to pair the keyboard and mouse to your console . <p> 21 ) Customizing your PS3 <p> Try Googling ' PS3 . p3t theme ' to find downloadable examples of PS3 's new Themes - the alternative desktops , menus and fonts for your PS3 that have been enabled since the recent 2.0 firmware update . Read on through this article for our tips on how to transfer them to your PS3 . You can even make your own Themes . All you 'll need is Sony 's PC-only design software , which is available for free here . <p> 22 . Make thousands of new PS3 Friends <p> Taken a shine to someone you 've played against online ? They 'll be in your Players Met menu . Or if you just want to make loads of new friends fast , then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and try . <p> Whatever format you want to access , the trick is to put your files in the right place so that your PS3 can actually see them . <p> Take any removable media - be it a USB stick , Memory Card or CD-R with files on it - and lace music , pictures and videos in folders called ' MUSIC ' , ' PICTURE ' and ' VIDEO ' in the root directory of the storage device . The caps are important . The quote marks are n't . <p> More PS3-based files need to be in a folder called ' PS3 ' in the root directory of the storage device.Then , inside this folder make sub-folders called ' EXPORT ' ( this is the folder to put PS1 and PS2 game saves in that you find on the net ) , ' SAVEDATA ' ( for your PS3 game saves ) , ' THEME ' ( for Themes ) and ' UPDATE ' ( see tip 8 . <p> 23 . Boost your WiFi <p> Slow downloads and dodgy PS3 connections ? Try this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking 101 . Try getting a direct ' line of sight ' between your wireless router and your PS3 . Pull them out both out from alcoves and behind dense furniture and try to minimize the number of obstacles between both boxes . ( Nothing degrades your Wi-Fi signal like a nice stone fireplace .... ) <p> Next , stand your PS3 on its on end . The PS3 's antenna is located in the right hand side so standing it up on its left-edge gives it a bigger spread . Ideally put your router up on a high shelf . <p> Finally -and this is the clever bit - take a Coke can ( other soft drinks are available ) and cut the top off . Cut down the sides of the cup-like can and fan out the divisions slightly so it looks like a weird metal flower . Now make a hole in the bottom and place your new ' high-gain antenna ' over your router 's stubby aerial so it pokes through . Now point it at your PS3 . Sounds mad , looks awful , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 25 . PSP and PS3 Remote Play <p> One of the best features of the new firmware is the ability to turn your PS3 on and off remotely , via the internet , with your PSP.Sounds like a tiny detail , but it finally opens up Sony 's Remote Play feature-fully . <p> First get yourself a PSP . Go into the System option , select Remote Play and pair your PSP with your PS3 . This used to be a slightly complex process but now it 's a cinch . Once both devices are paired together they 'll ' look ' for each other automatically . <p> Leave your PS3 on standby and just go on holiday - taking your PSP with you . Find a Wi-Wi-Fi hotspot near the beach . Connect your PSP to your PS3 using the Remote Play option . Your PS3 will switch on and its menu will appear on your PSP 's screen . You can now listen to your music , look at photos or watch any videos stored on your PS3 's hard disk . When you 're done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 26 . Play PS3 games remotely on your PSP <p> OK , so your PSP has n't got any ' tilting ' capability like the Sixaxis and Lair is pretty much unplayable on the PSP . But , in tech terms at least , it 's a great indicator of the possibilities on the way . Engage Lair 's Wireless Play option and you can wirelessly link your PSP to your PS3 and play ( a cut down , worse looking version of ) the PS3 game on your PSP . <p> 27 . Those secret button features <p> PS3 not behaving itself ? Then give it a prod . The most common causes of PS3 crashes are during PS2 play.Or your PS3 might hang while waiting for a network disconnection to be resolved . In either scenario press and hold the power button for five seconds to force a system shutdown . <p> Finally , have you ever been caught out moving your PS3 from an HDMI TV to the one in the bedroom , only to find that you 're not getting any SCART output when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your PS3 as normal but keep your finger on the Power button . You 'll get the first beep , as normal , then about eight seconds later a second beep and your PS3 will restart - this time defaulting to the most basic , lo-res , SCART friendly TV output . <p> 28 . Do your system updates at work <p> With system updates clocking in around the 200MB mark ( and set to get bigger ) it can be a pain to have to download updates when you 're stealing a quick five minutes for a game . Instead , download the updates at work and take them home on a USB stick or CD for instant installation on your PS3 . <p> Make a folder called ' PS3 ' on your disc/stick and inside that one called ' UPDATE ' ( see tip 3 ) . Go to http : **37;790;TOOLONG and find the System Software Updates box . Download the latest update and put it in your ' UPDATE'folder . When you get home choose to update your PS3 from whatever storage medium you 've chosen instead of via the internet.

@@98121410 @2321410/ <p> I heard the best way of cleaning vcr heads without open it , is to use a head cleaner tape and then run a new tape all the way but I do n't know if that works well . I cleaned my ag-1980 twice yesterday when I got it . On the first pass it the frames looked better but then I decided to re-clean it and I do n't know if the dots where there before but there are white dots appearing in the frames at ramdom could it be the head was old anyway ? please advice what to do I want to change heads if needed to make my ag new again ... <p> PS ! How do I use my AG-1980 as a TBC for my SLV-R1000 it 'll be like combining the best of both worlds if I 'm successful ... front inputs on the AG did n't work ... the image still unstabilized ! <p> I can tell you this .. if you have n't cleaned them in a while those cleaners can cause more harm than good . I found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a chance you 'll get one that 's been around the block a few too many times and leaves an oxide mess on your VCR 's tape heads . The result is a snowy picture or--if your VCR has a video-mute feature--a plain blue screen , which is less interesting than at least half the shows on TV . Instructions STEP 1 : Play a new blank tape in your VCR . Most of the time this works to clean the heads and keep them from flaking additional oxide . STEP 2 : After an hour , remove the clean tape and try the VCR . STEP 3 : If the heads still are n't clean , try using a special head-cleaning tape ( available at electronics stores ) . Buy one that uses a cleaning fluid ; dry cleansers are more likely to damage the VCR heads . STEP 4 : To keep your heads clean longer , check rental tapes for obvious signs of damage before putting them in your VCR , and fast-forward past the first few minutes of any rental tape , which is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warnings : Fast-forward and rewind your own tapes every two years to prevent sticking and potential flaking of oxide . <p> and one more : Here 's How : Eject any tape from the VCR and unplug it from wall current . Unplug any other cables from VCR ( Cable , Antenna , Audio/Video Cables , etc .. ) . Place VCR on flat surface , such as a table covered with newspaper or cloth to protect table surface . With the appropriate screwdriver , remove VCR cover carefully . You will see a shiny round drum--this is the Head Drum . Take an isopropyl alcohol-dipped chamois tipped cleaning stick and place it on the Head Drum with light pressure . Manually rotate Head Drum with your free hand ( it spins freely ) , keeping chamois stick stationary , allowing fluid to clean the drum ( Never move the chamois stick in the vertical direction-you may snap off Head protrusions on the drum ) . With fresh chamois tips and alcohol , now clean the Stationary audio head , capstans , rollers , and gears . Check for dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Belts and Pulleys using fresh chamois tips , once again , do not use excessive fluid . Clean dust off Circuit Boards using a mini-vacuum cleaner and/or compressed air ( Use just enough force to remove the dust and dirt ) . Let machine site a few minutes after finishing above process . With the VCR still open , plug into wall and TV , turn on VCR and insert a recorded tape . ( Do not touch any of the interior workings of the VCR or interior metal cabinet during this process ) . Press Play on VCR and confirm that everything is functioning correctly and picture and sound is restored . Repeat steps 1-10 if results are not satisfactory . Eject tape , Unplug VCR from wall , uplug all cables . Screw VCR cover back on and place back in original location with proper hookups .

Can I just use mere cotton buds ? Is it a good idea to clean 3 or 4 times the heads with the tape cleaner or just 1 is enough before I change tactics ... <p> Well I would NOT use cotton buds for sure ! The fibers are loose and WILL cling to almost anything they touch . Why I am NOT reccomending you do so I have taken the Q-Tips and made sure they were wound tightly after I dip them in the alcohol to keep that from happening . Also .. Radio Shack use to sell Q-Tips that had a small sponge end on them and they were longer so you could reach back and all the parts the tape follows .

Also if you notice the " problem " places on the movie again and again in the same places it MAY not be the machine . <p> Also you GOT ME THINKING today .. it may be time to clean MY HEADS also and I found this that reaffirms what I said earlier:I have used wet type cleaning kits but I have heard that both wet and dry are not very good . New VHS tapes ( unrecorded ) are apparently the best way to clean your VCR . Just run the tape from beginning to end and it will clean it . Apparently though the absolute best way is to open the VCR and do it manually but I am not brave enough to do that on an expensive VCR .

Quite often a broadcast stations news department will have a rejuvination machine for their news tapes so they can re-cycle them instead of replacing them , which replacing tapes can get quite expensive . <p> @RFBurns I have a kinyo 2 way rewinder + tape cleaner machine cost me 27$ Do I really need 100+ $ to clean my tapes ? Oh ! should I clean my tape during rewind or during forwaing ? I usally do it during forwaing so rewinding does not affect tensions on the tape ... Am I right ? <p> PS ! are you 100% sure the little white dots are cause of the TAPE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit to one that is 100$ . I would bet that the 100$ unit has something in it that the 27$ does n't  that effectively cleans tapes . Inside the more expensive units are elements that one would think would scrape the magnetic coating off the tape and ruin it . Not so . The key element in some of the more expensive ones is a quartz crystal that is ground on one edge in such a way that it does not scrape the magnetic surface away at all . It does scrape away any accumilated dust particles and other stuff that should not be on the surface of the tape . <p> You see , when dust begins to accumilate , the biggest enemy to us with tons of old tapes lying around is " moisture " . Any moisture at all will make the dust stick to the tape like glue . Plus any accumilated tape particles on the player 's guide posts and pinch roller can also adhere to the tape surface along with whatever already accumilated before . When the tapes sit for a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the case , the tension of the wound tape on the hub itself acts like a bench press , pressing and pressing the particles even harder onto the surface as the tape sits . With this kind of build up , a soft brush or soft foamy thing in the cheap cleaner will not remove the build up at all , if anything it will simply scatter or smear the build up like a paint brush spreading paint . <p> Thus what is needed here is a cleaner that can safely scrape away the buildup while leaving the magnetic surface intact . That 's why soem of those cleaner/rejuvinators are very expensive , but let me tell you from first hand experience .... they are definately well worth and more the money spent . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by Carlos Menem <p> Oh ! should I clean my tape during rewind or during forwaing ? I usally do it during forwaing so rewinding does not affect tensions on the tape ... Am I right ? <p> Well what direction does the tape move to play/record ? Imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its like shaving , you want to shave with the grain , not against it . Thus cleaning during forward is the best way to prevent excessive cleaning and removing magnetic particles or removing a chunk of accumilated stuff that just might also take along a piece of magnetic surface with it ! ! ! So yes you are right to clean as it forwards . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by Carlos Menem <p> PS ! are you 100% sure the little white dots are cause of the TAPE and not the heads drums etc ? <p> Yes . There is only one other cause to the little white dots , actually two . One would be worn heads within the drum . The head elements can wear down due to tapes that have build up of junk going across them . You see the heads surfaces are machined so that they are very smooth . Imagine getting dirt or sand in your engine oil and what that would do to the machined bearings and cylinder walls and piston rings ! Well that 's what junk stuck on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine finish and makes them chop at the tape as the tape passes over them , and that in turn causes clogged heads and chewed up magnetic surfaces which in turn causes drop outs and ruins the whole day . <p> The second cause to the white sparklies is loss of ground in or around the ribbon cable that leads from the pickup coils below the head drum to the pre-amps . Some head assemblies use direct solder connection to the board where the head amps are , but those can loose grounding as well . If this is the culprit , it is the drum motor noise that is being picked up and induced inductively into the signal path , and we get the white sparklies in the picture . <p> The second scenario would only occur if the machine had a gazillion hours use on it with never having been to a service shop for a little bit of maintenance . Just like a car engine , you do the maintenance , the engine will last and be dependable when you need it . If you neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise on the day you need it most ! Same with a vcr . Keep it clean , run good tapes through it , have it maintenanced properly on a regular time schedule and it will perform when you need it . <p> Actually thinking about what you said ... would n't be better cleaning while rewinding it seems to me like cleaning while FF will be passing over the dust instead of against it ... ? I 'm confuse now . Can anyone else confirm ... <p> In any case the dots are not there anymore I pass it a few times over my 27$ rewinder&amp;cleaner and they were gone . <p> @RFBurns Do you know if Ethanol is better then Isopropyl 99% medical grade ? Is this guy doing a good LONG ... section : Cleaning Video Heads - Video Head Clogs - Head Clogging === -I read my AG is n't really full frame but -full field or full line- ... a guy from doom9 -chipzoller- said to me the AG is better since it has TBC build into the machine ... so is a vcr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it does n't matter ... -will using my AG-1980 with tbc + datavideo 1000 produce better results because there is 2 tbcs at work or not neceseraly. -I heard slv-r1000 has better picture then ag-1980 is it true and will it be best to use the datavideo with the slv instead because of the quality ... -How about this for the cleaning LONG ... <p> The more and more I read from you , the more and more I learn . Thank you . <p> Regards <p> You bet blu ! <p> Carlos , the reason why I prefer to clean tapes in the forward direction is to prevent large chunks of junk being removed from the tape , which if that happens it is possible that a chunk of magnetic surface will come up right along with the garbage we want to remove . It really does n't  matter , forward or reverse , but I prefer to have the machine clean them in the forward direction to prevent the " chunk-dump " from occuring . <p> As to head cleaner , ethanol is just as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff evaporates and does not linger its good . <p> The TBC thing , yes the AG unit is a good unit if you do n't  need the corrected signal at the output . <p> @RFBurns at first you said the forward direction was preferable because that 's where the dust will pick up the better now you say is for security not necesseraly better rubber . -what about this for chamois pads ?

Well , , I tried using that option but the decrypted DVD would n't open in Shrink and could n't process properly with VOBblanker , which in my test case makes it non-workable solution . <p> Okay the first step would be decrypt the DVD using DVD decrypter in File mode to your HDD . Check if your DVD does contain multi-angle in the VOB 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case " VTS05 " or VTS05*.Vob " <p> Once we are sure let 's GO ...... <p> Open the decrypted titleset ( the one we need to correct ) using IFOedit <p> Click the VOBextras button ( at bottom ) <p> Make the settings exactly like below .......... change destination directory ........... and select the angles you want to retain . <p> Click on " OK " <p> Accept the selection prompted by IFOedit for Streams ( dont change it , yourself ) .... click on " Strip " <p> Go make some coffee and invite me <p> Once finished , <p> You will only have the IFO , BUP and VOB 's in the destination directory which have been stripped of its angles now . <p> Copy the rest of the files from the original decrypted folder to this IFOEdit destination folder ........... <p> OR <p> a ) Notedown the filenames from the IFOedit destination folder . b ) Goto the original ripped folder and cut the files as noted in step a ) to a backup folder.b ) Copy the files from the IFOEdit destination folder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this folder using Vobblanker you will still see the warning messages but if you check the size of the PGC , it will be less than original ( which means the angles are removed now ) . <p> Use VOBBlanker and Menushrink as you would normally to reduce size of the DVD . ( See my earlier Simplistic Series guide here&lt;HTTP=HTTP : showthread.php ? t= " 57278 " **41;829;TOOLONG ) <p> Hmmm ... I backed up an multi-angle DVD with DVDDecryptor not looking to see if the DVD was multi-angle or not . A lesson learned . <p> So now I have the entire DVD copied on my hard drive . Naturally , when I tried to use VOBblanker , I was alerted that it was skipping the multi-angle files .

I would really appreciate it if anybody could help me with this ... <p> I have burnt a DL DVD+R disc with Nero and I was n't able to choose myself where to place the layer break . To create the project I have used TMPEG DVD Author because it 's the only software I know that uses VOB files without re-transcoding them ( that is very useful when you have a slow PC but a good stand-alone DVD-recorder that does the realtime coding for you ! ) . Anyhow , I was a bit upset that I could n't decide myself where to place the layer break and I hope I was lucky enough to have it in a friendly part of the movie ! All I want to do now is to check with a stand-alone DVD Player if playback stucks or not when the layer change occurs . Is there a way to see on which scene I have the break without watching the entire film again ? I can not divide the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles with different bitrates so half of the data ( it seems Nero burns approx the same amount of data on both layers ) would not equal to half of the total movie lenght . Thanks , Marcello . <p> This software will accpet your VOB 's IFO 's and BUP 's . Then it is possible to use it to burn a DL DVD using DVD Decrypter . When you click on Burn it was ask where you want the layer change and give suitable places . <p> Also , when you load the files . Look for the title you want to find the layer change for and double click on it ( Title 1 should be it ) . It will show the chapters and the layer change will be ticked next to the chapter . <p> Have a look at this screenshot I have done . It shows the layer change at chapter 6 , cell 7 for Title 1 ( a chapter is made of small cells ) . <p> Hi thanks for the help ! ! ! ! Surely I will read it carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already burnt ? Is there a way to check where the layer break is ? <p> You can use do it as above using the same technique . You can read the DVD inside PGcedit but it will error . Ignore it and it will just carry on . It is trying to put a Pgcedit backup folder but ca n't as it is read only . As you just need to read the disc it does n't matter . Otherwise , just copy the files onto the hard disk first . Then load into the software <p> Quote : <p> Also if TMPEG DVD Author 1.6 burns DL , will it let you decide where to insert the layer break ? <p> I admit I have n't done it . There is a setting in the Evionmental Settings preferences to switch between single layer and double layer capacities . I expect it does its own layer change like Nero . <p> If you want to specify your own one then Pgcedit with DVD Decrypter is the best ( and only way at the moment afaik ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I have a standalone Sony DVD Player and you were perfectly right it shows me where the layer change is ! ! ! ! I was amazed though that you can not notice it during playback . There are no pauses . The funny thing is that if I put a commercial DVD it will pause when switching to the second layer .... so does it mean that Nero is better than commercial pressing of DVD 's ? ? ? <p> When you play a backup . Shrink takes out the layer change pause . The pause is needed for the laser to be refocused to the second layer . As a DVD-R/+R is single layer the pause is not needed . A DL+R or DL-R needs a layer change so you will get a pause all the time . You may find that a layer change on a DL media is slightly longer than a commercial DVD . <p> Any DVD player with a DVD ROM drive ( usually cheap ones ) have a buffer so no layer change is noticed . Sony use their own drives or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the drives are better quality most of the time compared to a cheap DVD ROM drive . <p> There is an option in the preferences in Shrink to remove or keep the layer change .

Very long time ago , before I even started pulling this stunt , I read that using sticky CD/DVD labels can screw up your CD/DVD player cuz the laser will not be reflected back properly ( sorry if I 'm missing the tech part ) with that label on . So it is evident that something of that sort happened to me this afternoon . After doing a li'l R&amp;D I found that there are some label makers that gaurantee of hazzle freeness ! ! !

A couple of months ago , I started collecting and posting weekly Blu-ray and DVD sales figures published in Home Media Magazine , and provided by Nielsen VideoScan , which looks at many retail outlets and provides sales the figures . <p> There 's a lot of misinformation when it comes to Blu-ray sales figures , mostly due to PR and marketing people doing their job . But these sales stats should provide a clearer picture of what is actually going on in the world of HD ( vs SD ) , and how Blu-ray is doing when compared to DVD sales . <p> Let me first show you two graphs : <p> The first graph shows Blu-ray sales as a percentage of total sales ( of both Blu-ray and DVD sales combined ) . The dates on the bottom corresponds to the weeks ending on these days . For example , for the week ending August 17th , Blu-ray sales accounted for 5.27% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph show the actual sales volume for the same time period- ( for example , for the week ending August 17th , $6.19m in sales was recorded for Blu-ray ) . <p> Since I only started collecting stats from May 4 for both Blu-ray and DVD sales , there 's nothing that I can publish from before this time . Just as well as May marked the last month that a HD DVD movie was scheduled to be released , so from this point on wards , the war is now between Blu-ray and DVD well and truly . <p> So what does these graphs tell us ? Not a lot , apart from that its still early days and that Blu-ray sales are still struggling at this stage . Looking at both volume and percentage , August ended much like how May started . Blu-ray sales were between 5% and 8% of total sales . That 's respectable , but its hardly the kind of results that many expected after the death of HD DVD , at a time when Blu-ray has no like-for-like ( HD on a disc ) competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , most likely due to releases of certain blockbuster titles at those times . The peak in sales also corresponded with a peak in the Blu-ray vs DVD sales percentage , which suggest that Blu-ray sales- is still- largely dependent on what is available for sale . Because I think Blu-ray is still largely being supported by early adopters and the more serious movie collectors ( those that buy movies on the release date , rather than wait for a few months for the eventual price drop DVDs have a monopoly on these sort of sales , mainly because Blu-ray prices do n't  drop with any- conceivable pattern ) , this translates to bigger slice of the sales pie whenever a good release ( that benefits from HD ) is available . Look for Blu-ray sales to peak again when movies like Iron Man , The Dark Knight- are released later in the year . <p> Just to expand on the point about budget movies , this is still an area that is dominated by DVDs . I recently purchased some movies including Revenge of the Nerds and Hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales are made up of titles such as these . These movies are not available on Blu-ray for one , and even if they were , they would be too expensive . And further more , even if they were just slightly higher in price , there 's very little benefit in watching these types of movies on Blu-ray- ( a lot of these films werent even recorded with multi-channel sound , and arent- " important " enough to get the full proper HD transfer ) . This is why , I think , DVDs will be around for some time yet . I do n't  know if Blu-ray sales can ever overtake DVDs , not until studios stop producing DVDs anyway . Most experts predict that Blu-ray vs DVD sales will reach 50-50 by 2012 , so there 's still plenty of time for Blu-ray to reach this target . But many also predict other video delivery platforms , such as online streaming and downloading , might be of more interest to people by then . <p> Anyway , I 'll be back in a few months time with an update to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect The Dark Knight has on Blu-ray sales ( I think this one will break all records ) .

I was going to wait until March to write this new installment ( as to keep it a tri-monthly feature ) , but there has been some interesting developments recently that I wanted to write about ( plus I do n't  have anything else to write about ) . You can read the last instalment here . <p> Back in September , I- first wrote- about what I would be looking for in a computer if I were buying one today , and todays blog will see what has changed in the last few month . To get a better idea of the kind of system I 'm looking for , please refer to the original blog entry , but to sum up , it would be a system for playing the latest 3D games as well as a system ready for Blu-ray and HD DVD- playback , but one that is reasonable in price and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . Here are the specs- of the computer , including comparisons with the last specs from December ( as compared to December : upgraded parts in blue , lower prices in green , higher prices in red ) : <p> Type : <p> December- Part : <p> February- Part : <p> December- Price- ( $AUD ) : <p> February Price ( $AUD ) : <p> CPU : <p> Intel Core2Duo 6750 <p> Intel Core2Duo 8400 <p> $227 <p> $264 <p> Motherboard : <p> Gigabyte GA-P35C-DS3R ( Rev 2.0 ) <p> Gigabyte GA-P35C-DS3R ( Rev 2.0 ) <p> $165 <p> $156 <p> RAM : <p> Corsair 2 GB PC-8500 C5D <p> Corsair 2 GB PC-8500 C5D <p> $244 <p> $213 <p> HDD : <p> 2 x Seagate 400GB 7200RPM 16MB SATA2 <p> 2 x Seagate 500GB 7200RPM 32MB SATA2 <p> $238 <p> $312 <p> Video Card : <p> NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT- 512 MB ( XFX ) <p> NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT 512 MB ( XFX ) <p> $389 <p> $365 <p> Sound Card : <p> In-Built <p> In-Built <p> N/A <p> N/A <p> Optical Drive : <p> LG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pioneer BCD-S02 <p> $460 <p> $215 <p> Monitor : <p> Chimei 22 ? 221D <p> Samsung 22 ? 226BW <p> $309 <p> $397 <p> Case : <p> Antenc Sonata III <p> Antenc Sonata III <p> $179 <p> $178 <p> Total Price ( $AUD ) : <p> $2,211 <p> $2,100 <p> The price of the system has dropped $111 , but the specification of the system has also been improved , now with- a state of the art Intel Penryn 45nm CPU , - a set of bigger hard-drives and a- superior Samsung LCD monitor . Let 's go over each specification . <p> CPU : I 've changed the spec from an Intel Core2Duo 6750 to the new 8400 part . The 8400 is Penryn chip based on the new 45nm process , which means lower power usage and a cooler CPU . Reviews of this new chip has been extremely positive , with clear improvements over the 6750 . The real improvement will come later in the year when a new architecture is unveiled to take full advantage of the new 45nm process . AMD has also released their new Phenom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package at just slightly cheaper than the 8400 , although not as efficient considering it is still a 65nm part . Obviously , choosing a Phenom means a different motherboard choice to the one I 've listed , but the price should remain similar . <p> Motherboard : Ive stuck with- my choice of motherboard from the last- update . - I- like Gigabyte motherboards , although the sheer number of models that are available for a single chipset is a big confusing at times . Gigabyte was recently chosen as the best overall motherboard manufacturer in an Australian PC magazine survey ( PC Authority ) . The model I chose is one that supports both DDR2 and DDR3 memory , allowing for a smoother upgrade path when DDR3 memory pricing becomes a bit more reasonable . Despite getting a newer motherboard , the price has actually decreased . Note that the previous chosen motherboard had ATI crossfire support , which the new one does not , but since were going with an NVIDIA card anyway , it does n't  really matter . <p> RAM : Were sticking with our choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap enough for us to consider , but our choice of motherboard above means we can use DDR2 for now , and upgrade to DDR3 when they become more reasonable in pricing . <p> HDD : This is where the increased costs mainly comes from . An upgrade from 400 GB ( which seems to be no longer available ) to 500 GB , and the 32MB version as well. - Still sticking with a Seagate drive . The same PC Authority survey I mentioned above also gave Seagate the best overall award , so its an easy choice for me . <p> Video Card : I had to think about either sticking with the 8800 GT 512 MB , or getting the new 8800 GTS 512 MB- ( do n't  get the 320 or 640 MB version , since they are old models while sharing the same 8800 GTS name ) . Because the price has already went up more than $100 for the updated specs , I decided to hold off and keep the 8800 GT for now . If an extra $110 is not a big deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Card : Still going with a on-board solution . Until HDMI audio output gets sorted out , its probably not worth getting a new sound-card for your PC . HDMI audio output would allow the pass-thru or decoding or several of the new HD audio formats , which is not possible through SPDIF/optical due to insufficient bandwidth . <p> Optical Drive : Still sticking with the state-of-the-art Blu-ray and- HD DVD dual format reader drive , which also can write to the usual DVD formats . With this drive , you can make your PC format neutral and playback both Blu-ray and HD DVD movies . The huge cost increase , especially for those that want HD movie playback right now , is therefore understandable . If you want to save a bit of money , you can get the Pioneer BDC-S02 Blu-ray reader and CD/DVD writer drive for $215 , but you miss out on the ability to play HD DVD movies , which still make up nearly 50% of all available HD movies . Update : With the high definition format war appearing to be- over and Blu-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pioneer BDC-S02 drive , instead of the LG dual format drive . Those with HD DVD movies and want to play them on the computer might still consider the LG drive better value . The Pioneer is exactly half price of the LG , so the extra savings means that this instalments computer is actually cheaper than last instalments . <p> Monitor : Ive chosen the Chimei 22 ? for a while now , so I thought it might be time to upgrade . The new monitor Ive chosen is the Samsung 226BW 22 ? model , which looks a lot nicer than the Chimei , both in terms of style and picture quality . The monitor has a resolution of 1680+1050 , which is still a bit lacking for 1080p HD content , but you will need to up the size to 24 ? to be able to buy a monitor that is capable of 1080p display ( like the Samsung 24 ? 245B ) , which means at least another extra $200 . Others might want to consider a HDMI capable monitor ( the Chimei has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blu-ray/HD DVD playback as long as the DVI port is HDCP compatible ( which it is ) the 8800 GT does n't  even have HDMI output anyway . The main use for HDMI would be to connect external devices to the monitor ( eg. the PS3 ) , but 22 ? is probably on the small side if you plan on using the monitor for watching Blu-ray/HD DVD . <p> Case : Again , I 'm sticking with the Antec Sonata III case , because its good value as it comes with a high quality 500W power supply ( designed for quietness ) , and the overall build quality of the case ( and Antec cases , in general ) is quite good . Building a quiet system is essential if you plan on using the machine as your Blu-ray/HD DVD player . Of course , a quiet PC depends much on the type of cooling you have for your CPU and GPU . <p> While $AUD 2,100 ( that 's $1,930 for you US folk ) is a bit on the high end , we are loading the system with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that will pretty much do everything and then some . Whether its gaming or HD , it wo n't disappoint . Hopefully by our next instalment , DDR3 prices will have dropped , and perhaps- a new graphics card will tempt us to upgrade the specs again . So until then <p> feature , in that CPU prices actually went up . Some of the parts are still overpriced compared to February , but most have come back down to normal levels now . I guess with AMDs line up being a bit 
@@98121426 @2321426/ <p> You can open the video in virtualdub . Set the Video as Direct Stream Copy and under the Audio tab , choose Full Processing Mode , click on Wav audio ... and choose your wave file . From there you can manually choose your compressor ( definitely MP3 right ? ) , interleaving options and volume adjustment . <p> An even easier thing to do is what you have exactly done . Do the same thing as above but choose Direct Stream Copy for the Audio tab . Fool Virtualdub by changing the . mp3 extension of your audio track into . wav . Then , save as AVI . <p> One thing to note . I 've not personally tried doing this before ( MP3 Direct Streaming using Vdub ) , but it should work IMO . If you want to make sure , Nandub does support opening MP3 tracks for Direct Streaming . It 's basically an enhanced version of Virtualdub , so if you 're familiar with the latter , you should n't find that much difference with Nandub . <p> I just downloaded Nandub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I open this , how do I use it . <p> also with virtualdub ... I get a blank grey screen when I run it . if I use the priview view that shows my video , the video plays slow and choppy and looks nothing like what it does when I play it using other media players . <p> You can use Winrar or Powerdesk to open rar files . This format is very much like the compressed format zip . ' Un-rar ' the files into a folder of your choice and open Nandub as you would Virtualdub . <p> Assuming you 've got your video done ( you can open it in media player and see the picture ) , and the MP3 track prepared separately ( you 're trying to combine them , are n't you ? ) , follow the steps I wrote earlier . You need not worry about choppy preview . Just write back here about the results . <p> you should have seen the smile on my face . , every thing you said worked and I 'm delighted . <p> there 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I was able to reduce the file to just over 300 megs down from over 800 megs by setting a start and end point , just what I wanted . <p> I was able to add the . wav file as the . mp3 file only made poping sound when played . <p> the only remaining promblem is that both video and sound are playing at reduced speed . slower than normal but faster than actual slow motion . maybe there are settings or something I could adjust and then try again ? <p> As for the popping sound , I sometimes got the same thing too . This problem does not occur when the . wav is converted to . mp3 on the fly ( Full Processing Mode ) . So this is one solution for you , though it will require a lot more space . <p> By the way , try replaying the scene where you got the pops and tell me if the same pop is heard . For me , the pops seem to occur only randomly . <p> Have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio is interleaved at too small a frame interval . As I stated , I usually interleave them every 10 seconds of the movie , which means 250 frames for a 25fps movie , 300 frames for a 30fps movie and so on . 
@@98121427 @2321427/ <p> hey all , i just got DVD Flick and i 've used it to make some TV episodes into a DVD , well the video quality is excellent on my home player on the TV but the audio is out of sync , the TV episodes are all . avi format and it took 3 hours + to do 5 40ish minute episodes , i was told its suppose to be a much faster process with no encoding but its obviously encoding , are they suppose to be in a different format like mpeg-2 ? someone please help ? thanks ! <p> EDIT : forgot to add that after DVD Flick is done i 'm using Imgburn to burn the VIDEO and AUDIO folders onto the DVD <p> DVD Flick had to do the encoding because the original files were encoded with MPEG-2 ( if it 's AVI files , then they are almost certainly not MPEG-2 ) . The audio sync problem could be due to several factors ( assuming the AVI files played perfectly ) , and you might want to convert the AVI files to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using DVD Flick on them ( and then DVD Flick wo n't re-encode ) . This guide may be of help : <p> Try it with one file and then make a test DVD in DVD Flick with this file to see if the sync problem remains . If it does , I wonder whether it may be helpful to re-encode the AVI files , since they may not have been encoded properly in the first place : <p> thanks alot for the reply , can you reccomend a free program that will convert to mpeg-2 ? and does it take a long time to convert to mpeg-2 ? <p> Many times you can get audio out of sync because during the video conversion the frame rate is changed . It 's better , faster and easier if you can get a stand-alone DVD player or set top box that has native support for . avi and . divx , that can also play both NTSC and PAL formats . Reencoding from PAL to NTSC or vice versa often messes up the audio sync since they have different frame rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up . avi files to play on stand-alone is load them into AviDemux with all the automation options checked , and save the file . <p> The newer divx players are much less finicky about . avi and . divx then they used to be ( esp. if they are Ultra Divx certified . ) Also because you are not encoding to mpeg2 you can fit more episodes on a disc . Just make a data dvd with the . avi files on it . Imgburn Build Mode will do it . <p> for the record i burnt Gandhi using DVD Flick and Imgburn and it worked perfectly fine but trying to burn lost episodes about 41 minutes each the audio is off everytime putting about 5 episodes on each disk , tried it 3 times and its the same everytime : / <p> I 've had pretty good luck with DVD Flick but there are other freewares if you want to encode to standard DVD . You could try AvsToDVD , FAVC .. or others . Most have the ability to use HC Encode . When I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the frame rate . If the . avi is 25 fps I encode it as PAL dvd . Otherwise NTSC . My players can play both PAL and NTSC . Changing the frame rate is usually the culprit . If you have no choice but to output NTSC then you might look for an encoder that has an option to use DGPulldown . <p> I would use AviDemux to slice off a piece of an . avi and convert it until you successfully circumvent the sync issue . Then try a whole movie . It 's a lot less frustrating to do a 10 minute test than to wait for a whole video to process with unusable output . <p> hmmmm well when i 'm encoding with DVD Flick the frame rate is in the 60 's but then if i play WoW or something its down in the 20 's , should i use DVD Flick by itself with my PC doing nothing else until it finishes ? <p> I think the best idea is get a stand-alone that plays avi/divx . Avoids the whole encoding altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post the MediaInfo stats from a couple of the . avi files you are trying to encode then maybe someone can help you . Otherwise I think it 's at an impasse . <p> edit : btw I found this excellent guide how to fix up audio sync when you 've already created the DVD folder : <p> The best answer to this would have been telling DVDFlick to ignore AVI offsets . <p> That is always the most likely cause of audio and video sync options when using DVDFlick to process an AVI file . <p> AVI files ( actually a container ) have simple sync offsets within the container . They mess up things during encoding because the program will try to ' live ' by those hard offset times . <p> As I give this tip around the net on forums I find many people have their issues resolved . When you have an AVI loaded in DVDFlick , choose ' edit title ' in the upper right , click on ' audio tracks ' . then highlight the track or tracks one by one and choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the box for ' Ignore audio delay for this track ' on each and every audio track . That tells DVDFlick to ignore the AVI offsets and sync the video/audio up on it 's own terms . This resolves most if not all of the problems . <p> It 's a strange rhythm of posts on this whole forum , almost like at some point something happened and there was a mass exodus or something . Some of you mods and regulars might remember the above though , since you will be more likely to answer questions of this type in the future . <p> Sometimes , before you take the whole engine apart and reveal your in-depth knowledge of the internal combustion engine in all its glory ... it 's a better move to make sure gas is in the tank before you declare a problem with the engine . If you follow my metaphor . <p> You can give DVDVideoSoft 's Free Video to DVD Converter a try . Among others it supports a host of video formats and allows you to create a simple menu apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD disc . <p> DVD Flick is a good program . I 've not encountered any problem with it . If it 's giving you a headache , try DVDVideoSoft 's freeware program .

Let 's go over each specification . <p> CPU:Were sticking with the Intel Core2Duo 6750 , as it still represents the best price/performance Intel processor . There 's a price drop too , so that 's a bonus . If you like AMD processors , then you might also look at the AMD X2 6000+ for just over $200 . Those that are patient can wait for the Intel Penryn range of processors ( non Extreme Editions ) to come out early next year . It will the the " tick " in Intels " tick-tock " release schedule , which means the new 45 nm CPU will use existing architecture .

The same PC Authority survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so its an easy choice for me . <p> Video Card : After all my blah blah-ing- about the GeForce 8800 GT being " the card everyones been waiting for " , I had to choose it for this months selection .

Weve done well here by upgrading to a better card , while saving money at the same time . <p> Sound Card : Still going with a on-board solution .

@@98121432 @2321432/ <h> iTunes 's new 1080p Compares Well to Blu-ray Quality , At a Fraction of File Size <p> iTunes ' new 1080p video compares well to Blu-ray , despite only being a fraction of the size , tests show <p> New technology is allowing Apple to deliver high quality 1080p video to the " better than HDTV " new iPad screen without having to dramatically increase the file size of the videos . <p> The resolution of 1080p , 1920x1080 , provides 2.25 times as many pixels as 720p 's 1280x720 , but the new compression algorithm used by 1080p videos on iTunes can deliver superior quality with only a 20% , or 1.2 time , increase in file size . <p> The magic lies in the various encoding techniques that are now available on Apple 's hardware devices . Apple uses the H.264 ( MPEG-4 AVC ) codec to deliver its videos , which is an industry standard codec also used for Blu-ray and YouTube . The codec features several encoding techniques that can be enabled to disabled , depending on the power of the decoding hardware - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to easily make their hardware compliant . For example , low end devices can choose to only support the Baseline profile , with HDTV using Main , and high capacity storage formats such as Blu-ray using the High profile . <p> In addition , there is also a " Level " rating that specifies the resolutions and bitrates the decoding device is capable of handling . Again , low end devices will have a low " Level " rating like 3.1 , which limits the maximum resolution to 720p at 30 FPS , while high end devices can go all the way up to Level 5.2 , to support 4,096+2,048 @ 60 FPS . <p> The combination of " Profiles " and " Levels " then determine the maximum peak bitrate the video is allowed to use ( the higher the bitrate , the better the picture quality , but also increases the file size ) . <p> The improved processors on the new iPad and Apple TV , as well as the fast A5 processors on the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2 now allows for " High " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Level being supported . Whereas previous generation hardware was limited to 30 FPS 720p with a peak bitrate of 14 Mbps , the new Apple TV supports 30 FPS 1080p with a peak bitrate of 25 Mbps , thanks to increasing the Level from 3.1 to 4.0 , and using the High profile instead of Baseline/Main . <p> The other more powerful A5 devices ( iPad 2 , new iPad , iPhone 4S ) has raised the supported H.264 Level to 4.1 , which allows for 30 FPS 1080p with a peak bitrate of 62.5 Mbps . <p> Techno-babble aside , what this means is that , with a higher peak bitrate to play around with , high detailed scenes can now get more bitrate to improve quality , while low detail scenes can still use a low bitrate . This much more flexible use of encoding bitrate allows dramatic quality improvements , without the associated file size increases . It also allows iTunes 1080p video files to be far smaller in size than the equivalent Blu-ray files , which tends to err on the side of caution and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . As such , a typical 35GB Blu-ray file , can now be squeezed into less than 5GB on iTunes , and only those with high end home theater equipment or super large TVs will be able to tell the difference . <p> This technique is not new though . VUDU 's HDX streaming service uses a similar technique to bring down the average bitrate of 1080p video from Blu-ray 's dizzying 35 Mbps to a more manageable ( for today 's broadband users , at least ) 12 Mbps . <p> Not quiet convinced ? Then have a look at this Ars Technica article , with actual screencap comparisons between Blu-ray and iTunes 1080p , and decide for yourself . While those serious about quality will always want Blu-ray , those willing to settle for smaller screens of the iPad or iPhone , or the streaming convenience of Apple TV , should be more than satisfied with iTunes 1080p.

Even though we are without probably the best weeks of the year in terms of sales , I thought I would offer a preview of what the year has been like so far for Blu-ray- sales . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its an important year because a new Blu-ray format , Ultra HD Blu-ray , was introduced , and the popularization of streaming continued unabated . So its- important to take a look to see if discs are still a thing that people want . More importantly , has 4K had a positive effect on the format ( considering that 4K UHD Blu-ray sales are counted as Blu-ray sales in the stats I provide weekly ) . <p> Looking at the stats , the short answer is yes , 4K has helped Blu-ray record a turn-around ! <p> 2015 was not a good year for discs , and not a good year for Blu-ray . Blu-ray revenue had declined for the second year running , and it certainly appears that " peak Blu-ray " or even " peak disc " , where the peak for Blu-ray/disc sales , had already been reached some time in 2013 . <p> But 2016 is turning out to be quite different , at least for the first 47 weeks so far of the year , and the turning point came in March , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go into some more detail for you . Of the 52 weeks in 2015 , thirty weeks ( that 's close to 58% of the weeks ) had a Blu-ray revenue result that was lower than the same week in 2014 , compared to 22 weeks ( 42% ) that had recorded a rise in Blu-ray revenue . <p> Studios are n't  shy to bring their biggest hits to UHD Blu-ray <p> For 2016 so far , - it has reversed , where 21 weeks ( 45% ) - were worse compared to 26 weeks ( 55% ) that were better . Looking at the same time period ( the first 47 weeks ) in- 2015 , Blu-ray revenue was 7.6% lower than the same period in 2014 , but comparing 2016 to 2015 , - Blu-ray- revenue is now up 2.3%. - Thats what I call a turnaround ! <p> Now looking at the first 11 weeks of 2016 that did not include any Ultra HD Blu-ray sales , 6 of these weeks were worse than the same weeks in 2016 , only 5 were better . Revenue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So in other words , before Ultra HD Blu-ray , revenue was falling at about the same rate as in 2015 , but since then , revenue has actually risen . Ultra HD Blu-ray has had a very positive effect on Blu-ray sales . <p> None of this should be a surprise for those that have been following the WNR . I 've mentioned many times that studios have been very proactive in releasing titles on UHD Blu-ray , and that the UHD version is selling quite well given how new the format it ( it frequently beats the 3D version of the same film ) . And studios are only keen to push UHD because there are lots of households already with 4K , thanks to a lower than expect price premium to upgrade to the format ( relatively speaking , of course ) . <p> Now with that said , the final few weeks of 2016 could still change things around , depending on how receptive people are to Ultra HD Blu-ray during this crucial sales period . But given that the Xbox One S is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Xbox One S includes an- Ultra HD Blu-ray player , its quite possible the sales growth will actually intensify during the next few weeks . <p> Well have to wait- a few more weeks before I can confirm- were Blu-ray revenue will end up , and even if my hypothesis is correct and that 4K is helping sales , its hard to- tell if this boost is just a temporary one on the transition away from discs . 
@@98121438 @2321438/ <h> Weekly News Roundup ( October 30 , 2016 ) <p> Welcome to- the pre Halloween edition of the WNR . There 's nothing particularly scary or Halloweeny about this edition though , well other than the usual scary , depressing , frustrating and insane anti-piracy news stories that I post almost every week . More Groundhog Day than Halloween , I suppose . <p> Another scary anti-piracy idea comes from Cisco this week , as the networking giant has a new way to- help cable companies protect their price gouging business model , via anti-piracy tech . Cisco plans to tackle the problem piracy of cable- content , especially the live streaming of cable channels , by something they call- Streaming Piracy Prevention ( SPP ) . SPP will help cable networks digitally watermark their content , and when a stream or download is detected by SPP , its able to trace the pirated content ( via the watermark ) all the way back to the subscriber account that 's responsible for pirating the content . In the case of a live piracy streaming , SPP is able then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- account in question , thus cutting off the stream in the quickest possible way . <p> SPP will be completely automated , meaning no human intervention is required . And because of this , SPP is also likely to trigger a lot of false positives if- the past is any indication . <p> Streaming piracy is a big problem , especially at times of major sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics . But I 'm always weary of tech solutions to piracy , especially automated ones . And it still does n't  address the root cause of piracy , which is an access- problem , usually caused by high pricing , lack of value , choice , and services that are n't  in tune with how people want their content delivered ( that is , online and accessible everywhere the polar opposite of a cable connection ) . <p> DVD screeners are a more and more common source of pirated copies <p> Now a story about a different kind of piracy , and something that involves players completely within the film industry . Warner Bros. has sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leaking award screeners that were sent to the agency . The screeners- that have been mentioned in the lawsuit are for the movies Creed and In the Heart of the Sea and were sent to Innovative the digital watermark in the pirated downloads were then tracked to the copies given to the agency . The agency- represents clients including the likes of Adam Ferrara ( Rescue Me ) , Alicia Witt ( Twin Peaks ) and used to represent The Big Bang Theorys Jim Parsons . <p> Innovative have since provided an official statement , saying they were surprised that this matter wasnt handled privately and will now head to the courts , despite the agency having previously cooperated fully with Warner on the same matter . The sharing of screeners , - Innovative says , is also commonplace in Hollywood and something that Warner knows all about . <p> So instead of going after downloaders , it seems Hollywood need to get their own house in order , since screener piracy , one of the most damaging kind ( because it usually happens before the retail disc release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last couple of years as pirates up their game and try to- release movies as fast as possible . <p> Ultra HD Movies like Deadpool may sound better on the Xbox One S thanks to a firmware update in 2017 <p> The Xbox One S is helping Microsoft bridge the sales gap between the console and the PS4 , at least in North America , and at least some part of that is due to the inclusion of a new Ultra HD Blu-ray drive in the console , allowing it to play the latest 4K movie discs . This has helped to greatly improve the value of the Xbox One S , which is actually cheaper than most standalone UHD Blu-ray players on the market. - This makes the Xbox One S almost no brainer for those looking to buy a UHD player , even if they do n't  want to play too many games I say almost because the Xbox One Ss UHD Blu-ray function does lack a few key features . <p> These mostly relate to the consoles poor audio output options , with no bitstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dolby Atmos and DTS-X . This rules out the Xbox One S as a serious contender for those that have already heavily invested in these next-gen audio system , or are planning to . <p> At least this was the case until this week , when Microsoft announced that bitstream output , along with Dolby Atmos and DTS-X support , will be coming to the Xbox One S in early 2017 . Not only that , bitstream support and Dolby Atmos for gaming is also coming to the original Xbox One . <p> The inclusion of UHD Blu-ray even in the cheapest Xbox One by Microsoft , in my opinion , is a masterstroke . Whether this helps the Xbox One catch up to the PS4 is another matter though , as the PS4s lead is extremely impressive , to say the least . <p> ====== <p> I think that 's all we have for this week . Hope it was n't too boring . See you next week !

If I can use a rewinder what type ? What usually cause timebase problems ... manual rewinder ? When I played this VHS-C on my VCR using the adapter , it it causes distorted images at certain points on the DV capture . <p> Worn out tape guides on both the VCR units and stand alone rewinders will cause tape edge damage , which in turn causes the tape to " walk " up and down inside the guides when playing or recording , and that in turn makes the " control track " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get bad picture , loss of hi-fi tracks , just general unwanted garbage . <p> Dirty tape guides will also cause this problem with playback and recording . Check those for buildup of tape particles that gather over time and make the tape walk off of the guide . The best way to determine tape walk is to examine the tape as it travels past the pinch roller and capstan shaft . If the tape looks like it is warping and not traveling smooth between the pinch roller/capstan shaft and the exit guide just byond that , chances are the guides in front of the pinch roller/capstan shaft ( the one near the video drum on the exit side ) are either worn out or have build up at the top and bottom guide hats . Clean as needed . <p> TBC is short for Time Base Correction , a pulse used in video tape media and machines in order to correct sync and color timing errors . More commonly found in video production and broadcast studio facilities , TBC 's do a very good job in fixing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not fix everything unless you are fortunate enough to afford the extremely expensive TBC 's meant for broadcast and production facilities . A TBC requires GenLock , or " house sync " as us engineers refer it to . This " house sync " is usually a black video signal with the correct sync pulses and color pulse so that all of the video machines and other equipment like the video/audio routers and switchers can switch between video and audio sources without loosing the time base of each video/audio source . The result is a smooth transistion between the sources . <p> The TBC found in consumer gear is basically similar to the expensive big brother units , except the TBC does not use a reference house sync pulse . It generates new sync based on its count of the exsisting sync pulses on the media , and calculates the correct timing delay and color timing and re-assembles it with the new generated sync . <p> So do you mean comsumer TBC can still cause UNSYNC just not much image distortion ? <p> Do you think a bad rewinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use my VCR/CAMCORDERs for the rewinding as I think they may broke sooner if I do . But on some forum I heard is a good idea to do just that so that it put a good tension on the tape ? Que hago ? What should I do ? I do n't believe my old rewinder ... I bought a KINYO one says it also clean the tape too I may need advice on this soon too . <p> You think my new rewinder can cause timebase problems ? If so , does this mean I always have to rewind the tapes on the VCR whenever I found them ? <p> Its possible that a rewinder that has worn out guides or pulls the tape too hard or the hub brakes kick in at the incorrect time or they keep too much tension on the wind process can cause " tape strech " , where the tape is pulled and changes width . It only takes just a fraction of strech to muck up a tape , any tape be it audio or video . <p> What the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It usually is done when a tape has sat for a good period of time to loosen up the tape before running it through a machine . A stand alone rewinder is best for this operation . But unpacking a recent tape that has been used frequently is not recommended , only on tapes that have been sitting for a long time , years for example . <p> When a tape is streched , it not only changes the width and the position the tape rides along the guides and across the control track head , it makes the control track pulses change frequency because of the dopler effect . You can experiment with this by taking some old cassette tape , strech it just a bit in one spot , play it and listen to how the pitch changes in the music as it comes across the streched part of the tape . With video , it messes up the control track pulses and the video drum sync and make the picture loose tracking . In digital recordings you will end up with pixilization or freezing video . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix a lot of VCR 's . Most of the problems were mechanical . Stand alone rewinders are crap . I have never seen one that could match the VCR . RFBurns is right , I would also check the head of the VCR and make sure it is still shines . You may have " stiction " . Also make sure the tension arms move freely . Sony 's used top freeze up a lot rendering an excellent VCR useless . You would be better using an old VCR for winding and rewinding the tape . Do not do it in Fast forward mode as the tape is pulled out and rubbing against the head . Most of the tape problems I have seen from stand alone rewinding machines was that they wound the tape too tight . <p> So you 're all saying my new KINYO will still cause timebase errors ?

@@98121444 @2321444/ <p> If you want to fit a movie into the smallest possible size , cropping can do a lot to help out . The most vital thing to remember for optimal compression is to always crop a few pixels into the image and delete all of the black bars . Mpeg compression works best on blurry images ; so if a hard black line is seen at the bottom or top of your cropped movie it will not compress as effectively . In fact , if you can not crop into the image then I 'd say do n't bother cropping at all . <p> Because Mpeg2avi does n't have a preview box we will have to do a few quick tests to see what we will get . The best way to do this is to set it up to encode about 100 frames . Mpeg2avi has a start and end from such and such a frame option . So we can put in where we want to test the movie and how many frames to encode . This is done like this : <p> This will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames of it . Then we can see what the picture will look like . It is also a good idea to start from the second Vob so we do n't get the start credits . Now , every time we want to see what the image looks like we simply hit the ' Create my AVI ' button and in a few seconds we can check it . <p> RESIZING A 4:3 MOVIE <p> Many get confused by Mpeg2avi 's crop and resize settings , but really they are very easy enough to use . The only down side is you do n't have an instant preview to work from like Flask Mpeg . As always we are using Danni 's amazingly cool GUI to do this , so you will not need to mess around with the DOS prompt = ) . <p> Okay , let 's do this : assume we are resizing a 720 x 576 PAL DVD to 448 x 336 this is a 4:3 aspect ratio of 1.33:1 . Mpeg2avi 's resizing options are : <p> Downsizer X : This option shrinks the width smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y : This shrinks the height according towat you set it . <p> It 's important to remember that the downsizer options only shrink the picture itself . So , for example , in the picture below the original movie was 720 x 576 and I used a downsizer of : <p> Now , the movie below is still 720 x 576 but the picture inside it is 448 x 336 ! <p> To get the movie perfect we must crop out the black areas too . The Mpeg2avi crop functions are : <p> Output Cropping X : crops the width of the whole window . Note that its does n't just take a bit from one size or the other but takes it evenly . <p> Output Cropping Y : same again , but it crops the top and bottom . <p> So to crop out the black areas we just put the same resize values in the cropping sections as are in the resize , like this : <p> The final picture will look like this : <p> CROPPING WIDESCREEN MOVIES <p> The same process is used again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sizes we may have to " tweek " the measurements a little to get the best posible cropping . Let 's say we have a 2.35:1 Anamorphic movie . Its 720 x 576 and looks like this : <p> As you can see anamorphic DVD 's have squashed pictures . For an explanation of this subject be sure to read the section called " Anamorphic DVD 's &amp; Aspect Ratios " in the my appendix . But to cut a long story short we will resize the image to an aspect ratio of either 1.85:1 ( or 1.33:1 depending on the DVD ) and I want to resize my movie to about 576 x 320 which is the closest size I can get to a correct aspect ratio at this size . So I put : <p> When I check the move it is now in near-perfect aspect ratio : <p> Next is to crop out the picture . Since we know the correct width is 576 across we can set the cropping to 576 . We also know that 320 will be higher than the picture because we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in too like this : <p> And we get this : <p> But because the DVD had a gap on the left , this is going to detract from our otherwise perfect cropping . All it needs is to bring the sides in 16 pixels and it will look nice . So instead of 576 we can crop it to 560 or we could resize the image 16 pixels to so it was 592 x 336 . So we : <p> And we get the following : <p> Finally we keep cropping a little at a time until we get the bottom and top right . At the moment the cropping is Y=320 . We want that to be smaller so we take away 16 pixel to make 304 ( always resize by multiples of 16 pixels ) . That 's no good , so we take off 16 more until its 288 and try that . Then we try 272 , then 256 and finally we find that 240 is perfect !

@@98121449 @2321449/ <h> Copy Protection Silliness , HDMI , Component and Upscaled DVDs <p> Ever tried to play an upscaled DVD on your DVD or Blu-ray player through component cables ? Well , unless you have one of those Asian players that the MPAA hates , then you wont be able to , all thanks to a quirky copy protection rule that 's frankly just silly. - I 've been aware of this little bit of copy protection silliness , but it has n't  really affected me since I use HDMI , that is until last weekend . <p> What happened was that my 5 year and 1 month old Pioneer plasma TV , which came with a 5 year warranty , decided ( one month out of warranty for those that are paying attention ) to break . Actually , everything works except for the HDMI input , and even that works except when you feed it a copy protected source . Anything that required HDCP no longer worked , and apparently this is a well known problem with early Pioneers . <p> Diagnosing the problem was difficult at first , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I played a disc , everything would go black . But when playing a non commercial disc , everything worked . A little bit of brain work pointed me towards the fact that the HDCP chip for the TV had probably fried . I have a PS3 connected to this TV as well , and nothing would even show up , since Sony took the extra step of ensuring no picture at all if HDCP wasnt enabled . <p> As I am in the planning stages of buying a new TV ( most likely one of those Panasonic Viera plasmas , since they are now the new Kings of plasma now that Pioneer has pulled the plug ) , I decided it was n't really worth it to try and fix the problem , at least not until I 've got my new TV . Everything would still work if I connected through component , and to be honest ( and even using fairly poor quality cable ) , the differences were minimal . And that 's when I encountered the silliness I mentioned above . <p> No HDMI ? No problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PS3 was connected via a new set of PS3 component cables I got ( the fact that Sony only bundles composite cables with the PS3 is an insult the PS3s HD capabilities , in my opinion I know that most people use HDMI , but *some* people cant and by using proprietary connectors , it makes the situation even worse ) . It took a while to get the picture right ( see Addendum below ) , but once it was working , Blu-ray played great , not as good as HDMI , but hey what can you do , right ? <p> But when it came to playing a DVD , the picture was n't so good . While you can watch a 1080p Blu-ray movie in 1080i ( or 1080p if your TV supports that kind of thing through component ) , but you can not actually watch a 576p ( or 480p ) DVD upscaled to 720p or 1080i , not legally anyway . Apparently , this is done to prevent copying . Except I can still copy Blu-ray movies outputted to 1080i ( or 1080p ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make copies of upscaled DVDs ( ie. fake HD ) , but is perfectly happy for you to make copies of Blu-ray movies ( ie. real HD ) . Does this make sense ? <p> A little bit more brain work from me and I think I figured out why it actually does make sense , at least in the twisted logic that Hollywood employs . You see Blu-ray uses a new copy protection mechanism called AACS and as part of the specifications is something Image Constraint Token ( ICT ) , which all Blu-ray movies carry . Basically , this allows component output to be disable or limited to lower resolutions if the studio wishes , which when activated will bring the Blu-ray situation in line with the upscaled DVD situation when it comes to output via component . In order to promote Blu-ray , manufacturers and studios came to an agreement not to implement ICT until later on , I guess they did n't  want to turn off people who had invested heavily in analogue equipment . And , this is the twisted logic part , - because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( even though it was n't turned on ) , this is why Hollywood deemed it okay to allow HD output via component for now . If the DVD copy protection scheme *had* the ability to also limit HD output via component at some stage in the future , and chances are , it might have been allowed until studios realised that they have nothing to fear on this front at all . But because the DVD copy protection scheme was invented before upscaling was the norm , the sledgehammer approach was deemed the only solution , and that meant disabling all HD output via component . <p> There is also another set of twisted logic in play . Analogue means reduced quality , everyone knows that . So Blu-ray via analogue means the copy made is an inferior version compared to the original , which might be okay in Hollywoods eyes . But if you take a digital standard def DVD , upscale it to high def , and then output that via analogue , and then re-digitize that , then you might end up with a copy that 's fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , is not okay . Of course , anyone can just rip the DVD and retain 100% of the original quality , which is what everyone does. - Just how many DVD and Blu-ray movies are actually pirated via component is quite debatable , not when there are much easier ways to make 1:1 copies . Ironically , DVD ripping may be the only way to watch your legally purchased DVDs upscaled via component , as non copy protected discs are still upscaled perfectly . <p> Note the two pronged PS3 Slim power cable , which probably means no more component inteference problems on the PS3 <p> So in my situation , until I get my new TV , I 'm stuck with watching DVDs in SD , while still being able to enjoy Blu-ray movies in HD glory . At least until some studio implements ICT . Luckily , this problem is largely a problem of the past , as HDMI is now far more common and comes in greater numbers of connectors on TVs than even component , and so it wont be a problem most people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip is fried <p> Addendum : I mentioned earlier about taking a while to get the picture right on my PS3 via component . The problem I ran into was the common PS3 component interference problem ( horizontal or diagonal wavy lines ) , as described here on the official PS3 board , and luckily with solutions . My solution to the problem was to follow the information in the posted thread and remove the ground prong from the power plug , and the interference went away . This type of- interference- does n't  affect the HDMI output , so that 's why Ive never noticed it probably until now . Just why I need to do this with what is otherwise a high quality piece of electronics , I have no idea . I have never run into this problem with the dozens and dozens of low , and high quality equipment Ive ever used , or help install for other people . And I did notice that neither the Wii nor the Xbox 360 uses the ground connector , and apparently the PS3 Slim does n't  have it anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted on Wednesday , January 6th , 2010 at 6:23 pm and is filed under are currently closed . <p> It was short lived , we hardly knew thee , but HDCP copy protection has been cracked , with the master key posted on Twitter of all places . People at first were sceptical , but a few days later , we had confirmation from Intel , the company that developed HDCP , that , yes , the posted key was in fact the legitimate master key . So what does the master key do ? Well , it the way HDCP works , it allows legitimate source keys ( keys for things like Blu-ray players ) and sink keys ( keys for receiving devices , mainly TVs and monitors ) to be generated , and therefore it means that there is no way now to tell the difference between authorised devices , and unauthorised ones , thus killing HDCP as a viable DRM scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed " , it is n't quite that simple . Yes , Blu-ray players rely on HDMI and therefore HDCP copy protection , but the disc itself is still protected by several other layers of DRM , including AACS . However , it will now be possible to intercept the HDMI output and get access to the raw digital stream to make copies of the movie , although that will require a bit of hardware ingenuity , although something could be done in software too . Those around when DVD ripping first came onto the scene will remember Power Ripper , the tool that used PowerDVDs screen capture tool to rip DVDs , frame by frame . Since then , many DRM schemes have protected this sort of ripping by disabling screen capture or encrypting the path from software to screen . But with HDCP out of the way , this kind of ripping may be possible again ( and this time , since HDMI carries audio too , the whole stream can be riped ) . Of course the question is why would anyone want to do this when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are also other applications other than ripping , such as allowing movies to still be played via HDMI even when the TVs HDCP chip has died . <p> I also have a 5 year old TV and the HDCP chip will not work with my DVD player or my AppleTV. - It is ironic that I would have to break the law ( e.g. rip the DVD ) to watch DVDs on my TV because my HDCP chip is not functioning . - Even worse to pay a repair guy several hundred dollars to fix this problem which is designed to prevent me from copping the movie . - Ironic that I have NEVER even heard of a movie being copied from the HDMI output and even more ironic is that the output is fine on the VGA from my computer and it would be much easier to copy from the computer . - <p> Given how easy it is to rip a DVD or out put the VGA on a computer Hollywood should give up on this asinine strategy . I wish we could take the RIAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend just to watch the $@ ! %#@ media that I have legally purchased . <p> As an update to this post , to make matters worse , Hollywood has deemed HD analog too much of a danger to allow , and so from the beginning of 2011 , newly manufactured Blu-ray players are no longer allowed to output HD via analog ( it will be limited to 540p ) : <p> Pirate it . The MPAA is digging their own grave . I will still support the indies , and small companies , but I wo n't spend money at the theater , or purchase a big name title anymore . I honestly cant remember when I last went to the theater . Its been at least a few years . I 'm in no rush to see some terrible regurgitated junk . Netflix , Hulu , etc. , or pirate it . The MPAA and RIAA think were just greedy people , but its their greed that caused this problem , not ours . I would happily stop watching movies , and just read books , if that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are garbage anyways . Maybe I 'll go see the next Nolan or Cameron movie , but that 's about it . All I know is that this junky protection means I cant connect through composite to stream/record the PS4 . Its not like I would have been stealing anything by doing it . I think I may just sell the PS4 unopened , for a sizable profit , and stick to PC . <p> I agree , this closing ALL holes ( by limiting you to only a single encrypted HDMI output ) is just asinine . Now I see Blu-ray rippers popping up all over the internet , and the MPAA is no longer able to stop them all . Limiting you to just 1 HDMI port to hook to your TV gives you no choice , and there is no failsafe backup strategy if the only connection you are allowed to use does n't  work . All this to stop a copy method that does n't  even exist ? Give me a break ! That is why they got rid of component too . Now even if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whole new format , even if I got all the necessary hardware to do a Blu-ray to a blank Blu-ray disc . For starters , I would have no way to hook up todays Blu-ray player to my old TV set anyway . I know it would take at least a year for me to get my return on investment on a Blu-ray burner if I got one , so I am attempting to sit this one format out . PS : watermark detection has quietly been added to Blu-ray players without anyone having a choice , so it would cause a watermarked copy that did n't  have the encryption to mute after 20 minutes . Cinavia is being added to some titles , look for the tiny crescent symbol on the bottom of the package near the bottom toward the back of the package . <p> Now 4K content is coning out , but they are adding HDCP 2.0 and 2.2 , and you have to have BOTH in order for everything to work . I know of NO one that has pirated off an HDMI port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste 10 or more terabytes for a single movie . This silliness does nothing to address the ripping straight off the disc . <p> I cant speak for 4k content , but you can most certainly pirate any 1080p protected HDMI source you like . Be it PS4 , blu-ray movies , etc . Its not only not that complicated , but also rather inexpensive . It just requires a capture card that does 1080p hdmi , and the proper adapters to bypass the encryption . All of it can be bypassed with ease . Just because you do n't  know anyone , does n't  mean you could n't google how to do it , and realize this is n't exactly top secret black hat stuff . In fact I learned it purely to be able to stream my PS4 to my laptop capture card , in order to use the laptop as a monitor ( and no , I 'm not talking about the disable HDCP option in the PS4 settings , which is different ) .
