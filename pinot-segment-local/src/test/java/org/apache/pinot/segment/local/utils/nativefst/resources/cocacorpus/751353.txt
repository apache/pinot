I was looking for a relatively economical replacement set of torches that would take the 18650 battery instead of having to replace the CR123 's used in my Surefires all the time . I purchased the Nitecore based upon multiple resource information available on the net , and thought I should give it a try .

It is well thought out , built to last and has a very nice fit and finish to it . It more than confirms my opinion that Nitecore will be my go to product line from now on .
