
 five years since the recession began , and in that time ethical markets have increased in value from ? 35.5 billion to ? 47.2 billion , according to the recent Co-operative Ethical Consumer Markets Report . <p> In response to increasing demand from customers , many retailers have drawn up plans to improve their performance on a whole host of ethical issues , sustainable sourcing being chief among them . <p> As well as monitoring the ethical market across the UK through the Ethical Consumer Markets Report , mutual retail &amp; services business The Co-operative Group also works to meet ethical targets , such as creating a dedicated supply chain for milk , through ' Our Ethical Plan ' . <p> Commenting on the growing demand for ethical goods , a spokesperson for The Co-operative said : " The Ethical Consumer Markets Report shows that intervention by enlightened businesses , together with regulatory intervention , is driving ethical sales growth . <p> " During the downturn we have seen some of the biggest ever Fairtrade conversions , be it in chocolate or sugar , and business is beginning to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services such as fish , palm oil and soya . " <p> While recognising that ethical consumers are " a vitally important barometer of change " and that progressive businesses can also stimulate ethical markets , the spokesperson laid the bulk of the responsibility at the Government 's door , commenting : " Ultimately , over and above the efforts of responsible business and ethical consumers , sustainable solutions require a government committed to long term intervention . " <p> Richard Anstead , Fairtrade 's Head of Production Management , agreed that the Government has a responsibility to support ethical retailing and sustainable supply . With David Cameron hosting the G8 Summit in June 2013 , Anstead told Retail Gazette that the Prime Minister has the opportunity to make a real difference . <p> Outlining his hopes , Anstead commented : " We would like to see the Government get behind helping smallholders and make a commitment to finding a solution to food scarcity in the world . <p> " If the Government channelled more support into agriculture in developing countries , it would be an opportunity to secure supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Securing the supply chain , which Anstead sees as " an investment for retailers " , was a key theme for Anstead as he discussed the progress which Fairtrade has made in recent years , as well as the obstacles which it has yet to overcome . <p> At present , 40 per cent of sugar in supermarkets is Fairtrade , and 30-35 per cent of bananas , although Fairtrade supporters The Co-operative and Sainsbury 's now stock only Fairtrade bananas . <p> Nestle has also recently announced that all two-finger Kit Kats will carry the Fairtrade mark from 2013 , increasing the impact on farmers in Cote d'Ivoire who were already benefitting from the use of Fairtrade products in four-finger Kit Kats . <p> Moving forward , Anstead wishes to add to these successes , particularly through Fairtrade Fortnight , which will take place between Monday February 25th and Sunday March 10th 2013 . <p> " We are challenging retailers to make noise in stores so the message can really resonate in the retail environment , " he explained . <p> " One of the biggest opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where people discover and buy our products . " <p> One retailer with strong connections to Fairtrade is supermarket Sainsbury 's , which launched its 20x20 Sustainability Plan in 2011 , setting out 20 targets relating to sustainability , community action and protecting the environment which should be achieved by 2020 . <p> Echoing Anstead 's comments about the importance of the supply chain , Sally Uren , Deputy CEO of Forum for the Future said : " In order to continue in the success to date , Sainsbury 's needs a sustainable food system around it . <p> " It just is n't possible to be sustainable and successful into the long-term if the system around you is broken . <p> " Sainsbury 's has done some of the best work I 've seen in the UK on sustainable agriculture , so what I 'd love to see is that work scaled up in the UK and beyond , and for Sainsbury 's not only to feed the nation in a sustainable way but help create a sustainable food system . " <p> Sainsbury 's CEO Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant and stretching " , and that although there is a long journey ahead , achievements have already been made . <p> In December 2012 , Sainsbury 's distributed ? 1.2 million in funding to projects dedicated to driving the future of British farming , including initiatives to extend the British strawberry season and improve the quality of Aberdeen Angus beef , and the supermarket is also the largest retailer of Marine Stewardship Council certified fish . <p> Research into the impact of the 20x20 plan has revealed that Sainsbury 's customers have adopted " new-fashioned values " since the onset of the recession , and are unwilling to sacrifice their principles despite the need for a cheaper price . <p> Neil Saunders , Managing Director of analyst firm Conlumino , confirmed that consumers want to be ethical , but told us that " price does remain the number one consideration . " <p> " If they can find a cheaper product elsewhere that is not ethical then people that are constrained financially probably will trade away because they will see it as being important just to get the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethical products and subsequent reductions in the price of these products are the main reasons for the booming ethical market , he said : " What we do n't know of course is how much it might have grown by if there had n't been a downturn , because I 'm sure the downturn has slowed down the growth rate . " <p> Saunders added that , while the growth rate will eventually slow as the market reaches maturity , 2013 is set to be a year of significant growth in ethical retailing . <h> Shameless ! Everton

 Gillan , Managing Director of Squaretrade <h> Thursday 30 May 2013 - Editorial Assistant <p> Kevin Gillan , new Managing Director of warranty provider Squaretrade , spoke to Retail Gazette about the importance of offering tech-savvy consumers with fragile devices value for money in the current economic climate . <p> Tell us a bit about the company and why the time was right to launch a warranty solution . <p> We are a San Francisco-based company with over 200 employees at present though we are growing rapidly . The business has doubled in size over the last 12 months and is continuing to win accounts , notably with US retailer Costco . Here in the UK , we 've only been going since last year but have already secured the likes of Tesco , Amazon and eBay as clients . I have come on in the last few weeks to grow the business here and across Europe while helping with the mobile networks as well . There are few companies that you get the opportunity to join when they are going through 100 per cent growth per annum so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all know , the whole world of extended warranty in the UK has not had a good reputation so I think if a company like ours can come along and offer customers good value in the space , that can only be a good thing . <p> Importantly , we are all increasingly carrying devices around in our hands costing hundreds of pounds and the question is not if you drop the thing but how much it 's going to cost when you do drop it . Whether it 's kids at home with a tablet or adults walking around with expensive smartphones , far too few of us have no protection plans in place for our technology at all and I think if someone can come along offering a great solution and customer service , there will be a strong opportunity in the UK for such a company . <p> What are the legal implications for the consumer of dealing with a third party such as Squaretrade ? <p> It 's quite simple , in terms of the cost to protect the product . If you break it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within five days , we will fix it and return it to you or we will pay cash for the original price . Often when you protect things under home contents cover , you will be offered the depreciated value of the product ; so if you bought an iPhone for ? 100 , they could offer you a payment of ? 50 , which does n't go very far to buying a new one . So the promise that we make is that within five days we will have it repaired and back in your hands or give you cash instead . You can do all of this online in a couple of minutes so you do n't have to visit our contact centre if you chose not to . <p> We pay out a lot more than most insurance companies and we do n't quibble , we just say that we stick to the promise we made when you bought the extended warranty with the product , that 's how it works . <p> Why is it important to offer value for money now and how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breaking ; if you look at 10 people 's phones , a large amount would have cracked or broken screens and they do not know how to get them fixed . Consumers are spending a lot more on technology than they used to and carrying it around before dropping it and breaking it . What we are saying is that the vast majority of people have no protection whatsoever and if people knew that such a solution is available , they would be very attracted as a result . <p> Historically , certain retailers have offered protection at an extra cost and instantly you think " I 'm going to get had here " and that is the challenge that we 've got as a business . We need to convince people that there is something called value for money , there is something called good service . <p> Looking at the reviews that we have had on Amazon or Google or even the Facebook followers we 've got , they speak volumes and people will still say what a great solution we offer even though they have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service we promised can deliver . <p> Squaretrade has previously published reports on reliability ; how reliable do you believe current technology truly is ? <p> From a mechanical point of view , having worked at Carphone Warehouse for many years , I believe phones are probably less likely to break now than before . However , most smartphones are made of glass and aluminium so if you drop them , as compared with an older mobile phone , you can do serious damage to the exterior and as soon as you tap it against something it gets scratched . I challenge anyone to say that they have not dropped their phone in the last 12 months ; we 've all done it . <p> What do you think is missing from retailers ' strategies for warranties ? <p> If you go into well-known retailers in the UK , they have offered extended warranty for years and that has n't changed . Banks also offer extended warranty , though one of the big issues with that is that you do n't know who you 're insuring your product with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a retailer or a familiar brand or bank , but often the small print tells you this is actually covered by a third party and that 's why the real issue of a lack of transparency is coming up across the industry . Who is really taken accountability and whose promise is this ? This is a classic move for insurance companies to make money as the business models are not customer-centric . We are a B2C brand and we pride ourselves on that ; I have ambitions of becoming what the AA is to motor insurance . Retail is about helping customers when things go wrong , that is what great service is . We want people to make successful claims and continue to use us and renew their policies or extend them to other products that has got to be the essence of what the business is about . <p> How have your new clients responded to the solution ? <p> Right now , we are most proud of our Tesco relationship which started at the end of last year ; if you go into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they would say themselves it 's been a fantastic launch which was hugely well-received by employees . Staff themselves really believe in the solution so they sell it as they believe it is value for money . The response has been phenomenal as this is about a very simple product where pricing should be transparent and you know what will happen if things go wrong . Often you find there 's lots of small print explaining what is and is n't covered . There must be integrity around the product you sell and if there 's any quibble it 's on us to just pay out the customer at the end of the day , that 's what it is all about . <p> What will European expansion involve in terms of strategy ? <p> We are working on a couple of big deals here in the UK right now , though are very proud of those we have secured already . We have ambitions across the mobile phone space in Europe as well given that it 's one of the most vulnerable technologies consumers use as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get the UK onto a really good platform here before growing across new markets . <p> High-profile campaigns , 
 Mackle , Head of Sales and Services at O2 <h> Monday 17 June 2013 - Editorial Assistant <p> Feilim Mackle , Head of Sales and Services at O2 , spoke to Retail Gazette about the significance of omnichannel in today 's market and how O2 as a business is creating a seamless online and offline experience for customers . ( <p> As becoming ' omnichannel ' becomes an increasingly key focus for retailers in the competitive digital space , what does the word mean to you and why is a seamless experience across stores and online so important ? <p> I believe that all modern retailers should be customer-centric , operating wherever their customers choose to interact and communicate . ' Omnichannel ' is about making it as easy as possible for customers to engage with a brand , and ensuring a consistent experience across every touch point . <p> The power of the internet and the rise of social and mobile technologies have empowered consumers , and their expectations continue to increase . They want to be able to browse online , view in store , pay via mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In today 's digital world , technology should be at the heart of delivering an outstanding customer experience , whether online or offline . It makes it possible for retailers to transform shopping into an interactive and rewarding experience , providing shoppers with the excitement and accessibility they are increasingly coming to expect as standard . <p> O2 uses Twitter and other social networks to engage with customers and offer individual customer service ; why is this medium the preferred way to interact with O2 shoppers and what positive and negative experiences have the team had on these networks that have informed the strategy ? <p> Soaring smartphone usage and the mobile internet have fundamentally changed what people expect from customer service . We know that our customers are increasingly opting to interact through digital channels , including social media which , in O2 's case , has seen an almost five fold increase in customer interaction over the last two years . <p> Instant gratification is now the norm , and customers want a more flexible way to contact companies . Technology and social media are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction , helping to resolve queries faster than many traditional methods . <p> At O2 , we believe it 's crucial to recognise the value of the insight that we gain from these conversations with customers . From information on service performance to feedback on particular devices , the two way dialogue via Twitter enables us to be agile when issues arise , as well as developing a closer relationship with our customers . <p> This insight is also informing the way we work as a business . For example , the strength of interaction on Twitter has led us to implement what we believe to be a global first a system that will see us offer customers the opportunity to check their accounts by tweeting . This innovative new service will be available in the coming months . <p> O2 recently announced new digital customer services ; tell us more about this and how it fits in with your broader omnichannel strategy . <p> Last month we set out bold plans to redefine our customer service offering to better respond to growing demand from customers wanting to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in digital customer service , and investigating how we can further develop our services to serve the customer of the future . <p> O2 was the first company to offer web chat for customer care as opposed to sales , and we want to remain progressive . The investment will allow us to scale up and enhance our digital service channels which are becoming increasingly popular . MyO2 , which allows customers to manage and check their bill online , is currently being used nine million times a month , while web chat services are used three quarters of a million times every month . In addition , we 're also able to facilitate over half a million answers per month in response to questions on the O2 Community forum . <p> O2 is to invest ? 19 million in transforming its stores to streamline these with your digital offer ; what will this transformation involve , how long will it take and to what extent will these create a sense of the retail space as more of a showroom than a traditional store ? <p> Retailers need to recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this multichannel environment needs to be consistent . <p> This means fundamentally changing both the way our stores look and the interactions we provide to our customers . It is no longer enough to simply showcase products in store . The function of the retail environment today should n't be just to sell , but to excite and inform customers . <p> Our investment will be used to create an in-store experience that mirrors shopping with O2 online , recognising that customers are increasingly using a range of channels before making a purchase . For example , we know that 70 per cent of our customers go online to research handsets before they even set foot in one of our stores . <p> Are there any other upcoming developments you can share at this time ? <p> We operate over 450 stores and are responsible for serving more than 23 million customers in the UK , so we know retail and we know mobile . I 'm excited about how technology is going to transform the way we shop in the future . <p> The launch of later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online and in-store . Not only will this make experiences faster , it will also provide ubiquitous connectivity , allowing retailers to connect seamlessly with their customers . Small retailers and pop-up outlets will benefit in particular . Up until now , they have n't necessarily had the time or capital to invest in more than a basic network connection . will give them the same power to enhance the customer experience using technology as their large and more established competitors , and will stimulate innovation across the sector . <h> Like shooting ? 
 cent of UK consumers use loyalty cards regularly <h> Thursday 12 September 2013 - Editorial Assistant <p> When it comes to customer loyalty programmes , UK consumers sign up . Nearly 95 per cent of consumers who took part in research released today by SAS , the leader in business analytics , and retail analyst house , Conlumino , revealed that they had at least one loyalty card and nearly 90 per cent admitted to using them regularly . <p> The findings firmly establish the UK as a leader in fostering consumer loyalty . In fact , just over 40 per cent said they would be less likely to use a retailer without a loyalty scheme . The research found emotional connections are key to fostering customer loyalty as 80 per cent of consumers now believe engaging with a brand emotionally influences their likelihood of making a purchase . <p> The retailers , which have invested in customer loyalty programmes , such as Tesco , Boots UK , Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainbury 's , show the highest emotional connection with consumers in the research - with Tesco coming out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states they are using the information obtained by consumer loyalty card activity to create a " rich and personalised offer " for their customers . <p> This is just what the consumers interviewed indicated they wanted with around 50 per cent saying if offers were personalised that they would be more likely to use that retailer again . Neil Saunders , managing director at Conlumino says : " This really creates a massive opportunity for retailers because those that grasp the opportunity to understand their customers and treat them as individuals , are more likely to see increases in shopping trolley purchases and add to their profit margin . " <p> The findings suggest that consumers are comfortable with retailers collecting data they need to deliver these more personalised offers . Nearly half of consumers have no concerns with loyalty schemes whatsoever . In fact , almost 40 per cent actively opt-in to marketing material from retailers , meaning a significant number believe they can benefit from relevant offers by allowing retailers to market directly to them . <p> The buy-in to loyalty schemes is not just hypothetical over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them more likely to purchase from them , and nearly half would be likely or very likely to use a retailer if they provided personalised offers . In addition , almost a third of consumers are likely to respond to relevant in-store offers , highlighting the increasing importance of location and the potential for mobile services . <p> The business potential for retailers who grasp the opportunity is evident . The largest loyalty scheme in the UK , Nectar , has , according to the website , 19 million collectors and 24 Nectar cards are swiped every second . If every card holder received a personalised offer which resulted in them spending just an extra ? 1 annually , the collective group of retail partners could achieve an additional ? 19-million in revenue . <p> According to Alex Fovargue , SAS UK &amp; Ireland retail specialist , this personalisation becomes even more exciting in the UK 's digitally developed society because customer loyalty is going mobile . " This provides retailers with the opportunity to create instant wins by connecting with customers right when they are making a purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumers would be likely to take advantage of an offer if they received it via their mobile device while standing in store . About the same volume of retailers agreed customers would do just that . " With nearly 88-million mobile phone subscriptions in the UK , the potential business development in getting around 30 percent of that 88-million to accept offers would have a serious impact on the retail industry 's profit margins . " <p> Key to driving this shift will be the adoption of high-performance and visual technology solutions that not only manage big data being collected from loyalty schemes , but also analyse and transform it into valuable customer insights . From here retailers can make decisions based on evidence to deliver the right product , for the right price , at the right time , to the right person and via the right channel . <p> concludes : " This really is the next step for retailers to take to get the maximum return from investment in customer loyalty programmes . The retailers wanting to take this step will be looking for innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom line benefits . SAS , with its depth of experience and heritage in big data analytics , has those answers . " <p> Hugh Broughton Architects

 search engine dominance ? <h> Tuesday 07 February 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> The importance of Search <p> Search has become increasingly important in e-commerce websites . It has become the primary means for customers to find products and is often the first action that a consumers perform when reaching a site . The behaviour of customers prior to purchase is a key part of the way that a website works , as only between 2-5 per cent of visits actually turn into orders . This offers huge potential for sales meaning that search becomes an integral part of the site experience and has a direct impact on profitability . <p> What is ? <p> is a portmanteau word combining search and merchandising . The term was created to define the way that search and e-commerce should interact . It is a key marketing feature of many e-commerce sites although the exact definition of varies across the industry . <p> Some retailers see any , search navigation as delivering . Typically , this means allowing customers to navigate through search results using a set of characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand , colour or size and more recently descriptive ' tags ' supplied by customers . <p> However , more significant benefits are found by optimising search results based upon the other factors . These include filtering capabilities , such as only displaying products that are in-stock . It is also possible to arrange the search results to match a customer 's profile . This type of uses analytics to define customer segments and then feeds the information back into search to maximise the number of relevant products displayed . <p> When done correctly , allows the merchandisers to group products by the same search terms that customers use to find them . These groups of products can then be priced and promoted independently to appeal to particular customer segments . By implication , this relies on having merchandising tools that work in a similar way to searching from the website . <p> What about the Merchandising ? <p> It is important to remember that merchandisers are responsible for the arrangement of products for sale on a website . They need the ability to organise their products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using search to find products . The best tools give the merchandiser good visibility of how their products will appear within customer searches and allow them to adapt quickly to changes in customer behaviour . <p> How much intelligence should be in the Search Engine ? <p> Given the importance of search to retailers , the obvious conclusion is that we should put more intelligence into search . However , there is a major downside to this approach . The more optimisation that happens to the search results , the slower they are to appear on the page . While carefully building the search index to get best results is a good idea , lots of ' post-processing ' of those results can degrade performance . <p> Customers are becoming increasingly impatient and will leave slow sites in favour of competitors . Studies by Amazon have shown that slowing pages by a little as 100ms leads to reduced profitability . To compound this is evidence that internet search engines , such as Google are giving better page rankings to faster sites . In other words , performance affects both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will stay there . <p> Finding the right Search Engine <p> There are several search providers engaged in the e-commerce arena . These are mainly enterprise search engines with a few commerce specialists . Enterprise search solutions include large companies such as Endeca , FAST and Autonomy . The problem with enterprise search is that it offers features that are not applicable to the retail domain . E-commerce search is about finding one type of information Product . It does not need to be able to analyse a wide range of document types or information repositories . In addition , enterprise search solutions can be expensive and can easily exceed the costs of the e-commerce platform . <p> The specialised commerce solutions include companies such as , Mercado and . These platforms offer rich , customer targeted search but have historically being plagued by performance issues , especially when more advanced optimisations are used . <p> One solution is to use open-source search , which has grown in popularity over the years . In particular , the SOLR search that grew out of the Lucene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers comparable features and scalability to proprietary search , but allows the commerce platform to expand without a search licencing overhead . <p> Make Commerce Smarter and Search Faster <p> Unlike databases , search engines work with unstructured data , spreading it out so that it can be retrieved extremely quickly . It makes sense to arrange the search index this way to handle large number of searches on the site . However , there are limits to what search can and should do . <p> Naturally , there are strong market forces at work . Search companies are constantly looking to differentiate themselves from the competition . Often this means expanding their capability into other areas including providing tools to manage product sales hierarchies , having large areas of the site driven by search and integrating analytics functions into search . <p> The problem with an expanded search platform is that the management of products is now split between the e-commerce and search vendors . Search is also using its own content management to manage search specific pages or page areas . Business users are presented with multiple tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make effective merchandising decisions . <p> E-commerce platforms offer a centralised store of enriched product information . They are able to present products in a structured way to merchandisers . This formal separation becomes important when managing multiple sites businesses or channels from a single platform . <p> Crucially , e-commerce can be used to drive any search provider by supplying well organised information about products , customers and business rules to build powerful search indexes . Perhaps now is the time for e-commerce platforms to fully integrate and to deliver the full benefits of without the overheads .@@741237 <h> What song would 
 retailers can reduce rental costs <h> Tuesday 14 February 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> Everywhere you look on the high street , retailers are exiting stores either to try and cut costs or because they have no other choice . <p> The spate of retail insolvencies continue . In 2012 we have already lost Past Times ( for the second time ) while Blacks Leisure , La Senza and Barratts were all bought out of administration , the latter at the expense of around 50 stores . Peacocks meanwhile are still currently in administration , leaving hundreds of surplus stores . <p> Even companies that are still trading are rationalising their portfolios , with Dixons having announced plans to cut a further 70 high street stores and New Look planning to exit as many as 100 units . Arcadia Group , Thorntons , Mothercare , Clintons and Thomas Cook have already embarked on a similar strategy . <p> According to the latest Local Data Company report , Stockport heads the list for retail voids at 30 per cent , while Nottingham , Grimsby , Stockton , Wolverhampton , Blackburn , Walsall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shops lying empty . Leading retail estate firm British Land saw its portfolio depreciated by 0.4 per cent during the last three months of 2011 due largely to the performance of its retail estate which accounts for 61 per cent of its holdings . <p> The UK high street vacancy rate currently stands at 14.3 per cent which equates to around 48,000 empty shops . Prime retail centres are almost fully let ; however secondary and tertiary retail centres are struggling . The north is worse than the south . There is simply too much retail space in places where people do not want to shop . Add to this recent research from Jones Lang Lasalle which shows that 25 per cent of all high street leases will expire by 2013 and 50 per cent by 2015 . <p> It is clear that the landlord-tenant power dynamic is shifting because of this new environment . Retailers may be in a better bargaining position if they wish to stay ; however , this is not the case for those wishing to go . There is little tenant demand , landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faced with similar requests from other struggling occupiers . <p> Nevertheless , retailers should realise that now is a useful opportunity for tenants to consider how they might reduce their real estate liabilities in such torrid trading conditions . OpCapita has recently completed its purchase of Comet and as part of a due diligence exercise of its 248 stores , it is seeking to reduce its ? 77 million rental bill . It is likely to deploy many of the techniques I recommend below : <p> 1 ) Undertake a careful review of your portfolio . Do you have surplus properties those that are already closed or not trading so well ? Identify leases coming up for expiry or with break clauses in them allowing you to terminate them early . Be careful to comply with all conditions of the break for instance , material compliance with repairing covenants . In the current market , landlords are challenging break notices aggressively ; <p> 2 ) Ask your landlord whether it might accept a surrender . Even if the answer is no , you may be able to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant dilapidations claims are becoming commonplace from landlords for whom redevelopment no longer makes commercial sense ; <p> 3 ) Consider sub-letting premises in whole or in part . This is a possibility if you want the property back in the future or if you want to trade from a smaller space . Alternatively , consider an assignment of the lease . If the lease allows subletting or assignment , you will most likely need your landlord 's permission . If the lease does not allow it , ask your landlord to vary the lease ; <p> 4 ) Even if you can not find anyone to pay the rent , you may be able to let rent-free to another occupier , perhaps a charity , so that you can at least reduce your business rates liability ; <p> 5 ) If you are keeping the property , consider negotiating monthly rents to increase cash flow or better still a rent reduction , a rent holiday or a capital contribution . Nick Leslau recently opined that one in four retailers outside of the 50 prime retail centres are paying no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably easier to achieve than walking away from the property completely . Dreams , the bed retailer , is the latest company to ask its landlords for monthly rents in order to improve cash-flow . Consider also asking for downwards rent reviews or turnover rents ; <p> 6 ) Consider other ways of reducing running costs . For instance , can the service charge be reduced ? Is the landlord charging for items that should not be part of your service charge , for instance the running costs of empty units ? <p> 7 ) If all else fails consider formal restructuring . Administrations and corporate voluntary arrangements ( CVAs ) are insolvency processes designed to allow companies to off-load their liabilities and may be an extreme possibility in the absence of agreement . Administrations allow companies to trade out of difficulties whilst a buyer is sought . The frequent outcome is an asset sale to a newco . Landlords are then faced with an unauthorised occupier that they can choose to accept or a vacant property . CVAs usually involve landlords being offered a premium , often six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lease . If 75 per cent of a company 's creditors agree , all creditors are bound by its terms . <p> Unfortunately there is no quick fix to the current retail woes and it is likely that we will continue to read of retailers using these sorts of tactics to try and reduce their retail estate liabilities over the coming months and years .@@753303 <h> Appeal over Tommy

 Williams , Hotel Chocolat 's Head of Retail <h> Monday 16 April 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> Darren Williams says that he started volunteering for the Samaritans seven years ago , while working for Costa Coffee , as a way of finding fulfilment outside of the corporate world . <p> In his current role as Head of Retail at chocolate retailer Hotel Chocolat , it could be said that Williams has found a way in his professional career of combining both his corporate and charitable instincts . <p> Hotel Chocolat co-founders Angus Thirlwell &amp; Peter Harris have never been afraid to stand apart from the crowd and this approach can clearly be seen in the retailer 's unique corporate responsibility programme Engaged Ethics . <p> " We have done some tremendous work in Ghana , from assisting healthcare and funding schools to educating people about how to grow cocoa . " <p> Established as an alternative to Fair Trade accreditation , Engaged Ethics is not a charitable exercise but rather a kind of mission statement from the chocolatier : A promise that the retailer will try to make the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-help programmes and beneficial trading practices . <p> Hotel Chocolat aims to buy the cocoa beans it uses to make its luxury chocolate at prices between 30 to 40 per cent higher than its rivals ; it buys those beans wet rather than processed to ease the farmers ' workload ; and it ensures that all of its ingredients can be traced back to where they were grown . <p> Williams explained : " Being outside of Fair Trade allows us to go over &amp; above some of its basic standards . The way that we buy and pay for our cocoa , and the quality of the products we use alongside the cocoa , are industry leading . " <p> The company is certainly used to being different ; as it operates its own commercial hotel on the Rabot Estate in St Lucia where it grows some of its beans , it insists on referring to its customers as ' guests ' , and it specialises in unique luxury products like its giant chocolate slabs . <p> And being different seems to be paying off , as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British high street over the last couple of years , and in 2011 it reported a pre-tax profit rise of 25 per cent and a 12 per cent jump in revenues . <p> Its latest innovative idea is a **28;294;TOOLONG called Roast &amp; Conch which opened at the beginning of this year in London 's Covent Garden . <p> Conch &amp; Roast is a concept store where ' guests ' can buy hot beverages , savoury dishes , cakes , pastries and breakfast items all made with fresh cocoa which is ground , conched and tempered in front of their eyes . <p> " We have always been proud to be a British Chocolatier , controlling the process from tree to bar , and this new concept gives guests the opportunity to see that process in a new format . " <p> " It is a micro way of bringing the tree to bar process into central London and showing guest some of the work we do . " <p> The format has proved so successful that a second Roast and Conch store will be launched in Copenhagen in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business looks to expand its international footprint after establishing a reputation of quality in the UK . <p> When Williams joined Hotel Chocolat in 2009 it had just opened its 30th store . Last month , that total moved up to 61 with the unveiling of an outlet at the revamped concourse of London 's Kings Cross train station , but the retail boss cautions that it has never been interested in aggressive expansion . <p> Hotel Chocolat stores have been earning plaudits for design and innovation <p> " We have shied away from talking about a target number of stores because it is not really a focus of ours , but , of course , we have to have a number in mind because there has to be a point where your estate reaches maturity . <p> " Right now 75 feels enough . We do not want to be ubiquitous because one of the things which has worked for us is being special . " <p> Exclusivity is central to its offer and that is why , unlike its high street rival Thorntons , it does not wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Williams puts it , you will never find their products " on offer at your local supermarket or petrol station " . <p> Department store John Lewis , which Williams calls " iconic " and perfectly in keeping with Hotel Chocolat 's brand values , is the only other retailer which stocks its products and it has no plans to change this approach . <p> The relative struggles of Thorntons , which has had to significantly reduce its store portfolio due to mounting debts and poor sales , certainly reflects well on Hotel Chocolat 's more contained business model . <p> " We are not a huge business by any means but we are very pacy and what I think is exciting is that we always have an element of " what are they going to do next " about us . " <p> Since Williams joined , the retailer has cemented a reputation for high levels of customer service and attractive stores , which he says are strictly monitored internally to enable the group to regularly update and improve its offer . <p> " I made some deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers guests , and then we completely evolved our in store service proposition in the autumn of 2011 . " <p> The refurbishment of ten older stores in the retailer 's portfolio last year delivered a considerable increase in the like-for-like sales at these locations , and six more store renovations are planned over the coming months . <p> Williams believes that too many retailers are taking a cookie cutter approach to in-store design &amp; service , and the result is that savvy shoppers are becoming increasingly choosy about who they give their cash to . <p> He argues that the era of hundreds of bland identikit big-box stores is over , not least because with so many properties it is difficult keeping them all looking good , and he says that due to the sector Hotel Chocolat operates in its guests want a personal &amp; special shopping experience . <p> " Chocolate is a desirable thing . Often its something you purchase for yourself as a treat or something you buy for someone else that you care about ... It is an emotive and important purchase . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Williams says that innovations such as buying online while in-store and the company 's first mobile app are in the pipeline but will not be launched until they have been perfected . <p> Though trading figures have been healthy for the chocolatier of late , Williams describes the current trading conditions on the high street as the most turbulent he has seen in his 22 years in the industry . <p> " We are taking nothing for granted , its choppy out there and we have to continue to be special to succeed . " <p> Williams faces a very different challenge this weekend as he takes on the London Marathon for the very first time to raise money for Spinal Research . <p> After such long service with the Samaritans , Williams says he is now looking for his next charity to dedicate his time to , whereas , with plenty more to achieve at high flying Hotel Chocolat , it seems unlikely that he will be looking to change jobs any time soon . @ @ @ Behring Breivik

Therefore , as overall demand slows , the worry for Boots is that it will find itself as the ' soft spot ' that most feels the squeeze .

 corporate responsibility <h> Monday 23 July 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> On Thursday June 21st 2012 , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced that UK companies will have to declare their greenhouse gas emissions in the hopes of creating a more sustainable form of business . <p> Clegg felt that the ruling was necessary as , despite protestations from leading companies that they operate in a ' green ' way , there are many who do not have any tangible way of proving this . <p> Retailers have now started to review policies to make sure they are keeping on top of their carbon footprint . <p> Last month , high street stalwart Marks and Spencer ( M&amp;S ) was the first major retailer to be declared carbon neutral due to its ' Plan A ' programme , which sees the business now recycle 100 per cent of waste with nothing deposited in landfill sites . <p> Winning a host of awards , most recently the ' Responsible Business of the Year 2012 ' at the Business in the Community Awards for Excellence , the retailer is almost unrivalled when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of changing a business model in these current times , though it is possible that this could be a shrewd economic move as well as an ethical one . <p> Daniel Himsworth , Corporate PR Manager at M&amp;S , told Retail Gazette that ' Plan A ' has helped to inject money into this strategy due to early successes . <p> He said : " We 're very clear on the business case for becoming a more sustainable business . <p> " In 2007 we set aside ? 200 million for ' Plan A ' ( originally a five year plan ) . " In only its second year , Plan A delivered significant cost benefits to M&amp;S and opened up new revenue streams . <p> " In year three it returned a net benefit , or profit if you like , and last year ( year five ) it had a net positive effect to the tune of ? 105 million . <p> " That 's ? 105 million that M&amp;S would either have had to find from elsewhere or simply would not have had in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , regardless of the economic climate , Plan A is not a cost to the business , quite the opposite and therefore it is the right thing to do for the business , for our customers , for our shareholders and stakeholders . " <p> Since its launch , ' Plan A ' has recruited over five million customers , which demonstrates that a community centric plan helps the public to buy into the sincerity of a retailer 's convictions . <p> Helen Drury , Policy Advisor at the British Council for Shopping Centres ( BCSC ) feels that latest initiatives by retailers in the run up to the Olympic Games have really caught the imagination of local community spirit up and down the country . <p> She said : " We have seen initiatives launched in the run up to the Games already , especially with the Olympic sponsors and the campaigns they have been doing . <p> " Proctor &amp; Gamble have done the ' Great Street Clean ' , trying to get community spirit together and gathering excitement which is really a good engagement tool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Anecdotally , supermarkets give out vouchers for sports equipment and we will definitely see more of that in the run up the Games . " <p> Drury believes the Olympics organisers pride themselves on making it as sustainable an event as possible and create inroads to improve upon that principle year on year . <p> " Every year they say the Olympics have been the most sustainable year , " she explained . <p> " Sustainability and sports culture have been core principles of the Olympic Games since 1994 so I think it has an aim to drive sustainability . <p> " What will remain to be seen is how much of a legacy does that leave after the Games have finished ? <p> " Hopefully that something people will tap into and as it raises awareness then it becomes more important . " <p> As part of its work , the BCSC encourages government legislation which would force companies to review their ethical standpoint though Drury acknowledged the need for the group to be more supportive rather than simply coming up with a rigid policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation to benefit retailers already struggling to make money in a tough climate . <p> " At the moment , the policy landscape is quite confusing and complex and we see a better way as a tied policy replacing environmental tax with greenhouse gas reporting , " Drury said . <p> " That would be a much better policy scenario than the Carbon Reduction Commitment ( CRC ) as it stands at the moment . <p> " We are supportive of government legislation when linked in with another policy . " <p> Online fashion retailer Asos has found a way to make its brand more responsible without necessarily having to spend a lot of money in this area and seeks to uphold the name of what it calls ' fashion with integrity ' . <p> As well as having a dedicated team of employees in ethical trade , sustainable fashion , sustainable business and community , the e-tailer works with several high profile charities including the Prince 's Trust , Oxfam and the Retail Trust . <p> Extending to the ethical standards of clothes sold on the site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stephanie O'Reilly , Senior Press Officer at Asos , said : " The Asos Africa range is designed by Asos and produced by a social enterprise in Kenya , Soko . <p> " We are very proud of the work we have done together and plan to develop this further as we are also helping Soko build a new workshop . <p> " Corporate Responsibility ( CR ) in clothing crosses many areas and we are working very hard behind the scenes to be able to communicate the many different ways that brands or companies are tackling corporate responsibility issues . " <p> O'Reilly says Asos has the benefit of still being a young company in a position to provide inspiration to other online retailers and there are numerous plans in the pipeline to become more ethically focused in its business strategy . <p> " Asos are still a young company and we are a fast growing , fast changing , and increasingly global business , " she added . <p> " All those factors can add to the challenges of making steps to improve Corporate Responsibility ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Asos is excellent at running with a new idea and responding rapidly , so we are very positive about the future . <p> " Asos recently joined the ' UN Global Compact ' , which demonstrates our commitment across four core areas - Human Rights , Labour Conditions , Environment and Anti-Corruption and we want to consistently improve in all these areas . " <p> Drury acknowledged that raising your sustainability profile is important , not just for government legislation reasons but to uphold your reputation as a retailer . <p> She commented : " It is your investors or the public that can see what you are doing to manage those emissions .

 supplier Hall of Shame <h> Friday 19 October 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> Supermarket chain Sainsbury 's has today been criticised over its move to more than double payment times to all of its non-food suppliers . <p> Last month , the grocer wrote to its non-food suppliers explaining that payment times have now increased from 30 to 75 days , claiming that the change would allow it to align itself with standard industry practice . <p> As a result of this letter , the Forum of Private Business has ( FPB ) has written to inform the chain that it is being added to its Hall of Shame and called on it to sign the Government 's Prompt Payment Code and pledge to pay suppliers on time without changing terms &amp; conditions once a contract has been agreed . <p> The FPB 's Policy Adviser Robert Downes attacked Sainsbury 's ' decision as being unethical , commenting : " Sainsbury 's might like to promote themselves as the ethical supermarket , but when it comes to their treatment of suppliers they are anything but . <p> " No right thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 per cent increase in the time it takes them to pay a supplier for goods provided as being fair and decent . <p> " With startling arrogance they have then tried to justify this increase by claiming 75 days is the industry standard . This is utter fabrication . " <p> Rival grocer Tesco has signed the pledge already and doing so allows small firms , which are owed around ? 37 billion in unpaid invoices at any one time according to research carried out by Bacs , to safeguard themselves against financial damage . <p> Downes explained that such changes leave small businesses with little choice but to accept due to fear of losing business which is not an option given the economic climate and called on the Government to do more in stamping out the issue . <p> " For the sake of small businesses and the economy , the Government must prioritise tackling the culture of poor payment , addressing the bully boy behaviour of these bigger companies , " Downes said . <p> " We are hoping the Groceries Code Adjudicator , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from acting like this certainly for food suppliers , behaviour which we think is likely contrary to the Grocery Supply Code of Practice . <p> " In the meantime we will continue to give small firms a voice by holding slow-paying firms to account publicly in our late payment Hall of Shame .

 importance of ' newness ' <h> Monday 05 November 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> It took a Spanish fashion brand to make the UK retail sector sit up and take notice of just how important the introduction of new stock is to both increasing footfall and improving margins . I n 1998 , Zara opened on London 's Regent Street and thus began not just a retail fashion revolution . " Fast " and " new " became buzz words throughout retailing and everyone was interested in this new business model . At Zara , fresh designs were being introduced twice a week and the excitement among shoppers was such that the keenest not only knew which day the deliveries were due but what time the new styles would be coming out onto the shop floor . The " limited " product flew out of the shop at full price . <p> In " modern " terms , Asos is probably the new Zara . It uses newness as a USP , introducing 1,500 new lines per week which makes for a unique shopping experience each time a user logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) match the " newness " level of Zara , it did have an impact on competitors who over the last decade have moved far away from what was the de facto twice-yearly deliveries with the occasional mid-season collection . Asos is having a similar impact on retailing today , leading the way within the internet world of retailing . <p> Forget about twice-weekly deliveries , though . Young customers , such as the 16-24-year-old age group , are checking their favourite websites on a daily basis and if they do not see something new , they quickly lose interest . While this puts increased pressure on the supply chain , the rewards of working within short cycle times can have a dramatic effect on margins . <p> At Kurt Salmon , we have calculated that for every week saved within the product development cycle , the realised margin is improved by 25 base points . We know of several retailers which have already reduced their total product development cycle time by more than 50 per cent over the past three years , so the best practice benchmark has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react fast have adopted a leaner and more collaborative supply chain policy , which often begins by looking at where they are sourcing production . The best practitioners generally opt for a balanced strategy that incorporates bulk production made in the Far East with " local " ( ie close by ) production handling in-season repeat buys and the " must have " trend that emerges from left field . <p> However , it is not just about where to source that has to change : to react fast the whole product development cycle needs to be reviewed . Retailers need to challenge all their processes : where can they take time out of the process , how can they speed up decisions , how late can they leave activities such as cloth dying etc before having to make a final commitment ? Answers to these questions are vital to generating the new product that will deliver good margins . <p> But the onus of creating newness can be devolved to a third party . For instance , Designers at Debenhams was conceived to add something new to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . This has generated a huge amount of interest and sales and the number of designers included within the roster is continually increased to add freshness and newness . <p> Other great exponents of generating newness and reaping the benefits are H&amp;M and Topshop with their celebrity ranges and there will never be a shortage of those . It is a relatively easy way to appeal to that all important 16-24-year-old target audience . <p> So why is it that some retailers are good at " newness " and others are not . We looked at fashion retailers that excel in innovation and bringing ' newness ' to market and their operations have six characteristics in common : <p> Customer focussed they all have regular interaction with their customers , understanding their behaviours and desires in detail <p> Fast quick decision making improves their capability to take new ideas to market <p> Remember the Mean 
 - Everyone 's at it <h> Tuesday 20 November 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> In those dark , grey , drizzly pre-internet days , direct sales was a revolution giving people , and notably women , the chance to run their own business . <p> The well-worn business model of direct sales was proven for decades for thousands as a source of additional income .

The US seems to be a step ahead of the UK in the direct selling market . We launched Stella &amp; Dot to the UK last year .

US entrepreneurs like Jessica Herrin founder and CEO of Stella &amp; Dot had seen and seized this opportunity way before Zuckerberg made his bold statement . <p> Even advanced retailers are still trying to work out how to surf the ' s-wave ' and incorporate social-selling into their business models . An example in the past month is the Tesco pop-up Facebook Halloween shop . The temporary shop enabled fans of Tesco to benefit from exclusive previews and discounts available through a specially designed pop-up app . <p> Retailers trying to tack s-commerce onto their business models are finding it harder than those that already have a sociable selling model that lends itself to existing in an online space . However , this desire to embrace s-commerce is a sign of the change in the market landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels has leapt and companies are desperately trialing different methods to integrate s-commerce to find out what works with their market . <p> As direct selling is the UK 's largest provider of part time , independent earning it would make sense for more direct selling companies to take their lead from companies that use s-commerce . The lucrative market has changed , the consumers are tech savvy , they reside on facebook , they post on twitter , they do n't have house phones to call and doorbells to ring nowadays . They rely on texts and find out what their neighbours are up to by trawling through their recent status updates . <p> Currently it is thought that around 81 per cent of consumers receive advice from friends and family when purchasing a product through a social networking site and almost three quarters of consumers rely on social networks to guide their purchases . <p> This shift in need for ease , simplicity and integrated networking has been addressed by the invention and growth of social commerce .

 uses new look technology <h> Monday 22 November 2010 - Editorial Assistant <p> Fashion retailer New Look 's flagship store in the Republic of Ireland is using new display technology to help make its mark in the city . <p> The outlet , which opened in the capital 's Jervis Centre earlier this month , has installed tech provider Christie 's MicroTiles solution to promote its product range and get customers moving around the shop . <p> It is the first time this technology has been used by a fashion retailer in the UK or Ireland , and its main function is to catch the attention of shoppers as they make their way around the store . <p> Multimedia solutions provider Mood Media Corporation supplied the media team who developed the animated content broadcast through the MicroTiles . <p> James , UK Channel Sales Manager at Christie EMEA , commented : " The ability to reconfigure the MicroTiles within the store in line with the fashion seasons formed an important part of the initial brief , and highlights the compelling impact and flexibility that Christie MicroTiles can offer within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look comes after Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo opened a new outlet in Kent retail hub Bluewater last month , which uses new technology to create an element of theatre in the store . <p> Consumers entering the store are met by two rectangular screens on pillars either side of the entrance that display the company 's different fashions , brands and marketing videos . <p> Commenting at the time , Uniqlo CEO Simon Coble said : " We are really pleased with the new look and the large screens . <p> " We put the mezzanine in to get two floors , but left space at the front of the shop to create the feeling of height and enhance the drama .

 - the challenges ahead <h> Thursday 02 December 2010 - Editorial Assistant <p> Senior HR professionals ' top three organisational priorities for the next 12 months have been listed as managing costs , growing the business and focusing on customer need . <p> The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development 's ( CIPD ) HR Outlook survey , from where these figures derive , also shows that key targets for the HR function are managing change &amp; cultural transformation , employee engagement and improving performance management &amp; reward . <p> Interestingly , but perhaps unsurprisingly , senior HR staff in the private sector are more focused on employee engagement than those in the public sector , where managing costs is the most pertinent issue in the wake of the government 's Comprehensive Spending Review . <p> Grocery HR <p> But what is the situation in the retail sector ? The top grocers in the UK have varying staff retention levels , suggesting that some businesses in the industry are better than others at engaging their workforce . <p> Waitrose , which is part of the John Lewis Partnership , provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's profits through its annual bonus scheme , which means it is often namedropped as one of the top places to work in industry surveys . <p> A spokesperson for Waitrose told Retail Gazette that the company 's staff retention level is 17.7 per cent - a favourable rate compared to the grocery market average . <p> " Our Partnership model has a direct impact on our good levels of staff retention , " she added . <p> " Its ultimate purpose is the happiness of all its members , through their worthwhile and satisfying employment in a successful business . <p> " As the Partnership is owned in trust for its members , employees share the responsibilities of ownership as well as its rewards - profit , knowledge and power . " <p> On the other hand , and in the week that the company saw two senior members of staff leave to start jobs at rival retailers , Sainsbury 's Retail Resourcing &amp; Development Manager Duncan Ingram admitted that his business 's " retention levels are currently below or at the industry average " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser Rebecca Clake , who worked in Boots ' HR team for three years earlier in her career , thinks the wider retail industry should try to instill a particular workforce ethos because success does not just come from a set structure . <p> Commenting on the Waitrose situation , she said : " The Partnership structure is part of the company 's success , but it also has a lot to do with how the firm involves staff , treats people and the consequent culture this creates . <p> " People need to feel respected , trust their manager and play a part in business decisions - it 's about building a place of employment where you would want your friends and family to work . " <p> She added that HR issues in the retail industry are not evidently different to other sectors - challenges tend to be set in relation to size of company rather than type of business - but there is perhaps more need for customer focus than in other industries . <p> " Focusing on customer needs should be at the forefront of retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they are trying to achieve , " Clake stated . <p> " But whatever industry you operate in , you must meet the needs of that particular business . " <p> Improvement <p> How is this best achieved though ? HR is a key department for every organisation , including those involved in the retail world , but there are a number of steps people in this profession need to take to improve the way they work . <p> One area of HR that employees can develop , according to the CIPD , is the behaviour described by the group as " curiosity " . <p> The organisation 's new HR Profession Map indicates that while being personally credible , driven to deliver and collaborative are high on the list of skills possessed by the UK 's HR staff , knowledge about the environment they work in could be better . <p> said : " Being driven to deliver - a skill that is very relevant to those in the retail sector - is a key HR behaviour , but more people can show an active interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower in the months ahead <p> Developing in such a way can help make HR departments even more integral to their respective businesses as we move into a new year , and it appears there will be more manpower in the coming months to help departments achieve these goals , with CIPD 's HR Outlook showing senior HR professionals are preparing to invest in future talent . <p> Some 27 per cent of those questioned expect to take on HR graduate trainees in the next year , which is 20 per cent up on the number who did so in the last 12 months . Perhaps this shows that HR departments are now ready to expand again after a period of transformation , which saw 51 per cent of respondents saying their HR function had changed structure in the last two years . <p> CIPD 's study also claims the majority ( 53 per cent ) of HR professionals have had a pay rise in the last 12 months , while the proportion of interviewees that experienced pay freezes and pay cuts in that time total 40 and three per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be it in retail or in other industries , a key challenge for HR departments will be to weave their way into the fabric of their respective organisations in the months ahead . <p> remarked : " What we would like to see - and it is something going on at many companies at the moment - is HR priorities being set based on the business 's overall priorities . <p> " HR must be involved in the business planning stages . HR must be plugged in . " <p> It is clear that representatives of the retail industry agree , and as 2011 progresses retailers may wish to increase HR departments ' overall involvement in business strategy . After all , as Sainsbury 's Ingram explains : " An efficient and effective HR department contributes towards the bottom line for a company . " <h> No More Menswear 
 up with Scott Storey , Managing Director of retail management and solutions provider CTS Retail , to find out his thoughts on contactless payment , POS technology and other issues facing the sector today . <p> How quickly do you anticipate the majority of retailers introducing contactless payment systems ? The retail world is now very consumer led , and delivering the complete user experience across all channels will be the primary driver for the next 12 to 18 months . With this in mind I do not see the majority of retailers adopting contactless payment systems for at least three to five years . <p> What are the best innovations in POS/EPOS available to retailers in today 's market ? With increasing consumer demand and customer loyalty heavily associated with the cross-channel experience , every retailer is looking to consolidate all of the disparate channels to gain a single view , deliver consistent levels of service and a better customer experience . Solutions such as Torex Retail J , BT Expedite &amp; Fresca 's Integrated Store and Cervello are good examples of solutions that provide a single view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . <p> Which retailers are leading the way when it comes to incorporating cutting edge technology ?

 3 things retailers can learn <h> Thursday 05 December 2013 - Editorial Assistant <p> Monday evening saw the first episode of Liberty of London a fly-on-the-wall documentary , going behind the scenes at one of Britain 's oldest and most beloved department stores . Nestled in the heart of London 's shopping district , you would be forgiven for mistaking this listed building for a museum on first glance . And maybe it is . Liberty has been in London for 138 years when it was first made famous for its import of oriental rugs , hand-picked eclectic goods and the now famous Liberty print fabrics . <p> In recent years the store has had to pick up the pace and modernise in order to keep up with its competitors . As MD Ed Burstell stated in Monday 's opening episode ' you have to adapt to survive . ' Brought in as MD in 2010 , Ed has helped to bring the department store back from the brink and out of the red . As Liberty evolves and gets to grips with new ways of engaging customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all retailers . These are issues that , at ShopperTrak , we work on closely with our clients on a day-to-day basis <p> Maximise and analyse the space <p> The shape of the Liberty building does n't automatically lend itself as ' selling space ' with much of the stock lining corridors around the central atrium . In the first episode , one of the key issues facing staff was understanding the sales breakdown per square foot , to determine how departments were performing and whether each area of sales potential was being maximised . It 's a problem that many retailers face , particularly when it comes to reporting and quantifying the performance of the business . Staff at Liberty were forward thinking in their approach , converting storage space and even a disused toilet on the top floor into a beauty and treatments room . <p> Customer service <p> ' What do you call a comfortable time to be waiting at a till ? ' asks one member of staff to another . ' Two minutes ? ' he responds . ' I would probably leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the biggest hurdles that retailers face . In a busy world where time is precious , waiting too long is hugely off-putting and can cause shoppers to abandon the purchase altogether . Being able to monitor , predict and take proactive action on queue times is a key weapon in a retailer 's armoury . <p> Staff training <p> The Christmas shop is one of the annual highlights at Liberty and with it comes an influx of new staff . Quite rightly , the department store takes training very seriously and frequently carries out mystery shopper exercises to see how staff are performing , including those that are doing well and those who may need more support . The personal touch , so synonymous with the luxury of Liberty , means that staff often develop relationships with customers and Monday 's episode took a look at some of the training around capturing the customer and building a rapport . This is of course driven by incentives - when talking about its ? 2,000 stuffed bear ; the line manager remarked : ' there will be something very special for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that understand which of their staff perform better in which environment , at certain times of the day and with specific types of customer are able to deliver better sales . It 's almost guaranteed that Shukla , a top sales person with 40 years ' experience of working at Liberty , would be on the rota in at power hours . <p> By knowing the space , taking the time to offer adequate training and offering excellent customer service , the documentary tapped in to some of the key triggers that retailers can use to create a tailored shopping experience and develop a sense of brand loyalty . Which is perhaps why Liberty has done so well in recent months . Roll on episode two ...@@2015649 <p> The NCA Arts 
 It 's all about loyalty <h> Friday 20 December 2013 - Editorial Assistant <p> Following on from our review last week , it was with anticipation that the ShopperTrak team tuned in for the second instalment of Channel 4 's ' Liberty of London ' , returning to the store where preparations for the run-up to Christmas were already underway . Loyalty was at the heart of this week 's episode as the programme examined how staff interact with shoppers to build a rapport , tailoring their service to suit the individual and to provide the best possible customer experience . <p> Customer service <p> In any line of business , customer service is of paramount importance , and in retail , it has a direct effect on whether or not the shopper will return to the store . This is even truer at Liberty where high-end price tags mean that everything must be perfect for the consumer to justify making the investment . In episode two , viewers met Jules and Trudy in the haberdashery department who know many of their customers by name , even receiving Christmas gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the difference at Liberty is that customers are treated ' like people , not cash cows . ' The business also recognises its best staff and knows when to put them on the shop floor , paying close attention to busy periods . <p> Management of customer relationships can differ between departments . In the carpet section for example , head of department , Bruce , stressed the importance of maintaining a strong level of trust with each of his customers . Whether they 're a teacher or a multi-millionaire , ' nobody wants it publicised that they 're spending an awful lot of money ' he explained , asking the cameraman to leave during one transaction later in the programme . <p> Staff sell more than just merchandise <p> It can be easy to underestimate how powerful staff can be for selling the brand to a customer and it 's vital that retailers understand that they are the company 's best ambassadors . Monday 's episode highlighted the enthusiasm of Liberty 's staff assistant Judy Rose beamed as she talked about a fabric that the company had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics , has a house filled almost entirely with Liberty purchases . Employees such as Emma , who have worked at the store for over 20 years , are prime examples of the importance of staff loyalty and ensuring they are rewarded in return for hard work . ' I will never work anywhere else , ' said Emma , ' I am Liberty ' . Those who are performing well should be encouraged with incentives for meeting targets for example . <p> While the customer is always a priority for the retailer , it is essential that staff are too they are your primary ambassadors . Get this right and loyalty to the brand , as shown at Liberty , will develop from the inside out .@@2048755 <p> For me , 
 Lewis ' Head of Format Development Tim Harrison <h> Thursday 06 September 2012 - Editorial Assistant <p> Bearing in mind this week 's LDC figures on shop vacancy rates and the North/South divide , why were Exeter , York and Chelmsford chosen for this initial phase of growth ? <p> We do n't have that many shops so it is a case of considering what our current coverage in the UK looks like and what the gaps in that coverage are . When looking to the future , we are thinking about the macroeconomic situation , for those regions . As a result of my remit it is much easier for me to look at target locations . Having said that , there are certain centres that I look at and think have either been underinvested in or are being underinvested in over time . <p> Exeter is a really great example of a town which has been completely committed to focusing on its city centre and the amount of investment going on now is huge . Right now , there is work going on in that town to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers . That has been thought about and retailers have been asked what needs to be done ahead of work starting . In line with that , the Council makes sure that the retailer mix is one which is very credible and which will bring customers to it . <p> York is slightly different ; unlocking York has been incredibly different as there is a strong heritage in the city centre , a lot of history to it and to get into that city centre was extremely hard . Though this is often the way with growth strategy and shows how opportunity aligns with that as well . We know we want to be in that part of Yorkshire but we must look at how opportunities unlock themselves and how quickly we can do that . We have been working with York for a number of years with our old formats and with our new formats it meant that opportunities were available more easily . <p> Chelmsford is a great example of somewhere that is making a big step forward in terms of investment in the city as well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have good products and present these to our customers they will buy them and exactly the same is true of retail shops . If you put a good collection of shops in a really nice retail environment and it beats off the competition then you are going to attract more customers ; it 's relatively straightforward stuff . Those have been three great examples of places that we have worked closely with but also taken the bull by the horns and got a good strategy to make sure that we have a good retail future . That is the real challenge as it 's not just about the here and now and making sure that you 're taking cash but actually being certain that customers are going to want to come in the long-term to your centre and we need to make sure it is sustainable , which is a real challenge . <p> What factors are taken into consideration when making expansion plans ? <p> The first thing has got to be the gap in the market ; what does our offering currently look like and how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dynamic retail environment ? All retailers are looking at that and asking themselves that question but we know that we do n't cover all our customers by any stretch of the imagination so for us there is a real opportunity . We look to find the market opportunity first and then within that , what are the best centres and which best suit you . <p> There are a number of centres where we have not necessarily gone with the prime location in terms of current trading but actually we have a great trading operation . Swindon and Poole are great examples of where we have taken in one case a brand new retail centre and made it very successful . So it is about making a sustainable centre through working with landlords and the Council . <p> Why was Exeter chosen as the location for your first pop-up and what feedback has there been from locals on the store as well as the upcoming flexible format unit ? <p> It has been phenomenal and a very exciting time for everyone involved in the pop-up shop . The reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in such a different way within such a quick timeframe has been very exciting . The reaction of customers has been phenomenal on site and actually it has been great to engage with them before we open the shop . We can explain the products we have in the shop and what makes John Lewis different so they have been really engaged with it from day one . It 's early days and we are absolutely thrilled . It 's a really good opportunity to raise excitement and make sure that the people of Exeter understand what we are doing and how it is running . We can do this in a number of ways through marketing but actually one of the best marketing tools we have are our partners and having them there talking to the customers has made such a difference . The way they are able to engage , touch and feel the product and , in the modern world the fact that you can start doing click &amp; collect now so that the product can be delivered to Exeter just helps launch the shop when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rolled out now and how will this improve your overall offering ? <p> The beauty of the flexible format is that it allows us to take a variety of sizes of unit so it 's back to this point about where the strategy and opportunity align together . The flexible format gives us many more viable opportunities and shows us how customers are using omnichannel and the internet and how they use it both in shops and at home and how they research products . This allows us to alter the size of the department and how and what we show in a way that optimises the site so that we can fit a full John Lewis proposition into a variety of sizes of shop . When we started with Exeter we thought if we stretched it we could make it work for us and it has been a phenomenal effort to get the shop open as quickly as we have but also designed and built up on a completely new format as quickly as it has been . York we will just go bigger again ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be fantastic . <p> The original work has all been done here by our Format Development teams with some design help from externals and the size of the shop , operating model and the size of the branch involves a lot of internal work . However , this was always a conversion of an existing scheme and that 's why I am so thrilled with the work that has been done converting this into a brand new scheme with a brand new design that will look absolutely stunning . <p> " If I

 n't be afraid of selling online <h> Thursday 30 January 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> While big brands have traditionally dominated the e-commerce market , small businesses are slowly beginning to tap into online sales as a way to reach new customers and boost revenues . While 82 per cent of small businesses have a traditional website and 49 per cent are using social media to promote their business online , only 21 per cent have a mobile website . It 's clear that small businesses recognise that the web offers many opportunities but opening an online store is not without its challenges . As a result , many independent retailers are nervous of branching out online or growing their presence across new channels like mobile . <p> However small businesses do n't need to go it alone ; marketplaces can support retailers looking to sell online without incurring the maintenance and marketing costs of running websites on their own . However , just like a physical store getting the online shopping experience right is crucial to build loyal customer relationships here 's how to make the most of selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to widen your horizons <p> While retailers on the high street benefit from a steady flow of shoppers walking by , online retailers are faced with the challenge of driving shoppers to their website in order to sell to them . Advertising through search engines and promotion on social media can help small businesses to increase the volume of visitors , however this can be time intensive and requires considerable investment to generate strong results , hitting retailers ' margins . Just like real world markets , with a marketplace retailers have the chance to reach a large numbers of shoppers so that they can focus on selling product and delivering a great experience , rather than driving traffic to a website . <p> Build consumer trust <p> Some shoppers still remain hesitant about buying items without being able to see and touch them , particularly if they are buying from an unfamiliar brand . While big brand retailers benefit from being well known , consumer trust online is limited for small businesses selling through their own website . Joining a trusted marketplace gives small businesses the ability to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that they are paying for and wo n't lose their money . The tangible experience continues to make your store on the high street unique and you can bring this local trust online with the support of a well known name . <p> A solid system is essential <p> Creating and maintaining an online store can be incredibly challenging for small businesses . From setting up a system for payments to updating the product inventory , a range of challenges must be overcome before retailers can even open the doors to customers . Conversely , with a marketplace the necessary systems are already in place and are even optimised for mobile shoppers , enabling retailers to start shifting stock straightaway and focus on delivering a great experience across numerous channels . <p> Foster customer loyalty <p> A loyal group of regular shoppers can be the lifeblood of a small business , but on the web it can be hard to encourage repeat purchases when the next retailer is just a click away , especially during a sale when shoppers are often scouring the web for bargains . <p> Introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return . Tapping into an existing loyalty programme to reward customers for shopping means that small businesses can focus on building a loyal base of customers through delivering a high quality experience . <p> Ultimately , although many small retailers realise that online presents opportunities for them , many are frightened of losing their personality online . How do they ensure that the personalised customer service and unique approach they adopt instore is n't lost online ? How do they build the equivalent of the relationships they have with the local community online ? It 's imperative that you have the freedom to build a unique personality online which reflects your brand offline . Through fully branded shop fronts and by using direct customer marketing you can target shoppers effectively and grow your small business . With the support of a marketplace behind you it will be much easier .@@2267054 <h> Dr John Farrer 
 retail - opportunities and challenges <h> Friday 07 February 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> The online retail sector has seen significant growth over the past five years , doubling its share of the market . In October 2013 , it accounted for around of all retail sales in Britain with an average weekly spend of just over ? . The latest announcements from Waitrose and Tesco to develop their click and collect services on London Underground stations demonstrates how retailers are striving to diversify their delivery service . The announcement by Westfield shopping centre , to incorporate dressing rooms and a returns capability within their click and collect service , again highlights the shift in focus to multichannel retail and the need to capture new customers and meet ever-changing demands in service . <p> This continued rise in online shopping brings both opportunities and challenges for UK businesses . Opportunities sit in cross-border e-commerce , with forecasts from the Interactive Media in Retail Group ( IMRG ) , predicting that cross-border online sales for UK retailers would reach ? in 2013 . Having a diverse international customer base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , and increase the potential reach of products . Research from DHL and IHS into how internationalisation can drive business performance , has also found that businesses that export internationally are twice as likely to be successful as those that operate only in their domestic market . <p> There is a growing appetite for British products internationally and according to Nielson and Paypal , the UK now stands as the second most popular shopping destination for online shoppers overseas ( after the USA ) , but ahead of China and Germany . Online fashion giant ASOS enjoyed a rise in annual sales to Australia in 2012 as a result of a lack of local online competition and strength of the Australian dollar . Smaller businesses tend to be more cautious when it comes to thinking about exporting overseas and minor setbacks can sometimes feel overwhelming . There is however a good range of services and information available to businesses that do want to look to overseas to pursue growth . <p> The rise of online and the need for a fast and reliable delivery processes allows consumers greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased ease of purchasing through mobile sites and the development of click and collect sites , continues to remove the need for consumers to visit the high street . With the high street operating in a challenging environment for several years now , retailers must consider ways to continue to be a destination of choice for consumers . <p> Footfall data supports this trend , with the BRC reporting footfall figures in December 2013 as 2.4% lower than 2012 and high streets seeing the greatest fall , down 3.7% . This again reflects how the rapid rise of online retail is changing the face of shopping and how consumers are adapting their spending patterns . This continued trend , although a challenge , can be adapted to and retailers should look to their in site retail units to identify possibilities to diversify their offer . <p> Companies that look to include an additional service can increase footfall and the opportunity of linger longer sales . Rymans and Robert Dyas are good examples , introducing DHL 's Servicepoint as an additional service . DHL 's Servicepoint , is an in-store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers existing customers , as well as inviting DHL customers to the stores .

 out-of-town stores ? <h> Wednesday 19 February 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> Today , convenience is retail 's little darling , with sales soaring where other channels suffer . IGD forecasts this trend to continue , with the value of the convenience sector expected to grow from ? 35.6bn in 2013 to ? 42.2bn by 2018 . <p> However , despite this spike in growth and change in fashion , the convenience store is one of retail 's veterans , with retailers like Marks &amp; Spencer breaking into the sector in the 1930s . Its heritage appeared threatened in 2006 as large multi-stores battled for loyalty , offering shoppers the ability to buy goods in bulk at a cheaper price . This change to the industry killed off the corner shop . Then , the rise of hypermarkets , out-of-town shopping centres and online shopping crippled the high street and led to many retailers going bankrupt . <p> But now convenience is starting to take back its crown as retail giants like Tesco and Sainsbury 's see growth only in convenience stores and are investing in smaller , more cash-rich spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more shoppers picking up their goods on the way home from work rather than travelling out-of-town , what will become of these large ' supermarket ' and ' hypermarket ' spaces ? <p> Shopper lifestyle changes <p> The spike in sales across the convenience sector is viewed collectively as a response to consumer demand . Changes to shopper lifestyles are always a key factor in what shapes the industry . Some may argue that as consumers , we now spend more time interacting with our smart devices than with each other and this has implications for the retail sector . <p> Not only are we more in tune with e-commerce and m-commerce , but our beloved devices have also unlocked the digital door for alternative working patterns . The ability to work remotely 24/7 has led workers to check their emails , write proposals and enter conference calls without needing to be in the office . It could be argued that there is now an expectation for people to stay connected all the time leaving them with fewer hours for their own ' life admin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . Many consumers consider life too short to be pushing a trolley up and down multiple aisles to find a ready meal and a pint of milk - especially when these remote workers can find a Sainsbury 's Local at their train station or at the end of their road . After all , why would they spend longer than necessary trekking further afield to a larger out-of-town store ? <p> Unless of course , they need to buy multiple items , the convenience store does n't stock all the items on their list , or they are n't willing to pay the price for convenience . <p> Overcoming the convenience killer <p> It was the big format stores and the internet that initially killed the high street , but the former category is now in danger of becoming the next victim on the hit list . If shoppers are redefining what they mean by convenient , then retailers must take their convenience strategy to the next level . <p> Many French retailers , like Auchan , are offering ' Click and Collect ' ' customers the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery produce . Similarly , Tesco are also trialling stores which go beyond traditional grocery shopping . The opening of their Watford store last year included more than just general merchandise , but a Giraffe partnership , spaces for yoga classes and even baby gyms . The future of their larger spaces plans to continue enticing customers beyond grocery with gyms , dry cleaners and restaurants . They want to make stores a " community space " where shoppers want to spend time , and in turn , spend money . <p> Planet Retail predicts the blur between bricks and mortar to evolve even further in future by offering shoppers the hybrid shopping experience , catering to every customer with any need . The future of retail space will see ' Drive ' pick-up points , a focus on fresh food , multiple checkout options , serviced counters and encouragement for impulse buys . A blend of both the physical store and ecommerce could be the perfect method for creating a well-rounded multichannel offering . <p> In conclusion , there is a danger that larger spaces will turn into empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if retailers opt to redefine what is meant by convenience to their shoppers , and move closer to a hybrid shopper experience , they could reinvent the spaces getting left behind into the stores of tomorrow . <p> Websites are now 
 tricks of the trade reviewed <h> Wednesday 09 April 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> Monday night 's Shop Secrets : tricks of the trade programme was a massively interesting insight by Harry Wallop into how retailers use various upselling techniques . This was episode 4 of an eight-part series on Channel 4 which looks at the many ways shops help us to part with our cash . <p> With hidden cameras installed in a number of shops , boutiques and market stalls , the programme delved into the techniques used by shops and sales assistants to get maximum sales from each customer . <p> The most interesting part for us was looking at upselling techniques at the point of sale , which is becoming more and more popular in high street stores . A classic example of this is McDonald 's asking if you 'd like to ' go large ' or add fries with your order . <p> Apparently , in a study of 1,000 shoppers , a third admitted that they made impulse buys at the till . In fact , the programme mentioned that of profits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . <p> In the show , one of the retail assistants rightly points out that for each shopper it may only be a pound here and there but for a retailer this can add up to thousands over a week or a month . <p> This tactic is based on the commitment consistency principle , which basically means that if a customer has already committed to buying one item , they are more likely to buy something else . <p> Another interesting aspect of the programme was its look at restaurants using tactics to sell more of a particular dish . A spicy chicken kebab was packaged up onto a hanging rack , which created a spectacle every time it was brought out of the kitchen . <p> The restaurant relies on ' social proof ' which means that seeing someone else order the dish makes it look popular and therefore more likely that other people will follow suit . <p> This is a really interesting series , but the tone of voice is rather over the top . Using phrases such as sneaky tactics , dubious selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem very dramatic , when they are in fact all classic sales techniques , which have been used for years .@@2421298 <p> Toni Pearce has 
 Things in retail disruptor or distraction ? <h> Monday 28 April 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> The Internet of Things ( IoT ) is a term that has been passed back and forth within the technology industry for many years now . But it 's only in recent times that the concept has become more of a reality due to a variety of developments that are allowing the technology to be used and controlled by consumers for their own benefit . According to Cisco , the IoT is the network of physical objects accessed through the Internet . These objects contain embedded technology to interact with internal states or external environments . More tangibly , the IoT can take many forms increasingly connected , intuitive smartphone and tablet devices , apps and gadgets that can be wirelessly controlled . It 's an exciting , fast-moving space to be involved in and is in a constant state of flux not a month goes by when another internet-connected everyday object or device is launched , proclaiming to save consumers minutes and hours in a time-poor , convenience-first world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the IoT a true disruptor in the field , providing huge competitive possibilities for retailers ? Or is it simply a fad and distraction that takes time away from building mutually beneficial and long-term relationships with the customer ? <p> Here we take a look at some of the ways that the Internet of Things is providing new ways of reaching consumers and the challenges and opportunities it will present to retailers who want to remain ahead of the competition . <p> Does connected really mean engaged ? <p> According to BI Intelligence , there will be approximately 75 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020 . It 's no secret that consumers are increasingly turning to their plethora of Internet-enabled devices to chat to friends , browse clothing stores online and vent their customer service frustrations on Twitter . But being increasingly connected with those around you does n't necessarily mean you 're more engaged and invested in brands . In fact , it can mean the opposite . Recent research we conducted with YouGov found that , as a result of the many devices and touchpoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer has been born . <p> The ' distracted consumer ' flits between the TV , smartphone and tablet and back again , multi-tasking and dividing their attention between the many screens . The outcome of this ' dual screening ' is that these consumers are spending increasingly less time 30 seconds or less depending on the channel listening to and reading online marketing communications . They are more selective about the marketing messages they pay attention to , which means that retailers need to savvy about types of message and methods they use to create dialogue with shoppers . The window for capturing a consumer 's interest constantly diminishes . But if consumers are increasingly using internet-enabled devices , be it tablet , smartphone or even smart TV then it makes sense for retailers to go where the shoppers are and use these channels and devices within marketing campaigns . The challenge is doing this in a way that works for both brand and the individual consumer . <p> The IoT opportunity <p> With an estimated average annual growth rate of 31 per cent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / CRM conversation . However , whether retailers will be successful in integrating the Internet of Things into wider marketing strategies remains to be seen . In-store and e-commerce experiences will become increasingly blurred as shoppers can use technology such as in-store wi-fi or virtual reality changing rooms to craft an increasingly seamless experience . Here are just a few examples of how the Internet of Things is making a difference today and what it could mean for retailers : <p> * Did my fridge just talk ? After many years of hype , we may all be soon using fridges that assess when we 're running low on certain food items and automatically re-order through an online retailer . You 're fridge might not literally be talking to you , but essentially it 's talking for you , telling your supermarket that you need milk or butter on your behalf . Many people already use their tablets or PCs to order their weekly grocery shop , but this intelligent and intuitive experience could help retailers maintain loyalty and boost sales by being on hand when needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of best practice Geo-location technology has been around for some time now , but the latest wave of innovation in this domain including Apple 's iBeacon , could transform retailers ' strategy from reactionary to pre-emptive and real-time . The potential of technologies like iBeacon are vast real-time discounts , help with shopping lists and potentially and end to queuing . All it takes is for customers to install the app of their preferred retailers , and the geo-location technology will do the rest , providing the shopper with real-time updates and discounts based on their journey on the high street <p> * TV , TV on the wall , where can I buy that silk shawl ? It wo n't tell you you 're the fairest of them all , but pretty soon smart TVs and smart TV apps will allow consumers to tap into high-street trends , browse information on products and potentially in the future even allow consumers to buy goods they 've seen in adverts , or at the very least find out where they can buy them . This immersive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact and reach shoppers , but also allows customers to discover more about products at their leisure , which is becoming increasingly important in our time-poor culture . <p> While these examples are impressive , they are just the tip of the iceberg for the Internet of Things and what it could mean for retailers . The real opportunity lies not just simply in the adoption of these technologies , but how they are used not isolation but in tandem with a wider marketing strategy to create a seamless and consistent brand narrative . And the key to doing so is taking advantage of the masses of data that these connected devices generate every second and minute of the day . <p> The devil is in the detail <p> As the old adage goes , the devil is in the detail and the detail lies in the data . While undoubtedly more sophisticated screens in stores and the portability of experience from store to device will provide a much more convenient and pleasant experience for shoppers and will in the short-term ensure repeat custom the data that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or break opportunity . In today 's ' always-on ' culture , consumers are becoming increasingly demanding about how and when marketers target them with offers and deals . They not only need to be timely , they need to be relevant and delivered over the right channels . Gaining access to device-level data will become the new battleground for retailers looking to truly take advantage of the Internet of Things . So if consumers are logging into in-store wi-fi , downloading apps for their smart TVs and exchanging personal information on their likes and dislikes , that data and insight becomes gold . <p> In an age when consumers have become more promiscuous as to the brands they prefer to shop with , relationship-building is crucial if retailers want to maintain loyalty and the bottom line . The more they can learn about habits , shopping styles and even needs will put them in the driving seat when it comes to truly understanding and becoming more intuitive about the consumer 's needs . It 's also important for retailers to feed the insight they glean from these connected devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they not only demonstrate the benefits of using such technology better , more relevant deals etc but also that all of the channels being used to reach out to consumers are orchestrated and integrated into one brand voice . <p> Disruptor or distraction ? <p> There are exciting things happening in the IoT space right now , but the future of the concept still remains to be seen . It 's still a relatively new concept , particularly in its applications within the retail space , but whether it will become a true disruptor or mere distraction will come down to one key factor how the technology is adopted and implemented by retailers . Many of the innovations in this space have been developed independently of one another , so the challenge for retailers looking to harness these technologies will be how they can integrate them into existing methods . And retailers will also need to be transparent about how these technologies and consequently the data they generate are being used to benefit the consumer . Innovations come and go , some are fads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money where its mouth is by purchasing connected device company Nest earlier in the year , the future looks bright for IoT.@@2461105 <h> eSports are now 
 Supermarket : Dark stores have a bright future , but is the sun setting on the superstore ? <h> Friday 20 June 2014 - Editorial Assistant <p> The superstore that we know and ( delete as applicable ) has its foundations in the boot space made available in the tens of millions of cars on the road in our great car society . That has provided for decades the logistic channel that goes from checkout via free car park to the home and all at the expense of the consumer . <p> This is a model that has legs , let alone wheels , and it 's still growing , with the big four still opening new stores despite the slowing in their rollout plans . The has been for some time the dominant format in a market in which just nine businesses own more than 95 per cent of the market , according to Kantar . The trouble is that boot space is becoming and will become less relevant as time goes on . If we peer a long way down the high street into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by very different retail formats . <p> The grocery half of retail has proven remarkably resistant to diversion of business to newer channels . Food sales online are still , in percentage terms , in low single figures , whereas product sales generally are in double digits and some subsectors such as Music , Video and Books are in the territory where online is becoming more the norm than property-based sales . <p> Online sales have , to date , largely been fulfilled from within existing superstores , but there 's a groundswell of grumbling about aisles clogged by internet order pickers in-store and we have a new format in , well , out of , town , that suits the fulfilment perfectly . Superstores have to be close enough to consumers for them to be willing to spend the time needed to drive to them , but fulfilment centres only need to be close enough to consumers for it to be economically viable to deliver to them by refrigerated van . <p> So the excitingly-named " Dark Store " can be big , as big as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big . Ocado have been proving this for a while . Dark stores can easily replace multiple superstores . A replacement rate above one-to-ten looks easily achievable . There are no more than about 5,000 outlets in the UK , so 500 dark stores should replace them nicely and Tesco , Sainsbury 's et al are in the process of building their replacements . It 's a commonplace that a national retailer can now cover the country with 200 stores or less , so that all sounds quite do-able . <p> The food market is n't growing much beyond inflationary expansion . The grocers are just fighting for market share . They could , of course , try to grab the non-food half of retail in one go , but that would only give them twice the turnover that they have at the moment , so the number of superstores would still fall even if they achieved it . <p> But the rest of the action is in smaller format stores run by the hard discounters , the convenience stores being opened by some of the bigger players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bira by the LDC . Between the dark stores and the convenience formats lie the superstores and their future is not so bright . <p> Then there are the outlets : Tesco may have fewer than 500 superstores , but they have about half as many Extras as that . They would make ideal dark stores . I wonder when we see the lights begin to out there in those . <p> I can hear the old codger now , as he points with his walking stick down the high street to a distant and empty field at the edge of town : " I remember , when I were a lad , that were all supermarkets .

 Lillywhites on House of Fraser floor space <h> Monday 16 November 2015 - Sabharwal <p> Sports Direct boss Dave Forsey has supposedly held secret discussions with House of Fraser . These reportedly relate to the implementation of London 's Lillywhites shop-in-shops in some of the British retailer 's department stores . <p> Mike Ashley , Sports Direct 's Deputy Chairman and majority owner , attempted to intervene in the acquisition of the high street giant by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower last year , by buying an piece of the pie . <p> Unfortunately for him , a ? ? takeover was finalised in September <p> According to The Telegraph , talks between Sports Direct and House of Fraser 's Chief Exec Nigel Oddy are at an early stage and House of Fraser has already rejected the idea of taking on Sports Direct branded shop-in-shops .

 : Mark Dunhill , MD , Whittard of Chelsea <h> Friday 20 November 2015 - Philip Gallagher <p> With only 51 stores in the UK , and little to no advertising , you 'd be forgiven for forgetting about Whittard of Chelsea . But the tea specialist has been around since the 19th century . The first Whittard of Chelsea store was opened by London merchant Walter Whittard in 1886 , where he sold teas from around the world to eager London customers . That store has since turned into a nationwide franchise and a household name . If your friend 's cupboard has a blend of tea you 've never heard of before and are n't sure you 're ever likely to try , it 's likely that it came from Whittard . <p> Mark Dunhill , Whittard 's MD since January 2014 , is a lover of teas . His favourite one week is " replaced by another the following week " , and with a background that complements his connoisseur status , he can really appreciate the correlation between the expansion of Whittard of Chelsea and the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " In the early 19th century tea was still very much a luxury product due to high taxes , " he tells Retail Gazette . " It was only during the course of the century that it became popular for the masses . WC started in 1886 , when it was gaining more broad appeal . " <p> His own interest in the company 's products that made him a fit for his current role . Dunhill has a strong history of managing and building international brands such as TM Lewin , where he oversaw the opening of 50 international stores and entry into 11 new markets . This made him well suited 's plans for future growth . As an outsider , Dunhill agrees that " there was a significant untapped opportunity " to transform the company from a high street chain into " an aspirational global brand . " <p> Dunhill already expects that anyone over the age of 30 or 40 " can find something from Whittard in their cupboard " , but is the company well positioned enough as a brand to embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company began " the expansion of business into key markets " last year , still managing to turn a profit despite this , and despite some major management restructuring . It seemed , then , that Whittard had a good starting point for its expansion . <p> Dunhill has now been at the helm for almost two years , and has confidence in the company 's chances . His goal as MD is " for Whittard to be the destination for the finest teas , coffees and cocoas for every market we enter in the world . " <p> For this to occur there are a number of significant challenges , but Whittard appears to have a lot in its favour . <p> Having started off as a brand that offered imported teas from around the globe , Whittard 's wide range has always been a part of its heritage , which it markets across its stores . Tea is a well-integrated aspect of the British identity , and as such this heritage is something Whittard can , and has been , making use of to appear every bit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as its emphasis on proper preparation , emits the impression of a well trained eye with the wide knowledge that comes from over a century of business . Dunhill agreed that heritage " is an asset that 's hard to reproduce from scratch . " <p> " It 's some sort of guarantee to the customer that we know what we 're up to . It 's also great evidence of expertise and credibility . " <p> Now more than ever , as it looks to expand into foreign markets , this historical asset of the Whittard of Chelsea brand is a boon for the company . Tourist revenue and events like Singles Day have shown that foreign customers have a great fondness for British goods , particularly in China . <p> " Particularly among the younger generation there is a real resurgence in afternoon tea , which has become a very popular lifestyle activity among the 20-25 year old customer . They have a great fascination for English heritage and afternoon tea . " <p> Although this heritage has inherent strengths , Whittard 's branding and advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although this is no doubt attractive for those who can tell their English Rose from their Tippy Assam , it could be perceived as exclusive to those who are used to basic tea bags and traditional flavours . <p> " I do n't think we 're alienating people . We still offer the old favourites : the English breakfasts , the jasmines . They remain strong sellers . What we 've done is ensure that the quality is beyond reproach . <p> We have two types of customers : the person who knows exactly what they want and restocks week in week out , and the ' adventure customer ' who comes to Whittard so we can educate them in the world of fine teas , and help them discover the joy that these teas offer . <p> We want to convey through communication that we run that we offer a wide range of teas for the aspiring connoisseur . " <p> A communicative approach ought to be welcome for those that are eager to experience fine teas . Dunhill admits that " experts " often combine their knowledge " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments " , and that this is something he is determined to avoid by making each WC employee a " friendly fanatic " . <p> At the same time , the customers Dunhill mentions are clearly present at chains such as Starbucks . These franchises also offer a wide range , including popular seasonal treats and mysterious ' secret menus ' . <p> " I see us as an antidote to the way coffee chains do tea . They dump the teabag into a mug of water without paying attention to how tea should be served . <p> The way we present tea for when customers want to drink on the premises , we brew it in a teapot for the right amount of time at the right temperature and let the customer enjoy the ritual that surrounds the experience of fine tea . " <p> For customers who are more inclined to the ritual of tea brewing , Whittard now has a number of stores which offer ' tea to go ' . Several branches in London as well as the new store in Birmingham Grand Central offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wherever the store is big enough " . Although this is an attractive proposition for the fine tea fanatic , it remains to be seen if such stores can compete with the fast on-the-go coffee chains that are sure to have branches nearby . <p> Changing technology , too , is an ongoing challenge that Whittard must be prepared to meet . Dunhill agrees that the high street is clearly under a great deal of pressure , but believes Whittard is " well adapted to survive and thrive as we offer experiences that can not be had elsewhere . " <p> " I think there are two strands . One , we have a retail estate of 51 stores , and this is what we see as a massive asset to the business to introduce customers to what we do and help them discover teas and coffees . <p> Two , our online presence , which we have great expectations for . There are customers who may well want to reorder their favourites from our website or use it as an opportunity to order gifts for loved ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next five years . " <p> The potential is certainly there . Retailers have seen mobile and online shoppers making a much higher contribution to revenues in recent years . Whittard among the many retailers that have invested in dedicated mobile sites to allow customers to purchase on the go with as much convenience as possible . <p> After almost two years at the head of the company , Dunhill believes he and the team he inherited have " achieved an awful lot " in repositioning the brand for global growth . <p> " I 'm certainly proud of the progress I 've made with my management team to reposition the brand for global growth . We take pride in the store concept that we 've developed . " <p> Overseas and at home , the brand certainly has the image of a well explored purveyor of fine teas , though there seems to be little compelling evidence to prove Marks assertion that its products can be found in quite so many UK cupboards .

 Ops Director Andrew Murphy <h> Tuesday 18 January 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> It is fitting that there are signs for Buckingham Palace situated outside John Lewis Head Office in London Victoria , as the department store group has become something approaching retail royalty in the last few years . <p> By establishing itself in such a powerful position in the sector , the retailer that was always been regarded as the industry bellwether has inevitably moved ahead of the crowd . <p> Director of Retail Operations at John Lewis Andrew Murphy agrees , telling Retail Gazette this week : " There is nothing about us that is a retail bellwether . <p> " Like many people I used to bounce along with this notion , but if you look back the last few years you 'll see different patterns emerging . <p> " We suffered as much as anybody when the recession began but in the months since it has been clear there is nothing about us that could describe us in this way . <p> " If you took John Lewis as the bellwether , you would be significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up this claim , with John Lewis 's 28 department stores earlier this month reporting the biggest percentage increase in sales of any seven-day period this financial year . <p> " Our challenge now is to stay away from being seen as an industry bellwether , " Murphy adds . <p> The Retail Operations Director is someone who knows John Lewis through and through , having worked at the partnership for 18 years in a number of different roles . <p> He joined the company straight from university and started out in various management positions in his home country of Scotland before venturing south of the border , where he first worked in the High Wycombe store , then in London 's Oxford Street and finally at the partnership 's Newcastle branch . <p> Head Office beckoned and he took on positions at this level prior to returning to Scotland , where he was made Managing Director ( MD ) of John Lewis Aberdeen in 2002 , MD of the Edinburgh store one year later and joint MD of both outlets in 2007 . <p> Two years ago Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man who he eventually replaced as Retail Operations Director in the spring of 2010 . <p> " I was in the fortunate position that I worked for the previous Retail Operations Director Gareth Thomas , who announced his retirement last year . <p> " Taking on the role , from a functional view , was a very natural step . " <p> The board member admits that his time in the current role has coincided with some fantastic growth at John Lewis , and has been a fun challenge . <p> But what is driving this growth and what is John Lewis doing differently to make it one of the standout retail performers of the last 12 months ? Nothing particularly different to before appears to be the answer , although Murphy credits the retailer 's buying team for the vital role it plays in the overall business model . <p> " Most of the reasons why we have been successful are to do with things that have been constant in our business over time , " he explains . <p> " These are n't new things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of - and our brand has certainly found its voice . <p> " There has been an emerging synergy with the mood of the nation and what we are offering . " <p> Challenges facing the industry in the months ahead are well documented , with consumer confidence expected to be low as the government 's austerity measures begin to bite and many fashion retailers passing on increased material costs to customers . <p> Murphy agrees that everyone will be affected by economic forces asserting pressure on the sector , with the impact of inflation and potentially higher interest rates apparently posing more of a concern than this month 's VAT rise . <p> " Our expectations are not vastly different to anyone else , but we are budgeting for growth , " he said . <p> " However , we certainly expect the next 12 months to be harder fight than the last 18 months .

" <p> The plight of the high street is not just down to the supply chain though ; it is the cost of property that many retailers find crippling . <p> " If you ca n't sell a book or a CD in Britain and make any money , this suggests that rents and rates are too high . We know there is a market for that product , " Constantine remarks . <p> " HMV struggling is an intriguing indicator of the current state of the British high street . <p> " It is not just the competition from the supermarkets that is causing the problem because they only take a percentage of the market probably not even 15 per cent . <p> " It seems to be that we are due some kind of crisis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse in property prices of a few years ago . " <p> But what about the future for Lush ? Constantine claims that the company invents more cosmetic products than any of its competitors in Britain , and suggests that by being so innovative it sits " quite neatly between fashion and cosmetics " in the world of retail . <p> " That is what customers like and we will be doing a lot more of this in the year ahead , " he notes . <p> Online sales are also strong and Constantine appears to be on top of the demands of today 's multichannel retail world , which requires all platforms of a business to be interlinked and of great relevance to a shopper . <p> He has 2,000 Facebook followers , who he talks to regularly , and the business has 135,000 fans .

" We have 94 stores in the UK and we will certainly go over 100 stores over the course of the next year , potentially building up in key locations like central London and Birmingham . " <p> Future plans may be held back if the retail boss 's market predictions ring true , though , and this week 's GDP figures have sparked fears of a double dip recession in the UK , which could also put the brakes on any portfolio expansion . <p> " A lot of our UK growth plans depend on the situation with landlords and property , " he said . <p> " Rents and rates in this country are too high .

 Manager Richard Baylis <h> Wednesday 02 March 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> O2 parent company Telefonica Europe recently announced that in 2010 its revenues rose to ? 15.25 billion ( ? 12.95 billion ) and the UK retail arm of the business is becoming crucial to its wider success , despite tough trading conditions on the British high street . <p> General Manager of O2 Retail Richard Baylis tells Retail Gazette that , aside from the growing popularity of smartphones which now account for 70 per cent of all contracts at the group , providing a key point of difference is proving singularly essential . <p> " We are rolling out new-look stores that have live and digital displays , and customers are now encouraged to play and test out the new devices in shops , " he states . <p> " There is much more information available to them in a way they are used to receiving it . " <p> Since arriving at O2 in 2008 Baylis and his team have identified how they can change retail 's role in the shopping journey , and this vision is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff profile in shops . <p> It is up to retailers to encourage customers to visit the high street , and Baylis considers bricks and mortar stores as an important cog in the overall retail multichannel machine , as long as they provide the correct services . <p> " We want to make the reason for coming into store ; advice , touch , experience and engagement - our skill is making everything join up and explaining to customers how everything works , " he said . <p> " To this end , we have introduced a new role called Guru , which is improving our level of service and educating customers to a higher degree . " <p> Around half of O2 Retail 's estate has been transformed to the new format and around 160 of these stores already have Gurus , but another 260 Gurus are expected to be added to the company 's workforce in the coming months . <p> The Gurus do not have sales targets , but they are heavily assessed on customer satisfaction and the employees require consumers to be positive and make recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsurprisingly as the world becomes more complicated , customers are looking for simpler things , " Baylis notes . <p> " In order to deliver that we have had to make more time for our store staff so they can consequently have better conversations with customers . " <p> The push to create more Gurus also ensures this year 's store closures at O2 Retail will not result in wide scale job losses , and only single digit unemployment is expected across O2 Retail 's sales adviser network as a result of the business 's change of focus . <p> " The role has given our more tech-savvy staff and those who have a passion for technology a new career path , " Baylis said , adding that there could be opportunities to move into other divisions of the business thereafter . <p> " We are really excited about the opportunities and are initially recruiting internally for Gurus because Assistant Managers have been a good source in the past and we want to give current employees the best chance of getting jobs . " <p> 18 <p> Like many senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry he represents , but his years prior to joining O2 were spent on " the other side " , working for a range of technology businesses . <p> He started at printing and software group Xerox , where he stayed for 11 years and held various roles in the company 's finance , sales , marketing and services departments . <p> Running product marketing at Xerox 's small office/home office division gave Baylis his first experience of the retail industry thanks to some of the client base , but he moved on from there to hold consumer sales and marketing positions at Epson . <p> Before joining O2 in 2008 as head of its commercial planning and trading arm , he was Regional Director at Acco Brands , but after 20 months as General Manager of O2 Retail he now seems at home . <p> " Retail is a really exciting place to be - it is a really interesting space . You can be working on a three or five-year strategies one day , but then work on a short-term commercial deal the next . " <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , naturally , one of the major reasons behind the changes taking place at O2 in the year ahead . <p> Being in charge of a technology retail business , where innovation inevitably becomes the driving force for the organisation , Baylis should be more aware than most about the importance of not standing still , and his actions suggest this is the case . <p> " Comparing two years ago to where we are today , O2 Retail is a very different physical environment , " he explains . <p> " More importantly it is a different culture - it is very strongly customer oriented and my team has done a fantastic job in delivering that change . " <p> No matter how much the retail industry talks about the importance of customer service , multichannel capability , social networking presence or product offering , success in this competitive sector can essentially be summed up in one word - relevance . <p> Baylis agrees .

" <p> Superdrug 's great rival on the high street , Boots , has set the benchmark when it comes to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Jebson suggests that his company 's new scheme is not just another rewards programme . <p> Instead of just increasing the weight in people 's wallets and handbags , a frequent scenario for many consumers in a world where store and reward cards are available on mass , it is hoped that the Superdrug Beauty Card will truly stimulate loyalty . <p> " We did some work finding out how many loyalty cards people had and often it was as many as ten or 11 - that 's not loyalty , that 's just collecting rewards , not building a relationship , " Jebson argues . <p> " Superdrug actually wants to build a relationship with our customers and ensure there is loyalty . We will demonstrably reward people for their changes in behaviour , rather than getting them to collect points endlessly . " <p> Tied in with the focus on loyalty is the revamping of online operations at Superdrug . <p> Jebson is approaching his second anniversary as Commercial Director of Superdrug having joined from Woolworths in 2009 , and he admits that the company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , perhaps due to some of the decisions made by previous management . <p> It is full steam ahead under the current regime though , and a new online workforce has been recruited to ensure the company 's approach to internet retailing is done correctly , with the Commercial Director admitting it takes time to make a success of online retail . <p> " We 've actually doubled the size of the team in the last two months to start doing online properly , " he adds . <p> " We are a late developer when it comes to e-tail , but we see its value both as a transactional and educational platform . <p> " It 's classic multichannel really , we need to make sure that both our stores and website are great places to buy . " <p> And that is exactly what Superdrug is doing . Another seismic change in the retailer 's operations is currently underway , which will see a large percentage of its property portfolio take on a fresh new look in the year ahead . <p> It launched its first TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoppers to " take another look at Superdrug ' , and the company 's Wimbledon outlet reopened in March with new wider aisles , more product information and an opened-up shop front that abandons the promotion-heavy window displays traditionally associated with the retailer . <p> Products for men have conveniently been moved close to the tills , allowing male shoppers to avoid the female specific aisles if they so desire , while there is a pharmaceutical consultancy room located at the back of the shop . <p> Although slightly resembling a department store in terms of the way perfumes , colognes and other beauty equipment is arranged , Superdrug is keen to avoid the ' white coat ' consultancy approach and is happy to give its customer the chance to try products for themselves and pick up knowledge from the newly installed signage . <p> " We are going to open a number of concept stores in the coming months , and with the different segments of stores we have they will be trialled in a variety of places , from local high streets to shopping centres , " Jebson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big improvement in the perception of Superdrug , the shopping environment and the interaction with our teams is better - it is all about providing accessible beauty to our customers . " <p> Superdrug is a retailer making great strides right now , and it is encouraging to see a business with a predominantly high street bricks and mortar presence take assertive action to draw people back into their local town centres . So how can others follow suit ? <p> " Retailers need to ask ' what is our purpose ? What would customers miss if we did n't exist ? ' and then build on those strengths , " the Superdrug boss notes . <p> " I believe retailers who have n't been clear about purposes will lose . " <p> 's CV includes stints at Asda and Sainsbury 's , as well as six and a half years at Superdrug 's parent company AS Watson . He has worked on both the buying and supply side of retail . <p> He is passionate about the high street and its importance to the overall retail landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers could combine to encourage higher footfall in town centres he would be probably be a richer man . <p> " Individual retailers can do great things to make high streets amazing whether that 's a farmers market , a Primark or a Poundland opening - all of this can reinvigorate an area , offering something interesting and motivating that you ca n't get out of town . <p> " One of the biggest challenges now is how retailers can work together - the high street has a fractured landlord base and is not like a shopping centre where one landlord can take control and decide on a proposition . " <p> The year ahead will provide an indication as to whether Superdrug has the right formula , but it is arguably too early to assess the impact recent changes have had on the business . <p> Being owned by Asian retail group AS Watson , Superdrug does not release regular financial results , so it is difficult to get a true idea of the retailer 's current trading patterns and levels of profitability , but Jebson notes that recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in the right direction . <p> " If you 're going to be a bricks and mortar retailer and survive on the high street you 've got to be good - we looked at ourselves and said maybe we need to update , " Jebson states . <p> " I aim to make Superdrug a beacon of modernity as a place to shop . We 're not ignoring discount or value , but customers expect more otherwise they have no emotional attachment . " <p> With the obvious nods to value for money , quality promotions and convenience still very prominent , but with the added bonus of a unique loyalty programme and tidier stores , it appears Superdrug is changing with the times and attracting new admirers , but without alienating its core customers . For the future of the high street , that can only be a good thing .@@4120952 <h> Universities call for 
 Nick Wheeler <h> Thursday 12 May 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> and formalwear specialist Charles Tyrwhitt is on course to report a significant increase in sales this year , and is gaining a reputation as one of the fastest growing UK retailers in terms of annual profits . <p> Founder and CEO Nick Wheeler , whose middle names gives the company its title , says there are no signs of his business , branded as " quirky British " , slowing down any time soon . <p> Strong sales and impressive profit figures do not come by accident though , and it is important for the businessman to keep his finger on the pulse of the sector he works in - something he argues some retailers do not do enough . <p> " A lot of retailers do n't focus on the competition but to do well all you have to do it do better than your rivals , " he tells Retail Gazette . <p> " It is simple . You need to look at what they are doing and make damn sure you are better than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and value than your rivals you will do well . " <p> The competitive approach appears to be paying off , with the Sunday Times ' 2011 Profit Track placing Charles Tyrwhitt in the top 15 UK medium-sized companies in terms of profit growth last year . There are also expectations that an impressive two million shirts will be sold by the firm in 2010/11 , a trading period which ends this July . <p> " We reported profits of ? 7 million in the last financial year , and with US figures added total profitability is just over ? 8 million , " Wheeler explains . <p> " Sales are currently up 40 per cent on last year but we 'll do ? 85 million this year against ? 64 million last year , which represents around a 34 per cent increase . " <p> The slight slowdown in sales growth as the financial year draws to a close is attributed to the fact Charles Tyrwhitt is running slightly low on stock , but this is all part of a measured buying policy that has allowed the retailer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 12 months . <p> Perhaps it is also an indication of the popularity of the retailer 's shirts , which Wheeler suggests boast both quality fabric and shape , and are not cheap . <p> Wheeler , who is married to White Company founder Chrissie Rucker , states : " Cotton prices have gone through the roof but we have tried to keep prices the same - margins take a hit but we hope to sell more products because of our price offer . <p> " We were aware of prices rising at an early stage because we buy quite far ahead - we bought well and now sales are exceeding expectations . " <p> Trading channels at Charles Tyrwhitt come in three forms - a mail order operation , which the business was founded on back in 1986 when Wheeler was at Bristol University , its 16 stores and online . <p> Seven of the shops are in London , including some prime locations for men 's formalwear shopping such as Regent Street and Jermyn Street , while there are six other outlets across the UK , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because 75 per cent of our business is conducted through mail order or on the internet , we want our stores to stand out and they have to have high footfall , " the CEO remarks . <p> " We do n't want a store in every high street . Outside of London we have locations like Kings Street in Manchester , which is an iconic shopping street and sits well with our quirky English brand . " <p> Personal evidence suggests that this is working . When Retail Gazette visited the company 's Jermyn Street store on one of the plethora of April bank holidays this year it was one of the busiest shops on the road , and the staff were highly attentive and helpful . <p> British iconography such as the red letter box is a feature of the store , adding an element of retail theatre which makes it stand out from other retailers in its marketplace . <p> Setting up in this manner means Charles Tyrwhitt does not just appeal to one particular demographic , which is another key part of the retailer 's strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to focus on too smaller proportion of the population because you wo n't sell enough items , " says Wheeler . <p> " We try not to be too specific and we try and have a product that appeals to a broad section of the nation . " <p> A selection of the retailers appearing alongside Charles Tyrwhitt in Sunday Times ' Profit Track list have either recently been the subject of a private equity takeover or have been linked to one . <p> Fashion and homeware specialist Cath Kidston , crafts retailer Hobbycraft and high street value retailer Poundland have all been acquired by these type of companies in recent years , but Wheeler does not appear to have similar plans for his company just yet . <p> A store in Edinburgh will open in the coming months and the general game plan is for three to four new outlets to be added each year in the foreseeable future - steady growth , but a proven successful formula . <p> " I started 25 years ago and hopefully I 'll be doing the same thing in 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe in the long term , and I believe it is always going to be quality that decides whether you survive or fail .

 its store network <h> Monday 16 May 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Collect Plus , the new alternative parcel service to the Post Office which operates through corner shops , plans to continue increasing its network of store partners in the months ahead . <p> By June 2011 it expects to have linked up with 4,000 shops to allow customers to deliver and collect items over their counters , having already increased partner organisations by ten per cent since the start of the year . <p> A statement released by the group today revealed that it is now delivering two million parcels a year and in April it processed more than four times the number of packages compared to the same month in 2010 . <p> The plethora of bank holidays during April helped Collect Plus 's cause , due to high consumer demand for alternative delivery options at a time when traditional parcel services were closed . <p> " Many small businesses and individuals can not wait until the working week to be able to send a parcel or package , but the traditional services usually cease to operate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to strength as the appetite for a more convenient and flexible service increases among the busy population .

 Brian Brick <h> Wednesday 15 June 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Since 2009 suit specialist Moss Bros has certainly been making headlines ; it 's been the subject of takeover speculation , it has appointed a new CEO , all whilst battling significant annual losses - it even got a plug from Boris Johnson during live television coverage of April 's royal wedding . <p> Under the no-nonsense leadership of CEO Brian Brick in the last two years the company has found itself back on the front foot , and the launch of newly formatted stores and modern fashion ranges are helping drive sales and reduce losses as well as setting up the retailer for a much more certain future . <p> " What I came into in spring 2009 was a heavily loss-making situation so the business needed to change . Moss Bros 's performance is now improving - we 're getting there , " Brick tells Retail Gazette . <p> " We 're on a cost-cutting strategy at the moment but we will invest in new stores and refurbish existing ones . " <p> Part of this transformation process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bespoke into stores nationwide , as well as the development of more outlets that contain the company 's traditional retail offering , hirewear and Bespoke all under one roof . <p> Brick is encouraged by the early sales levels and customer interest at Canary Wharf , the location of the first store offering all three parts of the business in one place , and clearly sees this format as a major part of his strategy going forward . <p> " There will be some new stores opening in this format and we 'll be trialling some refurbishments during the autumn with the view of completing these transformations next spring and through the next few years , " he adds . <p> Bespoke is Brick 's brainchild , and the CEO expects that Moss Bros will eventually boast 50 or 60 shop-in-shops promoting the brand . The offering gives customers the opportunity to buy suits made up of personally chosen fabrics , lining and styles , which have been made to measure no other high street retailer provides such a dedicated service . <p> Moss Bros Bespoke at the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact they 're easy to shop in , bright and airy and there 's real clarity in our offer , which is simple to understand . We now talk to our customers a lot more in person and through graphics , " Brick explains . <p> " I think we can say that we have thought through the customer journey . " <p> Many UK clothing retailers have agonised over whether they should increase prices in the wake of rising material costs from countries such as China during the last year , and Brick reveals that there are some big decisions that his company and other fashion retailers need to make . <p> " We 're looking in minute detail on everything we are doing product wise , including whether we should be using better or cheaper fabrics , or if we should use different factories or put prices up the situation is very difficult . " <p> Compared to the outdated and more heavily loss-making company Brick arrived at in 2009 , this represents major progress and will provide encouraging reading for Moss Bros 's shareholders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor consumer confidence is taken into account . <p> Brick was the owner of Suits You 's parent company Speciality Retail Group ( SRG ) until 2005 , so has mixed feelings about its demise , but he is clear that there are now more opportunities for Moss Bros to grow since its main rival of recent years ceased trading . <p> " SRG 's been through different ownership since I sold it and I 'm obviously sad to see it go under , but it was n't the same business anymore . When I owned Suits You we made money every year . <p> " Following Suits You 's closure we now have less competition on the high street and we can look at their business and learn how not to do it . " <p> Learning lessons from failed competitors is a valuable way for a business to move forward , but good publicity is priceless and that is exactly what Moss Bros achieved in April during the most widely viewed TV event of the year .@@4183556 <p> Inflation in Argentina 
 to open European flagship in London <h> Monday 04 July 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> US-based fashion retailer Kate Spade New York ( NY ) is to open its first permanent European store in September this year . <p> Kate Spade NY made its debut in the UK with a pop-up shop in London 's Covent Garden open for a month from October 2010 , but this 4,000 sq ft flagship outlet will be located on the corner of Symons Street and Pavilion Road in the Sloane Square area of the city . <p> Established in 1993 the fashion brand currently has 400 stores worldwide , including 36 stores in the US . <p> This latest acquisition is in the form of a ten-year lease from property owners The Cadogan Estate and the deal was advised on by real estate company CB Richard Ellis ( CBRE ) . <p> Hugh Seaborn , CEO of the Cadogan Estate , commented : " We are delighted to welcome Kate Spade NY to Chelsea and are confident that they will contribute to the continued success of this vibrant shopping area which is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located close to the new store include Tiffany , Links of London , Hugo Boss and Cartier and other units in this development have been let to retailers such as The White Company , Brora and Beatrix Ong . <p> CBRE is also working with the Cadogan Estate to bring other big name retailers into the area with a 7,000 sq ft flagship on King Road and a 4,000 sq ft outlet on Sloane Square set to be introduced later this year . <p> Edward Humbert , Senior Director of Central London Retail for CBRE , said : " Kate Spade NY is among the leading women 's fashion brands in the US and is a favourite with A-list celebrities . <p> " The Sloane Square area is continuing to evolve and improve as a retail destination , and the Cadogan Estate has already signed-up some great brands on both Symons Street and Pavilion Road ; however , the addition of Kate Spade NY to the retailer mix in the area will provide a fabulous anchor tenant for this development .

 David Robinson <h> Thursday 07 July 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> As the recent Retail Gazette Salary Survey 2011 identified , the vast majority of retailers have increased their focus on customer service since the UK moved out of recession in January 2010 , but some are doing it better than others . <p> Electricals specialist Richer Sounds is one retailer that comes highly recommended for its customer care , and Chairman David Robinson is confident this strategy combined with careful cost management will result in another profitable year for the business in 2011 , unlike other larger companies operating in the sector . <p> Meanwhile the much-hyped Best Buy UK arrived on this side of the Atlantic last year promising to open a vast portfolio of stores , but has curtailed these ambitious expansion plans after realising that consumer demand for electronic products is currently just too low . <p> This makes Richer Sounds ' latest award and continued profit growth all the more admirable , as it has not been thrown off track despite the hurdles being stacked up in the sector in which it operates . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Which ? award two years in a row , " said Robinson , who credits his 400-strong team of store staff and additional support office employees for their hard work and dedication to the cause . <p> " It 's the best accolade around because it is totally impartial and you do n't even know you 've been nominated until you receive an email one month before the awards ceremony takes place . " <p> In the 2009-10 financial year Richer Sounds made profits of just under ? 5 million from a turnover of around ? 160 million , and similar results are expected for the year just passed . <p> One of the Richer Sounds stores in Reading , Berkshire <p> Operating from 52 stores in mainly secondary high street locations across the UK , the retailer sells the latest hi-fis , flat-screen TVs and other electrical appliances . <p> Robinson says that his business , which was founded by Julian Richer in 1978 with the opening of a small store in London Bridge , benefits from the fact that 85 per cent of its freeholds are owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of its outlets , helping meet the requirements of the discerning modern shopper , and although there are not yet any major plans to increase its store portfolio , this part of the business is being closely monitored in terms of group expansion in the years ahead . <p> " As products have become more technical , the sales process with the customer has become longer , " he admits . <p> " We are not a cash &amp; wrap business any more . People do n't just come in and buy a CD player now , they want a lot more technical advice , they have far more questions and they have probably found out about the product they are after online . <p> " Years ago we could have a lot smaller stores because we did n't need the floor space , but being in the flat panel TV market we need much more wall space to display the stock , and we also need to find stores in which we can install more listening rooms . " <p> But the high level of customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not overly promoted by the company that is left to others . Robinson is only too aware that it may be held against the firm later down the line , and instead prefers to focus on the retailer 's product range . <p> " Our business model allows us to offer the best deals we can for customers and we want these to attract people into stores , where they will be knocked out by the service they receive , " he reveals . <p> " We do n't say come in because we offer really great customer service , we sell the business on the deals we have the best brands and great prices . " <p> So what can struggling high street retailers learn from the Richer Sounds model ? <p> A Richer Sounds consultant speaking to a customer in-store <p> The Chairman , who arrived at the company as a 17-year-old in 1983 and became Managing Director in 1991 before taking on the top job six years ago , says that the business has always been careful about controlling costs and keeping base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its growth over the last 33 years . <p> It has also continually improved its customer service through relationships with companies like Service Power Technologies , which manages the home services part of the business and recently won a three-year contract renewal worth ? 1.5 million . <p> All of these features are beneficial to the business , but it is perhaps Richer Sounds ' propensity to take the battle to its competition that other high street firms should recognise , such as the offer of payment for parking . <p> " We have to offer free parking because we are up against the out-of-town developments that provide this facility or the big shopping centres where drivers do n't have to pay for parking . <p> " Richer Sounds tries to be unique on things and we try and look at it from the customer 's point of view because we recognise , particularly in our sector , that it is very easy for customers to sit at home and order goods online . <p> " Retailers must recognise that there has to be a unique selling point , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when they must pay so much for petrol . There must be incentive to get people into stores . " <p> It would be an unprecedented achievement if Richer Sounds was to win the Which ? best retailer award again next year no firm has ever picked up a title from the consumer magazine three years in a row . <p> Questioned on whether the business can make it a hat-trick Robinson shies away from any predictions that might come back to haunt him , but with the renewal of its tech support contract agreed this week and plans in place to roll out further customer demonstration rooms in stores nationwide , the retailer is certainly showing electricals specialists the way when it comes to customer service .@@4217574 <h> We rock the 
 case for mobile <h> Thursday 14 July 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Retailers need to work hard to enhance their in store m-commerce offerings according to Ian Patterson , Managing Director ( EMEA ) of DigiPoS Store Solutions . <p> It would be fair to say that eCommerce has come a long way since its origins and has managed to heighten customers ' expectations of value , service and convenience . Today the mobile phone has similar revolutionary capabilities , by replicating aspects of the online experience in store . Yet , in spite of this , payment and check out processing activities via mobile still require serious attention . <p> The " click and collect " model , which was popularised by Argos with the launch of its app earlier this year , is perhaps the closest yet to the customer easily transacting through the mobile phone . <p> However , the future of retail is clearly about creating an integrated experience retailers have to mix online and offline , to create a true multi-channel offering , where all elements work in tandem , and not in opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is holding retailers back when it comes to offering mobile payments in store ? <p> Technology <p> When it comes to mobile , there is a lot of technology to take into consideration . An EPoS system , by comparison , is a known entity retailers have invested in this technology for 10-15 years , and in this scenario they are only managing one touch-point ; with mobile the complexity is far greater covering multi touch points . <p> As the eCommerce phenomenon grew , retailers undertook extensive development , to ensure the new technology fitted with their existing systems and processes . They will now be facing a similar set of issues with mCommerce , and taking into consideration how their systems can interact with mobile devices . <p> Clearly there are also myriad options to choose from , with new apps and payment providers launching on an almost daily basis . As the market matures , I wonder if for many it is a case of wait and see retailers will be persuaded to consider what has been road tested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year , I believe there will be a number of real life case studies , which will clearly demonstrate the benefits of mobile . <p> For now , many retailers have adopted the easiest route a mobile optimised website . <p> Security <p> When it comes to mCommerce , security is often touted as an issue for retailers and consumers alike . And , clearly , there is an issue around asset security ; paying for goods via a mobile phone in store is as good as self-scanning . For those retailers reticent about this process what about considering a VIP ' de-tag and bag ' booth for loyal customers who choose to buy directly through their handset ? <p> Mobile impacts the whole business <p> As I have previously highlighted , mobile is something which affects the entire business , from IT to operations and marketing . I 'd imagine there are many retailers in the midst of internal debate around the value of mobile , and where ' buy-in ' has n't been met by every department . <p> The huge impact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of retailers into a ' do more for less ' policy . Every department is under pressure to reduce costs and to indentify the things they could do better . <p> But retailers should be warned , where growth re-emerges they need to capitalise on this , and prioritise the things that will bring a quick return ; mobile being a point in case . <p> The customer journey <p> Retailers recognise that the customer 's journey is a mixed one . When they go into a store and fail to see what they want , they will go to the retailer 's website instead . But , if the site is n't optimised , they may find themselves feeling frustrated by the whole experience - far from ideal in an era where customer retention counts for everything . If a customer is in store , they need to be able to not only purchase through their mobile when in the shop , but also to view an optimised website . If they have what they need at the right time and in the right place this customised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the wall for retailers : mobile has the ability to deliver for the customer whether that 's shopping in store , redeeming coupons , or location-based services . <p> The app approach also brings with it a lot of benefits creating a branded , personalised and location-based experience for the customer . In this scenario , the mobile becomes an additional , complementary store front . And , again , if a particular product is in stock and with the right promotion , the customer is more likely to purchase it . <p> We have seen that people are comfortable shopping at home on a PC , and they are also adept at going into a shop and undertaking product research through their handset . If retailers could do everything in their power to empower their customers , and offer mobile as another payment option , they would be more likely to close a sale . What we need to remember is that as an issue is solved once , it is solved many times therefore a one-off investment is certain to pay off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for mobile , and ensuring it sits high on a retailer 's list of priorities . <p> With its hardware and software solutions , DigiPoS is redefining technology for retailers , bringing much-needed focus , value and reliability to a competitive market .

 CEO Mike Hancox <h> Wednesday 31 August 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Ideal Shopping Direct ( ISD ) was bought out in private equity deal worth almost ? 80 million in June this year , and under new ownership the business is set to expand at a rapid pace in the fast growing TV shopping sector . <p> With high street retailer Argos dipping its toe into home shopping earlier this year in an attempt to embellish its multichannel offering , ISD could have been concerned about market overcrowding . <p> However its channels , including Ideal World , appear to have benefited from the extra focus on TV shopping networks . <p> Mike Hancox , CEO of ISD , told Retail Gazette that sales at his firm had actually increased since Argos arrived on Sky TV in June . <p> " We 've looked at their launch and asked what it means for our business but June and July have been two of our strongest months for some while , " he explained . <p> " The impact of Argos on our business can only be viewed as positive so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sector has convinced new people to take a look at home shopping and they have ended up buying with us . " <p> In a warning to the newcomer and other companies potentially looking to branch out into Ideal Shopping 's area of expertise , Hancox dismissed the myth that TV shopping can be used as an accessory to a retailer 's main vehicle . He believes there is a huge set of unique skills required for home shopping to drive smoothly . <p> " One of the mistakes that many retailers make is that they just see TV as another retail channel and they forget that the first thing they need to do is entertain , " he said . <p> " I think that a number of Sky viewers have gone to have a look at Argos and flicked up a channel to Ideal World or down to the leading TV shopping network QVC . " <p> In April ISD reported significant growth in both sales and profits for the 2010 financial year , with revenues up 13.5 per cent to ? 117.3 million and EBITDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . <p> Forecasts for 2011 are also encouraging considering the slump retail currently finds itself in . While British Retail Consortium data indicates that trading has been sluggish at best during the first half of 2011 , ISD is expecting to post sales of more than ? 130 million and EBITDA of ? 11.5 million , as long as the busy Christmas period goes to plan . <p> It is hard to pinpoint the reason for the TV shopping specialist 's success , but Hancox attributes it to a number of factors that have come together to cause something of a perfect storm . <p> " We are developing a multichannel format , and that has helped grow our business substantially , " he commented . <p> " Almost half of our business is now transacted through the website because many of our viewers prefer this method of ordering . We also offer a number of goods online that we do not sell via the TV channel .

" <p> He also notes that when consumers first acquire Freeview they tend to lick through the channels to see what is available , and with an expected influx of new users it is likely that more shoppers will stumble across ISD in the coming months . <p> " For all of these reasons the digital switchover is hugely positive for companies like us , and since it started we have been on a significant growth curve . " <p> Marketers are increasingly identifying the benefits of linking the internet and TV to attract shoppers and mirror consumer behaviour trends , with a recent study from professional services firm Deloitte and research group GfK showing that 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time as watching television . <p> With 1,000 shoppers making their first purchase at one of ISD 's shopping channels every day , the link between the web and small screen is something Hancox and his team are keen to take advantage of and the CEO says that TV is used as " a recruitment vehicle " for other parts of the business , such as its niche retail websites like . <p> " For many people watching the TV , their purchases are often impulse buys , " he explained . <p> " Years ago shoppers would rely on the person behind the counter to give them information to steer their purchase but there are not many shops where you get that calibre of help now . <p> " The beauty of TV is that it sits between stores and the internet , providing all the information that is possibly needed from a salesperson and you can see the product being used .

" <p> In the past Hancox has held the role of CEO at home shopping groups Otto UK and Shop Direct , and he also had a spell at Chief Operating Officer of Littlewoods Shop Direct Group , but catalogue retailing is no longer where he sees his future . <p> " We have not gone down the catalogue route . The companies in that market do a good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " he argued . <p> And so there is no danger , it seems , of ISD retaliating to Argos 's move into its territory with a counter attack mimicking the Home Retail Group owned firm 's main proposition . <p> " We have focused all our efforts on combining online and the TV , " the CEO said . <p> " Everyone will soon be watching the TV on their laptops and iPads and I think the convergence of the technologies between the internet and the TV has much more potential than the traditional catalogue model .

" <p> There is no denying that retail has struggled in the aftermath of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and companies , from baby and mother products specialist Mothercare to entertainment retailer HMV , issuing profit warnings . <p> Meanwhile , last Monday 's report from the BA showed that there has been a 26 per cent reduction in its membership base over the last five years , prompting the group to urge the government to address a number of factors holding back growth . <p> In a recent survey of the association 's members the top three issues to tackle in order to improve trading conditions were said to be business rates ( 29 per cent ) , parking ( 28 per cent ) and planning ( 13 per cent ) all subjects at the heart of BIRA 's lobbying . <p> Weedon said : " We need to level the difference between out-of-town parking , which is free , and in-town parking which is expensive . Currently there is a ? 1 billion disincentive to go into town . <p> " Business rates must be reduced for suffering town centres and , as Secretary of State for Communities &amp; Local Government Eric Pickles said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of local councils to reduce them . <p> " It is also important to consult furiously on the national planning policy framework the consultation period ends on October 17th 2011 . " <p> By the very nature of his job , which sees him lobby the government and campaign on behalf of independent retailers across the UK , Weedon must remain optimistic about the future of the high street but it is mainly because there appears to be so much at stake . <p> " Everyone must read the 58-page planning document because the consultation closes in one week 's time and it 's going to set the theme for at least the next decade of planning . It needs to be right and it needs to be now . " <p> Despite his sense of urgency , Weedon is confident that the journey of the British high street will be one defined more by gradual evolution rather than rapid demise , and he expects it to serve different functions as the years go by . <p> Service-led businesses have become increasingly ubiquitous on the UK high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this will continue . <p> " People are often sniffy about this but LDC shows there are an increasing number of tattoo parlours and pawnbrokers , for example , " Weedon commented . <p> " They add to the life of the town and these services are also difficult to deliver via the internet so why not have them ?

" <p> O'Hare says that the development is being led by a " certainty of demand " and that half of the space at the site has all ready been reserved by interested retailers . <p> Construction should commence in the latter half of 2012 and be complete by late 2013 if planning approval is granted , creating 200 construction jobs and 300 full and part-time position in retail and associated jobs . <p> " This development has much wider implications as it secures the vitality of a city centre , " O'Hare added . <p> " It offers sustainability to existing retailers with the introduction of a wider critical mass and it offers hope for many in wider society- that there is a light at the end of the current , dark @ @ @ @@@4373481 <p> Following the parade

 COO Andrew White <h> Tuesday 08 November 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> As a recent Retail Gazette feature highlighted , now is a good time for foreign retailers to invest in the UK and that is exactly what Dutch retail group Macintosh did earlier this year with its acquisition of shoe specialist Jones the Bootmaker . <p> Details of the reported ? 40 million deal were made public in January and the takeover was completed in the spring . Since then , the Jones team has spent the rest of the year proving what a strong business its new parent company has acquired . <p> Six months on from the deal completing , Retail Gazette caught up with the retailer 's Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) Andrew White , who is confident the 90-strong store portfolio Macintosh took on earlier in 2011 is set to swell in the years ahead . <p> " Jones has been opening eight to ten new stores a year for sometime now and we will continue to do that as long as we can find sites that suit our profile and our customer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are opening profitable shops in the first year of new ownership , so we are quite careful about the locations we go into . " <p> New sites for the company this year have brought some surprising results , with premium locations performing better than expected , and success in less upmarket towns giving the company hope that its brand will be welcomed by a larger demographic in the future . <p> " We recently opened a site in Crawley which is n't the usual area we 'd go for but it is trading well , giving us scope to go into less premium locations for expansion , " White explained . <p> " Opening in Fleet Street was a no brainer we have been very strong in The City of London from day one , but our Westfield Stratford City unit has automatically become our best performing store in the country . " <p> White explained that in the seven full weeks since the east London shopping centre opened its doors to the public for the first time , his company 's store there has regularly taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ten months of 2011 total trading was up by almost four per cent year-on-year , but budgets were down . Margins are better than 2010 though , primarily because the bootmaker has not been forced into heavy discounting like other British traders . <p> You only have to take a walk down any UK high street and see the plethora of special offer signs in numerous shop windows , crying out to customers to spend money , to realise that Jones ' limited promotional activity goes against the grain . <p> Explaining the retailer 's current operations , White added : " We have focused on improving quality , but we have seen the VAT rise and the increase in raw material costs have an impact . <p> " We are running a boot promotion at the moment , but we 're not putting our products out on racks , we 're still merchandising them . " <p> Inevitably with any business takeover , a reshaping of the senior management structure is required , and things have been no different at Jones over the last few months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of the acquisition , left the business shortly after it was sold , having been keen to secure a private equity deal rather than a trade sale . <p> Ken Bartle and Peter Phillips , who according to White are two " iconic people in the shoe trade " and were major shareholders in Jones at the start of the year , have also opted to step down , although Bartle has stayed on a consulting basis while the company is integrated into the Macintosh group . <p> " I have taken on more responsibilities this year , looking after more departments . At the moment I 'm responsible for everything except for buying and finance , " White added . <p> " There are possibilities that this responsibility will increase further in the new year . " <p> Having been at Jones the Bootmaker for 24 years , working up from store manager to area manager , and then on to marketing and property roles , there is an argument that White is well-positioned to lead Jones on the ground in the UK under its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by Dutch corporate Macintosh <p> And when commenting on his rise through the ranks , it is clear that White holds a great deal of affection for the brand and is not set to move away from the business any time soon . <p> " I love the company and have had an opportunity to progress within it rather than seeing my career held up , " he acknowledged . <p> But when pushed on his future ambitions within the company , which could feasibly include heading up Jones in a General Manager capacity , he opted to focus on areas of the business that he would rather steer clear of . <p> " Just do n't let me loose on the buying section that would be a disaster ! " <p> Having also bought Belgium-based shoe specialist Brantano in 2008 , Macintosh is on a mission to stamp its authority on the UK footwear market by representing a ten per cent share of it in the not-too-distant future . <p> White says there are various challenges for international retailers trying to enter this particular sector of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if analysts ' forecasts of a spate of new year retail industry collapses prove correct . <p> " From a footwear perspective , international retailers expansion to the UK is a double-edge sword , " explained White . <p> " In London our trends tend to be six months ahead of central Europe , so it gives companies early reaction to ranges that they would n't necessarily get in mainland Europe . <p> " On the other hand , some firms consider the competition is too strong , especially in the south-east when you look at concepts like the Shoe Galleries in Selfridges department store , making them think it may be a tall order to start from scratch . <p> " London is a great place to be from a fashion point of view , but it is also hard to break into .

 The Big Interview <h> Wednesday 16 November 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> It is easy to define eras in certain industries , but perhaps a little more difficult to succinctly explain how retail has reinvented itself over the years . <p> In music , for example , there was the swinging sixties , the new romanticism of the 1980s and early 90s ' Brit Pop , but in retail it is a challenge to define just how the process of selling has changed over time . <p> Current Hobbycraft Chairman and experienced senior retailer Simon Burke , whose first major industry role was as CEO of music specialist Virgin Retail , believes retail can be broken down into three distinct ages separated by technology - with the third of those only just being born . <p> " I think it is the beginning of a new technological era there is no question about it , " he told Retail Gazette . <p> " There are perhaps three eras you can talk about in retail : The first is the pre-internet era when up until the late 1990s shops were shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something separate and quite small and specialised . <p> " Then you had the internet era , which has come along and in some sectors has completely revolutionised shopping , but in others it had had more limited impact . <p> " Now I think we are at the beginning of the mobile era . I 'd compare to this to where the internet was in around 1998 just before it really started to take off . " <p> Burke , who has previously been Chairman at Irish supermarket group Superquinn and toy specialist Hamleys , believes that retailers need to get over the fear factor relating to the impending mobile revolution ; something he claims held back many companies during e-commerce 's emergence on the scene at the start of this century . <p> While online-only retailers and a selection of high street stores got to grips with e-tail at an early stage , there were just as many companies operating in the industry which shied away from its advances . <p> " When the internet came along - and to some extent , the feelings still exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Burke remarked . <p> " Some have always had this fear of pushing too hard in their online business for fear of undermining store sales , a theory reinforced by the spate of stores closing down and high streets becoming deserted . Internet trading is seen as a contributor to this . " <p> Now , the experienced Irishman is keen for retailers not to make the same mistakes when it comes to m-commerce . <p> " It is very early days , but I think retailers have a lot of waking up to do to the potential that this actually offers their in-store businesses , " he said . <p> " With mobile technology , what is beginning to dawn on retailers is that there does not have to be an either/or . <p> " This is a technology which is n't going to take business away from shops it can actually be deployed to promote business in shops . " <p> The likes of Burke , who in his role as Non-Executive Chairman of mobile voucher firm Eagle Eye Solutions is at the forefront of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are backing mobile tech , do not want retailers to miss out on the opportunities presented to them by this new technological platform . <p> Dubbed Simply Tap , the tool developed by Charles Dunstone 's The Mobile Money Network allows customers to order products from participating stores such as Carphone Warehouse , Thorntons and Pretty Green , just by entering a corresponding code displayed in store or online . <p> " Since leaving Tesco he has invested in a lot of retail and retail-related businesses , but what is different about Eagle Eye is that he is actually giving time to it . We hugely value the fact that we meet with him every month . <p> Sir Terry Leahy is a keen advocate of mobile technology in retail , and has invested in mobile voucher firm Eagle Eye Solutions <p> " As you would expect he has been able to open some very interesting doors for us not least with Tesco . " <p> With so many of retail 's most successful figures from the last decade offering their backing to mobile development within the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium as an area in which to invest . <p> Burke certainly maintains that it is the way forward , and he sees huge marketing benefits for businesses which get involved in the initiative he is backing , with companies able to experience greater redemption rates for vouchers at more cost-effective prices . <p> " We think vouchering is a critical element of moving traffic into stores , " he argued . <p> " The other big thing is price comparison and information as you shop , and potentially location-based marketing , which are all things that will make it easier for people to do their shopping in stores . " <p> Comparing the success of voucher schemes in operation when he was in charge of Superquinn to the potential provided by mobile-based systems now , Burke described today 's technology as " a totally different phenomenon " . <p> " We 'd mail our customers with vouchers , and if you got a conversion of five per cent on that that would be extremely good , " he added . <p> " In the case of mobile vouchers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , but we have seen redemption rates of up to 90 per cent in certain regions during trials Eagle Eye undertook . " <p> It is expected that Sir Stuart Rose 's initiative will receive further backing from retailers in the months ahead as the benefits of the technology become clearer , and Burke revealed that Eagle Eye is in talks with three of the UK 's biggest grocers about deploying its mobile voucher system in their stores . <p> Fashion , electricals and household goods specialists , as well as sportswear , arts &amp; crafts and pet product retailers , are all reportedly showing an interest too . <p> " It 's really a case of across the board , " Burke clarified . <p> " There is no retailer that is n't interested in planting a promotional offer literally into the hands of their customer , without needing to resort to the very expensive business of mailing it out . " <p> With so many retailers struggling with the costs of running their businesses and worried about the lack of footfall in their stores , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And with the support of renowned retail professionals such as Burke , it is only a matter of time before the new mobile era is firmly established . <h> Murdered prostitute case

 Shop CEO Angela Spindler <h> Wednesday 23 November 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Angela Spindler likes to refer to her company as " one of retail 's best kept secrets " , and even she had to conduct some research on The Original Factory Shop before accepting the role of CEO at the firm back in January 2009 . <p> Despite boasting a portfolio of 176 UK stores and its senior management identifying 500 to 600 potential locations nationwide for its retail offering , the non-food discounter remains under the radar of many due to its focus on opening outside primary centres . <p> It is in the last two years however , following Woolworths ' collapse at the start of 2009 , that the business has really started to establish itself as a regular go-to place in smaller high streets up and down the country for people looking for fashion , homewares and electrical appliances . <p> Many of the units it takes on have been left vacant by failed businesses and some stores have even been opened in old garages and petrol stations , so it is effectively regenerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the likes of Frodsham in Cheshire , Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire and , most recently Ramsey near Peterborough , the value chain benefits from the convenience factor it offers its customers . <p> " I always have to use the phrase " near to " when talking about the towns we are opening in , " Spindler told Retail Gazette . <p> " Commercially , targeting smaller towns is a good strategy because people like the option of shopping locally as part of their repertoire of shopping experiences . <p> " Our shoppers will also visit supermarkets , a mall or a retail park we are just part of their repertoire but a really important one for them . " <p> Part of the attraction for The Original Factory Shop customers is the plethora of clearance products up for sale , which account for around 30 to 40 per cent of all stock depending on the time of the year . <p> The company 's roots are in Keighley , Yorkshire , where it was established in 1969 as part of Marks &amp; Spencer ( M&amp;S ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its new headquarters in Burnley , it sells overstock from retail giants such as Next and M&amp;S . <p> Although not in direct competition , it follows a similar model to fashion specialist TK Maxx in offering significant reductions from the recommended retail price , but they clearly have different target markets . <p> " We are more high street rather than designer brand , " Spindler explained . <p> Sales were up 16.4 per cent annually to ? 158 million in the last full financial year , fuelled by rapid store growth in the wake of Woolies ' demise , although the company has not been immune to the difficult trading conditions encountered since the beginning of 2011 . <p> " Due to our product range having a strong focus on fashion , we were affected by the pretty miserable summer weather and the warm autumn conditions , but that will always impact seasonal products , " the CEO admitted . <p> " Since the start of July we 're in positive territory though , with trading up on a like-for-like basis . <p> " Online is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going since April . <p> " In a store we would have thousands of SKUs and online we only have 600 , but in a typical week the internet channel is contributing to two per cent of our growth . " <p> Growth driven by internet sales is a familiar tale frequently retold at many of today 's multichannel retailers , but trade via the web at The Original Factory Store is aided by a unique take on ordering online . <p> Some 35 per cent of web sales at the company are conducted in stores with the help of a sales assistant , a process that results in the products being delivered to a customer 's home it is essentially a click &amp; deliver system played out in a physical store . <p> It is yet another feature of the business tailoring its offering to its local markets . <p> " Our customers like face-to-face contact and that they are still paying someone in the more traditional way it makes them feel more comfortable , " Spindler remarked . <p> " It 's the payment part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to touch a product before buying , which is often cited as a barrier . <p> " The system also allows people to pay in cash , and this has resulted in a huge pick-up in our online business .

" <p> Like the majority of retailers , Warden also believes that m-commerce is going to be " huge " in the years ahead , and she expects mobile and tablet devices to become increasingly important to her company 's overall offer . <p> Already 12 per cent of people who access the Heal 's website do so via one of these devices , and the CEO " can only see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully transactional m-commerce platform . <p> But while online and multichannel development remains a key focus for Heal 's , stores have not been neglected . <p> In-store kiosks have been introduced , including at its 42,000 sq ft flagship on London 's Tottenham Court Road , providing sales assistants with another opportunity to ensure customers do not leave Heal 's without having made a purchase . <p> This linking together of all retail channels is hugely important to any retail company ; be it for boosting sales , increasing brand presence or , evidently , preventing divisions forming within an individual organisation . <p> Warden said : " Initially we had stores saying that ' we do all the work and then the online rob the sale ' , but now we spend a lot of time saying that it can work just the same if not better the other way round . " <p> Commenting on the usefulness of in-store kiosks , which some analysts can not yet fully understand , she added : " Obviously I would like people to clinch a sale there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make a purchase online later . " <p> Warden also has an interesting take on what makes an ideal property location for homewares retailers , and she has not ruled out adding to the six UK stores currently operated by the company in London , Guildford , Brighton , Kingston and Redbrick Mill . <p> The latter is situated in an old mill in West Yorkshire , and the CEO believes the design could provide a blueprint for other furniture &amp; furnishings specialists looking to maximise sales . <p> " Redbrick Mill just outside of Yorkshire is a whole host of furniture retailers all under one roof in an old cotton mill , she explained . <p> " It 's a great location , full of restaurants , garden centres and all kinds of stuff . Lots of brands all under one roof it 's an interesting retail operation . <p> " I would love there to be lots more of these around the country . Rather than it being an unfriendly out-of-town , not very nice park , it is a great building , full of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who primarily want to shop for furniture but who want a relaxed and enjoyable day out at the same time . " <p> Perhaps with the homewares sector struggling in the face of the economic slowdown , proved by the recent administration of Heal 's former sister company Habitat and fellow furniture trader Lombok , there is an argument that those operating in this area of retail need to help each other out more . <p> Warden revealed that she does not expect huge growth to come from furniture at least until the middle of next year , and that reflects the majority of opinions emanating from the sector at present . <p> In fact , the Heal 's boss is concerned that heavy discounting , much of which is well-documented in the grocery sector , but which takes place in furniture retailing too , is changing the way consumers feel about shopping altogether . <p> She warned : " If retailers keep going on promotion it 's not good for the long term , because original prices will go up . <p> " It could be misleading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they should always get a discount and secondly , what is the real price ? It 's confusing times for today 's very intelligent shopper . " <p> Heal 's itself has not made a profit in the six years the existing CEO has been at the helm , but she has reduced losses every year during her tenure , having inherited an operation that was losing between ? 8-9 million per annum . <p> But for the VAT increase in January at the start of 2011 , the business would probably have moved into the black at the end of its 2010-11 financial year , according to Warden , but the decision by the government to raise the tax to 20 per cent appears to have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and retail as a whole . <p> Britain 's nation of shopkeepers are a positive group though and , despite the economic dark clouds drifting over 2012 , so many of the businesses this publication speaks to on a daily basis often identify rays of sunshine that improve the forecast for the year ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they expect to continue to see significant levels of buying activity from sunny expat communities in countries such as Italy and France , as well as higher society on UK shores . <p> " It 's a tough market and you have to cut your cloth accordingly . Newness is still important and you have to have reasons for people to want to buy things and if anything we 're developing more new product at the aspirational end , " Warden explained . <p> " You 've still got to tap into where people are spending . People are perhaps reining in expenditure at our opening price points , but they are still spending at the top end . <p> " There are consumers after ' I love it , I have to have it ' products - these are the people who are still spending at the moment . " <p> A dedication to design and a commitment to embracing new technology is helping ensure Heal 's stays fashionable in these consumers ' eyes . @ @ @ of Brits 
 Direct COO <h> Monday 12 December 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Dave Poole has been confirmed today as the new Credit &amp; Risk Director of specialist Brighthouse , starting early next year . <p> Currently the Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) of home shopping specialist Shop Direct 's financial services arm , Poole has over 20 years ' experience in total in the credit risk management services and has worked for or with many major retailers . <p> Consumers are finding the lure of buying home electricals and domestic appliances on a rent-to-buy basis increasingly attractive , as wage rises remain well under inflation , the cost of living increases and traditional forms of credit become harder to negotiate . <p> Leo McKee , CEO of Brighthouse , commented on the appointment : " Dave joins us at an important time for Brighthouse .

 Steve Lewis <h> Thursday 15 December 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Majestic Wine may have reported profits of over ? 20 million and like-for-like ( LFL ) sales growth of 5.3 per cent for its last full financial year , but CEO Steve Lewis believes that there are not enough people who understand what the retailer is famous for . <p> The company 's first TV advertising campaign since its inception in 1980 came to an end last week , and the month-long trial to boost the UK population 's knowledge of the business is set to be repeated early next year with a new marketing push planned for the spring . <p> Lewis told Retail Gazette that Majestic has reached a point in its history where it wants to showcase its unique selling points to fuel further ambitious growth in the decade ahead . <p> " We are now at the stage where we have got everything in the company exactly how we want it and we think we have got a really interesting story to tell , " he explained . <p> " Now we want to explore whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get a reasonable payback . <p> " The trial is doing exactly that and we 're learning from research around the campaign . They are small steps but I think we have a great company and it 's time we started telling more people about it . " <p> So , at the risk of repeating what customers have learned from the ads in recent weeks , as well as potentially spoiling the forthcoming advertising campaign in 2012 , what is Majestic Wine ? <p> For starters , it is a company that saw profits before tax grow 20 per cent to ? 8.8 million in the 26 weeks to September 26th 2011 , on the back of a LFL sales increase of 2.7 per cent year-on-year . <p> In that period the number of active Majestic customers grew 7.7 per cent to 534,000 , with this continuing rise in shopper numbers partly attributed to the decision two years ago to reduce the minimum purchase per customer from 12 to six bottles . <p> " Six bottles has made us much more accessible for new customers to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 per cent of our transactions are for below a dozen bottles , " Lewis commented . <p> " New stores now grow much more quickly than they did before and the move has increased the number of transactions in our stores significantly . " <p> If the management 's decision to reduce minimum sales volumes has proved to be a popular tipple with customers , then the dessert accompaniment comes through the high levels of service the business prides itself on offering . <p> Almost all of the staff employed by Majestic are graduates , and the company has an active recruitment team working to attract the best young retail talent . There is even a waiting list to get on the programme at present , with those who eventually filter through the system having to go through two thorough interview stages with store and regional management . <p> Recruiting staff who are of a similar nature to the customers they serve is an ongoing policy , so wine buffs and those into good food and travel for example , are favoured employees . <p> Sales staff are offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take exams to prove their knowledge of the industry , and this is one of the key factors that distinguishes Majestic , which has a 3.9 per cent UK wine market share , from its supermarket rivals , which boast around 80 per cent of the sector in this country . <p> " As a specialist we are operating against some of the biggest retailers in the land , " Lewis admitted . <p> He is evidently aware that Majestic must stand out through its customer service offering , its quality of staff and the events it holds . " We 've got to be a nimble , niche specialist and do whatever we do really well . " <p> He also estimates that the Majestic store portfolio has ten years of sustainable growth if it follows its current rate of expansion , with 179 outlets expected to be in operation by the end of this fiscal period , ultimately rising to around 330 in the years ahead . <p> " Over the last four years we have taken every area of the business and taken it up a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game right now , " the CEO argued . <p> " We 've got a strong range in place , we 're opening new stores more quickly than ever before , and will open 16 this financial year . <p> " Last year we only opened 12 , while in the previous two years it was six and four respectively , so you can see the growth . " <p> Lewis is a product of the Majestic graduate scheme , having joined the business in 1983 straight from university . <p> When he arrived at the retailer it only had 12 stores , and he has been fortunate enough to develop his career in line with the business ' growth , working his way up from store management , Retail Director and Chief Operating Officer roles to his current position , which he assumed in 2008 . <p> Hugely passionate about wine and the business in general , Lewis is leading an organisation seemingly on safe ground , with stores primarily located on the outskirts of towns with sufficient car parking facilities , while other retailers are struggling to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing consumer habits and seismic economic difficulties . <p> As a specialist , it is essential Majestic focuses on the things it does better than its competitors , including the major supermarkets , and it is this strategy that the company hopes to promote via its new marketing campaigns . <p> High street wine rival Oddbins , since re-launching under new owners in the autumn following its administration earlier this year , is doing the same thing through initiatives that allow customers to set price of wine through blind tastings . <p> Majestic helps top up glasses in homes nationwide , but highlighting what else the retailer brings to the table will be key to the company 's success as the grocers get ever larger and the convenience retail landscape grows yet further . <p> Lewis said : " We run free two-hour wine lessons for customers , where they can learn about vineyards , key wine varieties and how to taste wine technically . <p> " Customers love it and twice a year around 60 per cent of our customers are invited in to taste a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at a low cost , it is something the supermarkets just ca n't do .

 double digit sales rise <h> Thursday 15 December 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> Branded suit specialist Moss Bros has reported today a 10.5 per cent rise in like-for-like ( LFL ) sales since the summer and a positive start for its new store format . <p> LFL cash gross profit was up 7.9 per cent for the company in the 19 weeks ending December 10th 2011 , in spite of the difficult trading environment and the pressure put on margins by rising raw material costs . <p> In the first 45 weeks of its financial year the retailer has seen sales jump 13.4 per cent LFL and 18.5 per cent in total , and the business remains in a strong cash position thanks to the ? 12.3 million proceeds of the Hugo Boss disposal which has now all been received . <p> Brian Brick , CEO of Moss Bros , commented : " We are encouraged by the sales momentum throughout the business which has continued into this year , despite tougher comparatives . <p> " The simplification of the business model , following the disposal of the Boss franchise stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the strengths of the core Moss brand . <p> " We enter this important trading period in good shape but ever mindful of the fragile nature of consumer confidence and we continue to develop the business , whilst managing it to reflect these conditions .

 MD Henrik Madsen <h> Friday 23 December 2011 - Editorial Assistant <p> With consumers arguably seeking out bargains more eagerly than ever before and retailers particularly conscious of stock levels and supply chain efficiency in these austere times , it is perhaps no surprise that UK designer outlet shopping is on the rise . <p> For years , renowned high street retailers such as Next and Marks &amp; Spencer have used outlet shopping centres to shift out-of-season stock for up to 60 per cent off the recommended retail price , but a growing number of new brands have joined them by opening stores in these locations throughout 2011 . <p> Reiss and Fiorelli each unveiled their inaugural outlet stores at sites owned by sector specialist McArthurGlen earlier this year , adding to recognisable retail names such as Adidas , Calvin Klein and Burberry which have all worked with the property firm for some time already . <p> The latest retailer to stride onto McArthurGlen 's cut-price catwalk is Parisian clothing brand The Kooples , which launched its first venture into the designer outlet retail market on Wednesday ( December 21st ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Designer Outlet . <p> Having only arrived in the UK towards the end of 2010 and with just seven standalone stores to its name on this side of the English Channel , the early move into outlet shopping shows the high regard in which new businesses to these shores hold for this type of retail . <p> McArthurGlen 's Northern Europe Managing Director ( MD ) Henrik Madsen told Retail Gazette that , although not an option for some retailers , designer outlets are becoming a popular part of the artillery for many traders gunning for success in an increasingly tough industry . <p> " As well as The Kooples , Jaeger has just opened at out our Ashford outlet centre in Kent , " he explained . <p> " McArthurGlen tenants range from great high street multiples to niche brands and luxury retailers . <p> " It is certainly a concept that has become much more accepted among brands , as companies look at it as a way of complementing their traditional business and opening new distribution channels . <p> " Financing has become more important . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of stock in the warehouse it did n't matter it really matters today . " <p> The Kooples views the York Designer Outlet as a platform to increase sales , and the company said this week it chose to lease space because of the 3.5 million local shoppers and tourists who visit the destination each year . <p> It also acknowledged that brand adjacency The Kooples is positioned alongside Aquascutum , Gieves &amp; Hawkes and LK Bennett at the York centre was a major factor behind its decision to open at this particular site . <p> Individual retailer concerns aside , Madsen believes the increasing popularity of outlets lies in their relevance to the modern retail landscape . <p> " With the current climate so volatile it is more difficult to judge how things will be month-to-month , therefore they could see certain seasons not being as good as they should be , leading to extra stock , " he explained . <p> " There is a financial pressure in households across the UK and it does appear they are trying to shop a bit smarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this role as Northern Europe MD , Madsen holds responsibility for the performance of seven UK outlet centres , as well as the company 's designer outlet villages in Austria , Germany and the Netherlands . <p> In total , the company has 20 outlets across Europe , but despite uncertainty surrounding the future of the eurozone at present , it retains ambitious plans for further development in the new year and beyond , with Germany currently offering " a huge opportunity " due to its relatively immature outlet shopping market but sizeable population . <p> McArthurGlen holds a 21 per cent share of the European outlet shopping market , and this is set to grow with the opening of the group 's 21st outlet in Neum ? nster near Hamburg , Germany in autumn 2012 . <p> In addition , two new designer outlets in France are at the planning stage , while expansions to six of its existing centres across Europe , including Veneto , near Venice in Italy , are on the agenda . <p> According to the MD , the UK has space for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development plans on the horizon in this country . <p> " Our model is based on minimum rent , but turnover top-up . All the time we try and offer favourable payment terms . <p> " The better a retailer performs the better for everyone . Ensuring the marriage between brand and consumer works is a very big piece of what we do . " <p> With many high street retailers approaching next week 's quarterly rent day with about as much excitement as a turkey shows at this time of year , there is an argument that the wider retail property sector should show similar flexibility in rent negotiations to help prevent the stuffing being knocked out of businesses in the new year . <p> That is not Madsen 's major concern , however . While the high street is set to change beyond all recognition in the next ten years for a plethora of reasons , the Scandinavian is focused on developing an already-thriving , low-cost , out-of-town retail operation . <p> Shoppers at one of McArthurGlen 's European outlet centres <p> Prior to joining McArthurGlen in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of positions within the fashion industry , including Senior Vice President at Kenneth Cole and senior roles at IPI SpA and French Connection , but instead of fighting the cause of one specific brand the MD is now focused on the sector as a collective . <p> " We work with every brand , talking about whether the demographic is right for them , price points , stock selection and exactly what they are trying to get out of it , " he said . <p> " We are in an environment where we are probably becoming more relevant to the consumer and the brand . " <p> More new names have been lined up to be added to the list of McArthurGlen 's fashion brand leases by next spring , although Madsen wants the names kept under wraps for now . <p> These arrivals alongside The Kooples , combined with the expected continuing need of consumers to shop for a bargain , should ensure that McArthurGlen and designer outlet shopping remain a la mode in the eyes of the British public for some time yet .@@4482738 <p> This website and

 out of ideas ? <h> Tuesday 22 March 2016 - Sabharwal <p> Is less really more in the case of Apple 's new iPhone model ? <p> At a San Francisco-based keynote event on Monday evening , Apple revealed smaller versions of the iPhone and iPad Pro . <p> The tech giant said the iPhone SE is aimed at those who were n't quite ready for the Apple 6S . It features the same processing and graphics performance ( and the ability to capture 4K video ) but on a 4 " screen . Meanwhile the new iPad Pro will have a 9.7 " screen - the same size as the original iPad . <p> The iPhone SE will be the smallest smartphone in Apple 's current product range . <p> " Some people simply love smaller phones , " said Greg Joswiak , VP of product marketing for Apple .

 warns of " trouble " <h> Tuesday 22 March 2016 - Philip Gallagher <p> Mike Ashley has warned of further losses at Sports Direct . <p> The Sports Direct owner and founder refused his parliamentary summons , issued by the Business , Innovation and Skills Select Committee , calling them " show boaters " . In an interview with The Times he addressed the situation , but also painted a pessimistic picture for Sports Direct 's profits this year . <p> " We are in trouble , we are not trading very well . We ca n't make the same profit we made last year . We are supposed to be taking the profits up , they are not supposed to be coming down , and the more the media frenzy feeds on it , the more it affects us .

He went so far as to accuse Iain Wright MP and the Committee of abusing parliamentary procedure and creating a " media circus " around his company . <p> Ashley is hardly the victim of unjust practice , however . <p> " It appears to me that , so far , the proper procedures have been followed , " said parliamentary speaker John Bercow when questioned by Smith about the committee 's actions . " As long as the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses to obey the committee 's order to attend .

The publication claimed that employees were bottlenecked at security for mandatory searches which could leave them trapped at work for an additional , and unpaid , hour and 15 minutes every working week . <p> " There is no question we had issues with security , " Ashley told The Times .

 rebuttal of McCormick <h> Tuesday 29 March 2016 - Philip Gallagher <p> The bosses of Premier Foods have defended their decision to block a takeover bid by McCormick , despite anger from shareholders . <p> Last week the American spice and herb manufacturer McCormick offered a share for Premier Foods , the manufacturer of brands such as Mr Kipling and Bisto , only to have the offer unanimously turned down by the Premier board . <p> This was taken poorly by some of the company 's major shareholders . The day following the refusal , Warburg Pincus sold its stake in Premier to Japanese noodle manufacturers Nissin , leading some to claim the company had acted in the interested of one major shareholder to the detriment of the rest . <p> " The Premier board feels very confident that rejecting was a good decision , " said Chief Executive of Premier Foods Gavin Darby . " Warburg Pincus took the opportunity of selling their shares and chose to sell their shares to Nissin . Just as much as it could have been a deal between Warburg Pincus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . " <p> McCormick has said that it would only be interested in full ownership of the company . Though Darby said there is an " awful lot of time " and a strong possibility that a rival bidder will emerge , McCormick indicated that it would need to investigate Premier 's ? pension deficit before increasing its offer . <p> " It 's now a marketplace and McCormick have the opportunity to buy , some would say , of Premier shares and others would say , " Darby continued . <p> Answering McCormick 's criticism that the offer had not been properly discussed , Darby insisted that the board had met " once in the last five and a half weeks " , had had " four very significant telephone conversations " and had exchanged " emails and letters " . <p> Part of the rejection of McCormick 's bid was Darby 's own insistence that his accelerated growth plan would see company sales increase over the next few years .

 new investor of takeover bid in advance <h> Tuesday 29 March 2016 - Philip Gallagher <p> After defending its decision to refuse a takeover bid by McCormick , it has emerged that Premier Foods informed an outside business , Nissin , of the bid in advance . <p> Premier Foods was criticised for refusing the bid by American manufacturer McCormick for a share . Following this , Warburg Pincus sold its 17.3% stake to Nissin , a Japanese food company . <p> However , since then The Telegraph learned that Nissin was informed of the bid beforehand , even before it was revealed to existing major investors . With its new stake in the business Nissin is entitled to a seat on the Premier Foods board of directors , and its new cooperation agreement with Premier hinges on the UK company remaining entirely independent . <p> Shareholders were already disgruntled , with McCormick claiming that its offer was not properly discussed . Premier Foods Chief Executive Gavin Darby insisted there was an " awful lot of time " for McCormick or a rival to make a renewed bid , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning Premier Foods in its entirety , it would appear that the dialogue with Nissin was intended to frustrate a takeover . <p> " Nissin was aware of the approach by McCormick because it was essential before committing to the commercial collaboration , " a Premier Foods spokesperson told The Telegraph .

" <p> Earlier this week Darby also stated that the deal between Nissin and Warburg Pincus " could have been a deal between Warburg Pincus and McCormick . I 'm sure all three of them were involved . " <p> It has now been made clear there was no dialogue between Warburg Pincus and McCormick , with an inside source saying that McCormick was not offered the Warburg Pincus shares " at any stage " . <p> Whilst McCormick has recently reiterated its interest in Premier Foods , shareholders will no doubt be watching further developments intently . <p> The has

" While the numbers remain positive the dramatic decline in the growth of independents from 11 openings a day to just one a week reflects the challenges many independent businesses face .

 preps for an Argos takeover , what 's the digital future of retail ? <h> Thursday 28 April 2016 - Matt Wills <p> In January Sainsbury 's revealed it had been pursuing the acquisition of Home Retail , owner of Argos , for the previous three months while doubling the number of digital and technology employees to help improve its online offer . <p> Now , Home Retail Group has come out and backed Sainsbury 's ? 1.4bn takeover bid and Sainsbury 's is hiring a further 150 software developers and engineers . <p> It looks like the high-street grocer has finally secured the deal , and is laying down digital foundations , which will help it take on the likes of Amazon and diversify away from the ultra-competitive food market . <p> Digital is already a key battleground in retail , not only in terms of e-commerce but also in terms of how technology can improve the overall customer experience and how the offline and online world should interact in the future . <p> With its lamented catalogues and under-sized pencils , Argos is n't an obvious poster-child for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye after it ploughed millions into a same-day delivery service , to compete against Amazon 's Prime Same Day when they both went live in November last year . <p> If Sainsbury 's can instill digital change into the Argos shopping model with new combined stores in out-of-town retail parks , it can use technology to power a shared distribution network that would improve efficiencies and completely re-write the delivery rules of online ordering . <p> As part of the sale , Sainsbury 's will also be buying a sea of big data and granular customer insights , which can be mined for deeper intelligence that will drive improvements to the overall retail experience . <p> To truly compete with a digital disruptor brand such as Amazon or Netflix , Sainsbury 's would also need to improve its digital ability for accurate product recommendations . Over a third of Amazon sales are driven by accurate recommendations , while three quarters of what we watch on Netflix is driven by what is recommended to us . <p> More complex and multiple data sources will allow Sainsbury 's to really understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to better analyse in-store purchasing patterns for better stock management . <p> Data driven intelligence combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence would give Sainsbury 's a competitive edge across its expanded product range and allow it to factor in external data sources such as weather patterns and economic drivers to predict product demand and sales . <p> Finally , Sainsbury 's will also be looking to compete in the mobile battleground so as not to follow in the omni-channel failures of the likes of Next and BHS . <p> Innovation in retail mobile will include shopping via Facebook Messenger as well as improving the in-app / in-store experience . <p> For an example of the latter , look at US retailer Hointer and how it 's using its app to allow customers to select clothing in-store , which is then delivered to a fitting room within 30 seconds . <p> A specific dressing room number on the app directs the shopper to his clothes .

 dominate market share ahead of possible Brexit impact <h> Tuesday 28 June 2016 - Elias Jahshan <p> The latest figures released by Kantar Worldpanel research group has shown that the UK 's grocery market share has slipped into decline for the first time since January . <p> However , German supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl achieved a record high of 10.5 per cent combined market share , each holding 4.4 and 6.1 per cent of the market respectively . <p> According to Kantar figures , supermarket sales in the UK slid by 0.2 per cent for the 12 weeks to June 19 , while like-for-like grocery prices declined by 1.4 per cent compared to the same period last year . <p> This means 58 per cent of British people visited one of the two retailers in that 12 week period , with Lidl increasing sales by 13.8 per cent and Aldi by 11.5 per cent compared to a year ago . <p> Kantar 's head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt said the general decline in the market was " a continuation of the slow supermarket sector growth dating back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groceries brought about by a retailer price war " . <p> He observed overall sales at Tesco had dropped by 1.3 per cent , Morrisons fell by 2.4 per cent , Sainsbury 's dipped 1.4 per cent , while at Asda was down by 5.9 per cent . <p> However , McKevitt highlighted it had been " a good period for small retailers " . He said Co-op 's growth of two per cent was a product of the success from its recent revival , while at Waitrose , the small but increasing sales of its premium Waitrose 1 brand helped the retailer grow by 1.3 per cent . <p> McKevitt said Waitrose also now " has an unbroken period of growth dating back to 2009 the best run of any retailer outside of the discounters " . <p> " While these latest figures predate the EU referendum result , the immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a substantial fall in grocery volumes , as demonstrated by the 2008 financial crisis when basic food , drinks and household sales proved resilient , " he added . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overseas , any long term change in exchange rates may threaten the current period of cheaper groceries . <p> " Historically , higher prices have led to consumers looking for less expensive alternatives such as own-label products , seeking out brands on promotion or visiting cheaper retailers .

 : Paul Clarke , Chief of Technology at Ocado <h> Monday 04 July 2016 - Philip Gallagher <p> The supermarket sector has been fluid for a while now . <p> The traditional heavy hitters , the Big Four , have been losing ground to discounters , while new challengers like Amazon are throwing their hats into the ring to ensure that going forward there will be no shortage of choice for consumers . <p> For a number of years Ocado has been the dark horse of the sector . Despite having no store estate to speak of , Ocado has nonetheless ranked as the UK 's best supermarket by Which ? every year from 2010 to 2015 . The technology and logistics behind Ocado have had to remain top notch in order to ensure this , with consistent innovation and " self-disruption " headed by Ocado 's Chief of Technology , Paul Clarke . <p> An engineer by trade , Clarke had no previous retail experience prior to joining Ocado in 2012 , but technology is where he thrives . <p> " We have lots of people in the business who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two halves work creatively together to produce fantastic solutions , " Clark said , unfazed about his lack of any retail background . <p> " Ocado is very different from other retailers . We are this unusual combination of retail and technology business . What we do , what we 're good at and what we produce is the result of that duality . " <p> Clarke has not only overseen the continued development of Ocado 's offering , but also the emergence of the Ocado Smart Platform ( OSP ) . The company 's " duality " stems from this : Ocado is not planning to keep its platform and capabilities to itself . The OSP is a service that businesses around the world will be able to utilise . <p> Of course , this begs the question of how exactly -- and why -- Ocado reached the point of wanting to sell technology after starting as a solely " retail " business . <p> " That was always the vision the founding vision was to do online grocery via the use of significant automation and technology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clarke said . <p> " We 've obviously evolved the technology and solution , but that vision has n't changed . " <p> Indeed , automation at Ocado has come leaps and bounds . A visitor to the company 's Andover Warehouse will encounter over 1000 " smart bots " organising grocery deliveries . However , the extent of the vision in terms of Ocado 's business practices goes beyond this . <p> " We make a profit on just about everything , " Clarke said . <p> " The only reason why it 's only recently that we 've made an end of year profit is the conscious choice to reinvest in building a bigger , better solution . <p> " Right now we 're building the core of a much bigger business that we intend to become , not just in terms of platform but also capabilities . " <p> In essence , this is OSP : Ocado 's " capabilities " on offer to businesses wishing to expand their offering into a multichannel world . Clients will have the use of Ocado 's technology , warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these features themselves . <p> " The first goal is this marriage of the new ecommerce fulfilment platform and our building warehouses , " Clarke explained . <p> " The combination of those two is what we call OSP , and we want to allow brick and mortar businesses to move online using our model . " <p> Clarke drew my attention to Morrisons , which began a 25-year partnership with Ocado in early 2014 , becoming " the fastest growing online grocery business on the planet " albeit at the expense of not being allowed to develop its own separate platform . <p> " This is the kind of shortcut to online grocery that we want to offer our future OSP customers , " he said . <p> Despite Clarke 's enthusiasm , this has not been a perfect set-up : Morrisons ' ecommerce fulfilment capabilities are now entirely dependent on Ocado 's . This means where customers can order from is not determined by where Morrisons has a presence , but where Ocado can deliver to . Ocado will need to have geographically-specific distribution capabilities already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially ones based overseas , hence the focus on " building warehouses " . <p> There is also the element of increased competition in grocery ecommerce . Clarke emphasised that Ocado was set on " remaining a retailer " , but with rivals such as Amazon emerging to potentially threaten Ocado 's own business , there is a clear risk that any clients using OSP to enter ecommerce will find it difficult to compete . <p> " We 've been , in a sense , waiting for Amazon to roll out their grocery solution for many years , " Clarke responded when questioned about Amazon . <p> " We expected it to come long ago , and it 's not a surprise to us . Clearly they 're a very capable and formidable force , but at the same time the UK grocery market is highly evolved far from being saturated . <p> " We win best grocer of the year awards on a regular basis . We like to think we 're doing something right there , and looking at it from the point of view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a reason why everyone needs to move online . It 's happening whether you like it or not . " <p> Amazon is not the only threat to Ocado 's plans for OSP . Simply finding an international partner has been a long and drawn out process . Ocado even missed its own deadline to secure such a relationship after claiming it was in " multiple talks with multiple parties " at the end of last year . <p> " You definitely should n't misjudge the amount of interest out there via the number of people we 've signed , " Clarke insisted . <p> " This is a fundamental part of these companies ' future ... We 're in this for the long haul . We want to build the best platform for what we do in the world , and now we want to make it available to key customers around the world . <p> " It 's not about when we sign the first or the second . It 's about the opportunity that exists on a platform type model , and being able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to those retailers across the planet , apart from Antarctica , for a while now and there is significant interest across many different countries . " <p> While Clarke 's insistence is encouraging , Ocado representatives have been saying similar things for quite a while now . <p> Regardless , the fact remains that more businesses are moving into ecommerce , and fewer are doing this off their own backs . The UK Quarterly Outsourcing Index reported that the total value of outsourced retail deals , two thirds of which involved delivering multi-channel services , increased by 116 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2016 . Retailers are most definitely making the move , and taking on experts like Ocado to facilitate it . <p> " It 's the scale of the solution or platform that you have to build , " Clarke explained . <p> " You need everything -- you need ecommerce , you need supply chain management and forecasting , you need real time control of warehouses , you need the whole last mile piece such as tracking vans and doorstep interaction . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need all the AI and machine learning . <p> " This is a big ecosystem or platform to create . You 'll be faced with the dilemma , do I built it myself or acquire it ? There are a few companies with the technological clout to build it themselves given the race they 're in with their competitors . It 's a big piece of technology that you have to build . " <p> " The other thing is , it 's a massive risk if you have n't tried it before . For our future OSP customers , we 're offering not just a short cut but also a massively reduced risk . " <p> With a clear goal based on platform rather than grocery sales , it would seem Clarke has found a perfect niche for an engineer such as himself at Ocado . Earlier on I briefly mentioned " self-disruption " , which Clarke laid out for me as being at the core of Ocado 's technological innovation . <p> " As always there are multiple different businesses and streams , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about sustaining and powering the double digit growth we are achieving with online groceries in the UK , and also general merchandise . That 's a very important part that my division has to support . <p> " Then there 's another part , which is building the international platform , OSP , and then another is R&amp;D and 10-X planning to make a product 10 times better , in order to encourage innovation . That 's where we practice ' self-disruption ' trying to disrupt yourself before someone else disrupts you . <p> " That R&amp;D and 10-X side is very much about building solutions for tomorrow . It 's driven by what we believe will deliver value , but there are non-linear paths to innovation . You have to be prepared for that in order to find some of the most exciting future pieces of technology . " <p> All things considered , Ocado 's vision seems to hold as much value now as it did when Clarke first joined the company . Its grocery service lives and dies by the strength of its platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building so much stuff here , it 's amazing . It literally is an Aladdin 's cave . I think we 're doing an amazing amount of that , " he said . <p> " Of course , there 's more that we 'd love to do with robotics , artificial intelligence and machine learning , and that 's only going to increase . There are things on the horizon like quantum computing that will be important for us . " <p> It is within the realm of the OSP that things seem more uncertain . Its success will depend on finding the right partners ; otherwise for all Clarke 's enthusiasm the platform will amount to very little . Still , as a man overseeing the developmental side of Ocado rather than the business , Clarke has a great amount of confidence for the future . <p> " I 'm very lucky to be running the technology function of a business that really sees technology at the core of what it does , " he said . <p> " It 's very different from the kind of model you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about driving down costs rather than innovation and the sense of the possible . <p> " Here , it 's a very expansive vision . It 's asking , ' What can we do to make our technology better ? ' " <p> Inspector Philip Maguire

 to 21-year low in light of Brexit <h> Friday 08 July 2016 - Elias Jahshan <p> Consumer confidence has experienced its sharpest drop since 1994 , according to a one-off survey produced in the wake of the Brexit referendum . <p> The special Consumer Confidence Barometer , produced by market research institute GfK , has revealed that the Core Index has dipped eight points to -9 . <p> The barometer , which surveyed 2002 people online between June 30 and July 5 to measure the post-referendum sentiment , also shows that all of the key measures used to calculate the index have fallen . <p> According to GfK , there has not been a sharper drop than this since December 1994 . <p> When splitting the Core Index result , those who voted for UK to remain in the EU were at -13 , compared to the more optimistic leave camp at -5 . <p> " During this period of uncertainty , we 've seen a very significant drop in confidence , as is clear from the fact that every one of our key measures has fallen , with the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next 12 months , " GfK 's head of markey dynamics Joe Staton said . <p> The results of the survey also reveal that 60 per cent of consumers expected the general economic situation to worsen in the next 12 months , an increase from 46 per cent in June . <p> Only 20 per cent of consumers expected it to improve , compared to 27 per cent in June . <p> Meanwhile , the proportion of people who fear prices will substantially increase in the next 12 months has spiked from 13 per cent to 33 per cent . <p> Summary of GfK 's special post-Brexit Consumer Confidence Barometer : <p> " Our analysis suggests that in the immediate aftermath of the referendum , sectors like travel , fashion and lifestyle , home , living , DIY and grocery are particularly vulnerable to consumers cutting back their discretionary spending , " Staton said . <p> " As we 've learnt from previous periods of uncertainty , consumers turn to well-known brands they love and trust as a guarantee of quality and value for money . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consumer concerns by anticipating and meeting their needs . " <p> Danielle Pinnington , the managing director at shopper research agency Shoppercentric , believes the low consumer confidence means shoppers will be more careful with their spending . <p> " It 's going to be even more important for brands and retailers to work hard at fixture to persuade people to spend , " she said . <p> " Delivering ' value ' whatever that means to the shopper - is going to be critical . <p> " Retailers must assume that shopper requirements are going to change once again , and they need to be ready to adjust their offer to meet changing needs . <p> Chiuri leaves her

 the future of retail ? <h> Thursday 14 July 2016 - Elias Jahshan <p> More than two thirds of Europeans want to be able to use biometrics when making payments at retail outlets , according to a new study . <p> In Visa 's Biometric Payments study released today , whereby more than 14,200 people from across seven European countries were surveyed , 68 per cent said they wanted to use biometrics as a method of payment authentication . <p> Seventy-three per cent saw two-factor authentication as a secure way to confirm an account holder , while a third believed biometric authentication meant that their details would be safe even if their device was lost or stolen . <p> The two-factor authentication refers to something you have , such as a card or a mobile device , combined with something you are , such as a biometric or something you know , such as a PIN or password . <p> Of all the biometric authentication methods , 53 per cent expressed a preference for fingerprint over other forms , such facial recognition or iris scanning . <p> According to Visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of respondents saying they have abandoned a browser-based purchase because of the payment security process . <p> " Our research shows that biometrics is increasingly recognised as a trusted form of authentication as people become more familiar with using these capabilities on their devices , " Visa Innovations Partnerships executive director Jonathan Vaux said . <p> " However , one of the challenges for biometrics is scenarios in which it is the only form of authentication . It could result in a false positive or false negative because , unlike a PIN which is entered either correctly or incorrectly , biometrics are not a binary measurement but are based on the probability of a match . <p> " Biometrics work best when linked to other factors , such as the device , geolocation technologies or with an additional authentication method . " <p> Vaux added that as we moved into the future consumers would have an increasing number of choises in how they pay , but there was still a long way to go . <p> " While biometric forms of authentication offer significant opportunities to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only answer , " he said . <p> " In the future we will see a mix of solutions dependent on the purchasing situation .

 importance of investing in skills for young retail employees <h> Thursday 21 July 2016 - Guest Piece <p> Last Friday ( July 15 ) marked World Youth Skills Day , a day to reflect on how skills development can improve youth employment across the world . For retail businesses , this was an opportunity to encourage young people into the sector by highlighting the access routes to work , as well as the skills they can develop for a rewarding and fulfilling career in the sector . <p> The issue of youth unemployment and under-employment is global . Last year in the UK , people aged 16-24 were three times more likely to be unemployed than older workers . In a difficult job market , it can be particularly challenging as young people often feel that university is the ultimate end goal the only available option . A recent survey of graduate employers reported an eight per cent fall in advertised graduate openings in 2016 , compared with the previous year and businesses now have a responsibility to try and find alternative solutions to bridge the gap between education and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their future , the retail sector can offer a number of different entry route options , which makes a career in retail much more accessible . Once established , there are a number of training and certification programme opportunities both in-house and from organisations including the British Retail Consortium , that allow young people to develop skills on the job and learn while you earn , which enables career progression regardless of previous experience . At Asda , a tailored career development programme caters to the unemployed , school or university leavers , or a parent returning to work . All of these career development programmes pay from day one and train you on the job for the skills you need to grow and progress . <p> There is a lot of misinformation around the opportunities available to young people in retail . For many , a job in this sector will mean a sustainable and satisfying career path with a number of development opportunities along the way . <p> Retailers can be effective partners to education institutions , by working together to provide higher education opportunities for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the degrees in turn will benefit the business . An example of an effective partnership is the On Your Marks programme , which sees Asda partner with Middlesex University to give colleagues the chance to gain a university degree while working . Colleagues can boost their future career while retailers secure the skills they are looking for in future directly to career progression , this programme allows colleagues to gain practical experience alongside a qualification and achieve career promotion to management positions . <p> As well as developing graduate and in-house talent , retailers are also able to play a key role in ensuring young people in their community have access to jobs , even if they 're not currently in education , employment or training . Private and public sector partnerships between retailers , charities and government can result in real job opportunities . Many retailers have partnered with the likes of Movement to Work Business in the Community or the Prince 's Trust to run structured training programmes for young people to gain in-store and class based experience .

 oil and debt : The career of BHS ' Dominic Chappell <h> Wednesday 07 September 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> He has been described by some as a " millionaire playboy " and by others as the man who brought down BHS . As a man who seems to have rarely disappeared from the headlines over the past few months , the Retail Gazette takes a look at the career of Dominic Chappell who infamously bought BHS for ? 1 in 2015 . <p> Accounts of Chappell 's career prior to the acquisition of BHS are somewhat patchy . This is primarily due to the fact that he simply did n't feature on the radar of big businesses and its leaders . When compared to the league of business at which owners of nationwide department stores operate , Chappell 's career prior to his takeover of BHS was relatively modest . <p> He was born in Surrey , in a small town called Sunbury-on-Thames . He was educated in the prestigious Millfield public school in Somerset alongside countless high profile sporting names , such as BBC chief political correspondent John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His early career saw Chappell as an aspiring racing driver . It is unknown where his early funding to pursue a career in motorsport was found , but Chappell stated in an interview with the BBC that his family has always been involved in the oil trade in Libya . Associates also report he has access to a family trust fund in Gibraltar . <p> Chappell 's venture into motorsport lasted from 1986 until 1999 and saw him reach the level of formula three . During his racing stint he competed in three 24 hour Le Mans races , yet failed to finish all three . <p> It was during this period that he experienced his first , now-infamous insolvency , entering into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement that enables the individual to avoid bankruptcy , attributing it to a failed formulae one team he had invested in . <p> Following this came Chappell 's first venture into entrepreneurship . In 2001 he set up the Interactive Sportscar Championship ( ISC ) . The concept behind this venture was to fit all the cars with on-board dashboard cameras , offing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the ahead of its time . <p> Despite a promising concept , the predictions of popularity essentially brought about its almost instantaneous downfall . Chappell predicted 250,000 subscribers , washing over advice from insiders stating that even Berny Ecclestone 's formula one was receiving just 9000 viewers a race . <p> The ISC folded after a single race . Noone except the racetrack owners were paid any money , including the winners of the race who were promised ? 20,000 . <p> " We , as racing teams , are looking for championships to take part in , and he advertised this race championship . It was supposed to be televised and we were told there was a television deal so there 'd be some prize money , " Martin , a racing team director , said at the time . <p> " But we got to the point of the first race with everyone still questioning whether it was real . " <p> In 1993 Chappell became director of Eyot , a property firm he ran alongside his father Joe . In the face of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Foxton 's estate agents over an unpaid fee , Chappell remained director until 2008 . <p> However , the company fell into administration in 2008 , owing ? 230,000 to Lloyds Bank . <p> Perhaps his most famous venture , aside from BHS , was his joint venture to develop the Isle of Wight 's Island Harbour Marina with his father . This development would see 48 new homes , 26 luxury waterside properties plus private moorings and a personal helipad built for himself . <p> In 2009 after six months of development , the project was put into administration . Loans totaling ? 24 million were called in in March and administrators were appointed . Sources report that like his motorsport venture , this left numerous businesses and creditors out of pocket . <p> His personal assistant at the time told the Mirror : " Initially my job was just to get rid of people calling for money . There were 10 calls every day -- people who had done services for him , people who had set up computers , phone lines , caterers who had provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 12,000 and it almost ran them into the ground . I was told to tell them cheques had been posted . " <p> Chappell said all his staff and creditors had been payed and that these claims were " nonsense " . <p> This property venture plunged the entrepreneur into his second bankruptcy and he was declared unemployed in 2009 . <p> Chappell remained " penniless " up until 2013 when he told accountancy firms chasing him for the ? 24 million deficit that he had no assets . Upon trying to seize his ? 300,000 home in Dorset the company withdrew because the equity would not justify the trial costs . <p> It is unclear how a penniless entrepreneur with no retail experience managed to introduce himself to and secure a deal with Sir Phillip Green , who had owned BHS since 2000 through his Arcadia Group retail empire . <p> During the time between his bankruptcy and his acquisition of BHS Chappell stated that he received a ? 5 million " bonanza " from his oil storage facility in Cadiz , Spain . The sum is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Chappell was introduced to Green through Paul Sutton , who lost ? 160,000 on the marina development . Sutton has previously submitted a bid for BHS and says he hired Chappell as his driver to try and recoup some of his investment losses . <p> Green was informed that Sutton had previously been convicted for fraud , and " cut all ties " with him . <p> The finer details of the acquisition remain unclear , even following the headline-grabbing parliamentary inquiry in the collapse of BHS . What 's clear is that many were surprised at Chappell 's successful bid for the company , as several previous bids had failed . <p> It is thought Chappell was not clear on the significant deficit that was looming in BHS pensions scheme , and 13 months later BHS fell into administration . <p> Since then , the 88-year-old British retailer has now all but disappeared from our <h> Irish consumer sentiment 
 , his route into business was far from conventional . <p> " I was pretty good at school , top set for everything . A friend of mine offered me a job at 15 so I left school completely and jumped into the back of a transit van every morning , " he said . <p> " My parents got into a lot of trouble for truancy . This is a story I see a lot in business , people leaving school early to chase a career " . <p> After 10 years in the plastering business , was forced to reevaluate his career path when the financial crisis " wiped the floor " with the industry . <p> " You 're in a minimum wage job and you think you yourself " I 'm better than this " , but you do n't have the knowledge or the education to do anything about it . " <p> Frustrated with his situation and being priced out of his profession by overseas laborers , he returned to college and eventually embarked on a PhD in . Although he never finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HiCi 's success . <p> " Before I went to university I got all my information from the red top papers , going to university I learned to be a lot more critical about things , much more cautious . I think that 's part of the reason my business is where it is now . " <p> With a short time left of his course , he was encouraged by his wife to pursue an invention he had come up with when renovating purchased home. # <p> The first incarnation of what is now a stainless steel , three-year guaranteed tool which sells for ? 100 was made from scraps of metal and had the electronics drawn on in pen . <p> Despite this , knew his industry and knew he had found a solution to a significant problem . <p> " I went to see Oxford innovation , I had this tool which everyone said was a good idea but I could n't do anything about it because I was doing my PHD , " he said . <p> " My wife said just go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really enjoyed it , I was only there for an hour but I came away knowing it was what I wanted to do . " <p> However , he was told that while he was perusing his PhD , they could n't help him . So as every entrepreneur with a good idea must do , he made the difficult decision to leave his secure job and pursue his passion . <p> Securing investment from conventional sources proved difficult , he recalled : " As soon as banks hear the invention word they want nothing to do with it . " <p> Thankfully platforms that are as innovative as the products they fund exist . was encouraged to fund his project on Crowdcube . <p> " You have to say to people here 's our idea , can I have some money ? And that is really hard to do , " he said . <p> " It was a real validation , some builders put in a couple of grand that showed us they 're really behind it . <p> " For small businesses like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The product reached its ? 100,000 target in eight days over funded by 25 per cent . The strength of the Trig Jig products was a major factor in this success story , but was clear that this was not all he attributes to his success . <p> " I always read this . I honestly believe the best thing is to get help . Give away business to get the right people . I was n't precious about it at all , I know my strengths but there are lots of gaps in my knowledge , " he said . <p> " So find someone that can fill those gaps , ask for help .

Last year sales topped ? 1 billion on Black Friday , never before has this been spent in a single day in the history of UK retail . <p> With statistics reaching such dizzying heights , is it actually possible for retailers to do badly out of the event ? <p> " Black Friday can be a high-risk high-reward activity for retailers , but if appropriate planning and preparation is conducted , the rewards can be well worth it . There are many retailers that hate Black Friday , " partner and head of the retail specialist at Menzies LLP Roberto Lobue said . <p> Despite the astonishing figures , Black Friday is actually a big risk for retailers . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and accurate predictions in terms of stock can be made , the event can be catastrophic for retailers . Yet in today 's retail landscape , there is little opportunity to opt out . <p> " If a retailer is guilty of an offence , the company and its officers can be liable to an unlimited fine . " <p> " It has the potential to significantly affect retailers ' margins and skew the sales data for the entire year ... Retailers have to find the right balance between providing enticing discounts but not cutting margins on all product lines , " continues Lobue . <p> " Up until a few years ago , retailers were going into Black Friday blind , but now most businesses will have at least two years of records at their disposal . <p> " Ensuring that the appropriate systems and staff are in place to handle demand is vital and it is advisable that contingency arrangements are considered should demand exceed expectations . " <p> Stock and infrastructure are important factors to consider for retailers , however more dangerous and more hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers are as of yet unaware of could disrupt them majorly down the line . <p> Sarah Briscall , Solicitor at Shulmans LLP commented : " Retailers across all sectors should be aware that , aside from the usual commercial issues which may arise when sales increase there are also legal issues which can compound during a period of increased sales . <p> " Each channel , whether it be online , face to face in a shop , or over the telephone , imposes different obligations on a retailer to ensure compliance with the laws designed to protect consumers and it is very easy to trip up on a technicality . <p> " With the impact of Brexit yet to be really felt , 2016 is likely to be even bigger " <p> " These include requirements in respect of specific pre-contract information which must be provided to a consumer , cancellation rights and steps to confirm a contract . " <p> These new changes to legislation are put in place to ensure the consumer is protected , but if the retailer does not ensure they have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devastating for the retailer . <p> " If the retailer fails to provide information which relates to the consumer 's right to cancel , the consumer 's right to a refund for a period of up to 2 weeks after the sale will be automatically increased by up to an additional 12 months , " Briscall added . <p> " If a retailer is guilty of an offence , the company and its officers can be liable to an unlimited fine . This could potentially wipe out the retailers revenue over Black Friday or worse , force its closure . <p> " The legislation has been in place for a little while now and the regulators and courts are unlikely to have much tolerance for lack of knowledge of the legislation when considering any non-compliance " <p> It is certainly not guaranteed that Black Friday will boost a retailer 's sales to astronomical levels , and without rigorous preparation the event could prove as a significant hindrance to any business taking part . <p> " 2014 saw fights breaking out in stores as people tried to get their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved largely online with many websites struggling to cope with visitor volume , " commented Lobue . <p> " With the impact of Brexit yet to be really felt , 2016 is likely to be even bigger with the deal period more than likely to extend to over the weekend or for the entire following week .

 retailers have never considered new payment tech <h> Thursday 06 October 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> New research conducted by PayPal has revealed that small businesses are losing out on sales by failing to modernise their payment capabilities . <p> 44 per cent of small businesses , many of which are retailers , have never carried out a review of their payment methods despite the significant advances over the last few years . <p> Contactless payment , smartphones and digital wallets have grown exponentially in popularity over the last few years , but a significant majority of small business retailers are failing to implement new payment technologies . <p> Despite mobile shopping growing at nearly four times the rate of overall online spending , the payment giant 's study has found that only 17 per cent of retailers have a mobile friendly website and only four per cent have a mobile app that takes payments . <p> Sixty-three per cent of consumers were found to have abandoned a purchase online because the retailer did not offer their preferred payment method , 56 per cent also admitted to this in a bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put more customers off a purchase than poor customer service , queues at a checkout and delivery charges . <p> " Businesses that do n't join the 21st century stand to lose out , " PayPal UK small business director Nicola Longfield said . <p> " The good news is that much of this technology is designed to make life easier for small businesses , as well as consumers . <p> " Integrating a simpler check-out process , where customers do n't have to enter their card and delivery details every time on a tiny screen can help convert more sales .

 74% of retailers failing to engage with millennial shoppers <h> Friday 07 October 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> According to new research by Maybe* , a quarter of millennial shoppers consult social media before they commit to a purchase . <p> Despite this significant proportion of shoppers turning to social media , just over a quarter of retailers actively use social media to engage with customers . <p> The study focused on shoppers between the age of 16 and 34 in a bid to gain greater understanding of modern shopping habits . <p> Engagement with social media is becoming increasingly important for millennial shoppers . This was highlighted recently at London Fashion Week , where the world 's leading fashion brands threw away the well-established model of a six-month runway to retail waiting time , in order to deliver on millennials demand for instant access spawned by social media . <p> " The research presents an interesting dichotomy . On the one hand , 1 in 4 millennial shoppers are actively using social media to influence their decision making , yet on the other three quarters of retailers are failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Consequently , they 're missing a huge opportunity to engage with consumers and help to facilitate a sale . " <p> Following the research , a new collaborative campaign has been set up called " What do you think ?

 to Liam Fox warns of price hikes after a " bad Brexit " <h> Monday 10 October 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> The British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) has warned the government that without a " good " Brexit , retailers and shoppers will suffer . <p> In a letter addressed to Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox , a key figure in Brexit negotiations , the BRC has pledged to work alongside the government to avoid " a disproportionately severe impact on retailers and their customers " . <p> According to the BRC , the government must establish trade deals ensuring import costs are kept to a minimum . <p> They added that the effects of defaulting to the World Trade Organisation 's ( WTO ) rules following the activation of Article 50 means both retailers and consumers would suffer . <p> Under WTO rules the BRC have said that tariffs on food and clothing could rise sharply , with meat increasing by 27 per cent and clothing and footwear up to 16 per cent . <p> Another key point of the letter encourages the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , stating that the 200,000 EU workers deserve to know they will be welcome here after Brexit . <p> " We will be supporting the government through this complex and difficult process , helping them analyse how increased cost pressures on retailers could mean higher shop prices and identifying any opportunities for new trade deals that could benefit consumers , " BRC chairman Richard Baker said . <p> KPMG has promoted

Tell us a bit about yourself and your background before ShopStyle . <p> My career has been a series of great opportunities . I started my career with L.E.K . consulting , working in both their Boston and London offices . As a strategy consultant , I offered growth , acquisition and business development advice to companies in the life sciences , finance and retail sectors . <p> As a first job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at a certain point I decided I wanted to invest in the growth and success of a single business . At the time , Thomas Cook was expanding its online travel business and brought me in to manage corporate development for the chief executive . I then moved into a commercial role managing one of their product verticals . <p> When Thomas Cook started a significant restructuring process and I questioned my future there , ShopStyle came knocking . I started as head of commercial , managing ShopStyle 's retailer relationships across Europe . I am now the director of business development , responsible for driving new revenue opportunities for the business . <p> What got you into the retail sector in the first place ? <p> My move was opportunistic I was offered an opportunity to take a step up in my career and do so in a fast-moving , exciting business . Of all the industries I have worked in , fashion and tech is definitely the most fun . <p> Even though I work in the online space and ShopStyle does n't own any product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it everywhere you go . You recognise trends you 're featuring in website editorial , you pass by high street stores of the brands you work with . It makes it very relatable . <p> I also love working for a site that I believe offers a great customer experience and unique value to our users . Even my husband is a loyal ShopStyle user , so we must be doing something right . <p> My overall responsibilities are to help drive revenue from new opportunities outside the US . As I 've moved through the role and as the business has changed , this has meant taking on a variety of different work streams , initiatives and teams . I do whatever the business needs at a given point in time . <p> Right now , my focus is on international growth of our Collective program , a monetisation platform for influencers and app developers . We provide access to our entire product catalogue and a collection of tools and analytics to help individuals drive revenue from all their content , whether it be blog , video or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the US and UK , we 're now setting our sights on Asia , the Middle East and several other European markets . I 'm responsible for this growth and managing the team that drives it . <p> How has your previous experience aided your current job ? <p> My consulting background gave me a great foundation in problem solving , analytics and project management . Each project was a new " problem " we had to solve through a structured approach to research and analysis , sometimes needing to be creative and determined with the way we got to answers . With each project only lasting four to six weeks on average , I also had to become an expert in a lot of things quickly , be detail-oriented , and understand how to communicate complicated issues simply and effectively . <p> Can you explain the concept behind ShopStyle ? <p> It is an online fashion destination with 18 million items across apparel , accessories and home for women , men and kids . It 's presented to you in a beautiful , easy-to-use search experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for that perfect dress , on ShopStyle you can see everything at once .

You can also get inspiration from our editors if you 're not sure how to rock a new trend . It 's this breadth of product coupled with great functional experience that makes ShopStyle unique . <p> What 's the most challenging aspect of your job ? <p> Time management . While Collective is my primary focus , I also work on other projects for the business and help run our European office , so I have to wear several hats and jump between different activities . <p> I have to make sure I carve out time each day to focus on each initiative without getting distracted by the others , and ensure I 'm delivering to all deadlines . Working for an American company and managing many international markets also means I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need from San Francisco before I leave for the day , coordinating with our PR agency in France , visiting partners in Italy and reaching out to businesses worldwide . It keeps things busy but interesting . <p> The most rewarding ? <p> Seeing all of the amazing things our business is doing and knowing that you 're a part of it . I 'm proud to work for Popsugar Inc , the family umbrella that owns ShopStyle , Collective and the Popsugar media business . I 've never worked anywhere that delivers as much change , new product and exciting content , whether it be a new social monetisation tool , market research reports or an exclusive interview with Hilary Clinton . <p> The company has also reached some amazing milestones in the last few years , from reaching 100 million monthly unique visitors across the Popsugar properties to driving $1 billion ( USD ) in sales for our retailer partners . <p> What advice would you give someone who is considering embarking on a career in retail ? <p> Do n't be afraid to take whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built on opportunities the people I have met in my roles and the projects I have worked on or have volunteered to take on . It 's okay to start small and work your way up , but it can be helpful to have an ultimate goal in mind so you know where you want to get to . Be willing to work hard and see where it takes you . <h> Lafayette High principal 
 over allegations of unfair pay cuts <h> Monday 17 October 2016 - Elias Jahshan <p> Tesco is facing a lawsuit on grounds of age and gender discrimination from employees who allege their wages have been cut for working weekends , bank holidays and evenings . <p> The group of employees , who joined the supermarket before 1999 , are fighting the wage reduction introduced by the Big 4 grocer in July this year . <p> Tesco initially announced the changes in February after a period of consultation with trade union Usdaw and staff representatives . <p> The Big 4 grocer said a 3.1 per cent pay rise to ? 7.62 per hour made it one of the highest payers in the retail , although double time on Sunday and bank holidays were replaced with time and a half rates instead . <p> Despite this , lawyers from Leigh Day have written to Tesco demanding it fully discloses how many employees are affected by the decision . <p> The firm estimates the figure could be as high as 50,000 of Tesco 's hourly paid staff who are mostly over 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also argues that all staff employed prior to July 5 , 1999 have seen their previous benefits reduced and that the imposed pay cut discriminates against certain groups of staff . <p> " These long-serving employees are especially angry that they only found out about the decision when news was leaked to the national press in January 2016 , " said Paula Lee , the Leigh Day lawyer representing the group of employees . <p> " Tesco employs 380,000 people in the UK and the decision to impose pay cuts on long-serving employees is a bitter pill for our clients to swallow and we believe it is discriminatory . <p> " There seems to be growing trend amongst retailers to cut staff wages and use those savings across other areas of the business . <p> " It is the longer serving staff in these retail organisations who usually suffer . Understandably our clients feel their loyalty is being taken advantage of ; that the employer knows they are unlikely to leave their jobs and in turn , that makes them feel vulnerable to further ' no choice ' pay cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson for Tesco said : " Earlier this year we announced a pay increase of up to 3.1 per cent for colleagues working in our stores across the UK , in addition to a five per cent turnaround bonus . <h> Dallas goes top

Now that service in Britain has improved over the years , consumer expectations have also increased . <p> " It 's a warning to businesses that they can no longer hide behind poor service , and British people are more than willing to switch companies if they make just one mistake .

 the elimination of Sir Philip Green 's knighthood <h> Wednesday 19 October 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> Nearly 50 MPs have publicly voiced their support to strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood ahead of tomorrow 's debate . <p> Tory MP Richard Fuller , alongside independent MP Michelle Thompson have urged the Honours Forfeiture Committee to recommend Green 's title be revoked and for the issue to be included in tomorrow 's debate . <p> 47 MPs , including ex-cabinet minister Alex Salmond , much of the SNP and other former front benchers from Conservative and Labour parties have pledged their support for Fuller and Thompson 's calls for an amendment to the debate . <p> Let 's put the question to you , our readers . Do you think Sir Philip Green deserves to have his knighthood stripped ? <p> If successful , the amended motion will read " ( This House ) noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services for the retail industry , believes his actions raise the question of whether he should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knighthood be cancelled and annulled . " <p> Speaker John Bercow holds the final decision on whether the motion is included and a vote is held in the House of Commons , but even if the vote is held it would be non-binding . <p> Frank Field 's original motion for tomorrow 's debate focuses on Green 's handling of BHS prior to selling it for ? 1 , and his responsibility to fulfil his promise to fund the pensions deficit which stands at over half a billion pounds .

 David Mordecai Chief Executive of Hawkin 's Bazaar <h> Saturday 22 October 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> One retailer who is trying to move away from their association with Christmas is the legacy toy retailer Hawkin 's Bazaar . <p> Any millennial will recall the excitement at seeing a Hawkin 's Bazaar catalogue drop through the letterbox and relentlessly selecting every toy you wanted that Christmas . However much the same as those excited children , the retailer has had to grow up and move with the times , learning that life can get difficult along the way . <p> In 2011 the retailer fell into administration in the heart of the Christmas period on which it usually depended . David Mordecai joined five months later as chief executive . Since then the retailer has tripled its stores , nearly doubled its revenue and has plans to expand to another 20 outlets in the next few years . <h> " When we went into administration , we had no online presence . " <p> Having created one of the UKs most popular toy chains from scratch , Mordecai turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern consumer . <p> " The administration happened in December 2011 , the main reason for the demise was because the focus was totally on the retail side of the business . They 'd opened 130 stores , 60 of those were pop up stores , the rest were big locations , big rent and big property costs . Cash quickly became an issue , " said Mordecai . <p> " In addition to that I think a process had started where Hawkins had become about pocket money , low prices items and toys . The culture had started to change in the country " <p> " Another reason behind that is that it was very Christmas dependent , which is very dependent on footfall . However , if you look at it there is less people on the high street over Christmas because of online . Because Hawkins was so dependent on footfall and Christmas , we 've tried to take the dependency away . " <p> Clearly the old model which had proven so successful in the past no longer worked for the toy retailer . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader with enough experience to be able to cut the dead weight from a business , and implement innovation effectively . <p> " Firstly , we 've looked at products , a lot of our new products lend themselves to seasons other than Christmas , they relate to when films come out for instance . <h> " We almost carpet bombed the country . We sent out millions of these things , the costs were quite large , the risks were quite large . " <p> " Star Wars brands to tie in with the new film , same with Harry Potter brands . We tend to go with brands or licenses which have a bit of longevity . Other merchandise is there for the film then it disappears again . <p> " We 've also introduced a lot more radio controlled products , in particular Helicopters and more recently drones . Instead of stocking one drone at ? 15 , by the coming Christmas we 'll be doing a drone at ? 400 , we are looking at more than just people buying a gift for Christmas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot higher levels than we 're doing but we 're working our way up the food chain . This Christmas drones will be the number one seller in our stores there 's no doubt about that . " <p> Moving products into a more modern playing field is one thing , but with competition in the toy market so fierce , especially in the lead up to Christmas , a watertight approach to selling this is also essential . <p> " When we went into administration , we had no online presence . We sent out a catalogue , we did a lot of offline marketing , " the chief executive continued . <p> " We almost carpet bombed the country . We sent out millions of these things , the costs were quite large , the risks were quite large because it was dependent on people reading these things . People habits have moved on from picking Christmas presents out from a catalogue . <p> " We dispensed with all of that , we built a new online platform and we moved to pure online retail . We then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became omnichannel . <p> " The one thing that does n't work online is low priced retail products . If a product sells for less than ? 5 it is very hard for a retailer to make that work online . By doing what we were doing with raising the price range of our products , this transcends quite nicely to online products . <p> " Online is like having one really good shop , it 's about 10 per cent of the overall retail and growing . " <p> With plans for ambitious store expansion it is not just the retailer 's online presence that is growing . With a focus on drones , big branded toys and brand new VR offerings over this Christmas Hawkin 's Bazaar has successfully returned from the dead . <h> Inside Mosul :

 customers hundreds of pounds <h> Wednesday 23 November 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> Deliveroo customers have lost hundreds of pounds as their accounts with the instant delivery service were hacked , BBC One 's Watchdog will reveal tonight . <p> Deliveroo has changed the face of online retail and and is largely responbile for the emergence of what many call the " go economy " , but a growing number of customers have reportedly become a victim of fraud . <p> One pair of house mates from Southampton University lost ? 440 when hackers broke into their shared account and ordered masses of food to addresses all over London , some as far as 120 miles away from their home address . <p> The company failed to recognise the activity as fraudulent and Mary and Michael had to deactivate their bank cards in order to stop further orders being made . <p> " At 2:30am one morning we got a stream of emails saying that we had made various Deliveroo orders , " Mary told Watchdog . <p> " It 's been awful , they took nearly everything and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow flatmates , friends and parents as well . " <p> They were subsequently reimbursed by the company 10 days after it was illegally taken . <p> Watchdog will also reveal other examples of customer 's details being hijacked and fraudulent orders being made . <p> Judith MacFadyen from Reading had ? 240 worth of food ordered from her account before cancelling her card , Steve Tappin was charged ? 98 for a delivery from a TGI Friday and Margaret Warner was reportedly charged ? 113.70 for food she never ordered . <p> Deliveroo refunded all those mentioned . <p> Speaking to Watchdog , internet security expert David McClelland said : " When we buy things online the more hoops we have to jump through to complete that purchase the more likely we are to go away and do something else instead . <p> " Deliveroo realises that so tries to remove as many of the hoops as possible . However some of the hoops that Deliveroo are removing are there specifically for security purposes . So while it may be making it easier for us to place orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defrauded .

In response to the accusation that Deliveroo was not doing enough to protect customer details , a spokesperson from the company said : " We are aware of these cases raised by Watchdog - they involve stolen food , not credit card numbers . <p> " These issues occur when criminals use a password stolen from another service unrelated to our company in a major data breach . <p> " The stolen password is then used to fraudulently access someone 's account .

 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> BHS 's monumental pensions deficit has become an impassioned topic not only in the press , but in government and more importantly in the boardrooms of the UK 's biggest retailers . <p> Around 22,000 ex-BHS staff members have had their pensions jeopardised by the downfall of the retail giant . The deficit , with currency fluctuations taken into account , now stands at over ? 700 million and looks just as far away from being settled as it was when it was first revealed earlier this year . <p> However , the issue runs far deeper than former BHS owners Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell and the 22,000 pensions of their former staff . <p> Tesco has reported a ? 5 billion deficit , having doubled in the last year , affecting 350,000 pensions . John Lewis 's deficit now stands at ? 1.5 billion , having risen by ? 512 million in the last six months . <p> Debenhams ' deficit is predicted to have ballooned to ? 2.9 million , while Sainsbury 's is estimated to be nudging the billion-pound mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hole , seemingly destroying the pension schemes of many major retailers in the country ? <p> " Overall , there are two causes to the problem , " University of Warwick professor Michael Moore explained . <p> " One , up to relatively recently , life expectancy , conditional on reaching age 65 , had essentially not changed at all . All pension fund calculations were based on this . <p> " Now , primarily because of the dramatic fall in cardiovascular disease , life expectancy for 65 year-olds is increasing at the rate of three months every year . Pension funds are finding this difficult to manage . <p> " Secondly , contributions for those retiring now were initially made when interest rates were much higher . Finding low-risk investments that provide an adequate yield is proving almost impossible for pension funds . " <p> Sparked by Brexit , interest rates on investments are at a record low . Companies with a defined salary pension scheme accumulate a pot in order to pay retired employees . These pots are then invested so they can grow over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as gilts . <p> Gilts are usually a low-risk option , as there is little chance the government will default on its debt losing the gilts value . But amid the uncertainty of Brexit , gilts have become popular among investors hoping to bag the safest option . <p> As they become more popular , they become more expensive to buy , therefore they pay less interest . Thus , returns pension funds are at a record low . <p> Retailers now face the challenge of reinvesting in their pension schemes , keeping promises made to their staff . It is possible these deficits could be easily tackled by investment when conditions are less turbulent , but right now they have a mountain to climb . <p> Peter , head of shopper at Initials stated : " Retail is n't alone in failing those at its front line ; according to the International Monetary Fund , trillions of pounds in savings are failing to meet even the basic needs of workers as they near retirement . <p> " Yet in retail , reversing , stemming or even making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city focuses corporate minds on delivering immediate dividends rather than long-term strategies . The result ? Less investment in range , environment and the shopping experience . " <p> " Clearly , making good pension promises is complex and encompasses many factors -- rent , salary bills , dividends , to name just a few . <p> " But if you take BHS , its troubles began when it lost the hearts and minds of younger consumers because of an environment that was tired and unappealing , and a stock range that was muddled . The rest including the pension tragedy is history . <p> " Surely then , the lesson for retail is clear : go back to the building blocks to create a firmer foundation : as well as providing your target demographic with the range it wants .

 winners and losers of the new business rates ? <h> Thursday 01 December 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> Next year 's business rates revision has been a key concern among UK companies for the last few months , with the large majority of businesses concerned the changes could be crippling . <p> The lethal cocktail of looming inflation , higher wages and business rates has sparked a frenzy of fierce opposition against the rate increases . <p> Research has suggested that the new rates , coming into force in April 2017 , could cost retailers around ? 2.3 billion . The New West End company , which represents London 's busiest shopping destinations have called the new rates " catastrophic " rising by 80 per cent . <p> Philp Hammond 's first Autumn Statement did little to quell retailer 's anxieties , with the most significant " good news " stating that increases will be capped at 43 per cent , instead of 45 per cent . <p> Not everyone stands to do badly from the rates however . Figures suggest the Big 4 could save ? 173 million on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant boost due to exemption from the rate increases . <p> The rates are based on the value of the property the retailer trades from . Controversially the government pushed back the commercial property revaluation by two years , deviating from the usual five-year recurrence . They stated that it would create uncertainty among businesses , this will make the changes even more harshly felt when they come into effect . <p> " With a gap of seven years since the last valuation there is likely to have been some significant changes in property values so simplistically speaking , in areas where property prices have fallen , rates will be lower but in areas where property values have soared , the increase in rates bills are likely to be dramatic , " head of retail at accountancy firm Menzies Roberto Lobue said . <p> London is set to be the worst hit . The West End , which contributes more to the GDP than Wales , is predicted to cause a 25 per cent reduction in profits for retailers in the area . <p> " Areas where significant regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings Cross for example , will feel the squeeze from a hike in Business Rates , " Lobue continued . <p> " Unfortunately , SMEs and start-ups in prosperous areas are likely to be worst hit . Large multinational firms are better resourced to handle cost increases and often have nationwide coverage so their rates increases in London for example , will be offset by their savings elsewhere in the country . <p> " We 're waiting for transitional relief rules to be finalised so the impact may be spread but firms who do n't qualify for this have big decisions to make . " <p> Retailers must prepare for a drastic change in their financial situation , exaggerated by increasing wages and inability to accurately predict the future . <p> " First and foremost , retailers must check that their new rates bill is correct . There is a process to appeal if business owners believe the property value has been set too high , " added Lobue . <p> " Secondly , consider your long-term strategy . Are they based in the right locations ? Should they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there any other costs that can be cut in order to absorb a higher rates bill ? " <p> Partner and head of international retail at Osborne Clarke Dolf Darnton supports Lobue 's advice , adding that what are profitable stores for retailers now may not be in the future . <p> He stated : " Review the balance of the store portfolio in light of the changes . Warehouses supporting , say , an online offer are likely to be less impacted by the changes than prime retail space in a thriving location so sweat the prime space or be bold enough to dispose . <p> " Review store performance in light of the change in rates overheads . Stores which were making a positive contribution may not be after the changes and stores which were loss making may even start to make a profit . Do they need more investment ?

 Ocado set to reveal impact of pound and price war pressures <h> Monday 05 December 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> Sports Direct and Ocado will announce trading updates this week as the devalued sterling and continuing price war starts to take its toll on retailers . <p> Despite deflation remaining flat for November , Sports Direct will reveal the true impact of the fall in the pound in its half-year results , with City forecasts remaining bleak for the retailer . <p> Mike Ashley 's sportswear chain failed to hedge against the pound in the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote , and announced that " extreme movements " in the pound would result in lower full-year profits months later . <p> Full year earnings were predicted to be ? 15 million lower than previous expectations . <p> Numis analyst Andrew Wade explained there was little chance of recovery for the retailer : <p> " Wary of the extent to which Sports Direct is being required to change commercially as the major brands demand a better showcase , and notwithstanding some potential gross margin upside in full year 2018 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we see limited scope for a material profit recovery in the next few years and retain our neutral stance , " he said . <p> The financial predictions come amid numerous public scandals involving the retailer and its billionaire owner Mike Ashley , with the company now under investigtion from the Financial Reporting Council . <p> Meanwhile , online grocer Ocado is set to release its fourth quarter results later this week . <p> Although the City is predicting " similar trends to play out " following a strong third quarter , the online retailer is showing pangs from the ongoing price war . <p> In September it revealed its basket size was dropping by 3.4 per cent and there has been speculation from the City that both the price war amid the Big 4 and the introduction of Amazon Fresh could overwhelm Ocado . <p> Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said : " As the market remains very competitive , we are seeing sustained and continuing margin pressure and there is nothing to suggest that this will change in the short term .

 Cas Paton , CEO , <h> Wednesday 07 December 2016 - Ben Stevens <p> Amazon appears to be an almost unstoppable behemoth , releasing a new revolutionary retail concept almost weekly . From the Amazon Dash to this week 's announcement of a grocery store with no payment tills , it seems like an exercise in futility to take them on . <p> Yet , in true British style , one company has a plan to challenge the retailer with little more than a smart idea . <p> chief executive Cas Paton is the David to Amazon 's Goliath , pioneering the UK 's first subscription-based marketplace . <p> Instead of charging sellers a commission on goods they sell , the model which has gleaned such success for the likes of Amazon and eBay , charge a monthly subscription of around ? 50 , allowing sellers to advertise as much as they want for as much as they want . <p> " By not charging commission it means sellers can actually offer a lower price than they would normally offer . They could drop their price by 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Amazon . That is a brilliant way for us to launch . " <h> " I think the British populous are keen to find an ethical marketplace they can buy from . " <p> Despite the website already being live , with huge marketing campaigns planned for early next year , started with a very different concept . <p> " We started the business in 2012 . We soft launched in 2013 , originally working with a large investor . There were three partners , I was one , " Paton reflects . <p> " I had a different idea about the business , so I ended up undertaking a management buyout in 2014 . I bought it from them so I could build it and launch it in the way I thought was best for Onbuy . <p> " Originally the opinion was to follow in the footsteps of Amazon in the sense it was commission based . My feeling was that to take on a retail giant such as Amazon head to head , even at a few per cent cheaper , I think is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Amazon charge around 15 per cent , the partners I was working with were proposing 12 which does n't equate to a significant enough to discount to warrant users using a new marketplace they know nothing about . <p> " The one thing we did n't really have was a clear USP . " <p> 's USP is key , as Paton says " customers are very difficult to convince to use any new outlet " and it would take something great to draw people away from what they 're already familiar with . <p> Aside from its ground-breaking subscription model , has many essential traits that should succeed in convincing people to make the jump . <p> One is familiarity . The platform will adopt all the features that make their favourite marketplaces so easy to use like in-depth categories and the ability to save card details and multiple addresses . <h> " Sellers of sick are selling on marketplaces that compete with them . " <p> Another key selling point is its promise to never act as competition to their users . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Paton says . <p> " What has happened over the last few years , and is accelerating , is that Amazon retail has learned or seen which products sell really well ( on Amazon Marketplace ) they then source that product and sell it directly . <p> " They do n't have to pay the sellers fees . They will then take the advert from you , even if you are cheaper you will not be displayed on that page . <p> " Sellers are becoming frustrated with this , we speak to a lot of sellers who have lost a lot of business through this . They will take the risk in finding and sourcing products , three years down the line Amazon are selling the same product and they are losing entire slices of market share . <p> " Many sellers have had to lay people off , over night when this happens their orders are reduced by 90 per cent in some cases . <p> " will never be a retailer . Sellers are free to list in confidence that one day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> ? As seen with the growing success of Black Friday in the UK , American companies are quickly colonising our retail space . continues to differentiate itself form its rivals by championing British retailers . <p> " We 're targeting the British consumer and British business . We do enable overseas sellers on our marketplace , who wish to target the British market , " Paton explains . <p> " The idea is they have to meet the same standards when it comes to dispatch and delivery times . If they do n't meet the strict criteria they should n't sell with us . We are obviously trying to favour British companies . <p> " We 're working very closely with UK Trade to educate small business how to sell overseas . To have a British partner helps the economy overall . <p> " It is based on the frustration that people are paying for goods from vendors that are in this country , and quite a significant proportion of those sales are going to companies who are not based here , and are n't taxed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . I think the British populous are keen to find an ethical marketplace they can buy from .

 <h> New figures show " slowest growth of the festive period since 2009 " <h> Tuesday 07 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> The new year has started with an abrupt end to growth in the retail sector , as January sales fall sharply from the Christmas rushes . <p> New results from the BRC KPMG Retail Sales Monitor have revealed that like-for-like sales in January fell by 0.6 per cent , compared to a 2.6 per cent growth in the same period a year before . <p> Total sales rose by 0.1 per cent in the same period , compared to a 3.3 per cent increase in January 2016 , well below both the three-month average of 1.1 per cent and yearly average of 0.9 per cent . <p> " While this may appear disappointing overall , retailers were up against a strong January last year to try and deliver a repeat performance and many reported an increase in the number of returns received in January , " British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) chief executive Helen Dickinson said . <p> " Looking across the last three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period since 2009 . <p> " Closer inspection reveals that this was driven by slowing sales in non-food sectors . " <p> " Two-thirds ( 65 per cent ) believe food prices will have the biggest impact on their personal finances this year , ahead of energy bills ( 58 per cent ) , petrol prices ( 53 per cent ) and interest rates ( 28 per cent ) . <p> " Some recent cost increases for producers have begun to take effect but with currencies in such a state of flux , the picture for later in the year is very hard to predict . " <p> On a three-month basis , non-food sales to January rose by 8.6 per cent year-on-year , compared with total sales of 0.3 per cent . <p> " Online channels achieved the highest share of total non-food retail spend on record in the three months to January , despite the eight per cent growth being somewhat below the trend of late , " Dickinson said . <p> " As with total sales , online sales in January were set against a strong comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . " <p> One pound in every ? 4 spent on non-food items in the three months to January was spent online , alongside a 22.9 per cent share of total non-food sales throughout January , up from 21.6 per cent a year earlier . <p> Online sales accounted for the highest ever level of year-on-year non-food growth , at 2.9 per cent in the three months to January . Conversely instore sales made a negative 2.6 per cent contribution in the same period , the lowest on record . 
 <h> Over half of SMEs expect price hikes in the next 12 months <h> Tuesday 07 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> The fall of the pound has led to more than half of SMEs in the UK anticipating price hikes in the coming year . <p> According to new data from the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) , 54 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses ( SMEs ) which includes many retailers -- plan price hikes , while 44 per cent have reported that the weak pound is expected to damage their domestic sales margins . <p> Export margins produced a more diverse outlook , with 25 per cent expecting export margins to benefit from currency fluctuations , and 22 per cent anticipating it will impact them negatively . <p> Forty-five per cent of businesses state they do not currently manage currency risk , but 46 per cent said they expected to in the next six months . 
 <h> 8 out of 9 top grocers show growth as Aldi overtakes Co-op <h> Tuesday 07 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> German discount grocer Aldi has lived up to predictions it would overtake Co-op to become the fifth largest supermarket in the UK . <p> New results from Kantar Worldpanel indicate that Aldi 's sales grew by 12.4 per cent in the 12 weeks to January 29 , boosting its market share to 6.2 per cent <p> " Just a decade ago Aldi was the UK 's 10th largest food retailer , accounting for less than two per cent of the grocery market , " Kantar Worldpanel 's head of retail insight Fraser McKevitt said . <p> " Since then the grocer has grown rapidly , climbing the rankings by an impressive five places to hold a 6.2 per cent market share . <p> " Underpinned by an extensive programme of store openings , the past quarter has seen Aldi attract 826,000 more shoppers than during the same period last year . " <p> Although it lost its place to the discounter , Co-op posted a two per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a seven per cent rise in its own label sales . <p> Among the Big 4 grocers , the best performer was Morrisons which saw a 1.9 per cent growth in sales and an increase in market share for the first time since 2015 . <p> Amid a surprise merger with supply chain giant Booker , Tesco posted continued sales growth of 0.3 per cent . This was slower than its previous rate , and its market share has been ebbed away 0.4 per cent compared to last year . <p> Market share was also chipped away at Sainsbury 's by 0.3 per cent , while sales remained flat . <p> " Eleven million households buy courgettes annually , but supply issues contributed to 759,000 fewer shoppers buying them this January that 's a 31 per cent drop in spending compared with the same month last year , " McKevitt said . <p> " Meanwhile rising prices , which we saw at Christmas for the first time since 2014 , have continued into the new year , with like-for-like inflation on a basket of everyday groceries climbing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise at the same rate for the rest of 2017 , shoppers will find themselves around ? 27 worse off . " <p> Data from Nielsen shows that in the four weeks to January 28 , the volume of groceries sold fell by 2.7 per cent . <p> Nielsen 's UK head of retailer insight Mike Watkins said : " Partly due to the timing of New Year negatively affecting comparative sales , the figures do n't really reflect how the industry started the year . <p> " A better indicator is the last three weeks , during which till takings were up 0.3 per cent . <p> " We anticipate the industry to grow around 2% this year , an improvement on 2016 , primarily due to the return of cost price inflation after three years of deflation and the depreciation of sterling , yet grocery spend remaining robust despite price rises . <p> " The discounters will continue to grow faster than this due to the acceleration of new store openings which could push their market share to 13% for the first ever time .

 <h> DFS reports solid sales amid warnings of market slowdown <h> Thursday 09 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> DFS has posted strong figures in the first half of the year , but warns of an " increased risk " of a market slowdown . <p> In its 26 week period to January 28 , gross sales rose by seven per cent , boosted by its Dwell and Sofa Workshop subsidiaries . <p> " We recognise that in 2017 the retailing of furniture in the UK faces an increased risk of a market slowdown given the uncertain outlook for consumer confidence , " a spokesperson said . <p> " However , with its resilient operating model we believe the group remains very well positioned to respond to economic headwinds and cost pressures whilst achieving continued growth in its share of the UK retail furniture market . " <p> The sofa retailer is reportedly working on securing better deals with suppliers in order to offset the increasing costs due to currency fluctuations , assuring that its full year expectations remain firmly on track . <p> " We continue our work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the differentiated DFS sourcing model of vertical integration , UK manufacturing capability and superior scale remains an important competitive advantage , " it added . <p> These results come as the retailer searches for a new chairman , following news late last year that Richard Baker will replace Charlie Mayfield as chairman at the British Retail Consortium .

 <h> Prada 's UK market bucks trend of struggling global sales <h> Tuesday 14 February 2017 - Elias Jahshan <p> Luxury goods retailer Prada experienced a dip in sales across all of its regions last year , with fewer tourists visiting its global flagship stores dragging growth . <p> However , the Italian brand which trades in the UK with a few flagship stores and concessions said sales had improved in the last months of 2016 , hinting at a return to growth for the struggling luxury sector . <p> In the UK , the post-Brexit fall in the sterling enabled Prada to reverse the decline of the first six months to end the year with strong growth . <p> For its financial year ending January 31 , the Milan-based company recorded a nine per cent drop in revenues from ? ? 3.5 billion ( ? 3 billion ) to ? ? 3.1 billion ( ? 2.6 billion ) . <p> Prada 's sales fell across all regions with the biggest coming from Japan , where it plummeted by 13 per cent after five years of growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fell by 12 per cent and five per cent respectively , thanks to a reduction in tourists . <p> Like the UK , France and Russia also performed well in the European market , with the latter recording double-digit growth . <p> " We implemented a profound phase of business process rationalisation still under way -- and identified important strategies to secure the group 's future growth , " Prada chief executive Patrizio Bertelli said . <p> " This included revising our digital strategy with the creation of a highly skilled team with professional experience from the digital technology and new media industries . <p> " In the meantime , we are strengthening the retail management structure with the aim of integrating online channels with traditional channels in a truly innovative dimension .

 <h> " Queen of Shops " Mary Portas warns new business rates could kill off swathes of indie retailers <h> Friday 17 February 2017 - Elias Jahshan <p> The Queen of Shops has weighed in on the debate surrounding the impending business rates reforms with a warning to the government that it could potentially kill off a third of independent retailers . <p> Mary Portas , a TV personality and retail expert once hired by former Prime Minister David Cameron to find a way to save the UK 's high streets , labelled the rates hike as " madness " and called on Prime Minister Theresa May to bin the whole system . <p> Meanhwile , Communities Secretary Sajid Javid accused " unscrupulous " companies of trying to scare business owners into thinking their taxes would soar in order to make a profit . <p> Writing in The Telegraph , Portas said the revaluation scheme would be the worst blow to shops since the financial crisis of 2008 , as they were at risk of being " destroyed " from bill increases of up to 245 per cent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors who have publicly criticised the business rates plans , which comes into force in April . <p> " I am calling on Sajid Javid , ( Business Secretary ) Greg Clark , and Theresa May to stop this madness before it destroys everything we 've been fighting for , " she wrote . <p> Despite this , Javid accused " scaremongering " rating agents of manufacturing reports about business rates rising while " cynically " promising to help firms win an appeal against any increase " in exchange for a hefty fee " . <p> While he admitted the rates reforms were not " perfect , Javid insisted that thousands of independent shops , small pubs and rural businesses will see their bills slashed while a third of businesses will pay no rates at all . <p> Ministers are also facing a backlash after official figures indicated that the Treasury could generate an extra ? 1 billion after the business rates revaluation . <p> However , the government said that extra revenue would be the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than existing business ratepayers being forced to fork up extra money . <p> Javid also insisted that the revaluation did not amount to a " stealth tax " , saying the Treasury " wo n't make one penny more " from the business rates changes . <p> In a Telegraph article , Javid said : " Although there will inevitably be winners and losers in a cash-neutral revaluation , we 're taking action so the vast majority of businesses do not end up worse off , and to mitigate the impact on those who see their bills rising . <p> " I grew up above the family shop , and I know for myself that running a business is stressful enough without the government adding to your worries . <p> " But the only people who should be concerned about April 's changes are the scaremongering ratings agents , who are about to see much of their target audience celebrating a fall in their tax bill . " 
 <p> The idea first for SilkFred first came to Watkinson in 2011 , when she identified a gap in the retail sector and wanted to offer emerging fashion designers or established non-high street labels a place to have their work recognised and available to the wider market . <p> " One of the ways in which started is similar to how a lot of businesses start : you recognise that there 's a problem that needs solving , and then you create something around that , " Watkinson told the Retail Gazette . <p> The realisation of this gap in the retail sector came when a friend of hers had invested in a small independent designer . Things were not going so well , so the friend asked Watkinson and her co-founder to analyse the business , given her background in buying and merchandising and her co-founder 's background in financial trading . <p> " What this brand really needed was the expertise and a route to market and some budget , " Watkinson , pictured above , recalled . <p> " We decided the best way to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all to market . <p> " The penny dropped and we realised we were on to something when hundreds of new brands were asking me every day to give them an opportunity . " <p> Launched in early 2012 , and enjoying a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2013 , Watkinson said SilkFred has grown by 400 per cent and now welcomes 800,000 online visitors per month . <p> She added that the name of her retail business was a play on the phrase " silk thread " . The site was also intended to have some sort social network feature about it . <p> " Really what we 're trying to get at is a like-minded community that were connected by a thread , " she said . <p> " The actual initial concept of SilkFred was that it was marketplace that had this whole social network feature wrapped around it where people can see what everyone else was buying , but this was in 2011 when everyone was trying to create their own social network . <p> " We did n't know so much about that so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying clothes . <p> " And the name SilkFred kind of just had its own personality , we liked it , it 's quirky . " <p> " Independent retailers are so much more agile , they can react to industry changes a lot more quickly than bigger brands , and it 's more interesting for the customers . " <p> Watkinson has always had a keen interest in fashion . While studying English at the University of Liverpool she grew her knowledge of retail through experience on the shop-floor . After she graduated , she moved to Spain to work in buying , merchandising and management at a boutique luxury retail chain , overseeing a team of 20 sales staff at the age of 24 . <p> " I just had all this responsibility chucked at me , I was a real multi-tasker , " Watkinson said . <p> After a few years in Spain , she left for New York for editorial experience interning at fashion magazines . It was during her time there that her desire to return to retail became apparent . <p> A move back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working with the buying and merchandising teams . Here she developed skills in identifying product trends , and it was also here that she noticed smaller independent brands had no clear route to market . <p> After seven months at , she made the difficult decision to leave to establish SilkFred . <p> " did n't succeed in the end but it was really interesting and I learned a lot there . <p> " One of the reasons that impacted my decision to leave was that I always liked touching different area of the business .... I find that element of how it all fits together and how it all works together the most interesting part of any company , kind of doing a little bit of everything , which I missed . " <p> Watkinson believes SilkFred has helped revolutionised the digital retail landscape and is one of the UK 's leading destinations for independent fashion and accessory brands . <p> She said much of SilkFred 's success is owed shoppers who visit the etailer to " feel a little bit different in their every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear this brand , and we stand for this and this is our customer and she wears X ' , and then they kind of have to stick the stake in the sand and say ' this is what we are ' , " Watkinson said . <p> " But our customers can do whatever they want at any given time , there 's so much choice and so many different styles . <p> " Whether it 's something interesting to wear to work or something fun to wear for a girls ' weekend to Ibiza or a party dress to go out with the girls , or something really cute for that hot date or even if it 's just going to the pub they can buy something that you wo n't necessarily find anywhere else . " <p> While SilkFred has been featured in countless media outlets and gained a handful of business awards nominations , Watkinson said her business ' power to help over 290 fashion designers succeed has been the most rewarding part . <p> " We 're reaching a lot more people and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't really have to explain what SilkFred is as much as I used to , " she said . <p> " We 've taken brands from zero to millions , to see their team grow and develop alongside our own .

 <h> Majestic Wine wins " High Street Chain of the Year " <h> Monday 20 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> Alcohol retail chain Majestic Wine has been awarded " High Street Chain of the Year " at this year 's International Wine Challenge Merchant Awards . <p> The awards , considered one of the most prestigious in the industry , celebrate the country 's most successful wine businesses based on a proven business model while delivering world-leading services and wines . <p> " Winning the IWC High Street Chain of the Year award is an incredible achievement and is especially important as it reflects all the work that has been done this year as part of our transformation plan , " Majestic Wine 's managing director John Colley said . <p> " We are making brilliant steps in becoming a customer focused business with the best people in the trade and I 'd like to not only thank the IWC for recognising how far we have come in this short period of time but also all our people at Majestic for their efforts in putting the customer back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes after a successful turnaround operation , seeing Majestic Wine transform its fortunes . <p> Following reports of a ? 4.4 million loss in its half year results last year , the retailer went on to post like-for-like sales growth of 7.5 per cent in the 10 weeks to January 2 , its best Christmas performance to date . <p> It has now embarked on a three-year turnaround plan and is reportedly on track to meet its full year 's expectations . 
 <h> Just 3% of retailers profit from omnichannel fulfilment <h> Thursday 23 February 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> New research has revealed that despite continual and significant investment , only three per cent of retailers in the UK have been able to make a profit while fulfilling omnichannel demand . <p> In a survey conducted by JDA and PwC , only 10 per cent of global retailers questioned said they were able to achieve both profits and omnichannel fulfilment . <p> Furthermore only 12 per cent of chief executives say they are able to provide a seamless shopping experience across all channels , with many finding omnichannel too expensive and complex opting to scale back . <p> Despite this , retailers are continuing to invest heavily in new technologies . <p> Eighty-five per cent of retailers surveyed in the report state that mobile engineered applications , big data and social media are their key focuses for investment . <p> " The investment in digital technologies was a major undercurrent within this year 's survey results , " JDA 's Lee Gill said . <p> " This is no surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in the technology that will improve the customer experience , particularly in store . <p> " The report findings also reveal the continued balancing act retailers are struggling to maintain with ensuring omni-channel excellence and profitability all while meeting the demands of the modern shopper and keeping pace with the digital transformation underway across the supply chain . " 
 <p> The table shows that the top five supermarkets have all improved in the last year with Waitrose , Aldi and Lidl all boasting two thirds of their fish ranges as MSC-approved . <p> " Most of us do n't have the time to read up on sustainable sourcing and we should n't have to , " MSC programme director Toby Middleton said . <p> " The MSC label means the ' science bit ' has been done for you . Sainsbury 's , Waitrose , Tesco , Lidl and Aldi are offering their customers clear labelling and the chance to make a difference , helping to protect fish stocks . <p> " In contrast , at the bottom of the league there simply is n't the independent information you need to help you choose , and those shoppers are missing out . <p> " This growth in labelling is great news for the majority of British shoppers . Two-thirds of British supermarkets are making a real investment in the future of their seafood . <p> " If you 're buying MSC-labelled fish or seafood in one of these top-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world 's oceans .

 <p> Amid the scandal which saw Sports Direct and Transline succumb to a parliamentary enquiry over the treatment of workers , Iain Wright MP wrote to Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley calling for him to drop the company . <p> He stated : " We ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline , a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis . " <p> It is understood still supplies workers for the sportswear retailer , along with other high street staples like Argos and online retailer Asos. 
 <h> Sports Direct accuses shareholder lobby group of " fake news " <h> Wednesday 15 March 2017 - Elias Jahshan <p> An influential shareholder lobby group has been accused by Sports Direct of " fake news " over claims about its executive pay ratios . <p> The retailer said a report by Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants ( PIRC ) " incorrectly claims that Sports Direct had a chief employee pay ratio of 400:1 , the second highest in the FTSE 350 " . <p> Sports Direct said the data sets used in the study were " incorrect " and based on a bonus entitlement that was accrued by former chief executive Dave Forsey , but was never paid out . <p> " This is fake news that appears to have been either deliberately or recklessly circulated by an irresponsible organisation that is making headlines at the expense of Sports Direct , " a spokesman for Sports Direct said . <p> " We have contacted PIRC to request a copy of the report and we will be writing to them to express our disappointment . <p> " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chief employee pay . " <p> Sports Direct said the true ratio from 2012 to 2015 , had it paid out , would have been " closer to 9:1 " . <p> The news comes as Sports Direct founder , chief executive and majority owner Mike Ashley this week upped the position his company has in Debenhams to above 11 per cent . <p> He also recently snapped up an 11 per cent stake in struggling fashion retailer French Connection and an agency that Sports Direct has a 25 per stake in , Four Holdings , recently acquired lingerie retailer Agent Provocateur . <p> Last week the tycoon said Sports Direct will appoint an employees ' representative who will attend board meetings following the uproar over working conditions the retailer faced last year . 
 <h> Aldi &amp; Lidl in hot water over treatment of drivers <h> Wednesday 15 March 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> Discount grocers Aldi and Lidl have come under fire following a BBC investigation revealing their delivery drivers are forced to do the work of warehouse staff . <p> In order to maintain low prices , lorry drivers for the grocers are told to unload their own deliveries , prompting criticism from both drivers and the union that neither their pay or training are sufficient . <p> " It was obvious to me the only reason you were doing it was for the benefit of whichever discount supermarket it was that you were visiting , " lorry driver David told BBC Radio 4 's You and Yours programme . <p> " And you forego quality control by letting any Tom , Dick or Harry in your warehouse to unload their vehicle . " 
 <h> Grocery vs Fashion : Why is fashion being left in grocery 's dust ? <h> Thursday 16 March 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> This week Blue Inc , Jones Bootmaker and Brantano were added to the increasing list of fashion retailers flirting with administration , and could well end up among deceased UK high street chains American Apparel and Banana Republic . <p> That the fashion sector is struggling will not be news to anyone , but what is curious is that amid what is being dubbed a " perfect storm " for retailers , the grocery sector as a whole is performing well . <p> Earlier this month Kantar Worldpanel revealed that supermarket sales have grown at their fastest rate since 2014 . <p> Combined sales of the leading four UK supermarkets , which account for 70 per cent of grocery sales , grew by 0.5 per cent year-on-year in the 12 months to February 26 . <p> These figures are in sharp contrast to those within the fashion sector , dispelling any umbrella predictions of the current climate in the UK . <p> How can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors are so heavily contrasting in their performance ? <p> " One possible reason for the disparity in performance between food and fashion retailing comes down to the nature of the product , " Manchester Metropolitan University Professor Gary Warnaby said . <p> " Food is an essential expenditure and fashion is a discretionary purchase ; whilst one can postpone the purchase of a new top almost indefinitely subject to the size of one 's wardrobe , one has to eat . " <p> When the nation 's purses feel a little light , it is easy to understand that spending on non-essential items will drop . But it 's possible that instead of cutting out personal treats altogether , there has simply been a shift from big fashion purchases , to smaller luxury food purchases . <p> " In a world where we 're not due for a real pay rises for the next fifteen years , it 's clear that purchases from high end sectors including fashion are becoming harder to justify , " she said . <p> " Instead , consumers are opting to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a gourmet chocolate bar , which are within everyone 's reach . <p> " Helping to put food on the luxury list is the rise of Instagram lifestyle stars . Whether that 's Joe Wickes , Ella Woodward or the Hemsley Sisters , people now regard their grocery shop as an extension of their lifestyle . <p> " Your choice of breakfast , organic ingredients or clean eating cook books are as much of a status indicator , than any brand of designer bag or high street jacket . " <p> It is clear that economic factors are not solely responsible for the shift in spending . Cultural shifts have made food into a fashion statement , and one more affordable than fashion itself . <p> This is not the only sociological shift that could be having an effect on people 's spending habits . <p> Keith White from menswear retailer Dobell believes the decline of the big night out since the last recession has been significant in the shift away from fashion spend . <p> " We 've seen the night time economy really struggle since the recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading out on Friday and Saturday nights , there is less demand for fast-fashion items for that big night out , " he said . <p> " Retailers , of high street and ecommerce fashion have taken a hit in relation to this , especially with the idea of Brexit , and a possible further recession/economic dip . " <p> As White mentions , Brexit is going to be a key factor for all sectors in the retail world . Sainsbury 's Mike Coupe told an audience last week that it could in fact be good for supermarkets . <p> Ocado also recently stated that rising inflation meant the end to the ongoing price war , and may have actually helped growth in the grocery sector in the last few months . <p> believes inherent factors in both sectors mean that inflationary changes could work differently for both . <p> " Linked to Brexit , another factor is commodity prices , often traded in dollars , so the devaluation of the pound will have inflationary effects , " he said . <p> " One could argue that ' macro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all retailers equally . <p> " The question is how retailers deal with this , especially in terms of being able to pass on increased costs to customers and maintain margins ? <p> " However , fashion retailers are perhaps less able to do this , in that customers can always buy elsewhere , and moreover , the dangers of the race to the bottom in terms of production costs are well-known . <p> " Many food items are arguably less price sensitive , and there is more scope for growing commodities in the UK to minimise this effect ( which ca n't be done with cotton ) . <p> " Also growing in the UK , means that the supermarkets can leverage their power over supplier more effectively in order to maintain margins . " 
 <h> The rise of modest wear : Are retailers making a stand against discrimination ? <h> Friday 17 March 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> In politically charged times , seemingly innocuous items can take on extraordinary levels of significance . <p> In recent months , modest wear has begun to make its way into mainstream fashion , throwing petrol on an already lively debate . <p> Earlier this week , a European court passed a bill which allows employers to ban the wearing of the hijab . <p> It said in a statement : " An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political , philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination . " <p> However , prior to this ruling , which has been branded as both a step forward towards " social peace " or a " license to discriminate " , some of fashion 's biggest names have been making conscious efforts to introduce modest wear to their ranges . <p> Debenhams recently announced a partnership with modest wear brand Aab , planning to place its new collaborative ranges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps most significantly , due solely to the public backlash from the announcement , was Nike 's announcement of the Pro Hijab . <p> This move has solidified modest wear into mainstream fashion in the west , but it has been met with controversy especally on social media -- even though some of the Arab world 's most prominent female athletes publicly endorsed it . <p> " While the spending power of young Muslim women is enormous and constitutes a market that many are looking to tap into , I think this approach risks sounding exploitative , " said Raoul Shah , chief executive of commincations agency Exposure . <p> " And something as important as female empowerment should n't be translated purely into spending power and being ' good for business ' . <p> " It goes much deeper than that . It is also naive to view the issue simply through the lens of fashion this can risk reducing a truly important topic to something very ephemeral . " <p> Examples of the backlash include calls to boycott Nike , accusations that it the Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , or that it normalises the stereotype that all Muslim women have to wear the hijab when they do n't . <p> One of the Pro Hijab 's designers and testers , Emirati Olympic weightlifter Amna Al Haddad took to Instagram to respond to the backlash . <p> " From my perspective as a former athlete who competed in hijab , in the past , the big brands did n't see the need or market for it as it was not ' popular ' and it was unheard of to see women train , exercise and compete in hijab , " she wrote . <p> " It is a recent phenomenon where more women have expressed a need for it and more professional athletes have fought for rights to compete with a headscarf , and have an equal playing field .

 <h> The rise and rise of pop-up shops and what it means for retail <h> Thursday 20 April 2017 - Ben Stevens <p> Pop-up retail has taken the UK by storm over the last few years , with temporary shops now proving a staple in many of the country 's busiest retail spaces . <p> The UK 's pop-up industry is estimated to be worth ? 2.3 billion , accounting for around 0.76 per cent of total retail turnover , according to EE 's Britain 's Pop-Up Retail Economy report . <p> Furthermore , 44 per cent of customers say they have visited a pop-up shop in the last 12 months and the industry employs 26,200 people . <p> These figures could potentially increase dramatically , given the crippling hikes many retailers face under the new business rates revaluation and the increasing numbers of bricks-and-mortar retailers closing down and leaving behind vacant units . <p> Appear Here , a company at the forefront of the pop-up retail movement in London stated that there was ? 33 million in demand for pop-up spaces , with 3000 pop-up spaces in London alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Airbnb for retail " , allowing retail businesses to book a vacant space for short-term periods . <p> While based in London and focused on pop-up spaces all over the UK , it also has an office in Paris and it recently ventured into the US for the first time . <p> Appear Here 's chief marketing officer Elizabeth Layne said around three quarters of pop-up stores leased in the UK are by independent retailers or startup companies , given that they do n't yet have the means to consider a store in the prime retail locations where these pop-ups are situated . <p> " In terms of segments of customers that have grown , we 're seeing more and more ecommerce companies that want to test offline , " she said . <p> " More independent brands , or privately-owned start-ups tend to be the big majority in the UK . They have a bit more freedom , they take longer leases . They have a mix as to whether they 're using the space for selling or marketing , sometimes both . <p> " We 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether it 's launching in a new market or completely launching from scratch . <p> " Some brands that are now becoming fixtures in London actually launched with an Appear Here pop-up . They 've used us to test the market , test their idea , hone in on their product . " <p> Despite the obvious benefits available for independent brands , big name retailers are also jumping on the pop-up bandwagon . <p> In a recent interview , Manchester Metropolitan University business school Professor Gary Warnaby told the Retail Gazette that the retail landscape was perhaps contracting , and that " physical stores as a show room rather than a selling space might be a way forward " . <p> According to Layne , this is a trend that has been seen from established retailers using pop-up spaces . <p> " From a trend perspective , we have seen more bigger brands using retail space as media space , " she said . <p> " They 've seen that its more efficient in some ways than traditional media outlets like TV or at home . It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some interesting examples there could be Hunter Boots , which booked space with us in Piccadilly Circus station . <p> " They booked several units , they did n't sell merchandise there . Instead they used the space to create an installation which then drove traffic to their store not too far away . <p> " With the ability to book short term rent this is actually pretty affordable for them . And in in some cases it has a more efficient reach than traditional media . It 's the marketers from these companies booking the space , as opposed to the retail directors . <p> " I think brands are demanding flexibility , most of all digital brands . They want to still connect with their customer and they realise that still the majority of transactions originate in a store . Something like 80 per cent of Apple 's transactions happen in a store , " Layne continued . <p> " So it 's great for customer acquisition and it 's great for brand awareness but you get so many efficiencies being an online brand . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping up to build brand awareness , test the market reach their customers and continue the relationship online . <p> " Traditional retail is here to stay in the offline world , but I think brands are realising that they need to be a bit more innovative with consumes spending so much time online . They need to be a bit more about the experience than just about the product . " 
 <h> Former House of Fraser boss Nigel Oddy appointed CEO of The Range <h> Tuesday 25 April 2017 - Elias Jahshan <p> The former chief executive of House of Fraser who grabbed headlines in November for his sudden resignation has just been hired in the same role for homeware and garden retailer The Range . <p> Nigel Oddy had been chief executive of the department store chain for less than two years when he resigned right before the crucial Christmas trading period , amid speculation of an internal row with parent company Sanpower Group . <p> However , at House of Fraser 's recent five-year strategy presentation to the press , they denied there was any conflict with the Chinese firm and Oddy remained with the retailer until early spring . <p> According to Drapers , Oddy will begin his role as chief executive of The Range on May 1 . 
 <h> Friday 28 April 2017 - Elias Jahshan <p> A highly-regarded consumer confidence monitor has indicated that it is " surprisingly stable " in the UK , as the country embarks on a tumultuous period with the upcoming General Election and Brexit negotiations . <p> The GfK Consumer Confidence Index dropped one point to -7 in April , with no sign of any downturn as predicted once Article 50 was triggered . <p> " Although the Overall Index Score remains in negative territory and has dipped this month , we have not seen any evidence of the predicted post-trigger downturn , despite high levels of concern about the general economic situation of the country . <p> Fifty-nine per cent of retailers said sales volumes were up in April on a year ago , while 21 per cent said they were down , giving a balance of 38 per cent growth -- the highest figure since September 2015 's 49 per cent . <p> However , this is in stark contrast the Office for National Statistics , which last week reported that retail sales have recorded their biggest fall for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in the cost of living .

 <h> From shops to showrooms : The changing face of the UK 's shop floors <p> The retail space race that has been raging for the last three decades , is largely over . Property scarcity , soaring business rates and increasingly tight margins are forcing retailers to rethink how they are using their floor space . <p> Recently the Retail Gazette reported on the pop-up shop boom that is reportedly worth over ? 2.3 billion to the UK economy , where both independent and established retailers alike flock to fill these tiny spaces . <p> Furthermore , the BRC 's recent report " Beyond the Core " highlighted the prominence of retailers employing secondary revenue streams , many of which involve subletting their hard-earned retail floorspace to the competition . <p> According to professor Gary Warnaby at the Manchester Metropolitan University Business School : " It may well be that the physical outlet in the brave new multichannel world becomes more about the experience of the brand as opposed to selling more merchandise . <p> " Physical stores as a show room rather than a selling space might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prism Skylab 's senior vice president of retail Cliff Crosbie , this is a trend that " will only get bigger in the future " . <p> " Space polarisation is defining the new retail landscape with an increasing trend of retailers exiting sub-prime , secondary space and taking a smaller quantity of better quality space . <p> " We do not think that stores will become extinct , but rather that footprint growth has been excessive and the growth of online gives many retailers the opportunity to scale back their physical store presence , possibly retaining flagships stores in high-density areas for brand innovative product , and drive remaining volumes online . <p> Of course , this trend is not simply driven by the growing difficulties of procuring and maintaining bricks-and-mortar estates . The exponential growth of online retail and growing prominence of ecommerce revenue streams mean that often physical retail space is better used to drive traffic online , rather than providing point of sale retail space . <p> This model has proven to be lucrative for numerous retailers , as business analyst at Context Jonathan Wagstaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses for omnichannel showroom stores : allowing consumers to try products which currently need physical experiences , and selling traditional products whilst using the space to curate the online store . <p> " A great example of the latter is the US clothing etailer Bonobos , whose new model has helped to increase revenue by $60m in the last five years . <p> " High street stores do not carry stock with purchasing happening online , and the savings on inventory are reinvested in excellent customer service , whilst keeping prices competitive against pure e-tailers . " <p> This growing trend goes further than simply using space as a platform to drive online traffic . Smaller more experiential retail offerings serve to grow and solidify brand identity among consumers . <p> Managing director at retail property consultancy FSP Ken Gunn thinks these innovative small new stores must work alongside larger flagships to create a coherent offering . <p> " For brands such as Apple , Jack Wills , Muji and Oakley in Covent Garden , ( it ) is as about catching people in a different mind-set , perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " While these are not showrooms , it shows an appetite to reach different audiences in different ways . So the trend is for brands using in-store experience and lifestyle appeal to exploit their recognition amongst consumers , building on core products and creating new ranges around these . <p> " The growth of online retail has delivered major opportunities for physical retail " <p> " Ugg , Michael Kors and Superdry have done this well ; as part of the evolution of an integrated and comprehensive multi-channel offer which incorporates online , full price flagships , full price lifestyle stores and outlet portfolios . " <p> " As brands work harder to stay relevant , this means creating that immersive presence through stature , rather than product . <p> " The outcome ? Retailers are looking to dispose of less profitable stores and cover geographical gaps on-line , while brands are looking to create flagships as part of coherent multichannel strategies . <p> Despite online clearly influencing many retailers to trim excess space , Westfield 's chief marketing officer Myf Ryan has seen it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail has delivered major opportunities for physical retail , " he said . <p> " We are seeing increasing demands from retailers requesting larger spaces for flagship stores . Just in the last month , we have seen the opening of the largest Zara in the UK at Westfield London and the largest UK H&amp;M at Westfield Stratford City . <p> " Online has also introduced new retailers to bricks and mortar -- we have seen the likes of Missguided , Amazon Books and Rent the Runway all take space in our centres globally as they recognise the need for a physical store to grow their brand and sales . " <p> " We are also seeing the growth of new categories such as car brands taking space in our centres where now you can buy everything from a new Bentley in our luxury precinct , The Village at Westfield London through to Jaguar Land Rover at Westfield Stratford City . <p> " Car brands use the physical space not only as a showroom using the latest VR tech but they take space in our car parks for customers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times are changing and retailers must adapt or die . The benefit of these ' smaller showroom ' shops is that the retailer can have a greater customer facing presence without the inventory costs by having SHOW &amp; TRY stock so potential customers can TOUCH , TRY &amp; FEEL then buy online if they live in smaller towns . Retailers still can still offer selling stock in the larger towns only to give customers a day ( or part day ) out shopping . A massive reduction in waste/ markdowns by ensuring that the online stock is available without customers having to shop around so particularly useful to shoe and clothing retailers . No wasted cost or time in returning items ordered online once tried , touched and felt the product in a store . Fresh foods stores will still need the selling stock until customers really do trust their retailer to only pick the best and longest dated stock as the customer does . Apart from the savings in business rates it will release property in town centres for leisure and housing . If the retailer shares their space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience more enjoyable and better fitted to our more online and leisure based lifestyles not to mention the benefit to the environment . It 's about using our retail space cost effectively . A ' WIn Win ' opportunity for retailers to benefit from change .

" <p> The company also said it would take a ? 10 million to ? 40 million hit from changes to EU roaming legislation , which will see mobile phone retailers now miss out on the cut of additional charges levied by telecoms firms . <p> Nonetheless , Dixon Carphone 's said its UK like-for-like sales were up four per cent in the period , while total sales rose one per cent . <p> Meanwhile , overall sales were up six per cent . <p> In its annual report for the year to April 29 , the group reported a 10 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to ? 501 million , compared to ? 457 million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent as group like-for-likes jumped four per cent .

 <h> The rise of second-hand retail <p> " The fact that Next can make more profit than the average charity shop but without all their benefits , should shame charity shops and put their inefficiencies into context . " <p> Telling charity shops they should be ashamed of themselves is quite a statement , but Gina Miller has a point . Before she made headlines taking Brexit to court , Miller took on charity shops for being barely profitable . <p> Despite laying out the industry 's wealth of inefficiencies in a Telegraph interview , Miller did not elaborate on why they now number in the tens of thousands in the UK and continue to post sales growth . <p> In fact , the second-hand market accounts for around 14 per cent of London 's retail establishments , and sales volumes across the industry grew over five per cent last year . <p> Although the sector saw a boom during the last financial crisis , the industry has seen a steady 0.6 per cent growth since 2013 , according to Ibis World . <p> " Consumers have generally grown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of discount retailers has proven , the previous financial crash and the advent of internet retailing has produced a generation of " savvy shoppers " who relish the opportunity to grab a bargain . <p> " Our audience varies from first time buyers , to collectors , footballers and celebrities , " said Joseph McKenzie , the founder of pre-owned luxury watch retailer . <p> " Over the years we have been in business , consumers have generally grown to be more accepting of pre-owned . <p> " With online shopping giving a plethora of options , consumers are also far more savvy to the fact there are significant savings to be made . " <p> Unlike discount retail , the second-hand market benefits from shoppers knowing what the item was once worth . For many shoppers , including McKenzie , this is a key factor in the allure of the goods . <p> " From a young age , I was an aspirational individual with an interest in quality , well made products that were aesthetically pleasing , " he told the Retail Gazette . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to buy the latest watch . I found I could often pick up pre-owned luxury items from clothing to cars online at a fraction of the cost compared to brand new . <p> " I realised that selling brand new items was never really an option as , similar to the used car market , luxury watches typically depreciate up to 70 per cent in value once worn . <p> " They then often stabilise and some even increase in value depending on condition , provenance , age , et cetera . " <p> What entrepreneurs like McKenzie have developed is a second-hand market that no longer feels second-hand . By offering the same shopping experience as traditional high street retailers , rather than pawn shops , the only difference for customers is the price . <p> " In the future you 'll see more and more businesses like ours take this journey in reverse , establishing themselves online first and then using retail for brand awareness " <p> This is not limited to the luxury goods sector where the resale value of goods encourages immaculate selling practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video games , which a matter of months ago fetched upwards of ? 45 , for a few pounds . <p> Depreciation and the " bargain buzz " have driven the demand for second hand goods , but it is the platforms which came to prominence over the last decade which have allowed it to flourish . <p> " Online is really key to our business and the future of the luxury and pre-owned markets , " said McKenzie , who started his business through Ebay . <p> " Iin the future you 'll see more and more businesses like ours take this journey in reverse , establishing themselves online first and then using retail for brand awareness . " <p> High street retailers like Game and Urban Outfitters are increasingly incorporating second hand offerings into their retail operations , both having dedicated second-hand areas . But it is platforms like this that have allowed the same generation of savvy shoppers molded from the last financial crisis to compete with the high street . <p> Gumtree is perhaps the best known second-hand ecommerce retail platform outside of Ebay , averaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listings per week . <p> Like Ebay , Gumtree has provided a means for entrepreneurs to enter the pre-owned market , and it is now attempting to further boost its offering for small businesses . <p> " A small percentage of our 23.2 million registered sellers have pro accounts and Gumtree is a powerful sales tool for businesses , " Gumtree head of marketing Hannah Wilson told the Retail Gazette . <p> " Businesses using Gumtree are reaping the benefits , for example in late 2016 we announced an update to our motors category . <p> " Online is really key to our business and the future of the luxury and pre-owned markets " <p> " Since launching the new packages , Gumtree is now the fastest growing classified marketplace for motors in UK and has had a series of record months in terms of new customers signed up , number of new premium customers and number of responses to premium packages . <p> " The new offering is also attracting new audiences to Gumtree , with a 50 per cent growth each month in bigger dealers selling second hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more of a presence in retail than ever before . Despite its gradual integration into the high street , a lot of its growth and popularity is owed to online marketplaces. 
 <p> Superdry 's chief executive Euan Sutherland and chief financial officer Nick Wharton participate in existing long-term incentive arrangements and have waived their entitlement to take part in the scheme , to ensure it can cover everyone in retailer 's stores and head office . <p> Under the plan , for each ? 5 share increase over the ? 18 threshold , full-time store colleagues and those in the most junior roles in head office would be awarded up to ? 2000 at the end of the three-year plan period . <p> The equivalent figure for store managers would be ? 28,000 , for senior leaders up to ? 75,000. and for executive team members it would start at ? 300,000 . <p> Superdry said all awards would be over and above existing pay and bonus arrangements . <p> " James and I passionately believe that the success of the Superdry brand is down to the combined work of all our people , " Dunkerton said . <p> " As the founders of the business we remain significant investors and it is important to us that we share our on-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right way to ensure that our great team is properly rewarded for all the work they are doing to grow our global lifestyle brand . " <p> Sutherland added : " We remain confident in our strategy and believe that this innovative approach to reward for everyone will help us attract and retain the very best talent as we continue to deliver for consumers and create sustainable value for our investors . " <p> The scheme was launched yesterday at the annual general meeting of SuperGroup , the parent company of Superdry. <h> 1 COMMENT <p> It sounds good , but it 's a shame that there is the different amount for different grades of staff . Surely everyone will be working hard to grow the business , from the shop workers serving the customers to people in the head office to the directors . They should have looked to split the pay fairly .
