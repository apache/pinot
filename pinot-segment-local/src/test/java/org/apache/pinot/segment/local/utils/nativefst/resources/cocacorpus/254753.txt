@@75400102 @4100102/ <p> Alongside the tragedy of acute famine , frequently shown on our televisions , there is a much bigger problem of chronic hunger and malnutrition in developing countries . Although this carries a very real human cost , it is the purpose of this chapter to look purely at the economic aspects : assuring better nutrition can both reduce the economic drain on poor societies and help them become wealthier by increasing individuals productivity . <p> This summary article reviews the nature and scale of the problem and the economic benefits which would flow from successful solutions . Four opportunity areas for effective use of resources to reduce malnutrition are then proposed : <p> Using resources to address these opportunities would yield benefits greater than the costs , so these opportunities are economically justified . Benefits would , of course , also be realized on a wider social and human scale . <p> The nature of the challenge <p> Hunger has been described as " a condition , in which people lack the basic food intake to provide them with the energy and nutrients for fully productive lives " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with over-consumption of food , resulting for example in obesity , diabetes or heart disease . Such problems are of increasing importance in some parts of the developing world . However , currently malnutrition in the developing world is primarily associated with undernutrition . Although some commentators believe the regular figures published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) understate the true incidence of hunger , these nevertheless form the only relatively long-term global database . The figures indicate that the number of undernourished people in the developing world was 798 million in the 1999-2001 survey period : 17% of the total population of developing countries . Although this is an enormous problem , it should be seen against the background of their rapidly growing populations . There was an increase of 662 million people during the previous ten years ( nearly twice the population of the 15-member European Union ) while the number of chronically hungry people fell very slightly ( by 18 million ) . Thus the prevalence of undernourishment has fallen substantially . <p> 90% of these people live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 198 million ) . Despite the larger number of people affected overall , the trend in Asia-Pacific has been a reduction in the number and percentage of hungry people , primarily due to better nourishment of people in China . In Africa , on the other hand , the overall number of malnourished people increased , and in some countries the proportion of the affected population also rose . The socio-economic breakdown of malnutrition has been estimated by the Hunger Task Force as approximately : <p> 50% in farm households <p> 25% rural landless <p> 22% urban <p> 8% directly resource dependent ( eg pastoralists and fishermen ) <p> Development of a baby prior to birth ( the gestational period ) is crucial in determining its birth weight and affects childhood development . Mothers who are of small stature ( directly affected by their own foetal development and childhood nutrition ) , poorly nourished and prone to endemic disease tend to give birth to small children , who are at a developmental disadvantage . This is commonly measured by the incidence of Low Birth Weight ( LBW ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2000 , it was estimated that 16% of newborn babies in the developing world 11.7 million children annually could be classified as of LBW . In parts of south Asia , the situation is especially acute : an estimated 30% of babies are of LBW . <p> LBW is one important factor in determining early childhood development . Another is poor infant nutrition , particularly during the first two to three years of life . This has itself been linked to reduced breastfeeding . The net effect is reflected in the estimate that , in 2000 , 162 million children ( about one in three ) were stunted . In addition to the negative effect of malnutrition ( both of the child and mother ) on physical growth of children , deficiencies in micro-nutrients can have a major impact on development of intelligence . Lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development , and this can affect enormous numbers of people : it is estimated that 2 billion people ( one-third of the total global population ) are affected by iodine deficiency , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , it is estimated that 40% of children aged 4 and under suffer from anaemia because of insufficient iron in their diets . <p> Potential benefits of meeting the challenge <p> Reduction of the incidence of malnutrition would have a number of benefits . The most important ones identified are : <p> Reduction in infant mortality rates associated with LBW and deficiencies in micronutrients . The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) estimates that malnutrition contributed to 3.4 million child deaths in 2000 ; 60% of total child deaths . Reporting in 2001 , a WHO commission estimated that a 10% increase in average life expectancy at birth results in an additional 0.3-0.4% of economic growth per year . <p> Those who survive the effects of long-term malnutrition are more susceptible to disease , which further compromises their welfare . This also is a direct drain on healthcare services . <p> Poor nutrition can directly affect physical productivity . Reduction in chronic hunger increases an individuals capacity to do physical work and increases his or her earning power . For example , a study of workers in rural Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved nutrition ) leads to a 2-2.4% increase in wages or earnings . <p> For a variety of reasons , childhood malnutrition often leads to an individual receiving less schooling , which translates directly into lower lifetime earnings for the people affected . <p> Opportunities related to hunger and malnutrition <p> Framework for considering opportunities <p> While reduction in malnutrition would have clear economic benefits ( in addition to human and social benefits ) , the purpose of the Copenhagen Consensus is to compare as objectively as possible these benefits with those delivered by meeting the other nine challenges . <p> This is done partly by comparing the overall net financial gain , which may sound relatively straightforward but is complicated by the fact that benefits accrue in many cases over long periods ( the remaining lifetimes of children whose nutrition is improved , for example ) . To bring all projects to a common basis , an estimate must be made of the current value of all benefits to be received in the future . This is done by a process called discounting , which is simply an assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . However , the choice of a particular discount rate will , over a period of ten years or more , make an enormous difference to the current value ( what economists call the Present Discounted Value ) . Indeed , it can make the difference between an opportunity being seen as highly valuable and being rejected as having too small economic benefit to warrant the cost . There are other problems in making such estimates as well . Putting aside the question of discounting , for example , it is difficult to estimate the impacts of interventions given imperfect data that generally is generated by individuals behaviors and it often is difficult to estimate costs given programs that bundle interventions and use accounting prices that differ from marginal scarcity prices . Finally , for the efficiency motive for public subsidies what is needed are differences between private and social rates of returns , but such estimates are difficult to make and rarely available . <p> In a nutshell , there are no easy answers which are likely to be universally applicable . It is expected that a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their sensitivity to variables would be necessary . <p> Opportunity 1 : Reducing the prevalence of Low Birth Weight Some 12 million children in the developing world are born each year weighing less than 2500g , and are classified as Low Birth Weight . Increases in the proportion of babies of normal birth weight would have multiple benefits . In particular : <p> Saving of lives . While placing a monetary value on human life is uniquely difficult , it has to be done to make an economic comparison . One method , used here , is to use the resource costs of alternative means of saving a life . <p> Reducing costs of caring for newborn babies in hospital . <p> Reducing healthcare costs for surviving LBW babies , who have a higher incidence of illness than heavier babies . Improved lifetime productivity , based both on better physical development by adulthood and longer schooling/better learning ability . <p> Reducing costs of chronic diseases associated with LBW . <p> Benefits to following generations . LBW mothers themselves give birth to small babies , continuing the cycle of disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been estimated that the current value of actions which would result in one birth of a normal weight baby who would otherwise be LBW is $580 . Over half of this comes from increased productivity over the childs lifetime . This means that interventions which cost less than $580 per child affected would be justified in purely economic terms . <p> A range of relatively simple , and in many cases inexpensive , actions has been suggested . These include provision of antibiotics and anti-parasitics , insecticide treated bednets to reduce malaria incidence and supply of iron/folate dietary supplements . For example , it costs $2 per patient to supply antibiotics to Ugandan women with sexually transmitted diseases . As well as the direct benefits of curing disease , for every hundred women treated , two cases of LBW are prevented : a cost of $100 per case . Since each normal birth of an otherwise underweight baby is worth $580 , this has a benefit/cost ratio of 5.8 . <p> In another study , dietary supplements of iron and folate for pregnant women in Nepal prevented one case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment in a large-scale program is estimated as $13 per patient , or less than $150 for each LBW birth prevented : a benefit/cost ratio of about 4 . Of course , such interventions may also be justifiable on other grounds . <p> The key point with Opportunity 1 is that a number of interventions have been shown to decrease the incidence of LBW at a cost which is far below the estimated value of the benefit received . This means that such initiatives are readily justifiable , even with significant changes to some of the assumptions made in the calculations . <p> Nutrition in the first two years of life is second only to development in the womb in determining a childs healthy growth . Promoting breastfeeding in communities where incomes are low and food and water supplies are often contaminated can have significant benefits for childhood development and lifetime productivity . The gains are supplementary to those of opportunity 1 and of a similar magnitude . Costs of effective programs in place already make such actions easily justifiable in economic terms . For example , studies conducted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion of about 4 for typical interventions . Community based growth promotion is also a promising intervention in some environments . <p> Opportunity 3 : Reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia and iodine , vitamin A and zinc deficiencies <p> Lack of iron not only has an influence on fetal and childhood development ( and thus , for example , has a significant effect on the number of small babies born ) but also has a direct negative effect on the productivity of adults . Iodine intake also is an important factor in determining birth weight . In addition , lack of iodine in childhood reduces brain development : a study has shown , for example , that iodine-deficient individuals score an average of 13.5 points lower in IQ tests . <p> Vitamin A deficiency can permanently damage eyesight , even causing blindness . Dietary supplements not only decrease the incidence of blindness in children but also reduce deaths and severity of some illnesses . The direct benefits associated with the ( relatively inexpensive ) provision of vitamin A supplements are mainly in terms of this second category , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain during the lifetime of workers who would otherwise have been blind . <p> The benefits of zinc supplementation are to be seen in reduced LBW and improved physical development in childhood . <p> Delivery of additional micronutrients can be by a variety of routes . Flour fortification , supplementation with tablets , vitamin A as an addition to immunization programmes or even boosting iron by supply of iron cooking pots can all be cost effective ways of improving nutrition . Dietary interactions are complex , but an adequate supply of important vitamins and minerals can make an important contribution to well-being at various stages of an individuals life . As an example , many studies have been done on vitamin A supplementation , and it has been shown to be one of the most cost-effective medical interventions known , with a benefit/cost ratio of over 140 . <p> Opportunity 4 : Investment in technology in developing country agriculture <p> In an ideal world , all necessary nutrition should be obtainable from a readily available , balanced diet . This opportunity therefore focuses on developing improved seed varieties and agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent yields of more nutritious food . This is not just a case of subsistence farmers growing more to eat : rather it is a question of more productive farming which gives farmers a better return on their investment , increases demand for the labor of landless people and reduces the price of food to make it more accessible to both rural and urban populations . <p> The " green revolution " of the 1960s and 70s is a clear example of how modern plant breeding advances can be widely employed for the benefit of the poor . In this case , high-yielding dwarf varieties of rice and wheat have vastly increased the supply of staple foods in Asia and South America . Similar advances could be derived using the best technologies available now , including biotechnological advances . Returns on investment in this area are difficult to estimate accurately , but studies have shown that the relatively modest up-front costs of plant breeding can be quickly recouped , and that the benefits continue to accrue for many years until the seeds are displaced by the use of new varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cultivars with higher concentrations of micronutrients ( for example , vitamin A precursor in " golden rice " ) indicate that benefit/cost ratios can be very high in the region of 15-20 even with very conservative assumptions on uptake and effectiveness . Investment in agricultural technologies is the single most effective means of increasing the incomes of those groups in the developing world who suffer from chronic hunger . <p> Conclusions <p> Taking up the opportunities presented here would make a major contribution to the welfare of the worlds poorest people ; the 800 million who are chronically undernourished . While this can be regarded as a good in itself , the clear evidence is that all of the approaches described are also economically justified in the sense that the projected benefits outweigh the costs . <p> This paper is par of the Copenhagen Consensus project , which tries to evaluate various current and possible initiatives to improve the lives of poor people in developing countries .

@@75400104 @4100104/ <h> Women and Hunger Facts <p> World Hunger Education Service <p> Good nutrition is important for all people in order to reach the full potential of their growth and economic success . Poor nutrition , however , has a larger negative impact on women than on men . This is because it impacts not only their own health , but also the health of their children . The children of malnourished women are more likely to have poorer mental and physical development , higher rates of disease and infection , and are more likely to die in childhood ( Ransom &amp; Elder , 2003 ) . <p> Biologically , women are more likely to be malnourished , especially if they 're menstruating , pregnant , or lactating . In these cases , women have greater micronutrient requirements , and adequate protein energy intake is even more important ( FAO , 2012 ) . When they are pregnant or lactating , they need to consume more calories to support the development of their babies and the production of breast milk ( FAO , 2012 ) . <p> Women and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The United Nations ( UN ) estimates that 70% of the 1.3 billion people in poverty worldwide are women ( IWPR ) . <p> At least 120 million women in developing countries are underweight . In some regions , more women are underweight than not ; for example , 60% of women are underweight in South Asia ( Ransom &amp; Elder , 2003 ) . <p> Babies born to a malnourished mother are much more likely to have low birth weights ( LBW ) . LBW is one of the strongest predictors of whether a child will die before his or her fifth birthday ( UNICEF , 2014 ) . <p> In 2013 , 22 million infants were born with LBW , which was 16 percent of all babies born that year <p> Conversely , there is also growing concern in all countries about the rise in obesity rates " obesity being a form of malnutrition . Obesity in women also increases risk for labor complications and poor child health ( Delisle , 2008 ) . <p> Poverty is a main driver of malnutrition . In countries where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) between women and men , there is a higher percentage of women among the poor and hungry ( Delisle , 2008 ) . There is a strong and consistent relationship between gender inequality and hunger ( DeSchutter , 2013 ) . The Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) recognizes gender inequality as both a cause of and an effect of hunger and malnutrition ( FAO , 2012 ) . <h> I. Women 's Malnutrition : A Serious Problem <p> A. Protein energy malnutrition ( PEM ) <p> Adults in developing countries can also suffer from PEM , with women disproportionately impacted compared with men , particularly in South Asian countries ( WFP 2013 ) . There are five major causes of adult malnutrition : insufficient food , infections , mal-absorption of nutrients , malignancies ( such as cancer ) and eating disorders . <p> Pregnant women have an increased demand for nutrients by the developing fetus and those who are already undernourished can fall even further behind in their nutritional status with insufficient food intake . Not enough weight gain during pregnancy can lead to increased risk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low infant birth weight . It also becomes harder for a malnourished woman to provide adequate amounts of breast milk , which can lead to malnourished infants . <p> Prevention of adult malnutrition is complex because the underlying causes are numerous and there are no single , inexpensive or universal strategies that can be applied to prevent it . <p> B. Micronutrient malnutrition <p> Iron Deficiency and Anemia <p> During pregnancy , the amount of blood in the mother 's body greatly increases in order to support the developing baby . If the mother does not consume enough iron during this time , it is very easy for her to become anemic . Anemia in pregnancy increases the risk of the mother 's death during and after birth . Children born to iron-deficient mothers are more likely to have impaired physical and mental development and to have inadequate immune systems . <p> Anemia affects about 43-50% of women of reproductive age in less developed countries ( Ransom &amp; Elder , 2003 ) . <p> Anemia is estimated to contribute to at least 20% of maternal deaths worldwide . Pregnant women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Africa has the highest burden of anemia in pregnant women , at 57.1% , followed by South and Southeast Asia at 48.2% . South and Southeast Asia have a higher burden in terms of number of pregnant women with anemia. ( de Benoist , McLean , Egli , Cogswell , 2008 ) <p> Iron deficiency has been shown to be a key predictor of pica in pregnant women ; pica is the craving and consumption of non-food material such as dirt and paper . <p> Vitamin A Deficiency <p> Vitamin A is a nutrient that is required for proper cell growth . It has a critical role in the formation of the heart , lungs , kidneys and other organs in the baby . Vitamin A is crucial in vision , and night blindness is a symptom of severe vitamin A deficiency . Poor vision can become permanent in prolonged deficiency . Vitamin A is found in animal food products such as dairy , eggs and meats . It also comes from dark leafy green vegetables and orange and yellow vegetables . <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of vitamin A deficiency . Half of these children will die within a year of vision loss . <p> Many infants become vitamin A deficient because their mother is deficient and can not adequately supply enough vitamin A in her breast milk . <p> The WHO estimates that 19.1 million pregnant women are vitamin A deficient , and half experience vision loss as a result of vitamin A deficiency . <p> It is estimated that 10 to 20 percent of pregnant women in lower-income countries are vitamin A deficient ( Bailey , West Jr. , and Black , 2015 ) . <p> C. Resource Use and Malnutrition <p> To what extent women have the ability to choose how to use resources in order to achieve a desired outcome impacts the family . In many parts of the developing world , women do not have access to resources , nor the freedom to make choices about how resources are used in their households . When women have more access to resources and their ability to decide how to use them , maternal nutrition improves , child health improves and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , 2012 ) . <p> Unequal labor division and food allocation <p> In many parts of the developing world , women are responsible for performing a large portion of unpaid domestic work . Much of this is difficult physical labor . They may walk many miles every day to gather firewood and obtain water . This energy expenditure increases their daily caloric need . They are responsible for a majority of the labor involved in obtaining , preparing and serving food to their families . <p> In sub-Saharan Africa it is estimated that women perform anywhere from 60% to 80% of the labor involved in producing , procuring and preparing food for household consumption ( Ransom and Elder , 2003 ) . <p> Female-headed households are particularly vulnerable . They often lack access to resources needed to improve their food security . These resources include land , financial services and training in livelihood skills . Despite the role of women in food preparation , in some cultures women are still expected to eat last . This means they have less access to highly nutritional foods such as leafy greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family is a key factor in successful nutrition programs and policies . Improving household access to food is not enough if it is distributed unequally amongst members . <p> Malnutrition has a huge economic cost to countries . Malnourished individuals contribute less to the workforce , and increased maternal and child mortality drive up health care costs . <p> In Asia , malnutrition may account for as much as a 10% reduction in total gross domestic product ( Ransom and Elder , 2003 ) . <h> II . Vulnerability in crises and disasters <p> In severe crises , particularly those in which families are separated or displaced , the consequences on the health and nutrition of women and their children can be dire . Access to an inadequate diet while fleeing war or while in a refugee camp worsens deficiencies a woman already has . Pregnant or lactating women are extremely vulnerable in these situations . They lack access to proper nutrition advice and medical care . Stress can cause preterm deliveries , which is much more likely to take place without a skilled assistant or in a sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to malnutrition . <p> 56% of maternal and child deaths take place in fragile settings . Fragile settings are regions affected by violent conflict or natural disasters . <p> The Mother 's Index Score is a composite ranking of several maternal health and women 's empowerment indices . <p> Of the 28 countries that have ranked in the bottom 10 since 2000 , all but four have a recent history of armed conflict . <p> Divorce rates have been shown to rise during food shortages . This leaves women and children to fend for themselves . In cultures where divorced women are shunned in society , this is particularly bad . <p> Food shortages are shown to lead to daughters being married off sooner so there are fewer mouths to feed . Females who are married before reaching adulthood are more likely to end their education early , to become pregnant while malnourished , to die during childbirth , and to give birth to babies with poor health ( Save The Children , 2014 ) . <p> Differences in control of economic resources between men and women , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to cope with rising food prices . They also lack legal protection to claim the resources they do have the rights to ( FAO , IFAD , &amp; WFP , 2015 ) . <p> Exclusive breastfeeding for six months after birth is widely recognized as the best for baby 's and mother 's health . When a mother is malnourished , her lactation may decrease . If her breast milk is insufficient , she will begin complementary feeding before six months , which is associated with stunting , disease , and other health complications in the baby . Women are also more likely to sacrifice their own food consumption in order to feed their children more . Increased incidence of sexual assault " a common symptom of crises " leads to unintended pregnancies . Becoming pregnant while malnourished has severe consequences on the health of a woman . This is especially true if she is young or if she has been pregnant recently before ( Save The Children , 2014 ) . <h> III . Practical solutions for reducing women 's malnutrition <p> There are a number of actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce malnutrition in women and girls . Some of these actions are : <p> A. Women 's own role in ending malnutrition <p> Despite the numerous challenges and vulnerabilities that women face in achieving adequate nutrition , they are also in a unique position to improve their own and their family 's nutrition and health if provided the proper resources and opportunities . <p> B. Increasing access to family planning <p> Pregnancy and lactation places a huge demand on the health and nutrition of a woman . Because of this , access to family planning methods is a key way to improve the nutrition of women . With family planning methods , a woman can ensure that she is properly nourished before becoming pregnant . This greatly improves the chances of safely delivering a healthy baby . She is also able to space pregnancies so that she is able to breastfeed her baby for the recommended two years , with complementary feeding added at six months . <p> C. Investing in women to end malnutrition <p> In developing countries , 79% of economically active women are farmers . <p> Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have access to fewer resources than male farmers . If they had the same access , it is estimated that there would be 100 to 150 million fewer hungry people in the world ( Save The Children , 2014 ) . <p> Studies have consistently found that when women have more control over household income , the health and nutrition of children improves . <p> D. Increasing access to education for girls and women <p> Increased female education is a well-documented route to improving nutrition for women , girls and the family . In one large , cross-country study , it was found that 43% of improvements in nutrition over a 25-year period were attributable to increased women 's education ( DeSchutter , 2013 ) . <p> Some of the most important steps that can be taken to improve women 's nutritional status are improving their access to and freedom to use resources ; and providing access to educational opportunities and family planning . Appropriate nutrition policies and programs , including food security are key , along with protection and promotion of good health and care practices through education to women .

This is down significantly from 2014 , when 14.0 percent of households ( 17.5 million households , approximately one in seven ) , were food insecure. - It continues a downward trend from 14.9 percent food insecure in 2011 , the highest percentage ever recorded. - However the 2015 prevalence of food insecurity was still above the 2007 pre-recessionary level of 11.1 percent .

( Coleman-Jensen 2016b ) . <p> About 59 percent of food-insecure households in the survey reported that in the previous month , they had participated in one or more of the three largest Federal nutrition assistance programs ( SNAP ; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) ; and National School Lunch Program ) . <p> Background : The United States changed the name of its definitions in 2006 that eliminated references to hunger , keeping various categories of food insecurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured .

For non-Hispanic whites the poverty rate was 9.1 percent ( Proctor 2016 , p. 12-4 ) . <p> The poverty rate for children under 18 was 19.7 percent in 2015 , down from 21.1 percent in 2014 and the number of children in poverty was 14.5 million , down from 15.5 million in 2014 . Children represented 23.1 percent of the total population and 33.6 percent of people in poverty ( Proctor 2016 , p. 14 ) . <p> 19.4 million Americans live in extreme poverty . This means their family 's cash income is less than half of the poverty line , or about $10,000 a year for a family of four .

About 2 percent went for other food assistance programs and federal government expenses . <p> Close to seventy percent of all food stamp participants are in families with children ; more than one-quarter of participants are elderly people or people with disabilities . <p> The average SNAP recipient received about $127 a month ( or about $4.23 a day ) in fiscal year 2015 . <p> The SNAP benefit formula targets benefits according to need : very poor households receive larger benefits than households closer to the poverty line since they need more help affording an adequate diet <p> Unlike most means-tested benefit programs , which are restricted to particular categories of low-income individuals , SNAP is broadly available to almost all households who have low incomes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minimal assets ( up to $2,250 or $3,250 , depending on the circumstances ) . <p> WIC provides nutritious foods , nutrition education , and referrals to health and other social services to low-income pregnant , postpartum and breastfeeding women , and infants and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk. - WIC participants receive checks or vouchers to purchase nutritious foods each month , including infant cereal , iron-fortified adult cereal , vitamin C-rich fruit or vegetable juice , eggs , milk , cheese , peanut butter , dried and canned beans/peas , and canned fish . Other options such as fruits and vegetables , baby foods , and whole wheat bread were recently added . <p> 6.4 million infants and children under five and and 2 million women received WIC benefits in 2014 . <p> The cost of the program is approximately $7 billion annually . <p> Participants family income must fall at or below 185 percent of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines ( in 2010 , $40,793 for a family of four ) . Eligibility is also granted to participants in other benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid , or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families . <p> Funding : WIC is a Federal grant program for which Congress authorizes a specific amount of funding each year for program operations . <h> National School Lunch Program <p> The National School Lunch Program is open to all children enrolled in a participating school . Approximately 95 percent of public schools participate . During the 2012-13 school year 30.7 million children in more than 98,433 schools and residential child care institutions participated in the National School Lunch Program . <p> On a typical school day , 21.5 million of these 30.7 million total children , or 70.5 percent , were receiving free or reduced price lunches <p> Any child at a participating school may purchase a meal through the National School Lunch Program . Household income determines if a child is eligible to receive free or reduced price meals , or must pay most of the cost . To receive free lunch , household income must be at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level ; for reduced price lunch , income must be between 130 percent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must meet federal nutrition standards . National School Lunch Program lunches provide one third or more of the recommended levels for key nutrients <p> Studies show that proper nutrition improves a child 's behavior , school performance , and overall cognitive development . A healthy eating environment teaches children good nutrition and the elements of a proper diet , which can have positive effects on children 's eating habits and physical well-being throughout life . <h> Poverty <p> Three principal programs that provide income and other assistance for poor people are the minimum wage , the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , and the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) program . Other programs , not discussed here , include Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , and Social Security and Medicare for older people . <h> Minimum wage <p> The United States enacts a minimum wage ( as do some individual states ) that tries to establish a floor for what can be paid as a wage by firms . The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the District of Columbia have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage . ) <p> In 2014 , the official U.S. poverty level for a family of 4 was $24,008 . ( See Census Bureau " Poverty Thresholds " . ) With a 40 hour week , a family of 4 with one minimum wage earner ( working 52 weeks a year , typically with no paid vacation ) would earn $15,080 , only 62 percent of the poverty level . <p> The minimum wage is not indexed for inflation . Thus its value over the years has been diminished substantially , as increases in the minimum wage have not kept up with inflation . <h> The Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) <p> The EITC is the mechanism through which , by filing a tax return , low income people and families can receive an income supplement . It reduces poverty directly by supplementing the earnings of low-wage workers , and is designed to encourage and reward work . <p> The amount of EITC depends on a recipient 's income , marital status , and number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EITC was $3,074 for a family with children ( boosting wages by about $256 a month ) , compared with just $281 for a family without children . <p> In 2013 , the EITC lifted about 6.2 million people out of poverty , including about 3.2 million children . The number of poor children would have been one-quarter higher without the EITC . The credit reduced the severity of poverty for another 21.6 million people , including 7.8 million children . <p> One way the EITC reduces poverty is by supplementing the earnings of minimum-wage workers . At the federal minimum wage 's current level , a two-parent family with two children with a full-time , minimum-wage worker can move above the poverty line only if it receives the EITC as well as SNAP ( food stamp ) benefits . <h> Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) <p> In 1996 , TANF replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program , which had been in existence since 1935 . <p> The TANF program provides block grants to states to provide assistance to needy families .

TANF benefits have lost a fifth of their value since 1996 in most states and leave families far below the poverty line ( CBPP TANF ) . <p> This decline is due to factors such as the five year time limitation on benefits , declining real levels of funding , some increase in the number of single parents who work , and as an inability of families to meet the regulations . <p> Studies of families that stop receiving TANF assistance show that 60 percent of former recipients are employed " typically at poverty-level salaries between $6 and $8.50 an hour " while 40 percent are not employed .

This contributes to the rise in overweight and the decline of protein consumption . <p> In one household there may be both obese individuals and undernourished individuals , and each with micronutrient deficiencies . This is known as triple-burden ' malnutrition , and is a growing problem in Asia . <p> In the most recent data available , 12.2% of the population of India in 2010 was obese or overweight , in China 29% , and 34.1% in Thailand . These figures are expected to steadily increase ( Ramachandran &amp; Snehalatha , 2010 ) .

Women are often the primary care-takers of children , but they are inadequately informed about how to care for their own health and the nutrition needs of their children and they may have little say in the economic activities of their household . <p> In Asia , people living in rural environments are more likely to be malnourished than those in urban environments , especially children . <p> In India in 2005 , 33% of children in urban areas were malnourished , while 46% of rural children were malnourished ( International Institute for Population Sciences ( IIPS ) and Macro International , 2007 ) . <p> In South Asia , approximately 48% of rural children were stunted , while 35% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but smaller relationship with approximately 16% and 12% . <p> This could be due to a variety of factors . The factors that are statistically associated with better nutrition in urban areas are : Maternal education : It is more likely that an urban mother will have a secondary education , and will have higher decision-making power in her household . Hygiene and sanitation : The urban household is more likely to have access to and use a flush toilet , as opposed to open defecation or a pit latrine . Economic status : Urban families also tend to have a better economic status than rural families ( Smith , Ruel , &amp; Ndiaye , 2005 ) . 
@@75400113 @4100113/ <h> Food is a Human Right <p> Uwe Kracht <p> The World Food Summit ( WFS ) , which gathered in Rome two years ago , will hardly enter history as a landmark conference like the 1974 World Food Conference or the 1992 Rio Earth Summit . But it did open a few windows of opportunity , which could have a fundamental impact on the way we deal with food and development problems in the future . <p> The most promising is the human right to adequate food . The Summit reaffirmed the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger ( FAO 1996 , Rome Declaration ) . <p> This somewhat lengthy , cumbersome formulation reflects a measure of disagreement among Summit participants , notably on the part of the United States . The United States put on record that it " does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding the rights related to food . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food " or " fundamental right to be free from hunger " is a goal or aspiration to be realized progressively that does not give rise to any international obligations or diminish the responsibilities of national governments toward their citizens " ( FAO , 1996 , Part I , Annex II ) . <p> But precisely the lack of unanimity , together with the frustration on the part of many countries at decades of right-to-food rhetoric with too little concrete action , led to what could be considered a landmark decision : the international community at large governments , civil society , international institutions should clarify the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger and propose ways to implement and realize it ( FAO , 1996 , Plan of Action , paragraph 61 ) . For the first time since the Universal Declaration on Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and whose 50th anniversary is being celebrated this year , a global summit challenged the international community to give operational meaning to the human right to adequate food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most frequently cited in solemn declarations of political intent and most neglected and violated in practice . <p> The Right to Adequate Food in International Law The right to adequate food is widely recognized in international law . The most basic provision is found in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights ( UDHR ) , which stipulates that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family , including food . This provision is further elaborated in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) , to which some 180 States ( but not the United States ) are Parties . In recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , the ICESCR identifies a set of core actions related to food production and distribution as well as nutrition . The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) , ratified by 191 States ( not the United States ) , recognizes food- and nutrition-related rights in the context of the right of the child to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regional level , the right to adequate food is most clearly spelled out in the ( not yet ratified ) Additional Protocol to the American Convention of Human Rights in the Area of Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . And there is a host of other instruments , declarations or pronouncements , in which the right to food is reaffirmed or referred to . <p> Lack of application of the right can not just be attributed to the habitual lack of political will of governments . Human rights nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) and scholars have equally tended to neglect it in their work . And development practitioners largely fail to see the value added by using a right-to-food approach as compared to various forms of conventional basic-needs strategies , through which they have sought to deal with hunger and poverty . Failure to bridge the largely intellectual realm of the human rights debate and development practice , and to bring about a joint vision of development among people with a background in law and those trained in various development disciplines has impeded effective advocacy in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the private sector and civil society at large . <p> What Difference Does a Rights-based Approach Make ? What are the differences between a rights-based approach and conventional basic , needs-based strategies ? What benefits can be gained by introducing the right-to-food dimension ? <p> This Bolivian child holds a piece of bread , a rare treat in a village where underemployment is chronic . With a human rights approach to adequate nutrition , the government of Bolivia , and the international community , would have to consider how the poorest people could be integrated into the international economy of production and income . <p> At the surface level , the differences may appear subtle , but on reflection they emerge as fundamental ( Kracht , 1997 ) . They have both an ethical and juridical dimension . Basic needs approaches define " beneficiaries " and their needs . The approach is one of dependency in the sense that beneficiaries have no active claim to ensure that their needs will be met . And there is no binding obligation or duty for anybody to meet these needs . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fundamental difference in a human-rights approach is that it starts from the ethical position that all people are entitled to a certain standard in terms of material and spiritual well-being . This was most forcefully brought to the fore by the 1995 World Summit for Social Development , which stated : <p> " We Heads of State and Government are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility . " <p> To this end we will create a framework for action to : promote universal respect for , and observance and protection of , all human rights and freedoms for all , including the right to development ; promote the effective exercise of rights and the discharge of responsibility at all levels of society ( United Nations , 1995 , paragraphs 25 , 26 ; emphasis added ) . <p> A human rights approach thus removes the charity dimension inherent in basic needs strategies , however valuable this may be , and emphasizes rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim-holders and establishes duties or obligations for those against whom a claim can be held ( objects or duty-bearers ) to ensure that needs are met . That moves the focus to where it should be : development by people themselves , not for them . The concept of claim-holders and duty-bearers introduces an important element of accountability . Increased accountability holds the key for improved effectiveness of action and as such offers the potential for added value flowing from the application of a rights-based approach . <p> Implicit in the introduction of a rights dimension are also attitudinal aspects whose potential political impact should not be underestimated . A basic needs view of the problem of chronic hunger in the developing world may state that 80 percent of the population is able to meet their food needs , while a rights position would have to emphasize that the right to food continues to be neglected or violated in the case of 20 percent of the developing countries ' population . <p> Introduction of a rights approach would also have important implications for the analysis of food and nutrition problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causal factors of identified problems would need to be complemented by a multifaceted role/responsibility analysis of obstacles confronting the realization of the right to adequate food , from the household up to the national and international levels . This would be the basis for determining who is to be held accountable for the existence of such obstacles and who would be responsible for their removal ( Jonsson , 1997 ) . <p> In most states , the basis for the creation of a normative , legal basis for the right to adequate food already exists , as states have already incorporated human rights in their national law at the constitutional and/or ordinary law level . Given this , a human rights framework means : <p> Human rights are legally binding for states , not optional as in the case of recommendations from global summits and conferences . <p> National law and policies need to be brought into agreement with what the state has agreed to internationally . This will recognize the states limitations in providing such essential aspects of economic human rights as employment , but also recognize the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these areas . <p> By using a human rights entry point , the entire human rights framework is brought into play : civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights . <p> Human rights require active and effective remedies , not necessarily by the use of courts , but any person or group whose rights are violated should have access to appropriate remedial measures , juridical or otherwise . <p> Rights imply accountability , both domestic and international , and thus contribute to good governance . Under international covenants , states are obliged to submit periodic reports on the human rights measures they have taken . These reports are public and accessible , now accessible even on the Internet , and can be used to hold governments accountable for non-compliance with their obligations . <p> Ethics in a Globalizing World On reflection , using the concept of value added by a human rights approach is misleading for two reasons : 1 ) it suggests that there is a choice between an ethics-based rights approach and other approaches , and , 2 ) when applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that may be desirable but not necessary . Such suggestions are no longer tenable in a world undergoing the revolutionary changes of the liberalization and globalization of economic and financial markets , which are of no lesser significance than the 19th century industrial revolution . <p> The dominance of the liberalizing and globalizing marketplace is affecting all spheres of life in every corner of the world . Directly and indirectly , it is affecting the sovereignty of states by transcending conventional political boundaries changing and even reducing the roles of governments . Even more importantly , it is affecting human beings and the relations among us . The global market place treats human beings as objects and , most often , as obstacles and will result , if unchecked , in more poverty , more hunger , more civil strife and armed conflicts and the denial of the right to food for millions ( Spitz , 1996 , emphasis added ) . <p> These risks are real . They can and must be checked , if globalization is to bear fruit for people and not just the actors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for doing so , through its emphasis on ethics and human rights in development . By adopting international human rights agreements governments have committed themselves to an ethics and human rights dimension in development . <p> That ethics and economics need to come together rather than being considered irreconcilable antagonists has been a frequent theme of Pope John Paul II . In underlining the advantages of a globalized economy in a recent address , Pope John Paul II pointed at the same time to the need for harmonizing the exigencies of the market with those of ethics and social justice ( John Paul II , 1998 ) . <p> Globalization of the market place must be matched by globalization of solidarity based on human values and norms anchored in ethics and human rights . This is the challenge at the threshold of the third millennium . <p> Neither globalization of human solidarity , nor a principal component of this effort , implementation of human rights , including the right to food , will be achieved overnight .

The " solutions " they prescribe are rooted in the same policies and technologies that created the problem in the first place : increased food aid , de-regulated global trade in agricultural commodities , and more technological and genetic fixes . These measures only strengthen the corporate status quo controlling the worlds food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been little official leadership in the face of the crisis . Nor has there been any informed public debate about the real reasons the numbers of hungry people are growing , or what we can do about it .

They have worked hard to diversify their crops , protect their soil , conserve their water and forests , and establish local gardens , markets , businesses , and community-based food systems . There are tens of thousands of highly-productive , equitable , and sustainable alternatives to the present industrial practices and corporate monopolies holding the worlds food hostage , and literally millions of people working to advance these alternatives in this time of need . What is missing is the political will on the part of government , industry , and finance to support these alternatives . <p> The food crisis is affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trigger for the present crisis was food price inflation . The World Bank reported that global food prices rose 83% over the last three years and the FAO cited a 45% increase in their world food price index over just nine months .

As of March 2008 , average world wheat prices were 130% above their level a year earlier , soy prices were 87% higher , rice had climbed 74% , and maize was up 31% . While grain prices have come down slightly , food prices are still high , and because low-income and poor families are faced with higher fuel and housing costs , they are still unable to buy sufficient food . <p> The crisis of food price inflation is simply the most recent tip of a slow-moving iceberg .

In fact , over the last 20 years , world food production has risen steadily at over 2% a year , while the rate of global population growth has dropped to 1.14% a year . Population is not outstripping food supply . People are too poor to buy the food that is available . " Were seeing more people hungry and at greater numbers than before , " said World Hunger Programs executive director Josette Sheeran .

But in the winter of 2007 , instead of shortages , food price inflation exploded on world markets " in spite of that years record harvests . As a result , the number of hungry people jumped dramatically to 982 million in just one year . In the United States , 57 million people ( a sixth of the national population ) classified as " near poor " are now food insecure .

Bad weather , high oil prices , agrofuels , and speculation are only the proximate causes of a deeper , systemic problem . The root cause of the crisis is a global food system that is highly vulnerable to economic and environmental shock .

Immediately following de-colonization in the 1960s , Africa exported 1.3 billion a year worth of food . Today African countries must import 25% of their food . The rise of food deficits in the global South mirrors the rise of food surpluses and market expansion of the industrial North . <h> The population factor <p> The Sub-Saharan African population has grown from 230 million in 1961 to 673 million in 2000 , a 292% increase over 39 years .

Through its structural adjustment policies , the World Bank and the IMF pressured African countries to abandon small farm agriculture , which was seen as unproductive . Development policies pushed people to the cities where they were to provide labor to manufacture and industry . African industrial agriculture would produce export crops ( coffee , cacao , cotton ) to pay off their foreign debt , and Africans would use revenues from industry to import their food . The bank insisted that this development strategy would result in increased family incomes and economic security , thus leading to lower population growth rates . The strategy failed miserably . The urban population increased seven-fold , swelling from 18% to 33% of the population . Millions of poor and unemployed workers have swelled the cities " with two-thirds of them living in slums . The manufacturing and industrial sector did not " take off " in African countries ; the percent of the GDP coming from industry was 30% in 1961 and 32% in 2000 . In the countryside , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew . Though the rural population , density increased by 180% as more farmers were crowded onto smaller plots . While the rest of the developing world lowered the amount of export earnings they spent on food imports from 42 to 24% , African countries increased the share they spent on food imports from 42 to 54% . The industrial transition did not slow population growth because it actually increased poverty and insecurity in both rural and urban areas . The rise in population is not the cause of hunger , but the result of poverty " brought on by the programmed destruction of African food systems . <p> The destruction of southern food systems occurred through a series of northern economic development projects : <p> The Green Revolution ( 1960-90 ) was a campaign led by the international agricultural research centers that aimed to modernize farming in the developing world . Impressive gains in national productivity were accompanied by the steady monopolization of seed and input markets by northern corporations .

Excluding China , the Green Revolution increased food per capita by 11% .

Southern countries were flooded with subsidized grain from the U.S. and Europe that was sold at prices far under the costs of production . This destroyed national agricultural markets and tied southern food security to global markets dominated by rich northern countries . <p> Regional free trade agreements and the World Trade Organization <p> " The idea that developing countries should feed themselves is an anachronism from a bygone era . They could better ensure their food security by relying on U.S. agricultural products , which are available , in most cases at lower cost .

WTO rules , like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the General Agreement on Trade in Services , further consolidated northern control over southern agricultural economies . The global South was forced to strip away genuine protections for smallholders and local producers to open its markets to northern goods while northern markets remained largely protected through a combination of both tariff and non-tariff barriers . Regional free trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA , pushed through by the North , continued trade liberalization , forcing southern farmers out of business and making countries of the South dependent on northern food imports . <p> Northern subsidies to agriculture amount to $US 1 billion per day . This figure is six times the annual development assistance from northern countries to the global South . Fully one-quarter of the value of agricultural production in the United States comes from subsidies .

Because when prices are high " and food is unavailable to the poor " food aid decreases . When prices are low " and food is abundant " food aid increases . <p> Sound backward ? That is because food aid responds to grain prices on the international market " not to the food needs of poor countries . When the price of cereals is low , northern countries and transnational grain companies seek to sell their commodities through food aid programs . When the price is high , they prefer to sell their grains on the international market . When more people suffer from hunger , less food aid arrives . Global food aid is dominated by U.S. food aid , whose objective since 1954 has been to " lay the basis for a permanent expansion of our exports of agricultural products with lasting benefits to ourselves and peoples of other lands .

In 2007 , 99.3% of U.S. food aid was " in-kind , " that is , food procured in the United States and shipped to recipient countries ( rather than provisions of cash or coupons for purchasing food closer to recipients ) . <p> The crippling of food systems in the global South opened up entire continents to the expansion of industrial agri-foods from the North . This expansion devastated local agro-biodiversity and emptied the countryside of valuable natural and human resources . But as long as cheap , subsidized grain from the industrial North kept flowing , the industrial agri-foods complex grew , consolidating control of the worlds food systems in the hands of fewer and fewer grain , seed , chemical , and petroleum companies .

This even bests U.K.-based Tesco , a recent , high-power arrival on the U.S. market , whose profits rose by a record 11.8% percent last year . Other major retailers , such as Wal-Mart , also say that food sales are driving their profit increases . <h> Food banks : canaries in the mineshaft <p> Prices are up , but just how bad is the food crisis in the United States ? The recent trends in the nations food banks are a good indicator : there is less food available , it is more expensive , and the lines outside the food banks are growing . <p> Federal support for food banks began during the food crisis of the 1970s as an emergency anti-poverty measure to close what was thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite a downturn in the economy , the Reagan administration cut support for social safety nets , pushing poor people into the street and forcing food banks to turn to the private sector for donations . Food banks fought hunger by collecting unwanted food from distributors and individual households . Religious institutions , nonprofits , and an army of volunteers set up soup kitchens , food pantries , and food banks , giving rise to a rapidly growing emergency food movement . Between 1980 and 1982 , the Salvation Armys food pantrys demand increased 400% . <p> As the number of hungry people in the United States has grown , food banks have increasingly taken up the slack where government food stamps and federal school and nutrition programs leave off . Today , the nations largest food bank , Feeding America ( formerly Second Harvest ) , distributes two billion pounds of food annually to 200 national food banks . <p> A survey done by Feeding America in 2008 revealed that 99% of food banks have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people served since last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks are down . USDA surplus has declined by $200 million and local food donations are down nationally about 9% . ( The USDA distributes surplus when stocks are high or commodities prices fall below a certain level . Like international food aid , they respond to the needs of the grain market first , tending to decrease distribution when food is most needed and increase it when it is less needed . ) The Food Bank Association of New York state reports that USDA commodities are down 60% this year , a decline of 67 million pounds of food . Because many food banks across the nation rely heavily on government surplus , the decline in USDA bonus commodities has pressured them to find alternative suppliers and sources of food . Many food banks are making substitutions for traditional sources of protein and dairy , and others are reorganizing their operating structures . <p> The California Association of Food Banks asserts that food banks are at the " beginning of a crisis . " The concerns of food banks in California are not isolated ; strain and worry resounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food crisis . Food Banks are also suffering due to decreased monetary donations from middle class Americans who are tightening their belts in response to the national financial crunch , and decreased food donations from food corporations due to the emergence of lucrative " secondary markets " ( e.g. , Big Lots , Dollar Tree , Grocery Outlet ) . The U.S. Farm Bill <p> Food crises and farm crises are never far apart . In the 1970s , the government had been managing grain supply and market fluctuations by maintaining national reserves and paying farmers to idle their land . But when oil shortages and inflation pushed up food prices " provoking widespread hunger abroad " then U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz told U.S. farmers to save the world from hunger by planting " fence row to fence row " and putting their entire harvest on the market . Policies that curbed overproduction and protected farmers from price swings were replaced by ones that encouraged maximum production and low prices . <p> When it turned out the hungry people of the world were too poor to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Butz then told farmers to " get big or get out . " The result was widespread bankruptcy and the painful exodus of over half of our farming families from the countryside . The average farm size went from 200 to 400 acres , reflecting a steady agrarian shift to mega-farms . Large-scale corporate and non-family farms now control 75% of agricultural production . <p> Under new agricultural policy , farmers were guaranteed a minimum price for their grain . True to its word , over the next two decades , the government paid out billions of dollars to maintain surpluses of cheap grain . Cheap grain became the bulwark not only of the feedlot explosion , but of U.S. foreign policy as well . This policy was later incorporated into the rules of the WTO that prevented developing countries from raising tariffs to protect their agriculture from cheap foreign imports . <p> But membership in the WTO also required the United States to drop its farm subsidies . The 1996 Farm Bill called for a phase-out by 2001 . The so-called " Freedom to Farm " Act abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal aspects of the U.S. Farm Bill ( like price floors to rural economies , conservation , and diversified livestock programs ) . Counting on unimpeded exports , U.S. farmers borrowed heavily to crank up production " too quickly , as it turned out . When global grain prices crashed , the government responded with billions of dollars in " emergency payments " that they claimed were " not technically " subsidies . In 2002 corn and wheat exports from the United States were priced at 13-43% below the cost of production . It is no surprise that these " non-subsidies " became the foundation of the 2002 Farm Bill . <p> The main beneficiaries of these policies were large farms , multinational grain traders including Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland , the feedlot industries ( e.g. , Tyson and Smithfield ) , and chemical-seed companies including Monsanto , DuPont , and Syngenta . <p> The 2008 U.S. Farm ( and Food ) Bill ( also known as the Food , Conservation , and Energy Act ) weighs in at $307 billion over five years . On the food side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistance Program . There is also $100 million a year to be split between programs that rebuild local food systems , increase access to healthy food in underserved communities , and support organic , beginning , and minority farmers . <p> Unfortunately , the Farm Bill also includes $74 billion of the same commodities programs that benefit mega-farms and corporate agribusiness , and undermine public health , the environment , and farming communities worldwide : <p> $300 million a year for agrofuel programs that will continue to push up grain prices and consolidate monopoly power in the hands of grain and fuel companies <h> Are Farmers Benefiting ? <p> While the food crisis sent grain prices on the global market skyrocketing , farmers growing the grain wont see much of this windfall for long . Why ? As George Naylor of the National Family Farm Coalition ( NFFC ) puts it , " Farmers do n't  trade in grain ; grain companies trade in grain . " The spectacular increase in the price of corn ( from $2 to as high as $8 a bushel ) was quickly followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins are rapidly thinning for both conventional and organic farmers . In general , farmers report that their costs are increasing faster than prices for their goods . Farmers receive less than 20 cents of the food dollar , out of which they must pay for production costs that have increased by 45% since 2002 . The prices of most fertilizers have tripled over the last 18 months . Urea , the most common nitrogen fertilizer , has risen in price from an average of $281 per ton in January 2007 to $402 in January 2008 , then to $815 in August , an increase of 300% . Diesel prices to farmers have increased 40% over the last two years . <p> Agrofuel " specifically corn-based ethanol " was once considered a good way to add value to corn in order to improve farm incomes . Unfortunately , the farmer-owned cooperatives that initially ensured returns to farmers are quickly being taken over by industry . According to the Renewable Fuels Association ( RFA ) , the ethanol industrys lobbying group , of 134 operational ethanol processing plants in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28% of the nations total capacity . This is rapidly changing . Out of a total of 77 plants now under construction , 88% are owned by large corporations . When completed , the farmer-owned percentage of total plant capacity will fall to less than 20% ( note : RFA and the USDA were recently accused of underreporting the number of ethanol plants under construction , so the degree of corporate control may actually be higher ) . Just five corporations control roughly 47% of all ethanol production in the United States . ADM and POET , the two largest corporate ethanol producers , control 33.7% of all ethanol production . The top 10 producers together control an estimated 70% . Because of the economies of scale of its plants , and the fact that it can dominate the grain market in both food and fuel crops , ADM is emerging as the hegemonic player in the United States . While other ethanol companies are struggling with shrinking margins due to high corn prices , ADM has strengthened its market share , as well as its profits . <p> Organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( organic fertilizer , seeds , and plastics used for irrigation , ) and general costs such as electricity and water . Many organic milk producers can no longer find organic feed grains . Some small-scale producers selling at farmers markets have seen an increase in customers and in the short run , Community Supported Agriculture ( CSA ) farmers appear to be better off ( because their consumers help shoulder production costs ) , but this could shift due to anxiety over next years crop or the overall economy . In the Midwest and the South this years crisis is compounded by flooding and hurricanes , forcing re-planting and a decrease in crops to farmers markets or local distribution . Because of the high volatility of prices , the NFFC warns that we are " one drought away from $10 dollar ( a bushel ) corn . " Because of the markets high volatility , we are also a bust away from $2 a bushel corn , which would be just as devastating . <h> Food , finance and speculation : bailing our way out of crises ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. government to tap capital reserves . But what happens if we have a devastating drought or other natural or man-made disaster which results in a food crisis in the United States ? There are no food reserves ! The United States has a Federal Reserve Bank for money , and a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for oil , but absolutely no federal reserve for grain and other emergency foodstuffs . " <p> Larry Matlack , American Agricultural Movement <p> The American economy is in the worst shape we 've seen since the Great Depression . The federal government is investing billions of dollars in taxpayer money to bail out Wall Street . Both the food crisis and the financial crisis are rooted in similar polices that have fed on each other for years . <p> Free market reforms worldwide , championed by the United States , eroded support for local agriculture and led to massive consolidation in the agriculture industry . In the same period , deregulation in the financial services industry allowed banks to " cross over " their investments : small banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the economy . Large banks quickly swallowed up small banks . Between 1980 and 1998 alone there were over 8,000 bank mergers in the United States , accounting for over $2.4 trillion in assets . As banking became more centralized , loans to small businesses , including farms , became harder to come by , which in combination with falling prices and expensive chemical and seed packages left many farmers to " get big or get out . " Commodities traders increasingly invested in other financial services , large traders moved into futures markets , and some banks began to trade in financial instruments , including commodities , in order to protect their loans . Some financial services companies , like Goldman Sachs , even became importers of physical goods , while traditional agribusinesses , like Cargill , now have investment banking arms that deal in everything from real estate and corporate securities to IT technology . <p> Deregulation and consolidation both make markets extremely vulnerable to shock . When the sub-prime mortgage crisis hit in 2007 , investors began to scramble for safe places to put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation that began at the beginning of 2008 was caused by exactly that scramble " a combination of investing in agricultural commodities and oil , which drove up the price of food and farm inputs . Looking for safer investments , traders that may or may not be in businesses related to food at all , put their money into commodities futures . This kind of speculative trading that is exacerbating the food crisis was not possible on this scale until financial services deregulation in the 1980s . <p> This system of deregulation has caught our economy and our food system in a negative feedback loop . Less regulation breeds more consolidation and less stability in both agricultural and financial markets . The irony is that because markets and investments are now so intertwined , we are facing a breakdown in the worlds food and financial systems at the same time . <p> The Wall Street bailouts may or may not stabilize financial markets in the short run , but will do nothing to address the root causes of the current crisis , nor will they stave off the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both food and financial markets . We need strong oversight on large traders and financial services , and increased support to local economies , small farmers , local banks , and small borrowers . Most of all , we need a dramatic departure from the free-market fundamentalism that brought us here in the first place . <h> Solving the food crisis " fixing the food system <p> The official prescriptions for solving the world food crisis call for more of the same policies that caused the crisis in the first place : e.g. , more subsidies , greater reliance on food aid , more free trade , and more Green Revolutions ( now read : gene revolutions ) . Expecting the institutions that built the current food system to solve the food crisis is like asking an arsonist to put out a forest fire . More corporate welfare , more free trade , and more technological " fixes " are good news for an industrial agri-foods complex seeking to prolong windfall profits and further consolidate monopoly power , but it will do nothing to re-structure our environmentally vulnerable and economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis we need to fix the food system . That entails re-regulating the market , reducing the oligopolistic power of the agri-foods corporations , and building agro-ecologically resilient family agriculture . We need to make food affordable by turning the food system into an engine for local economic development in both rural and urban areas . These tasks are not mutually exclusive " we do n't  have to wait to fix the food system before making food affordable , marketing fair , or farming viable . In fact , the three need to work in concert , complementing each other . <h> Localize food power ! <p> 1 ) Support domestic food production internationally based on social , ecological , and economic justice and the right to healthy food . <p> We need to re-negotiate Free Trade Agreements and remove agriculture from the WTO . The World Food Program should purchase food locally at fair prices and distribute food to those in need ; such practices would avoid " dumping " of cheap grains and feed more people . In the United States , food policy councils can localize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be improved to ensure adequate access to fresh , healthy food . Food banks should be supported to source fresh , healthy food from local farmers and through state-level commodities programs . Support independent community-based food businesses at home and abroad . <p> 2 ) Stabilize and guarantee fair prices to farmers , workers , and consumers by re-establishing floor prices and publicly-owned national grain reserves at home and abroad . <p> Create living wages and demand full workers rights for farm workers , food processing workers , and food service workers so that everyone can afford healthy food . <p> 3 ) Halt agrofuels expansion . <p> Suspend international agrofuels trade and investment . Maintain current tariffs on all agrofuels imports to the United States to curb expansion of agrofuels imports that threaten the food supplies of developing countries , as well as the dwindling reserves of the worlds biodiversity . Halt any expansion of government-supported biofuels programs and immediately revise all renewable fuels mandates , tax incentives , and other subsidies . Any support for domestic production of bioenergy must at least ensure : communities right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of greenhouse gases ; local ownership of bio-refineries by farmers and other community members ; fair prices for farmers and a living wage and humane treatment of farm workers and other laborers ; incentives for regional and ecologically appropriate feedstocks that enhance biodiversity ; and a substantial improvement in environmental quality and the maintenance of existing conservation programs . <p> The call for an agrofuels moratorium in Europe has forced European Commission officials to acknowledge the dangers of agrofuels expansion , leading to a re-evaluation of Europes own agrofuels mandates . A coalition of progressive environmental and social justice groups in the United States recently launched a global call for a U.S. Moratorium on agrofuels ( See : http : **38;29;TOOLONG . ) <p> 4 ) Re-regulate finance sector investment in food commodities . <p> Institutional investors have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into the commodities futures markets , driving up food and energy prices to historic levels . Even though prices have dropped in recent weeks , regulatory loopholes still remain ready to introduce extreme market volatility , political instability , and much human suffering . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commodities Futures Trading Commission must use its authority to curb excessive speculation in commodities futures and r e-establish strict position limits on speculators ( which were successful until removed by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 ) . We must r egulate and bring transparency to all trading . We can also removing damaging speculative influence on commodities prices by prohibiting participation in commodities markets by those who do not produce , manufacture , or take physical delivery of the commodities . We must create a solidarity economy that puts compassion and care for one another ahead of short-term profits , in the United States and around the world . <p> 5 ) Promote a return to smallholder farming . <p> On a pound-per-acre basis , extensive research shows that small family farms are more productive than large-scale industrial farms . And they use less oil , especially if food is traded locally or sub-regionally . Further , because three-quarters of the worlds poor are small farmers , investing in smallholder agriculture will address both poverty and hunger . According to Henry Saragih , coordinator of the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food economies will require immediate and long-term political commitments from governments . An absolute priority has to be given to domestic food production in order to decrease dependency on the international market . Peasants and small farmers should be encouraged through better prices for their farm products and stable markets to produce food for themselves and their communities . Landless families from rural and urban areas have to get access to land , seeds , and water to produce their own food . This means increased investment in peasant and farmer-based food production for domestic markets . <p> 6 ) Support Agro-ecological and locally-based approaches to food production and food system management . <p> The International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology ( IAASTD ) recently released the results of an exhaustive four-year international consultation with over 400 scientists . The IAASTD calls for an overhaul of agriculture dominated by multinational companies and governed by unfair trade rules . The report warns against relying on genetically engineered " fixes " for food production and emphasizes the importance of locally-based , agro-ecological approaches to farming . The key advantages " aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market surplus , it provides both food and income to the worlds poor . Contrary to conventional wisdom , agro-ecological farms , growing throughout the world , are highly productive and " according to a path-breaking study from the University of Michigan " can easily provide us with all the food we need . As industrialized farming and free trade regimes fail us , these approaches will be the keys for building resilience back into a dysfunctional global food system . <p> 7 ) Food sovereignty : democratize the food system ! <p> Food sovereignty is the right of all people to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods , and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems . At the heart of these concepts is the belief that we need to democratize our food system in order to ensure equity and sustainability . The democratization of our food systems requires a social change in the way we manage food . We must reduce the political influence of the industrial agri-foods complex and strengthen antitrust laws and enforcement . These changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to establish a regulatory context for sustainable and equitable food systems . These changes also depend on the degree of political will on the part of business , our legislators , and our communities . Political will results from social pressure from informed social movements . These movements already exist , and are gaining strength in the face of the food crisis . Join and support organizations campaigning for fair food system policies ; write letters and make calls to your elected officials ; and ask questions of presidential and congressional candidates about hunger and poverty in the United States and abroad and what they intend to do about it . <p> Together we can fix the food system and solve the food crisis once and for all .

The banks , seeking investments for their new funds , made loans to developing countries , often without appropriately evaluating the loan requests or monitoring how the loans were used . <p> Photo : WFP/N .

Meanwhile , the United States adopted extremely tight monetary policies to reduce inflation , producing a domestic recession . The combined impact of the rising price of fuel and rising interest rates led to a worldwide recession . <p> Developing countries were hurt the most . Their exports declined as the domestic cost of production rose and the major importers reduced their purchase of goods from overseas . Latin American governments , which had taken out loans from commercial banks at floating interest , ( rates that vary according to the current market interest rate ) saw the interest on their debt skyrocket .

When Mexico finally announced that it could not pay its foreign debt , the international financial system appeared on the brink of collapse . The world 's major creditors acted to save the commercial banks and the world economy . <p> Impact in the South <p> The existence of debt has both social and financial costs . <p> Heavily indebted poor countries have higher rates of infant mortality , disease , illiteracy , and malnutrition than other countries in the developing world , according to the UN Development Program ( UNDP ) . <p> Six out of seven heavily indebted poor countries in Africa pay more in debt service ( i.e. , interest and principal repayments ) than the total amount of money needed to achieve major progress against malnutrition , preventable disease , illiteracy , and child mortality before the year 2000 . If governments invested in human development rather than debt repayments , an estimated 3 million children would live beyond their fifth birthday and a million cases of malnutrition would be avoided . The UNDP estimates that sub-Saharan African governments transfer to Northern creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ( Human Development Report , 1997 ) . On the financial side , heavy indebtedness is a signal to the world financial community that the country is an investment risk , that it is unwilling or unable to pay its debt . As a result , impoverished countries are either cut off from the international financial markets or pay more for credit . The UNDP estimates that in the 1980s , the interest rates for poor countries were four times higher than for the rich countries due to inferior credit ratings and the expectation of national currency depreciations . Another cost of debt is the absence of infrastructure such as roads , schools , or health facilities that could both fight poverty and create the conditions for more economic growth . A different type of cost is associated with the time civil servants spend negotiating debt repayments .

Many poor developing countries face major problems in addition to high levels of debt , such as drought , reconstruction after natural disasters , and internal and external conflict . <p> SAPs are designed to : I ) Stabilize faltering economies by reducing inflation and correcting the balance of payments ; and , 2 ) Increase growth by making economies more productive and efficient and by opening them to market forces . <p> Major elements in structural adjustment programs typically include : <p> Raising taxes to increase government revenue and balance the budget <p> Eliminating price and interest rate controls <p> Reducing the size and scope of government and privatizing state-owned enterprises <p> Reducing tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade <p> Reducing regulations on businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although SAPs may help a country become more competitive in the global arena , they can severely harm the poor .

Deregulation of labor markets can result in situations where workers can not exercise their rights and local entrepreneurs and multinational corporations maximize their profits by operating sweatshops .

These agreements concluded understandings emanating out of the Uruguay Round of negotiations held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) but went considerably farther in establishing a new organization with new powers , the WTO . <p> The GATT is a series of multilateral treaties embodying the results of seven rounds of negotiations agreeing to progressive tariff reductions that have taken place since 1947 , culminating most recently in the Uruguay Round . The successor to this series of trade treaties , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) includes 134 member countries that have agreed to certain basic rules and tariffs to govern their mutual trade in goods and services .

In spite of its looser framework there was considerable pressure to accept GATT panel rulings in order to maintain the force of treaties and agreements that were thought to be beneficial overall . <p> The GATT is generally credited with liberalizing world trade , which has grown enormously since its inception , and helping to underpin the postwar prosperity , at least in the industrialized countries .

Many , including some groups in successful plaintiff countries , feel that these rulings were not well grounded , favor trade at the expense of labor , consumer and environmental protection and have undermined national sovereignty or present the risk of so doing . Defenders of the WTO , including many producers trying to sell their product under fair rules of competition , would argue that the rulings represent a sound , science based regulation of international trade in a world becoming smaller and increasingly interrelated . <p> The method of deliberation of WTO dispute panels , where differences on these and other measures are heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions are written not oral--are thought by some to be excessively secretive , leave little room for the airing of differing points of view , to exclude third party interest in the dispute 's resolution and to overly favor trade at the expense of all other considerations .

The exclusion of precedent from national laws , intent expressed in other multilateral treaties as those on environmental protection , popular expression and cultural tradition , as well as the narrow interpretation of scientific findings as they relate to human and environmental risk from food and drugs and the exclusion of most labor and environmental considerations which relate to production rather than trade , have made the panel determinations unsatisfactorily narrow to many and raised a maelstrom of criticism in Seattle and beyond . <p> WTO panel decisions asking the United States to revise the " CAF+ " standards , mandating emission levels on cars after challenge by the Europeans , as well as a ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after challenge by Venezuela , have been thought to be particularly detrimental to environmental standards in the United States . Panel decisions requiring Europeans to accept artificial hormones in imported beef have caused particular concern to consumers there . The Japanese have been particularly troubled by rulings ordering them to narrow their import and phytosanitary regulations for certain fruits and nuts as they fear infestation by codling moths from which Japan is now free . The list of WTO panel rulings that are stridently objected to is long ! <p> How Will the WTO Affect Hunger ? <p> The agreement signed at Marrakech , Morocco , creating the World Trade Organization and accepting the agreements on tariffs and trade reached during the Uruguay Round of negotiations , recognized the difficulties developing countries might face in acceding to a more liberalized trade regime under the WTO . A declaration of intent was signed at Marrakech by the developed countries , agreeing to examine the situation regarding trade among developed and developing countries , in view of addressing any deterioration in terms of trade or well being of the developing countries more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the WTO on developing countries was reaffirmed at the 1996 Ministerial meeting . WTO members agreed to : <p> So far few permanent steps have been taken to implement the declaration regarding developing countries . While food aid has increased , this has more to do with short term surpluses in the developed countries than enhanced commitments called for in the declaration . General assistance levels and especially agricultural assistance continue to decline . <p> The Uruguay Round brought agriculture under the jurisdiction of the GATT/WTO for the first time . Tarification of agricultural quotas --the replacement of quotas with tariffs , agreement to lower tariffs progressively , and reduction in aggregate measures of support were some of the principal trade measures , along with the accompanying rules on acceptable health and phytosanitary measures ( SPS ) and intellectual property rights ( TRIPS ) . See box . <p> Tarification measures were generally favorable to developing countries , which were allowed to set their tariffs at unchallenged levels for entry into the WTO . Reduction in aggregate measures of support ( AMS ) are also thought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplements to farmers but call for reductions in other types of price supports and subsidies , including export subsidies with which most developing countries are ill equipped to compete . Schedules for AMS reduction and levels of reduction were also given favorable treatment when compared to developed countries . ( For importing developing countries , however , the loss of export subsidies on potential imports could result in higher food prices ) . <p> Most experts predicted that the reduction of subsidies agreed to under the Uruguay Round would lead to higher agricultural and food prices , hence the Marrakech concern for enhanced food aid levels and import financing . They reasoned that production costs previously absorbed by governments and consumers through taxes , would shift to being passed along through rising prices . This has not been the case . Even after several years of substantial subsidy reduction , agricultural prices are at historic lows in real terms . No one , of course , can say what prices would have been without the change in subsidies . The analysis of the effects of WTO measures , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand have remained high as processing costs have continued to grow . World hunger has also grown over the past several years due more to the lack of jobs and low income levels in many countries , coupled with inadequate safety nets in others . These social and economic phenomena , more than the price of food , explain hunger in the midst of plenty . <p> What Can We Expect ? <p> A new round of negotiations was to be scheduled over the next three years . Although temporarily shelved there is already talk of resuscitating a new round . While disagreements on agriculture ( U.S. and Cairns Group see box vs . EU and Japan ) , dumping ( U.S. and EU vs . Japan ) , environment ( U.S. vs . EU and both vs. developing countries ) and labor rights ( industrialized vs. developing ) are stark , there is much pressure to continue to make progress on trade . World trade is increasing due to a growing world population and advances in transportation , communications and industry . Facilitating trade is generally thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better access to goods , although it inevitably leads to lower wages and job displacement for some . This conviction about the beneficial effects of trade by business leaders and governing classes in the developed and developing world will likely result in agreement for another round within the next two years . Previous trade rounds , seven since 1947 , have been progressively longer in recent years . Any current round may well take more than the three years talked about as a tentative schedule , given the complexity of many of the issues . Since procedurally a decision will probably be taken to hold-off any final agreement until agreements are reached on all topics scheduled for talks , a new round may realistically take until well into the new millennium before concrete changes to trade rules are made . Freer trade in health and education services is already on any future agenda as well as significant issues of further reduction in agricultural protection . How regional trade agreements will be integrated into the WTO is another important subject , for it will affect both potential accession agreements to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural subsidies and anti-dumping measures a compromise seems attainable which would allow talks to go forward along the lines of previous agreements . The United States has affirmed publicly that it will support negotiation of stronger environmental and labor covenants , new areas for the WTO and both of which represent extremely complex technical and political issues . With agreement of the EU they will probably in the end be able to override any objections the developing countries have that this would result in excessive interference in national prerogatives . Enforcement will remain an important caveat for any environmental or labor agreements . As national sovereignty has been a major issue in the developed as well as developing world , yielding inspection and enforcement functions to the WTO or another neutral , non-national body will present issues that may be insurmountable . A strong agreement with weak inspection and enforcement provisions would be a not unlikely outcome . Even such an agreement could lead to change as people begin to challenge assumptions that previously went unquestioned and the issues of development , fair labor standards and environmental protection are understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMS - Aggregate Measures of Support . Refers to the totality of national support for agriculture including price supports , export subsidies , deficiency payments , income support , research etc .

Other agricultural subsidies or support measures were as the result of Uruguay Round agreements scheduled for progressive reduction . <p> Cairns Group . Group of countries with major agricultural production and export interests which have joined together as an informal negotiating block at the Uruguay Round and for upcoming talks . The Cairns Group includes : Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , Chile Colombia , Fiji , Indonesia , Malaysia , New Zealand , Paraguay , the Philippines , South Africa , Thailand and Uruguay . <p> Codex Alimentaris .

Working group set up to study the relationship of trade to sustainable development and the environment and to report to the bi-annual Ministerial meeting .

No recommendations have been forthcoming and the level of U.S. participation has been criticized by some of these groups . <p> GATT - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Accumulated trade agreements over 40 years incorporated into the WTO . <p> GATS - General Agreement on Trade In Services .

As measured by income per capita. 48 developing countries are considered LLDCs of which 29 are WTO members and 6 more are in the process of accession to the WTO . <p> MEA - Multilateral Environmental Agreements . A number of international agreements on the environment as the Kyoto protocol or the Biodiversity Treaty include provisions that affect the use of natural resources in production ( air pollution , land conservation , etc. ) or the protection of species from production processes ( drag-net fishing , destruction of habitats , etc ) . These signed and ratified treaties have come in conflict with WTO rulings . These treaties also have provisions for trade sanctions for violators of treaty provisions which conflict with WTO rules prohibiting unauthorized restrictions on trade . International legal principles according precedence to the most recent international treaty or agreement when followed to their conclusion , as currently interpreted by the WTO , would have the possible effect of undermining environmental agreements which have international sanction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledging to exchange information on product standards . A troublesome aspect of the MRA 's has been whether their approval status remains solely with the executive branch or as with a treaty resides in Congress . MRA 's once implemented have also been thought to set up minimum WTO standards under principles of mutual recognition of product standards , going perhaps beyond their original intent . <p> NFIDCs - Net Food Importing Developing Countries . Includes 18 developing countries . The official WTO definition includes four small net food exporters ( Sri Lanka , Honduras , Kenya and Mauritius ) because they are major cereal importers . <p> PPM - Non-product related production measures . These refer to environmental pollution , child labor , and other conditions of production of a product related more to the process by which it is produced than to the product itself . WTO rules are generally construed to have little jurisdiction over PPM 's . This has been a source of concern to environmentalists and labor unions that feel that opening trade could lead to an increase in abusive production practices . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent round of negotiations . <p> SPS - Sanitary and Phytosanitary Regulations . Refers to food and drug regulations . These are left in principle to the WTO member states to determine within certain requirements . However , when exceeding standards laid out in the " codex alimentaris " ( food ) or more generally for drugs , national regulations must meet certain conditions . The same SPS must be applied nationally as for imported products , must cause the least trade disruption consistent with its purpose and must be based on a scientific assessment of risk . WTO rulings concerning SPS measures have been widely criticized by consumer groups as being excessively in favor of trade promotion and consequently insufficiently sensitive to health risks . The codex itself is criticized by consumer groups as being excessively influenced by industry and minimalist for certain products . Difficulties in assessing national measures arise because of the imprecision and complexity of scientific analysis of risk and what consumers have interpreted as a WTO requirement to prove the likelihood of harm rather than accept an inference of potential harm . <p> Tarification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quotas or variable levies , to tariffs . Tarification levels by product were agreed to under the Uruguay Round for all agricultural products as well as scheduled reductions in these same tariffs . Developing countries were allowed to set their own tariffs for previously restricted products without contest . Reductions will be negotiated in this round . Tariff levels for some previously untraded products were set quite high . <p> TRIMS - Trade Related Investment Measures . Agreed to at the Uruguay Round the TRIMS Agreement governing foreign investment requires rules governing foreign investment to be consistent with those for domestic investment . A broader investment treaty promulgated under the auspices of the OECD after the Uruguay Round was tabled after an unprecedented internet campaign by consumer and environmental groups aligning themselves with developing countries . <p> TRIPS - Trade Related Aspects Of Intellectual Property Rights . This agreement , which resulted from the Uruguay Round , requires all WTO members to sign , pledging to protect and honor property rights ( patents , copyright , etc ) through their domestic legislation . Developing countries have 10 - 15 years to phase in full compliance with TRIPS . 
@@75400124 @4100124/ <p> The Right to Adequate Food is a fundamental human right firmly established in international law . This right flows from the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) of 1966 . The Right to Adequate Food has been reaffirmed in many pronouncements of the international community over the last 50 years . It is the UDHR which clarifies that the realization of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social is needed to guarantee a life in dignity for all members of the human family . A life in food , clothing , housing " ( Article 25 , UDHR ) . <p> The commitment of states to the indivisibility of all human rights has been renewed with the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights of 1993 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and within them the Right to Adequate Food have also been supported and strengthened by the series of international conferences in this decade : the Copenhagen Declaration and Program of Action of the World Summit for Social Development of 1995 , the Beijing Conference on Women of 1995 , and the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action of 1996 . All these documents come to similar conclusions with respect to implementing the Right to Adequate Food : societies today possess sufficient resources , organizational capability and technology hence the capacity to achieve this objective . It is this assessment , and the renewed commitment of governments , that has led non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and social movements to increasingly make use of the right to food approach . <p> The use of the rights approach to hunger and malnutrition by NGO and social movements has also increased considerably in recent years , because ESC rights generally have been recognized more precisely than in many decades before ( although they have also been neglected by states in their human rights work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the national and international level , ESC rights have been discriminated against , relative to political and social rights . <p> A more precise legal interpretation of ESC rights , which started with the installment of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1987 , better support by the international law community , and a new commitment by states to implementation of ESC rights after the end of the Cold War , have all helped to change the situation considerably in the last years . Much remains to be done nationally and internationally to end the neglect of ESC rights , but it is now recognized that the indivisibility of all human rights is high on the agenda . <p> The Rome Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted by the World Food Summit ( WFS ) offer a milestone opportunity for a much better implementation of the right to food . <p> The WFS final documents are outspoken in placing the right to food at the very top of the international agenda . The documents contain a strong commitment to the right to food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established as a fundamental human right in international law . In addition , the documents emphasize the need to further elaborate the Right to Food in order to facilitate its implementation . Commitment 7 , objective 7.4 of the Plan of Action invites the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , in consultation with relevant treaty bodies , and in collaboration with relevant specialized agencies and programs of the UN system and appropriate intergovernmental mechanisms , to better define the rights related to food in Article 11 of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and " to propose ways to implement and realize these rights as a means of achieving the commitments and objectives of the World Food Summit , taking into account the possibility of formulating voluntary guidelines for food security for all . " <p> NGO action in the follow-up to the World Food Summit has taken this objective very seriously . Many NGOs are well aware that working for the right to food means a constant effort to explain the basic concept of ESC rights and requires an ongoing process of " unlearning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil and political rights , as well as unlearning reductionist concepts of food security , which focus mostly on agricultural production and productivity . <p> Realizing Objective 7.4 of the Plan of Action : NGO Action Toward New International Instruments for the Implementation of the Right to Adequate Food <p> The leading states behind the acceptance of the aims in objective 7.4 in the texts of Rome were the Latin American states ( most notably Chile and Venezuela ) , who had been very dissatisfied with the initial version of the texts in early 1996 . In June , 1996 the Latin American states decided at their preparatory conference in Asunci+n , Paraguay that the WFS Plan of Action should contain the idea of developing a Code of Conduct on the Right to Adequate Food , once the conference was over . This was done so that the respective references in the text would become more than non-binding programmatic statements . <p> In July , 1996 the government of Venezuela co-sponsored an expert conference in Caracas in order to discuss the possible content of such a code . The experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN organizations , international lawyers , and FoodFirst Information and Action Network ( FIAN ) and World Alliance on Nutrition and Human Rights ( WANAHR ) as NGOs . The report of this conference was made available to WFS delegations in Rome . <p> The final text does not literally refer to a code of conduct , but fixes under objective 7.4 three concrete aims for an improved implementation of the right to food . Under the guidance of the UN High Commissioner , and in cooperation with the UN Food and Agricultural Organization , the following goals are to be achieved : 1 ) a strict legal clarification of the content of the right to food , 2 ) the development of new instruments on improved implementation of the right to food , and 3 ) the formulation of additional " voluntary guidelines " to promote this implementation . <p> The idea of a code of conduct on the right to food was embraced by regional and international NGOs and became one of their main lobby aims for the Rome summit . There are two functions of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the Code of Conduct will reduce the existing weaknesses in the human rights instruments recognizing the right to adequate food . One of these weaknesses is the lack of a precise description both of its legal content and the corresponding states obligations in the Covenant on Economic , Social , and Cultural Rights . Second , there are legal gaps with respect to the impact of intergovernmental policies ( e.g. , the structural adjustment programs of World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) ) , or of private actors ( e.g. , transnational corporations ) on the right to adequate food . Both aims could be approached in a first step by formulating a Code of Conduct on the Right to Food . The Code of Conduct was therefore put up in Rome as one of two key demands by the plenary of the parallel NGO summit . In their final political statement , " Profit for Few or Food for All . Food Sovereignty and Security to Eliminate the Globalization of Hunger , " the NGOs in Rome concluded under point 6 : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that food sovereignty takes precedence over macro-economic policies and trade liberalisation . " <p> 6.3 " Negotiations should be carried out to develop more effective instruments to implement the right to food . These instruments should include : A Code of Conduct to govern the activities of those involved in achieving the Right to Food including national and international institutions as well as private actors , such as multinational corporations . . " <p> A few NGOs were directed by the NGO Forum to formulate such a code of conduct during 1997 and to have it discussed in an international NGO conference . A draft Code of Conduct of the NGOs has been available since the end of September , 1997 . FIAN International and the World Alliance on Nutrition and Human Rights coordinated this draft , together with the Institut Jacques Maritain Internationale from Rome . In early May , 1997 , more than 30 NGO representatives of international networks from all continents had assembled in Geneva in order to discuss the first draft . The venue was made available in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made it more precise . Several NGOs participated in the final editing . NGOs , as many as possible , are asked to endorse the idea of the Code . <p> The Code of Conduct as a Tool for Actors in the Civil Society <p> The objective of this process is to place the proposal of the Code of Conduct on the agendas of the Human Rights Commission ( HRC ) and the FAO Committee on Food Security ( CFS ) . The NGOs behind this initiative have developed a two-pronged strategy for such a campaign : <p> An International Instrument shall be adopted by the states drawing on The International Code of Conduct on the Human Right to Adequate Food . The mandate for the preparation of such an instrument was given by the World Food Summit to the High Commissioner for Human Rights . Such a new International Instrument must therefore be adopted by the Commission on Human Rights ( CHR ) and subsequently by the Economic and Social Council of the UN . Due to the fact that improving the right to food was identified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World Food Summit results in general , it is also important to get the support of the CFS for the adoption of such an international instrument . The support of states for the development of an international instrument drawing on the International Code of Conduct on the Human Right to Adequate Food can only be gained if the promotion and lobby work is done not only at the international level , but also at the national level . The states need to be confronted with the challenge of implementing the right to food and WFS objective 7.4 by their national civil society , including NGOs and social movements . <p> The Code of Conduct can be used , at the same time , as a tool for strengthening the understanding and implementation of the right to adequate food at the national level . It can be used as an education instrument : <p> a ) for opening up a debate and a process with their own government , on how to implement better the right to adequate food at the national level . It can be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative regulations and behavior , etc. ; <p> b ) for opening a debate between NGOs and inside the civil society about the right to adequate food . It shall be used by national NGOs to inform other NGOs and social movements about the ESC Rights in general and the right to adequate food in particular . It can be utilized to show how human rights , and human rights procedures and advocacy , can be used at the national and international level to better implement the right to adequate food and nutrition . <p> According to the strategy decision , as many NGOs as possible are now asked to endorse the idea of the Code . In 1999 , an attempt was made by coordinated lobby work to place the proposal on the agendas of the FAO Committee on Food Security and the Human Rights Commission . In April , 1997 the FAO signed an agreement with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on cooperating in the follow up to the World Food Summit ( objective 7.4 ) .

@@75400130 @4100130/ <p> Overview The World Bank was established in 1946 to provide long-term assistance for economic development . It mobilizes funds contributed by member governments and raised in capital markets to lend to developing countries . <p> Although the World Bank is technically an agency of the United Nations system , in reality it is independent and has separate sources of finance . The World Bank provides loans while other UN agencies generally provide grants . <p> The World Bank is the worlds largest multilateral development agency . In 1996 , the World Bank made approximately 250 new loan commitments to low- and middle-income nations , for a total of $21.4 billion . By comparison , the U.S. Agency for International Development provided $5.8 billion in development and humanitarian assistance to such countries . <p> What is generally known as the World Bank consists of two institutions with different lending programs : the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , and the International Development Association ( IDA ) . The IBRD provides about two-thirds of total loans to middle-income countries at near-market interest rates . IDA provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . <p> The World Bank makes two types of loans : those for projects ranging from infrastructure , agriculture and industrial development , and health and educational services , and others for reform of economic policies , or " structural adjustment .

However , a 1996 World Bank internal evaluation found that poverty assessments are of poor quality , lack strategic recommendations , and are not adequately incorporated into policy and lending programs . <p> The International Development Association ( IDA ) was founded in 1960 to assist the poorest developing countries which could not afford to borrow capital at market rates . The 79 countries which receive IDA funds , including 41 in Sub-Saharan Africa , are home to 80 percent of the worlds people living in absolute poverty . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest over 40 years . IDA lends mainly to countries that have a per capita income of less than US$905 . The average income of IDA borrowers is less than $400 per year . <p> Of the World Banks $21.4 billion in fiscal 1996 loan commitments , $6.9 billion was through IDA . <p> IDA is funded largely by contributions from approximately 30 richer countries which are members of the World Bank . Every three years donors are asked to replenish IDA funds . <p> IDA is now the single largest source of donor funds for basic social services in the poorest countries . In fiscal 1996 , $1.48 billion , or 21 percent of IDA funds , was spent on education , population , health and nutrition , water supply and sanitation , and social protection . This is three times the fiscal 1989 level . <p> Debt and Structural Adjustment In fiscal years 1994-96 , 25 percent of World Bank lending supported economic reform , or " structural adjustment " programs ( SAPs ) . These loans are made on the basis of progress toward free-market economic reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward structural adjustment , with some African countries adjustment shares as high as 90 percent . <p> The World Bank and other international financial institutions insist that borrowing governments service their debts first , before any other creditors are repaid . <p> As the major lender to poor countries , the World Bank is one of poor countries biggest creditors . In 1994 , for every $3 lent to poor countries through IDA , $2 was repaid to the World Bank in debt service . <p> Decision-Making Structure <p> The World Bank has 180 member governments . In contrast to the UNs one-nation , one-vote decision-making , power in the World Bank is related to a countrys financial contribution , or " shares .

The Road to Hell , by Michael Maren , a former relief worker turned journalist , takes the hardest look yet at how NGOs and the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) design and conduct relief and development projects . Like its predecessors Graham Hancocks Lords of Poverty in 1989 , Francis Moore Lappe in the 1970s and the Paddock Brothers in the 1960s , Marens book provides useful insights into the most serious failings of the aid system , yet neglects to give any credit where credit is due . <p> The book also offers an enlightening case study of frustrated aid efforts in Somalia from the 1979 crisis with Ethiopia through the famine of 1991-93 . The presentation is replete with original quotes and first-hand observations , drawn from Marens NGO and USAID assignments in Somalia and Kenya . It is his longer historical sense , beyond any one crisis or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Marens central criticism of the aid business is its insincerity . This insincerity , he argues , alienates aid workers themselves and reinforces an ongoing myopia about how best to adapt foreign aid . <p> In Marens analysis , the trust between NGOs and the American public is betrayed because NGOs do not reveal to the American public how problematic aid work is . In their advertising , the goal is not to make us think about hunger and poverty . It is to relieve us of the burden of having to think about it . <p> By use of behind-the-scenes vignettes of NGO staff working for Save the Children , CARE , USAID and other agencies heavily involved in Somalia , Maren suggests that the aid community is more concerned with fund-raising and image than in beneficial impact .

" He recounts the tendency of some NGOs to jetting into a crisis to be part of the spectacle of compassion , and then leaving swiftly , along with the TV cameras . <p> Alternately , NGOs frequently blunder in their sincere efforts to help : Maren recounts how one NGO airlifted into Goma over 250 doctors and nurses who had none of the skills that were really needed . <p> Marens harshest criticism is toward those bureaucrats in the aid system who wield authority without humility and who pretend to be wiser than they are . Referring to one U.S. Ambassador to Somalia : " He had the useful skill of projecting an enigmatic half smile whenever confronted with questions he did n't  want to or more likely couldnt answer . Most of the assembled press corps interpreted this as a sign of higher knowledge . " <p> Somalia provides Maren an excellent , though extreme , case for long lists of " unintended consequences " of foreign aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create and bolster the corrupt regime of President Siad Barre . Later , the United States inadvertently resurrected General Aydeed : his tribesmen joined forces only when Aydeed focused their attention on the common U.S. enemy . Ironically , while U.S. troops sought futilely to rid Somalia of him , each bloody confrontation raised his profile farther . <p> According to Maren , it was the inept conduct of aid in the 1980s that led to famine in Somalia in 1991 and 1992 . Maren is on strong ground when he makes the case that supply-driven dumping of commodities in the 1980s led to Somalias vulnerability to crisis in the 1990s . The humanitarian aid system was able to provide Somalia with plenty of food aid when it was n't needed , but then unable to provide it when it was needed during the critical period of December , 1991 through September , 1992 . <p> Though acknowledging that the aid effort saved over 100,000 lives , Maren indicates that now little evidence remains of the U.S. intervention , and little trace of the $4 billion that was spent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , Maren shows keen insights into the dynamics of crises . Reviewing the forced relocation of famine-affected populations in northern Ethiopia , Maren writes , " The government had launched a cynical campaign : First you starve them , then attract them to central areas with food , then cart them off to where you want them . That had been the governments plan , carried out with the assistance , unwitting sometimes , of local foreign charities using monies donated by schoolchildren and old ladies and working-class families in church . <p> Most of the recent literature on Somalia has attempted to interpret why international intervention failed . Mohamed Sahnouns focus on the tentative , ponderous , inflexible way the UN reacted ( Mohamed Sahnoun , 1994 , Somalia : the Missed Opportunities , Washington , D.C. : U.S. Institute of Peace ) . Jonathan Stevensons 1995 Losing Mogadishu : Testing U.S. Policy in Somalia ( Annapolis , MD : Naval Institute Press ) focuses instead on the particular role of the U.S. military and its alternately cautious and aggressive rules of engagement . Marens book goes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somalis receiving aid . The Road to Hell depicts Somali leaders who , more often than not , are part of the relief system , either as employee or refugee leader . However , Marens book does not venture into the broader countryside and explore the extent of risk or need in the population . Maren generalizes from a few examples to indict the entire aid effort . By extension , it is also difficult to generalize about aid in general , based only on Somalia , which remains an extreme case of local manipulation of aid . <p> For all its insights , Marens book is misleading in the extreme in the overall picture it leaves about the community of aid professionals . Most unfairly , Maren conveys a view ( which he certainly does n't  believe ) that aid workers are unaware themselves of these many pitfalls and tradeoffs that Maren recounts . Maren implies that only he and a select group are concerned about dependency , overpopulation , unsustainability , political manipulation of aid and the many myths about the Third World cherished by the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that current aid workers keep trying to put forward solutions , not give up , and write critiques that cater to the foreign policy isolationists who prefer to believe that all aid is without long-term benefit . <p> Curiously , Maren concludes that NGOs can not be trusted to monitor themselves , and are best evaluated by journalists . Since few journalists have any of the technical expertise necessary to interpret project data , epidemiologic trends , or economic effects , Maren is encouraging more of the simplification that already exists . <p> Hansch is a member of the Hunger Notes editorial board , is affiliated with the Congressional Hunger Center , and has written extensively on refugee nutrition and health issues . 
@@75400135 @4100135/ <p> ( November 11 , 2004 ) For as long as the world has known it , malnutrition has been associated with hunger , conjuring up images of gaunt and prematurely aged children and adults . In 2004 , malnutrition is still very much with us , and it is taking on a new form as well . <p> To be sure , there are still far too many hungry and underfed people--1.1 billion at last count . But over one billion people are now overweight and obese . <p> Perhaps most surprisingly , these are n't all cheeseburger-eating Westerners . Most are Asians , Pacific islanders , and Latin Americans , in particular urban women , living in developing countries . Usually poor , they are succumbing in alarming numbers to the misleadingly named " diseases of affluence " --obesity , heart disease , cancer , and diabetes--that arise from changing diets , lifestyles , and economies . <p> Chronic non-communicable diseases now cause close to 60 percent of all deaths worldwide . Surprisingly , nearly 80 percent of these deaths occur in developing countries . <p> Overweightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing face of malnutrition in developing countries , increase the chances of a person falling prey to the other non-communicable diseases . ( Overweight here refers to a body mass index BMI of 25 or more and obese to a BMI of 30 or more . BMI is a weightheight relationship that indicates amount of body fat . ) <p> According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , obesity-related ailments afflict more than 115 million people in the developing world , up from essentially none two generations ago . By 2030 , these diseases as a group are projected to be the No. 1 killer of poor people around the world . <p> " We really are seeing the spread of a different form of malnutrition in the developing world and the globalization of chronic diseases due to the adoption of energy-dense high-calorie diets , high in fat and sugars , and Western-style work and social infrastructures , " says Neville Rigby , director of policy and public affairs at the International Obesity Taskforce , a London-based nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) that researches weight-related health issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited , the highest rates appear to be in the South Pacific . In Nauru , 70 percent of the population is classified as clinically obese , up from only 15 percent in the mid 1960s.The problem can not be defined regionally , though . Obesity affects 25 to 50 percent of the populations in countries as diverse as Kuwait , Colombia , the Philippines , and China . <p> " Even in the low-income , Sub-Saharan African countries with HIV and malnutrition dominating , there are still 10 to 15 percent of adults that are overweight , " says Barry Popkin , professor at the Nutrition School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . <p> Age is also no longer a safeguard . In much of North Africa and Latin America , one in five children aged 4 to 10 are overweight . While bad diets and obesity are most damaging to adults ( because they often lead to fatal illness ) , they have serious consequences for children as well . <p> Overweight children are more than twice as likely to have high blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to obesity , Type 2 diabetes , once known as adult-onset diabetes before it started afflicting so many children , puts kids at risk for a range of disorders , including blindness , nerve damage , kidney failure , and cardiovascular disease . <p> The Energy Equation <p> Nutritionists working in developing countries once thought that if people obtained enough energy in their diets , they would obtain enough minerals , vitamins , and other micronutrients . But that is clearly not the case . Malnutrition is not simply caused by a lack of food overall , but by a lack of high-quality foods such as whole grains , fiber , fruits , and vegetables . Diets can also be injurious to health if they contain an excess of components such as saturated fat , sodium , and added sugar . <p> " Sadly , it seems that we have somehow managed to bypass good health , moving from hunger to obesity in a single generation in many parts of the world , " says Marie Ruel , interim director of IFPRI 's Food Consumption and Nutrition Division . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases are reaching epidemic levels in countries that are still struggling to eliminate hunger and poverty , encumbering them with a double health burden . <p> In some cases , undernutrition and obesity can even be found under the same roof . The prevalence of households with both overweight and underweight members in Brazil , for example , stands at 11 percent . In Asia it ranges between 3 and 15 percent , with households typically containing an underweight child and an overweight , nonelderly adult . <p> This one-two health punch has the potential to cause an economic and human disaster in countries whose medical systems are woefully unprepared to deal with diseases requiring long-term care . <p> " What 's clear is that the developing world in particular is going to bear the enormous brunt of the adverse health impact of the world 's weight gain and they are n't  prepared for it , " says Rigby . <p> The Nutrition Transition <p> So , how did we reach this point ? <p> The reasons are manifold , starting with our genetic make-up and including global economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changes in the nature of work and leisure . Together it is what scientists refer to as the " nutrition transition , " a process that is accelerating rapidly . <p> People living in urban areas throughout the developing world are much further along in the transition than their rural counterparts . Comparatively sedentary jobs demand less physical energy than rural labor . And as more and more women work away from home , traditional patterns of food preparation are changing . Cities also offer a greater range of aggressively marketed calorie-rich food choices . The fact that more people are moving to cities makes the problem more pervasive . <p> Down on the farm , toil is also not always what it used to be as increased mechanization curbs energy expenditures . Many farmers are also opting now to grow a single , high-yielding cash crop instead of the multiple crops that supported their former subsistence livelihoods and that often provided a fairly balanced diet . <p> Another element of the nutrition transition is the increasing role of foods associated with industrialized countries . <p> As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have featured grains and vegetables are giving way to meals high in saturated fat and sugar . <p> To get an idea of how revolutionary this change is , consider the eating patterns in China . Less than two generations ago , dinner for most Chinese consisted of rationed rice or wheat and vegetables with a little bit of soy sauceand often coarse grains instead of rice or wheat if they were poor . Today , most meals include excessive vegetable oils , some meat or fish , eggs , and rice or wheat . While variety is a good thing , it can result in increased intakes of saturated fats , sugars and other potentially unhealthy food constituents , which become more damaging when combined with reduced physical activity . <p> " In China , the amount of oil being consumed now is high and the energy density has gone way up , " says Popkin , adding that it is usually the increased use of edible oils , not animal foods , that account for the first jump in a country 's caloric and fat intakes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dietary shifts . Humans prefer energy-dense foods , high in fat and sugar . From an evolutionary point of view , it 's how we adapted to help us endure times of famine . But only recently have such foods become so cheap and widely available to most of the world 's population , thanks to new technologies and liberalized international trade and investment . <p> And as food companies watch incomes rise in the developing world , they are setting their sights on new markets and heightening the desirability of energy-dense foods , not all of which may be healthy . <p> The Costs Of A Poor Diet <p> Thanks to the developed world 's struggles with diseases related to food consumption behavior , the health consequences of diets high in fat and sugar are well documented , ranging from increased risk of premature death to serious chronic conditions such as hypertension , stroke , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , and a host of other ailments . <p> Alongside these diseases ' ability to reduce the overall quality of life , they can also exact a large economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's development gains by diminishing people 's capacity to work and by diverting scarce resources to healthcare . For nations whose economic and social resources are already stretched to the limit , widespread epidemics of non-communicable diseases could be disastrous . <p> In China , the economic cost of diet-related chronic diseases has already surpassed that of undernutrition a loss of more than 2 percent of GDP . <p> The economic costs of obesity have been estimated only for some Western countries . Although methodology varies , estimates place the cost of diagnosing and managing obesity at 2 to 8 percent of total expenditure on health care . The economic impact in developing countries is likely to be higher . <p> " If action is not taken , this group of diseases will swamp health services of poor countries at a time when they are still addressing infectious diseases , and reduce worker productivity that is so needed to lift people out of poverty , " says Derek Yach , professor of public health and head of Yale University 's Global Health Division and formerly WHO 's executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Shadow <p> Despite all that is at stake , obesity and related diseases continue to be overlooked as serious health problems in developing countries . Most policymakers in Asian countries and Pacific island states are still focusing exclusively on the problems of undernutrition , even when the costs of obesity are overwhelming the health care system . <p> There also needs to be more research into the nutrition transition , specifically on understanding how diets are changing among households and individuals in developing countries . <p> Addressing Dangerous Misconceptions <p> Among some policymakers and health officials , the misconception that obesity is a problem afflicting only affluent countries and households may be holding back needed research in poorer countries . <p> " Overall it seems that there has been a serious neglect of the public health aspects of nutrition/obesity , " says Yach , who calls for much greater investment in studies on causal relations between food intakes and disease and for large-scale community-based intervention studies to test " best-option " programs . <p> The lack of research to date has meant that policymakers do n't have the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increasing obesity and the rise of related chronic diseases or adequate guideposts on what might work in reversing these trends . <p> China , for example , which is facing the prospect of soon becoming the world leader in cardiovascular disease , would need to devise prevention programs for its own particular conditions , says Professor Chen Chunming from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention . " We need a country-specific strategy for China based on the current situation of the food industry and the food market and of people 's dietary patterns , which are different from elsewhere . " <p> The outline of what is needed is in place . Given the early successes of countries such as South Korea , Singapore , and Sweden , it is apparent that an integrated approach is needed that incorporates national food , agricultural , industrial , and healthcare policies , as well as the family , civic institutions , and the community . <p> The Task Ahead is Huge <p> " Right now this is clearly an underestimated challenge . Since it is lifestyle based and relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distribution , it will be most difficult to manage , " Popkin says . <p> As such , the key to managing the problem will involve making the right choices at the national , community , and individual levels . That will require , as always , relevant research , capacity building , and individual and political will . 
@@75400136 @4100136/ <p> Ideas have important consequences in real life . Ideas are the way human beings try to understand the world and address major challenges . This excellent article describes the ideas that have influenced African development , where they have come from , where they have gone to , and why . He discusses the ideas , where they came from , and their influence from the colonial period to post-independence rule , the onset of structural adjustment programs in the 1980s , and the new development discourse of **28;108;TOOLONG . Hunger Notes Introduction <p> From development to poverty reduction , sums up the trajectory of the development discourse in Africa over the last four decades since independence . This development marks significant shifts , not only in economic approaches and policies , but also in academic theories and political ideologies underpinning the discourse . In this article , my aim is to reflect on broad trends in the changing discourse unencumbered by details and empirical data . <p> I will organise my reflections around four aspects of the discourse : first the institutional and social agency of development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the theories underlying the discourse and , fourth , its politics . The contextual theme running through the discourse is Africas place and role in the global political economy and its relationship with the developed North , or , more correctly , the imperial factor . <p> Although my subject is not really the history of the development discourse , some periodisation is necessary to highlight the breaks and continuities in the ideas on development . The first two decades after independence , roughly the 1960s and 1970s , may be called the age of developmentalism . The next decade , that is the 1980s , has been characterised as Africas lost decade . This is the period which spawned various structural adjustment programmes or SAPs under the tutelage of the IMF and the World Bank . SAPs prepared the ground for and dovetailed into the next , or the current period , which may be characterised as the age of globalisation . <p> The Age of Developmentalism <p> The struggle for independence in Africa was first and foremost an assertion of the humanness of the African people after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colonialism . In the words of Tom Mboya , the struggle for independence was the rediscovery of Africa by Africans while Amilcar Cabral described it as the re-Africanisation of minds or rebecoming Africans . National development became the passion of politicians and the great expectation of the people . In the vision of the more articulate nationalist leaders like Julius Nyerere of Tanzania , the independent state had a double task , that of building the nation and developing the economy . The state in Africa , Nyerere argued , preceded the nation , rather than the other way round . Thus the national project was from the start , top-down , and statist . <p> The colonial economy and society were anything but national . In the scramble for Africa , the colonial powers had divided the continent into mini-countries where boundaries cut through cultural , ethnic and economic affinities . This was made worse by the policy of divide and rule , leaving behind uneven development in an extreme form . Some regions were more developed than others . Some ethnic groups were labelled martial , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour reservoirs ; some were characterised as " intelligent " and moderately entrepreneurial as opposed to the rest who were inherently indolent and lazy . All were of course uncivilized , uncultured , undisciplined pagans whose souls needed to be saved and whose skins needed to be thrashed . <p> The colonial economy was typically disarticulated , almost tailor-made , for exploitation by colonial capital , linked to the metropolitan trade and capital circuits . Extractive industries like mining predominated . Plantation agriculture existed side by side with subsistence peasant cultivation , all concentrating on one or a couple of crops for export according to the needs of the metropolitan economy . <p> Different colonial powers left behind different forms and traditions of public administration , culture , cuisine , dance and education , elementary as it was , all concentrated in towns . The urban and the rural were literally two countries within one ; one alien , modern , a metropolitan transplant barred to the native while the other stagnating and frozen in the so-called tradition or custom . But neither the modern nor the traditional were organically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent suffered as much destruction of its social fabric through foreign imperial domination as did Africa . I have traced these initial conditions on the eve of independence for two reasons . Firstly , to underline the fact that the nationalist project faced a formidable task on the morrow of independence . Secondly , to highlight an even more formidable reality , which was that the state that was supposed to carry out the twin tasks of nation-building and economic development was itself a colonial heritage . The colonial state was a despotic state , a metropolitan police and military outpost , in which powers were concentrated and centralized and where law was an unmediated instrument of force and where administrative fiat was more a rule , than the rule of law . <p> The nationalist vision thus called for a revolutionary transformation not only of the economy and society but also the state . A few nationalist visionaries attempted , but none succeeded . The post-independence international context was no more propitious than the colonial . Independence found Africa in the midst of Cold War and the rising imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national self-determination was " communism " , to be hounded and destroyed , by force if necessary , by manipulation and deception , if possible . The early story of the gruesome assassination of Patrice Lumumba and the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah , and the continuing story of military coups , assassinations , and resistance to national liberation wars and civil strife in Africa , in most of which imperialism had a hand , bear testimony to what the former colonial powers and the rising imperial power could do to retain their collective global hegemony . <p> These where then the initial conditions , so to speak , within which African nationalists had to realise their dream of nation-building and economic development and to answer their peoples great expectations . Invariably , the agency of change was the state since there was virtually no social class which could shoulder the task of national development . Nor was foreign capital obliging in spite of various protective laws and incentive schemes put in place by the African governments . <p> Invariably , nationalist politicians turned to the state . African governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marxists of various inclinations- all resorted to the state for their economic programmes . The post-independence economic programmes , contrary to the current propaganda from the West , were designed by the erstwhile World Bank . In effect it involved intensification of the monoculture agriculture for export ; some enclaves of import-substitution industrialization and throwing open of the extractive and resource based industries to transnational corporations . <p> The state had to be manned . The colonial bureaucracy was almost exclusively White at the top and immigrant in the middle . The education and health infrastructure had to be expanded , both for pragmatic as well as political reasons . Africanisation of the civil service could not be resisted nor could the basic welfare demands of the population . <p> Provision of basic services by the state as a matter of fact also served to legitimise the otherwise authoritarian rule of the political elite . The state bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds . Nationalism thus resolved itself into various ideologies of developmentalism . We should run while others walk , politicians declared . The academia was dominated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the traditional sector , rural , unproductive , backward , lacking entrepreneurial spirit and governed by ascription or the economy of affection . Development consisted in modernizing the traditional society . <p> The dominance of modernization paradigm was challenged by young academics coming out of post-independence universities . Where there was relatively a freer space , as in Tanzania of the 60s and 70s , intense debates raged between modernizers and radical nationalists calling themselves African socialists or Ujamaaists or Marxists . African progressives placed history of the development of underdevelopment and the role of imperialism as the process of worldwide accumulation , at the centre of their analysis and understanding . The traditional , they argued , was not quite traditional , nor the modern quite modern ; rather both belonged to the system of international capitalism which reproduced development in the metropoles and underdevelopment in the peripheries . Development therefore was not a process of changing pattern variables or looking for modernizing elites but rather a process of class struggle . <p> Meanwhile , the state became both the site of power struggles as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming their societies , were routed through military coups or assassinations . A few who survived compromised themselves and became compradors or tolerated imperial arrogance for pragmatic reasons . <p> Everywhere , politics became authoritarian , whether in the form of one-party states or outright military dictatorships . Liberal constitutional orders imposed by the departing colonial states did not survive as the underlying logic of the colonial despotic state reasserted itself . <p> State positions opened up opportunities for seeking rents . Conspicuous consumption at home , a little investment in unproductive activities to make quick profits and a lot of stashing of funds in foreign bank accounts was , and perhaps still is , the typical characteristic of this class . Thus very little serious domestic private accumulation took place . Whatever investment that did take place was public , by the state . <p> During the first one-and-half decade of independence the African economies showed modest growth rates ; modest in comparison to other continents but impressive given the initial conditions at the time of independence . Investment and savings ranged between 15 to 20 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tertiary education , which in many countries literally did not exist during colonial times , was introduced . Medical and health statistics also showed improvement . But this growth and development was unsustainable . It was predicated on the reinforcement of colonial foundations . <p> Growth in agriculture production was based on extensive cultivation rather than a rise in productivity through chemicalization , mechanization and irrigation . It depended heavily on exports of a few primary commodities traded on a hostile and adverse international market . The growth in the manufacturing industry was heavily of the import-substitution type with little internal linkages and dependent on import of intermediary inputs . Investment was largely public while domestic private capital was stashed away in foreign countries . One estimate has it that by 1990 , 37 per cent of Africas wealth had flown outside the continent . ( Mkandawire &amp; Soludo 1999:11 ) To top it all , foreign capital concentrated in extractive industries which simply hemorrhaged the economy rather than contribute to its development . <p> During this period , the developmental state also borrowed heavily whether for productive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 oil crisis were off-loaded in the form of cheap loans to developing countries . By the end of 1970s , cheap loans turned into heavy debt burdens . By this time , the limits of the early growth were also reached and the economic shocks of the late seventies plunged African economies into deep crisis . Numbers fell , growth rates became negative , debt repayments became unsustainable , fiscal imbalances went out of control , and so did inflation . Social services declined , infrastructure deteriorated and one after another African governments found themselves at the door of IMF and the Paris Club pleading for mercy . <p> The 1980s , described by economists as Africas lost decade , was also the transition decade which marked the beginning of the decline of developmentalism and the rise of neo-liberalism , euphemistically called , globalisation . <p> The crisis , the lost decade and the specter of marginalisation . In 1981 the World Bank published its notorious report , Accelerated development for Africa : an Agenda for Africa . It was certainly an agenda for Africa set by the erstwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had little to do with development , accelerated or otherwise . The report and the subsequent structural adjustment programmes concentrated on stabilization measures : getting rid of budget deficits , bringing down rates of inflation , getting prices right , unleashing the market and liberalising trade . According to the World Bank , the villain of the declining economic performance in Africa was the state , it was corrupt and dictatorial , it had no capacity to manage the economy and allocate resources rationally , it was bloated with bureaucracy , and nepotism was its mode of operation . The BWIs would not bail out the crisis ridden economies unless the governments adopted structural adjustment programmes to get stabilization fundamentals right . <p> Balancing budgets involved cutting out subsidies to agriculture and spending on social programmes , including education and health . Unleashing the market meant doing away with protection of infant industries and rolling back the state from economic activity . The results of SAPs were devastating as many studies by researchers have shown . Social indicators like education , medical care , health , nutrition , rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Redundancies followed . In short , even some of the modest achievements of the nationalist or developmentalist period were lost or undermined . <p> As the international situation changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union , Western imperialist powers regained their ideological initiative . The neo-liberal package of marketisation , privatisation and liberalisation now became the policy for , but not of the African states . Good performers would be praised and rewarded with more aid while the insubordinate and recalcitrant would be parodied and left to its own wit . While aid had always come with strings , now there was no attempt to disguise it . Political conditionalities were added to economic conditionalities . Policy making slipped out of the hands of the African state as Western financed policy consultants in their thousands jetted all over the continent with blue prints of policy on Poverty Reduction Strategies and manuals on good governance on their computers , gobbling up some 4 billion dollars annually . In 1985 , to give just one example , foreign experts resident in Equatorial Guinea were paid an amount three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mkandawire &amp; Soludo ibid.:137 <p> African leaders are left with little options : you are either with globalisation or doomed ! They have fallen in line one after another even if it means disowning their own past . Blairs Commission for Africa report , which consisted of prominent Africans including one president and one prime minister , castigates the whole of the last three decades , which virtually means the whole of post-independence period , as " lost decades " . The primary responsibility is placed on the African state for bad governance and lack of accountability , totally ignoring the role of imperialism in both the exploitation of African resources and supporting of non-democratic states when it suited their interests . Africans are told they have no capacity to think and African states are told they have no capacity to make correct policies . <p> The age of globalisation and the Pan-Africanist resistance <p> Globalisation expresses itself in Africa as neo-liberalism . These are a set of policies around stabilization of monetary and fiscal fundamentals on the one hand , and marketisation , liberalisation and privatisation of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their unrelenting critique by African intellectuals saw some modification of the programmes in the 1990s . <p> In short , the underlying thrust of the neo-liberal and globalised development " discourse " , which centres on policy-making , is deeper integration of African economies into the global capital and market circuits without fundamental transformation . It is predicated on private capital , which in Africa translates into foreign private capital , as the engine of growth . It centres on economic growth without asking whether growth necessarily translates into development . It banishes the issues of equality and equity to the realm of rights , not development . Human-centered and people-driven development which were the kingpin of African alternatives , such as the Lagos Plan of Action , are pooh-poohed into non-existence as the African people are reduced to the chronically poor who are the subject matter of papers on strategies for poverty reduction rather than the authors and drivers of development . It villainises African states and demonizes African bureaucracies as corrupt , incapable and unable to learn . They need globalised foreign advisors and consultants , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> In this " discourse " the developmental role of the state is declared dead and buried . Instead , it is assigned the role of a " chief " to supervise the globalisation project under the tutelage of imperialism , now called , development partners . The irony of the recent Commission for Africa was that it was convened , constituted and chaired by a British Prime Minister , while an African president and a prime minister sat on it as members . This symbolizes the nature of the so-called " new partnership " . The message is clear : African " co-partners " in African development are neither equal nor in the drivers seat . <p> But the neo-liberal project in Africa has not been without resistance . As Nyerere observed in his Preface to a book by African scholars significantly sub-titled , Beyond Dispossession and dependence : Africas history is not only one of slavery , exploitation and colonialism it is also a story of struggle against these evils , and of battles won after many setbacks and much suffering . ( Adedeji ed.1993:xv ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and in lecture halls of Africa . I will only confine myself to intellectual resistance . African scholars have severely critiqued structural adjustment programmes and indicated alternatives . Even African states and bureaucracies have not surrendered without some fight . There have been attempts to provide alternative frameworks and plans and programmes such as the Lagos Plan of Action , ( 1980 ) ; The African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programme for Socio-economic Recovery and Transformation ( 1989 ) and the African Charter for Popular Participation and Development ( 1990 ) . <p> These alternative frameworks have underlined the need for a holistic approach to Africas development ; called for a continental programme of regional integration and collective self-reliance ; cajoled African states not to surrender their developmental role , and sovereignty in policy-making ; and have attempted to develop a vision of a human-centered and people-driven development for the future of the continent . These African initiatives have been invariably dismissed by the erstwhile Bretton Woods institutions and the so-called " development partners " . Wielding the threat of marginalisation and dangling the carrot of aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed through their own agendas , which invariably prioritize the geo-political and strategic needs of the global hegemons and the voracious appetites of corporate capital for resources and profits . <p> The African state of art on development <p> I will quickly summarize the new development perspectives that are emerging in the debates of African scholars and intellectuals . <p> Firstly , African scholars are agreed that there is a clear need to go beyond stabilization fundamentals to developmental fundamentals . While stabilization policies and measures may be necessary , they are not sufficient . They have to be conceived within the larger context of building a self-sustaining economy rather than as short-term shock therapies . <p> Secondly , approaches and concerns of political economy on state and society have to be brought back in the discourse on development .

The role of the South-East Asian states in this regard , particularly in the development of human capital , is often cited in support . <p> In sum , the state must play a lead role in the long-term planning so as to place the economy on the developmental path towards an integrated economy . <p> But , fourthly , the state itself has to be reformed and restructured . The despotic colonial and the authoritarian post-colonial state can not play a popular developmental role . Its limits have been reached . The reformed state must have its roots in the people and must seek legitimacy from the people .

Is there an African national bourgeoisie capable of leading a genuine capitalist development or do we just have comprador bourgeoisies serving the needs of foreign capital ? Is state-centred socialist development , based on popular forces , the only alternative ? In any case , is a socialist alternative feasible in the light of the unipolar hegemony of imperialism ?

@@75400138 @4100138/ <p> There are two basic types of malnutrition . The first and most important is protein-energy malnutrition--the lack of enough protein ( from meat and other sources ) and food that provides energy ( measured in calories ) which all of the basic food groups provide . This is the type of malnutrition that is referred to when world hunger is discussed . The second type of malnutrition , also very important , is micronutrient ( vitamin and mineral ) deficiency . This is not the type of malnutrition that is referred to when world hunger is discussed , though it is certainly very important . <p> Recently there has also been a move to include obesity as a third form of malnutrition . Considering obesity as malnutrition expands the previous usual meaning of the term which referred to poor nutrition due to lack of food inputs.2 It is poor nutrition , but it is certainly not typically due to a lack of calories , but rather too many ( although poor food choices , often due to poverty , are part of the problem ) . Obesity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health problem and is increasingly considered as a type of malnutrition . <p> Protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) is the most lethal form of malnutrition/hunger . It is basically a lack of calories and protein . Food is converted into energy by humans , and the energy contained in food is measured by calories . Protein is necessary for key body functions including provision of essential amino acids and development and maintenance of muscles . <p> No one really knows how many people are malnourished . The statistic most frequently cited is that of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , which measures ' undernutrition ' . The most recent estimate , released in October 2010 by FAO , says that 925 million people are undernourished . As the figure below shows , the number of hungry people has increased since 1995-97 , though the number is down from last year . The increase has been due to three factors : 1 ) neglect of agriculture relevant to very poor people by governments and international agencies ; 2 ) the current worldwide economic crisis , and 3 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been devastating to those with only a few dollars a day to spend . 925 million people is 13.6 percent of the estimated world population of 6.8 billion , . Nearly all of the undernourished are in developing countries . <p> Number of hungry people , 1969-2010Source : FAO <p> The FAO estimate is based on statistical aggregates . It looks at a country 's income level and income distribution and uses this information to estimate how many people receive such a low level of income that they are malnourished . It is not an estimate based on seeing to what extent actual people are malnourished and projecting from there ( as would be done by survey sampling ) . It has been argued that the FAO approach is not sufficient to give accurate estimates of malnutrition ( Poverty and Undernutrition p. 298 by Peter Svedberg ) . <p> Undernutrition is a relatively new concept , but is increasingly used . It should be taken as basically equivalent to malnutrition . ( It should be said as an aside , that the idea of undernourishment , its relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concept is not clear to Hunger Notes . ) <p> Children are the most visible victims of undernutrition . Children who are poorly nourished suffer up to 160 days of illness each year . Poor nutrition plays a role in at least half of the 10.9 million child deaths each year--five million deaths . Undernutrition magnifies the effect of every disease , including measles and malaria . The estimated proportions of deaths in which undernutrition is an underlying cause are roughly similar for diarrhea ( 61% ) , malaria ( 57% ) , pneumonia ( 52% ) , and measles ( 45% ) ( Black 2003 , Bryce 2005 ) . Malnutrition can also be caused by diseases , such as the diseases that cause diarrhea , by reducing the body 's ability to convert food into usable nutrients . <p> According to the most recent estimate that Hunger Notes could find , malnutrition , as measured by stunting , affects 32.5 percent of children in developing countries--one of three ( de Onis 2000 ) . Geographically , more than 70 percent of malnourished children live in Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Caribbean . In many cases , their plight began even before birth with a malnourished mother . Under-nutrition among pregnant women in developing countries leads to 1 out of 6 infants born with low birth weight . This is not only a risk factor for neonatal deaths , but also causes learning disabilities , mental , retardation , poor health , blindness and premature death . <p> The world produces enough food to feed everyone . World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago , despite a 70 percent population increase . This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories ( kcal ) per person per day ( FAO 2002 , p.9 ) . The principal problem is that many people in the world do not have sufficient land to grow , or income to purchase , enough food . <p> What are the causes of hunger is a fundamental question , with varied answers . <p> Poverty is the principal cause of hunger . The causes of poverty include poor people 's lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and within specific countries , conflict , and hunger itself . As of 2008 ( 2005 statistics ) , the World Bank has estimated that there were an estimated 1,345 million poor people in developing countries who live on $1.25 a day or less.3 This compares to the later FAO estimate of 1.02 billion undernourished people . Extreme poverty remains an alarming problem in the worlds developing regions , despite some progress that reduced " dollar--now $1.25-- a day " poverty from ( an estimated ) 1900 million people in 1981 , a reduction of 29 percent over the period . Progress in poverty reduction has been concentrated in Asia , and especially , East Asia , with the major improvement occurring in China . In Sub-Saharan Africa , the number of people in extreme poverty has increased . The statement that ' poverty is the principal cause of hunger ' is , though correct , unsatisfying . Why then are ( so many ) people poor ? The next section summarizes Hunger Notes answer . <p> Harmful economic systems are the principal cause of poverty and hunger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunger is the ordinary operation of the economic and political systems in the world . Essentially control over resources and income is based on military , political and economic power that typically ends up in the hands of a minority , who live well , while those at the bottom barely survive , if they do . We have described the operation of this system in more detail in our special section on Harmful economic systems . <p> Conflict as a cause of hunger and poverty . At the end of 2005 , the global number of refugees was at its lowest level in almost a quarter of a century . Despite some large-scale repatriation movements , the last three years have witnessed a significant increase in refugee numbers , due primarily to the violence taking place in Iraq and Somalia . By the end of 2008 , the total number of refugees under UNHCRs mandate exceeded 10 million . The number of conflict-induced internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) reached some 26 million worldwide at the end of the year . Providing exact figures on the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively ) visible though it is , and anguishing for those involved conflict is less important as poverty ( and its causes ) as a cause of hunger . ( Using the statistics above 1.02 billion people suffer from chronic hunger while 36 million people are displaced UNHCR 2008 ) <p> Hunger is also a cause of poverty . By causing poor health , low levels of energy , and even mental impairment , hunger can lead to even greater poverty by reducing people 's ability to work and learn . <p> The target set at the 1996 World Food Summit was to halve the number of undernourished people by 2015 from their number in 1990-92 . ( FAO uses three year averages in its calculation of undernourished people . ) The ( estimated ) number of undernourished people in developing countries was 824 million in 1990-92 . In 2009 , the number had climbed to 1.02 billion people .

Three , perhaps the most important in terms of health consequences for poor people in developing countries , are : <p> Vitamin A Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness and reduces the body 's resistance to disease . In children Vitamin A deficiency can also cause growth retardation . Between 100 and 140 million children are vitamin A deficient .

@@75400152 @4100152/ <p> In October , 1996 , the World Bank and IMF reached an agreement on the first ever comprehensive debt reduction plan to enable the debtor country to pay back its loans without compromising economic growth and without building up arrears again in the future . The initiative is designed to reduce the multilateral , bilateral , and commercial debt of HlPCs over a period of about six years to a sustainable level , a level at which the country is considered able to make debt payments . This represents the current best effort by the World Bank , IMF , and most importantly , the developed country nations who play a preponderant role in the two international institutions . Thus , it is very important to look at what HIPC does and does not do . <p> BACKGROUND <p> Mexico 's announcement of a unilateral moratorium on its debt repayments in 1982 was a shock to the financial community . Moreover , it galvanized citizen 's groups , churches , NGOs , and others who experienced the impact of the debt crisis to step up their advocacy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly in response to the threat to the financial stability of commercial banks , the major creditors , commercial banks , governments ( also known as bilateral creditors ) , and international financial institutions sought new ways to address the problem . The principal result was the Brady Plan of 1989 , named for the then U.S. Secretary of the Treasury . <p> Through the Brady Plan of 1989 , commercial banks reduced about 20 percent of the commercial debt owed by middle income debtor countries ( commercial debt of Mexico , Brazil , Argentina , Costa Rica , Morocco , the Philippines , and Peru was reduced by about 35 percent ) . In the process , the banks were supported by guarantees from governments and international financial institutions , in effect shifting the credit risk from commercial to bilateral creditors . <p> Bilateral Creditors <p> The bilateral creditors fall into two categories : Paris Club and non-Paris Club . The Paris Club is primarily the group of wealthy donor nations which also belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . The non-Paris Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with the exception of Russia , a new member of the Paris Club since 1997 ) , and the Arab states . <p> Bilateral creditors were the first to provide debt relief in the early 1980s . Today , the Paris Club provides qualifying countries with some reduction or rescheduling of debt . The criteria are strict , but if a country qualifies , it can get a 67 percent reduction of a portion of its outstanding debt , up to 80 percent under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative . The portion of the debt eligible for reduction is that which : <p> has not previously been rescheduled <p> is not concessional <p> was incurred prior to the cut-off date ; the date when the country first requested assistance from the Paris Club . For most countries , the cut-off date is in the early 1980s . The debt incurred since then is ineligible for relief . Often , the net result is that debt relief is insignificant . ( Note : non-Paris Club donor nations have on occasion provided relief on Paris Club terms . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and regional development banks . They are governed by member nations , virtually every nation in the world . These institutions raise the majority of their capital on international financial markets at very favorable conditions because of their triple A rating , a rating received because their borrowing is guaranteed by all the member nations . Because the international financial institutions offer the best terms available and have been given a special role in the international financial system , they insist on preferred creditor status , which means that they must be paid back prior to other creditors . If the debtor country does not make payments on its loans on time , it is considered off track and will ordinarily not receive loans from other creditors . <p> Until the HIPC Initiative was approved in 1996 , the international financial institutions would not allow rescheduling or cancellation of their loans , although in practice they did so by enabling countries to pay off old loans by taking out new ones at lower interest rates and longer terms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest countries-- this is a good place to start-- but also and more questionably , to those countries who have implemented Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAPS ) approved by the World Bank and IMF . <p> Under the initiative , after the eligible country has established a track record of economic reform over a period of three years , the Paris Club creditors provide a 67 percent reduction in eligible debt stock . This point is called the decision point . All other creditors ( non-OECD bilateral creditors and commercial banks ) are supposed to provide comparable reductions . <p> Photo : WFP/N . Brodeur <p> Equipping African women with the necessary tools to be successful farmers takes resources . A large share of government resources of low income , highly indebted countries are devoted to debt repayment , hindering aid to their own people . <p> If these actions do not result in a sustainable debt , the country moves to the second three-year stage , during which time it might get support from the international financial institutions for economic reform and poverty reduction . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record by implementing required economic reforms , it will receive up to 80 percent reduction in eligible Paris Club debt stock . This point is called the completion point . The second period of three years might be shortened for countries which already have a track record of strong performance . <p> At the completion point , the multilateral creditors provide debt relief only if all other reductions are not enough to reduce the country 's debt to a sustainable level . <p> Shortcomings of the HIPC Initiative <p> Too Few Countries Eligible <p> There are 41 countries classified by the World Bank as HIPCs , yet only a few will get relief through the HIPC Initiative as it is currently designed . Like Paris Club debt relief , qualifying for HIPC is difficult and countries that do qualify will likely find its impact limited . <p> For example , Nicaragua may not qualify for relief under the HIPC Initiative because of its poor track record in carrying out structural adjustment programs .

As a result , they want to minimize its cost . Some powerful G-7 countries , as well as some middle income countries that are unlikely to be eligible for HIPC debt relief , have not committed sufficient resources to bilateral debt relief . The IMF will provide multilateral relief only through an existing fund , the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility . The World Bank , on the other hand , has set aside $2 billion for debt relief , an important commitment , but will release it only after bilateral creditors show their financial commitment by contributing to a separate debt relief fund . <p> Photo : Lane Vanderslice <p> The generations meet--in support of debt forgiveness for the poorest developing countries .

This is very instructive , because we must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most often , food in and of itself is not the problem nor are physical circumstances , such as a countrywide drought . People are deprived of food because they are deprived of access to it , such as the reports in this issue on Sudan indicate very strongly . There are other examples as well . Brazilian street children may have to break the law to obtain food and may lose their lives in the process . Bonded Indian laborers may have to work for food as virtual slaves . Pakistani prisoners ' access to food may depend entirely on their wardens . Peasants throughout the world may have to defend the land on which they raise crops against land grabbing or against agricultural policies that drive them to hunger and despair . Research has shown that some famines have coincided with increases in food supply to the affected region , although not to the poor and hungry . <p> It is thus not scarcity that leads to insufficient access to food , but the denial of access to food-producing resources and work . Who produces the food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maximize the return on investments in food production . Food is produced for the rich in a global supermarket to which the poor , because they are so poor , have no access . Access to food in dignity means the freedom to be employed , perhaps self-employed , in agriculture or industry ; it means the availability of work under conditions which are as just and fair as reasonably possible . <p> Adapted from FIAN 1996 , Twelve Misconceptions about the Right to Food as a Human Right .

@@75400167 @4100167/ <h> The Hunger Dilemma <p> Progress since the World Food Conference in 1974 has been disappointing . <p> Although the percentage of malnourished ( underweight ) children has declined , modestly , in most countries in the intervening 25 years , their numbers continue to rise . <p> The data suggest an ongoing race between socioeconomic development and population growth , compounded by an increasingly vulnerable resource base and the fact that , more often than not , the fruits of development have yet to reach millions of people in a manner sufficient to overcome their caloric deficits . Policies and programs explicitly designed to reduce hunger have done so only marginally in most instances , implying that they have not adequately removed the underlying constraints causing hunger in the first place . <p> Moreover , despite two major international meetings this decade , one on nutrition ( ICN , Rome , 1992 ) and the other on hunger itself ( World Food Summit , Rome , 1996 ) , there are few grounds for confidence as we look ahead . <p> What is the problem ? And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines hunger as a political issue and then focuses on two key operational problems : defining a hunger agenda , and the related problem of organizing to carry it out . The hunger dilemma is both conceptual and organizational , and it is not easily circumvented . The dilemma leaves hunger ill-targeted and hunger professionals often frustrated by the constraints they face in trying to erode the constraints to nutritional adequacy experienced by the hungry themselves . <p> Photo : Office of Rep.Tony Hall ( D-Ohio ) <h> Political Jekyll and Hyde <p> One might think that hunger would be an easy issue for governments , international agencies , and even universities to embrace . <p> Nobody actually favors the existence of hunger , except occasionally as a weapon of war . Most would agree that hunger is undesirable and that its prevalence in the world connotes something wrong that should be addressed . And , indeed , leaders as diverse as Lenin , Franklin Roosevelt , and Ferdinand Marcos have exploited the rhetorical appeal of hunger as an issue , confident that it symbolizes what they oppose and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward them for pledging to rectify the situation . <p> Moreover , hungers political appeal has been strengthened by evidence that protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) , the essence of hunger ( see Box 1 ) , constrains human competence , productivity , and potential , making it a legitimate issue in development , as well . <p> Hunger , it would seem , has all the advantages of being " big , " non-contentious , politically appealing , and for the development community professionally respectable , even compelling . <p> If only it were so simple . <p> Unfortunately , the hunger issue contains several liabilities that have proven to be problematic . <p> Endemic hunger is mostly invisible ; its victims are typically peripheral and voiceless ; and , rhetoric notwithstanding , political salience is usually low . <p> Moreover , hunger advocates labor in a cluttered policy environment . Most of them have few links to the people for whom they advocate , and their lofty appeals are seldom matched by political mobilization and demands by the hungry on their own behalf . <p> The hard fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a collective good . They tend to be divisible , even redistributive in their benefits , and hence contentious in nature , especially when it comes to actual resource allocation . Consensus that hunger is unfortunate does not mean commitment to eradicate it , while commitment does not imply agreement on how best to do so . Easy to embrace , hunger is also easy to abandon ( " well get to it after " ) or distort ( " developing the economy/stimulating agricultural production will alleviate the problem " ) . Hunger specialists and their allies concerned with social development function in uncertain and unstable terrain laden with obstacles . And that is before they have even started to act . <h> The Institutional Eclipse of Hunger <p> Governments <p> Governments have long had difficulty organizing to alleviate hunger . <p> Some have tried interministerial units charged with overseeing and , at times , coordinating the agendas of different ministries . These have typically foundered on the operational autonomy of line ministries and their resistance to being subordinated and coordinated . <p> Other governments have given responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect squeezing a multisectoral problem into a single sector while trusting , perhaps , that " hunger " will eventually be ameliorated by the countrys overall development policies . <p> The designated ministries often do not know what to do with malnutrition , leaving it to nutritionists who rarely are central players in the ministrys arena . Not infrequently nutrition agendas collide with broader ministry priorities and are similarly marginalized . Meanwhile , the overall development policies being pursued may have little immediate relevance to reducing hunger and in some instances such as promoting bimodal agricultural systems with a favored commercial sector and a largely neglected subsistence sector may actually , if unintentionally , intensify hunger . <p> Hunger , Protein-Energy Malnutrition , and Food Security There is some confusion in the use of the terms hunger and malnutrition . How do they relate ? This essay equates , the emotive word " hunger " with protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) , including but not limited to famine , while excluding micronutrient deficiencies such as in iron , iodine , and Vitamin A , even when these are derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more empirically defined concept than hunger , and it helps the latter to be better understood technically . An important corollary to thinking of hunger as PEM is that it gives hunger a health dimension that otherwise might elude recognition . <p> The currently fashionable term " food security , " although more appealing that the 1970s " nutrition planning " as an organizing principal , is not an ideal equivalent for hunger . " Food security " addresses means , not ends . It seeks to improve food availability and access but is notably inattentive to nutritional outcomesand to their health-related determinants . <p> International Agencies <p> International agencies have encountered difficulties of their own in determining how best to organize their hunger agendas . <p> USAID has eliminated its Office of Nutrition , absorbing it into a new office of population , health and nutrition . The name of this office clearly expresses the lessened priority given nutrition , with funding allocations being even more skewed . Moreover , attention to protein-energy malnutrition has receded in favor of the micronutrient deficiencies , ostensibly because the latter are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even parochial response to PEM , one that all too often is divorced from mainstream economic development . <p> Similarly , The World Bank has incorporated its Nutrition Unit into a larger entity , the Human Development Department . The Nutrition Section at UNICEF carries on but has largely abandoned protein-energy malnutrition in favor of initiatives on the micronutrients plus breastfeeding . PEM is now pretty much the responsibility of the Health Section , which has numerous other concerns , as well . <p> The tendency to define protein-energy malnutrition as primarily a health issue and to organize policy responses to it under a health rubric is a mixed blessing . The tendency may seem bizarre when the referent is " hunger . " Yet PEM has a strong health component shaped by the bodys failure to derive full benefit from nutrients consumed because of infectious disease , parasitic infestation , and other health states . Whereas " hunger " implies consumption deficits only , nutritional status a la PEM is understood to reflect the interplay of consumption and morbidity . <p> That said , health interventions alone are clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) correctly point out that other UN agencies FAO , WFP , and UNDP especially come at the problem in appropriate ways that are complementary to their own approaches in the sense both of going beyond health and in the case of UNICEF of addressing macro as well as micro ( community ) conditions . In effect , comprehensiveness in the UN system is achieved by means of organizational and programmatic fragmentation , whereas at USAID and the World Bank , nutrition initiatives are largely confined to the delivery of services , often through health infrastructures , a pattern found in most governments , as well . <p> Photo : United Nations/John Isaac <p> Universities <p> Universities , in principle organized to advance our understanding of the world , have had difficulty doing so in the case of hunger . Most have not even tried , but those that have have had rather sobering experiences . <p> The Massachusetts Institute of Technology created and then dismantled its pathbreaking International Nutrition Planning Program in the 1970s . Among the underlying reasons were misgivings about the intellectual rigor of such an interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarly , role . ( Early efforts at Meharry Medical College , the Harvard School of Public Health , and the University of California at Berkeley also came to nothing ) . <p> More recently , Stanford has abolished its Food Research Institute , largely because the Economics Department regarded it as redundant and inferior . <p> Brown University has essentially eliminated its World Hunger Program , the demise of this highly visible program being camouflaged by absorption into the Watson Institute for International Affairs . ( Leadership change and loss of core funding were also involved ) . <p> Tufts University and Cornell University have both struggled with organizing their nutrition programs ; in each case , organizing around an issue ( hunger/malnutrition ) has eroded in preference to organizing around a discipline ( nutrition science ) , while at Tufts international nutrition has also had to share its central role with the emergence of other social science programs that look financially more promising . <p> In the United Kingdom , both the Food Studies Group at Oxford and its counterpart at the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to survive as academic programs . <p> Indeed , the major exception to this litany of institutional woe is IFPRI , the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington , which tellingly is not a university . <p> Why are hunger-oriented institutions and programs in such eclipse ? In the case of universities , the answers center on funding , jealousies , and confusion concerning mandates , organizational structure , and organizing principles : the role of interdisciplinary programs in institutions organized primarily around disciplines , and an issue focus as against a disciplinary one ( see Box 2 ) . For governments and international agencies , the dilemma is how to organize and manage the action agenda for hunger . <p> The Nutrition-Hunger Mismatch Locating a hunger-oriented agenda in a School of Nutrition Science and Policy ( such as Tufts ) or a Division of Nutritional Sciences ( such as Cornell ) produces an inevitable tension between social and biomedical scientists . <p> Social scientists dealing with hunger treat " nutrition " as a dependent variable to be analyzed in relation to a wide range of economic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For them nutrition is an outcome or marker . Biomedical scientists are more likely to study nutrition itself as a set of independent , as well as dependent , variables . Moreover , their arena tends to be the laboratory and their focus to be micro , even cellular , rather than macro/societal . When hunger-oriented economists , political scientists , anthropologists , agriculturalists , and public health professionals are organized together with nutritional biochemists and physiologists on the assumption that they are all much the same or at least are equally devoted to " nutrition " , the result is a clash of intellectual cultures that would do C.P. Snow proud and , in effect , a power struggle induced by forced association.Hunger people are unlikely to win such struggles when " nutrition " is the organizing principle . <p> My personal opinion is that this is a counterproductive way of organizing hunger studies in a university . I also believe that , in the policy realm , " nutrition " is the wrong organizing principle for " hunger " because nutritionists have little to offer in the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by virtue of the nutrition label . <p> A predominantly nutritional approach to PEM distorts the response away from the underlying socioeconomic conditions that are central to the problem and its lasting improvement . I am concerned that nutrition advocates have become an interest group claiming resources for nutrition interventions that , in many instances , would be better spent seeing to removal of the root causes of malnutrition . It may well be that the proprietary claims of nutrition advocates also give some governments an easy escape from having to address hunger in a more serious , yet costly , and conflictual , way . Ironically , the current preoccupation with micronutrient deficiencies in the nutrition community , which comes at the expense of protein-energy malnutrition , actually makes sense from this perspective because it matches nutritionists with nutritional problems for which their expertise is critical . <h> Organizing Action Against Hunger <p> This is a difficult task . <p> In addition to its political problems noted above , hunger poses operational problems by virtue of its being a complex issue , and one that is also structural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " hunger " is a big issue for which no single , onedimensional response will suffice . This leaves hunger policy open-ended and hence subject to controversy even within the development community , where focal concerns vary , paradigms and priorities compete , mandates differ , and actors with compatible , even similar , goals find it necessary to vie with one another for scarce resources . <p> Moreover , hunger is a state of being produced by other conditions while being embedded in them ; and these conditions range from the specific ( soils , technologies ) to the intermediate ( markets , income ) to the broad ( poverty , political economy ) . <p> Hunger is so multifaceted in its causality and context that it is not obvious how best to respond to it . The context is every country in the world , and the causality involves everything from agriculture , to international trade , to the internal and external political dynamics of countries . <p> It is not obvious whether to organize policy to alleviate hunger as a specific goal or to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large with the expectation that success in these other areas will alleviate hunger as a happy byproduct . <p> If the decision is to make hunger a focal concern , a breakthrough that hunger advocates would applaud , there is still the question of how comprehensive vs. specific the policy response should be . Specific hunger policies ( improving agricultural yields , reducing post-harvest losses , feeding people in need ) have the advantage of directness ( do this , get that ) , in theory at least , and the likely disadvantage of being insufficient to materially change the hunger outcome given other constraints not adequately addressed . <p> Comprehensive ( " multisectoral " ) approaches have the advantage of being comprehensive and the disadvantage of requiring political and administrative centrality . Not only must a comprehensive strategy to alleviate hunger be reconciled with other concerns ( industrial development , for example ) that seek similar , if not greater , centrality ; like any long-term strategy , it must survive the corroding influence of short-term claims that can not be ignored ( higher wages for the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Getting a comprehensive plan approved is difficult if the plan is to be authoritative ; keeping it intact and on track over time even more so . Moreover , a comprehensive strategy has to be disaggregated into operational components ; and these can easily lose linkage , conceptually and in practice , with one another and with hunger itself as other purposes ( export promotion , cheap food for urban centers , political patronage ) crystallize . When political leaders and ministries end up disagreeing about specific policies and the priorities among them , the fragile consensus informing a comprehensive strategy easily fragments into autonomous components that become ill-connected and even competitive . <p> This , in effect , is the problem of reconciling big issues of enormous complexity with segmented structures and mandates ; and it mirrors over and over again the rational-comprehensive vs. incremental-adaptive approach to decision making assessed in the literature on public administration wherein the intellectual appeal of being comprehensive is thwarted by its operational cumbersomeness . <p> The Appeal of Policy Disaggregation <p> Disaggregating big issues into operational components is a necessity that reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classically educated Burkean gentleman <p> intellectual capable of making policy judgments on a wide range of subject matter , has yielded in the United States , in particular to modes of training and forms of expertise that are highly specialized . With the explosion of knowledge unleashed by modern scientific inquiry , in tandem with the social spread of educational opportunity , has come the compartmentalization of knowledge . The essence of most scholarship is to learn more and more about less and less . Scholarship has become an industry , with knowledge " exploding " because of the numbers engaged in research . However , as knowledge has expanded , expertise has narrowed . <p> So , too , in the realm of policy and action . As issues perceived problems , needs , opportunities have expanded , organizations to deal with them , public and private , have become more numerous , larger and more complex . Similarly , the proliferation of organization has created capabilities previously unknown . <p> Yet as capabilities have increased , competencies have narrowed . The expansion of organization and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification . Bureaucracies grow as their responsibilities increase , but this growth is accompanied by segmentation of responsibility . Just as the expansion of knowledge results in its compartmentalization , so the applications of knowledge result in organizational differentiation . Appeals for coordination , even integration , of administrative action speak to the extent to which these values have been compromised in practice . Often they are also asking more than highly differentiated structures with tightly defined mandates are able ( and willing ) to provide . Interministerial and inter-agency coordination , repeatedly invoked as administrative virtues , usually become an operational curse for this very reason , as the values of autonomy and control override those of subordination , shared responsibility , and mutual dependency . <p> Seen in this light , a big issue like hunger collides with our intellectual and organizational disposition to small solutions that are easier to allocate , organize , and manage . Technical assistance , with its emphasis on specific types of expertise , reinforces this tendency to disaggregate . <p> Photo : Catholic Relief Services/Carolyn Watson <h> Striving for Linkage <p> Notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda to largely autonomous units of decision and action , doing so has been at a cost to policy coherence , effectiveness , and reinforcement . <p> Consequently , there is a counter-tendency toward integration of effort , and this entails incorporating hunger/nutrition agendas into more comprehensive units , as at USAID and the Bank . The result is a trade-off . Organizational reform tries to balance the benefits of issue specificity , visibility , autonomy , and clout with the benefits of incorporation , integration , reinforcement , and possible protection from adversaries . Hunger lends itself to the latter approach because it is a derivative issue that reflects other things . One can isolate hunger , or " nutrition , " and give it organizational expression of its own ; but in large administrative systems this invites conflict over agendas and control , and it also disposes to isolation and impotence . <p> To illustrate , USAIDs Office of Nutrition , for many years an innovator and catalyst for raising visibility and concern for protein-energy malnutrition , nevertheless confined itself ( or was confined ) to programs directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Office of Nutrition was empowered to develop nutrition interventions but not to address the underlying causes of malnutrition . It dealt with manifestations and sought to treat them in laser beam fashion food supplements , education , social marketing , etc. ; it did not deal with poverty and the multiple objective conditions disposing to malnutrition . Hence , it addressed symptoms , not contexts ; and it sought to help the malnourished and those at risk , not to change the conditions outside their control that constrained them . All of that , ostensibly , was someone elses responsibility . By dealing with manifestations and offering only palliation ( " nutritional aspirin " if you will ) , the Office of Nutrition was not really a development agency at all ( except insofar as malnutrition itself constrains the development potential of its victims , a prominent argument at the time ) . <p> One wonders whether incorporating the Office of Nutrition into the Office of Population , Health and Nutrition was intended to bring " nutrition " more into the development mainstream and to encourage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , the record to date is not very encouraging . Of the 66 separate projects currently being funded by the Office of Population , Health , and Nutrition , only one , the FANTA project , can be said to address malnutrition as a significant , but by no means exclusive , part of its mandate . <p> Similarly , food aids relationship to hunger alleviation now called " household food security " continues to be more rhetorical than real . This is true in part because other goals have taken precedence ( such as " human capacity development , " i.e. education ) and in part because documenting nutritional improvement in food aid supported projects has proven to be so difficult ( thereby producing other justifications such as providing incentives to attend health clinics and schools ) . <p> Clearly , linking hunger to other agendas runs the risk of its being lost as a focal concern and otherwise marginalized in the inevitable array of other objectives . <p> In sum , it is difficult for agencies to capture and organize something so multifaceted as hunger . Expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more issue and context specific , and institutional jurisdictions are more focused and compartmentalized . <p> Put another way , hunger overwhelms organized efforts to respond to it . In turn , hunger policy tends to be buffeted by alternative dispositions disaggregation and integration , autonomy and incorporation and to suffer the indignities of bouncing around administrative systems when it is not lost in some corner . Managing the hunger agenda is a taxing and often frustrating enterprise as a result . Although no one is to blame for this state of affairs , there is no easy way out of the dilemma of organizing hunger . <h> The Good News <p> Hunger is being alleviated in spite of these ( and other ) impediments ( see Box 3 ) . The record is spotty , however ; and the hunger community has , on balance , been of only marginal significance to the gains made . Four overlapping conditions appear to be the decisive factors . <p> First , when a Basic Human Needs strategy of development has been pursued and successfully implemented over a decade or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " support-led " ( Sri Lanka , Kerala ) , or a blend ( China , Chile , Thailand ) . ( These terms are from Dreze and Sen , 1989 . ) Responding to Hunger : Five Options Hunger is the kind of issue , rhetorically appealing yet organizationally and programmatically elusive , that invites policy confusion , inconsistency , tokenism and displacement ( things done in its name that have little bearing on it ) . Consider the following five options as they pertain to government policy and the agendas of international agencies : <p> Ignore hunger as a focal concern , perhaps trusting that policies pursued for other reasons will impact favorably on it . <p> Respond to hunger with a few discrete interventions , such as child feeding , that are basically stand-alone initiatives . <p> Make hunger one of several organizing principles around which a broader policy is defined and organized . <p> Make the alleviation of hunger the overriding principle and core objective of development policy , subordinating other policies ( e.g. , export promotion ) to it . <p> Incorporate hunger into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing an overall development strategy . <p> Photo : United Nations Burkina Faso : Woman and child <p> These options would appear to be levels on a continuum signifying seriousness of purpose ; yet as levels they do not necessarily imply effectiveness of results . My own sense is that levels 3 and 4 do not exist in fact , even though rhetoric might suggest otherwise . Explicit hunger policy tends to bifurcate between levels 2 ( where it is often defined as " nutrition " policy ) and 5 ( where , ironically , it may not be defined at all ) . Between the two , most programmatic effort against hunger may be found at level 2 , whereas the greatest success in reducing hunger and even eliminating it is the distinctive achievement of level 5 . ( That , at any rate , is the impression conveyed by the development experience of Thailand , Costa Rica , Kerala , Sri Lanka , and perhaps China and Cuba as well as of Korea , Taiwan , and Chile ) . Sadly , most development in the modern era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of most Western countries , where hunger carried a badge of social stigma and responsibility for dealing with it was left to private charity . <p> Second , when a protracted rural based revolution results in a major reallocation of resources toward the poor majority ( China , Cuba for a time , Iran , perhaps Zimbabwe ) . <p> Third , when a competitive political process emerges , giving populist influence to smallholder agriculture and other rural and lower status groups ( Chile , Costa Rica , Sri Lanka , the Indian state of Kerala ) . <p> Fourth , when political elites forge a social contract with their populations exchanging supports health , education , employment , subsidized food , etc. for loyalty ( the Thai military , the Baath government in Iraq prior to the invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War , and Kuwait itself ) . <p> What stands out here is the primacy of political conditions , the secondary role of economic variables , and the tertiary role at best of the applied technical expertise of hunger specialists . Like nutrition planners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where conditions are least favorable for success . <p> It remains to be seen whether , in time , hunger specialists are able to break through the many constraints facing them .

@@75400176 @4100176/ <p> ( Tanzania , June 2006 ) Tanzania has a national HIV/AIDS policy and is in the process of finalizing legislation on HIV/AIDS . The expectation is that once the policy and legal framework is set , people living with HIV/AIDS and their families will be afforded greater protection . But will a legal framework that solely addresses the public health dimensions of HIV/AIDS and not the intimate aspects of personal relationships that maintain the status-quo in power relations between the sexes suffice ? <h> Treating an invisible syndrome <p> When one reads the alarming statistics explaining the magnitude of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa one gets an impression that people are dropping down like flies . One would think that as one walks the streets , every other person would be noticeably HIV positive . This , however , is not the case , not because HIV/AIDS is not present but because it is rendered invisible something that makes ongoing efforts to combat HIV/AIDS ineffective , if not difficult . <p> While HIV/AIDS is very much in our midst it remains hidden from many either by choice or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to see it ; or those that are affected by it choose not to divulge their status . It remains hidden by design when those who have it go to extra lengths to conceal their positive status . Also , it remains obscured when the state fails to address the problem at its core , that is confronting the underlying cause contributing to widespread infections rather than its consequence . <p> I have been following the progression of HIV/AIDS since the mid-eighties when the formulation of the first national response against HIV/AIDS emerged , but it remained invisible to me until the late nineties . Until then my association with HIV/AIDS was based on health statistics and my long association with womens sexual and reproductive health and rights . Putting a face to someone living with the virus came much later . But when these live testimonies finally emerged they were persistent in underscoring the pervasiveness of the pandemic . From the outset , it became clear to me that each story of a women who had contracted the virus was peculiar and in most cases did not meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions to the problem that is HIV/AIDS , something that is not so clear with prevailing responses against the disease . One can only appreciate the complexity involved in combating the pandemic when one reviews the stories of countless women , men and children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS . It is also these stories that inform my political stance on the adequacy of existing HIV/AIDS approaches in combating the pandemic . <h> Protecting the unsuspecting <p> One of the first cases I came across involved a bright girl , full of life and humor . I met her for the first time when she was ten but looked more like a five year old . She was born HIV positive , a fact that led her father to abandon the family . It was left to her mother and elder sibling to love and provide for her amidst great hardship . Although an innocent child , she was not spared the humiliation meted out on PLWHAs that resulted from prevalent institutional ignorance about HIV/AIDS . Her teachers openly discriminated against her , forcing her to wear a red badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother joined an association of PLWHA which provided her and the family with much needed moral and material support . Her sisters , who were not positive , became peer educators and volunteers for an HIV/AIDS community based program . She thus never saw herself as a victim . She accepted her condition and sought to live to the fullest in spite of the fact that she was positive . Her status was only an issue when it made her too sick to play or attend school . She died before her twelfth birthday , unable to realize her many dreams . Her brave attitude gave us a useful advocacy platform to intensify the campaign for the rights of PLWHA . <p> Progressively , the reality of HIV/AIDS came close to home when a close friend of mine lost her baby girl . Although she had suffered bouts of TB it only became clear that she may be infected with the virus after her very sick daughter was diagnosed with the virus . Indeed it is not exceptional that many women get to know about their positive status in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are likely to be infected with the virus in the sense that they are not prostitutes or " loose " women but women who are in stable relationships , the majority having the respectable status of being someones wife and , therefore , by local social standards , outside the ambit of the risk category associated with immoral behavior . <p> Consequently , a significant number of HIV positive women I know contracted the virus as unsuspecting victims . They were brought up to believe that it was enough that they were in a happy , healthy and lasting marriage . The husbands fidelity was immaterial to complete this equation . On the contrary , the overwhelming perception is that a chaste and faithful wife sufficed to protect the family from i 'll health and ensure a strong progeny . Increasingly women are finding that an institution that was traditionally meant to provide them with security , stability , health and respect is in fact endangering their lives and livelihoods . <p> Many of these women are torn between confronting their problem and in so doing drawing attention to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stigmatization . Importantly , it has the potential to ostracize them from traditional systems of support , especially after their spouse rejects them upon divulging their status . Indeed it is the dilemmas and contradictions women face as the weaker sex that puts them at risk of contracting the virus . Certainly , it is the denial of womens agency in matters of sexual and reproductive nature that informs womens social and economic predicament , a situation intensified by the HIV/AIDS pandemic . <h> Are we fighting a disease or a curse ? <p> The contradictory nature of the disease vis a vis womens wellbeing is most evident in the story of my namesake , now deceased , who I came to know by virtue of my work with Muslim women . She was an only child , begotten late in life .

There is no knowing what risk she exposed herself to as she only confirmed that he may have died of AIDS after her sister succumbed and died soon after . This tragedy ended the working life of this young woman as her mother went into shock , forcing her to take a leave of absence to nurse her until she died . To save her from a predicament like her sisters , her uncle and brothers planned to marry her off to a man who had been divorced thrice . <p> While a number of these women were ignorant about their status , a number were in denial not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status might have . My friend took some time to accept her HIV positive status . A lot of anger was exhibited against her husbands long love interest and while she came from a religious family she readily invoked witchcraft to explain her errant husbands behaviour . Perhaps it was more tolerable to accept that her husband was not acting in selfish disregard of her feelings and health were it not for an evil third hand or influence . <p> My most recent house help must have known for sometime she had the virus but instead of focusing on her condition actively sought out other women suspected to be infected as if in an attempt to deflect attention from her own status . Otherwise she hid her i 'll health well , substituting it with other debilitating diseases like malaria or typhoid . But when her ten-year old daughter died , she lost her will to live and succumbed almost two months later . The fate of her husband is unknown since he is adamant his daughter was a victim of someones bad spell , a view his wife never sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets . <h> Interrogating the source of repeated transmissions <p> The stories serve to underscore certain truths that hardly feature as the key issues in the battle against HIV/AIDS . It is more likely for women to admit their HIV status than it is for men . In most cases I have come across , the women were categorical that it was the sexual permissiveness of their partner that put them at risk . In many cases they were unsuspecting victims . In some cases , they suspected infidelity but were helpless to stop it since as opposed to their sexuality being regulated , their husbands infidelity was given free reign by religious dicta and the legal framework . While society is more preoccupied with the status of the woman during marriage -whether she is a virgin or not ; whether she is rebellious or not ; whether she is respectable or not equal consideration is not given to the status of her partner . On the contrary legal and social institutions tend to extol mens sexual prowess and irresponsibility . <p> Likewise , while it is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their condition there is never talk of compensating them for the harm inflicted on them and the ensuring violation of their privacy and property rights . My namesake was disposed of all her property by her in-laws even her cooking pots though it was well known that her culinary skills sustained the family during their short married life . She attempted to fight for her rights but died without justice being realized . The sister of my house help was evicted from the house where she lived and nursed her husband and ended up living with a relative before being bundled back to her village to die . <p> After initial denial my friend is living an open life . She recently lost her husband and is in the middle of a property distribution exercise directed by his family . While the family is keen to expedite her share of inheritance , perhaps in view of her condition , there is no mention of compensating her for the harm her late husband caused her , if not knowingly then by sheer negligence . She dares not bring up the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this attitude of looking at women as creatures to be pitied and helped , instead of full partners in a relationship , that limits their agency and bargaining power in a relationship . Surely , awarding her compensation is not a matter of retribution or her inability to forgive . On the contrary it is her ability to forgive and go on with her life that contributes to her positive and healthy living . But should such chivalry be abused ? <p> The wrong these women have been subjected to goes unrecognized . The contributions they made to families in terms of monetary and non-monetary forms of contributions go unacknowledged . Instead , these women are vilified by relatives and society for their positive status . Their positive status is equal to a death sentence and licenses their dispossession . Their continued existence means they are delaying the process of wealth transfer and if the virus wont kill them in time , then heart ache and harassment are efficient mechanisms to expedite the sentence ! <h> The unresolved politics of HIV/AIDS <p> Most governments have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sharing the burden of looking after those affected by the HIV/AIDS scourge . And while the pandemic presents new opportunities for governments to address gender inequalities there is paralysis in taking deliberate action to promote natural and social justice . Certainly the pandemic presents an opportunity to influence reforms in law and attitudes not only towards HIV/AIDS but in reforming gender relations . Other than reaffirming state responsibility towards principles of gender equality and justice , it affords states an opportunity to engage in social engineering towards meeting constitutional and civic commitments to its citizens , male and female . <p> The development sectors HIV/AIDS response fares no better . While it is commonplace to maintain that having HIV/AIDS does not amount to having a death sentence , prevailing policies , discourses and practice related to HIV/AIDS continuously pass death sentences on those infected by the virus . Though my organization addresses HIV/AIDS in the context of reproductive health , I resist working in the field mainly because the overwhelming support to the sector seems to promote welfarism approaching infected persons as helpless victims thereby subscribing to dominant attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those afflicted by the virus . This is an approach to development that we abandoned two decades ago in favor of a more empowering development approach and discourse . <p> Indeed , whereas we have tried to reclaim the dignity of people who survived gender based physical and sexual violence we are shamelessly victimizing people infected with HIV/AIDS . The biggest pastime for people who want to placate their sense of guilt or get a piece of the HIV industry in my country are projects involving HIV/AIDS orphans where countless children who are infected or who lost parents to the disease are not allowed to get over their loss and the stigma associated with their loss . The association with HIV/AIDS is the brand that sells . Oblivious are we to the message that underlies such projects : Why cant these children get on with their lives and be assisted by virtue of being orphaned and not because they are orphaned by HIV/AIDS ? <p> Also appalling is the wastage of resource poured in by the international community on material purchases and workshops that do very little to actually help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become the new development craze diverting much needed income from more sustainable development interventions . Why is overall spending in preventive health and reproductive health falling when they form part of the equation for an effective heath response to the pandemic ? I visited Rwanda in 2004 and was appalled to find that each major UN agency and international NGO was into the HIV/AIDS sector with very little coordination between them . I found a similar situation in Zanzibar where the bulk of advocacy organizations felt compelled to get into the HIV/AIDS sector to secure funding to remain afloat . <p> I am equally wary of the ongoing politicization of the question of access to anti-retrovirals for PLWHA . Certainly I have no desire to profit pharmaceuticals , who seek to commodify peoples health in the name of a pseudo-cure . I am also hesitant to create dependency on the drugs in the absence of better nutrition and a guarantee that the scientific community is serious in finding a cure or a better drug regiment . The idea is not to create another dependent population , this time not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The objective should be to empower PLWHA to live healthy and independent lives without fear of incrimination , stigmatization or impoverishment . It should be about giving security and dignity to those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS . <h> Conclusion <p> Statistics explaining the magnitude of the pandemic are plentiful . It is however not helpful when numbers are considered in a vacuum . I took inspiration from a book a young woman participating in our mentoring program is working on to open dialogue about HIV/AIDS . The book is particularly insightful as other than using narratives of women infected and affected by HIV/AIDS to expose the human dimension of the pandemic , it does so while charting her personal trajectory with HIV/AIDS . She explores myths about the disease ; education and prevention strategies ; and personal and community responses they invoke . Certainly it is in understanding the interactions that inform individual HIV/AIDS experiences that more sustainable prevention options will evolve , options that go beyond showcasing the scourge for what it is but attempt to deal with why it is and is allowed to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation , a development network that works with the concerns of Muslim and provincial women .

Analyzing 50 years of human rights treaties and subsequent commitments is an important responsibility for all human rights organizations and social justice activists . <p> What must still be done ? I believe that there are three necessary steps . <p> The defense and promotion of economic , social , and cultural rights must involve a comprehensive approach to human rights , including the human right to food and sound nutrition . There must be a systemic analysis of the necessary conditions for the progressive realization to the human rights to food , housing , health care , education and work . <p> Those concerned about hunger , hunger activists , the nutrition community , private voluntary organizations and their supporters , the religious community , and others , need to discuss how to incorporate this human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then take steps to do so . <p> On their side , those concerned with human rights , as presently considered , which in practice has meant those , such as Amnesty International , concerned with torture , false imprisonment , murder and other less serious but still very serious violations of political rights , such as denial of peoples right to vote , have to include in their framework a dialogue about the right to life considered in economic and social aspects , and consider its critical importance in developing a discourse to find new solutions to address old problems . <p> In doing this , we and they expand the range of activists that can improve human rights , including the right to adequate nutrition . A community dialogue on malnutrition and hunger and the means to escape them is both imperative and an unexplored opportunity . Much greater attention needs to be given to these issues by combining analysis and action from a much broader perspective . <p> The right to be free from life-afflicting hunger is the most fundamental and the most obviously universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not guaranteed all others are ipso facto made irrelevant . For this reason , it has always been high on the list of those cited in solemn declarations of political intent , yet it is still the most violated in practice . This human right is not realized in the case of the over 800 million clinically hungry people nor the 120 million malnourished children under the age of five . <p> Our current approach of charity/noblesse oblige , combined in practice with pursuit of foreign policy goals , has led to an insufficient response to the plight of those who are malnourished . <p> With respect to world treaties , in every one of these treaties and covenants , food , nutritious and life-building , has been acknowledged as an imperative foundation to sustain life in dignity . Yet these treaties and commitments have been tragically ignored . Feeding the needy is still viewed as a charity the world nobly hands out to the poor , the disadvantaged , and the hungry . Every single religious teaching speaks of " feeding the hungry " as a basic religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own communities and in communities other than their own . <p> The problem is this . Despite the treaties , the good intentions , the proclaimed norms and works of charity , hunger has become a chronic condition for vast and growing numbers of human beings all over the world , not as the solemn obligation made by the international community of enforcing all human rights for all , the call proclaimed by the UN . Nutritious food , health care , adequate housing , proper education and work at livable wages are denied to vast numbers of people around the world in every continent . <p> Religious groups in spite of their proclaimed and actual commitment have not been able to do enough an amount that does not reach even 10 percent of what needs to be done . <p> I do not want to deny the very real and necessary contribution of these social justice workers , righteous people who believe that " the material needs of my neighbors are my spiritual needs " in the words of a Lithuanian rabbi . Nonetheless , we , workers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , and include the human rights framework in our action . This next step , I believe , will be for communities to learn about human rights as related to their daily concerns , making the connection to the struggles and aspirations of others , and joining in action against the severe violations their governments impose on human beings by not budgeting for " progressive realization " of economic , social and cultural rights . All the human rights of our neighbors must become our spiritual needs . <p> We are only beginning to take this next step . Activities around the 50th anniversary are introducing the idea of the unity of human rights to wider audiences . The efforts of Mary Robinson , the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the United Nations , strongly supported by economic human rights activists to mainstreaming human rights throughout the U.N . system has resulted , for example , in a recent UNDP policy paper that calls on all specialized agencies , intergovernmental and non-governmental groups to mainstream human rights and integrate human rights in sustainable human development , regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It emphasizes the legal obligation of all states and of UN agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization , World Health Organization , ILO , and UNDP " to promote the progressive realization " of these rights through development . <p> I would like to describe another implementation of this human rights approach . It was developed by the Peoples Decade for Human Rights Education ( PDHRE ) . PDHRE , especially its affiliate in Rosario , Argentina , has undertaken to mark the " 50th Anniversary and Beyond " , with a historic initiative whereby a whole community , its leaders , elected officials , and civil society examine traditional beliefs , its collective memory , and its aspirations as related to human rights and move into the 21st century as a " Human Rights Community . " <p> In a ceremony held in June , 1997 , the City of Rosario , its elected leadership and representatives of all its community groups , has undertaken to develop a sustainable human rights community . <p> What is a human rights community ? A human rights community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , learn about human rights obligations , relate human rights norms to their own immediate and practical concerns , and commit themselves to their application . They make a joint commitment to enter into a society-wide dialogue for the purpose of developing the guidelines of their " Human Rights Community . " <p> Rosario , population 1.2 million , is a middle class community . However , with downsizing and the closing of work places , it is having to face poverty and widespread unemployment as a " new " way of life . As a result , malnutrition has taken its toll on many families ' health in general , and particularly on childrens ability to actively participate in their schools . Specific concerns about malnutrition , poverty and work are ways in which the people of Rosario can be engaged in learning about human rights as related to their daily lives and concerns . <p> All organizations and their members , public and private , after learning about human rights , will join to monitor human rights in the community , document violations , and share their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public . This process will ideally make of each member of the community a human rights " educator " and a human rights " defender . " <p> As the citizens of Rosario view their lives from a human rights perspective , they will be empowered to develop the methodology to ensure that , in the future , all decisions , laws , policies , and communal relationships , and thus resource allocations within the community , will be informed by human rights norms and standards . <p> Like many other countries , Argentina has ratified every single human rights treaty , yet people know practically nothing about them or the fact that these international human rights laws must be enforced in their country . Thus , a basic premise of human rights education is the recognition that imposed ignorance is a human rights violation and must be redressed by informing the nations citizens of their rights , agreed to by their government . <p> Rosario provides a unique opportunity for people to engage collectively in claiming their human rights . Similar efforts to create inclusive human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mombai , India and in the nation of Mali . <p> People , especially those in most need of recognition of their human rights , do not know that they can claim these rights , much less establish procedures for advocacy and actions for social and economic justice . Many people struggle for justice which they inherently understand as the way to be in the world in dignity with one another , yet do not know that over the last 50 years , their hunger for a just world has been enunciated in a comprehensive , holistic body of norms and standards that powerfully acknowledge their right to be human . They are unaware of the fact that their own politicians have , at one or another point in the last 50 years , participated in developing these norms and standards and have made a commitment to enforce human rights by ratifying human rights conventions ; and by doing so have made an explicit commitment to scrutinize their country 's laws to be guided by human rights . The sad fact is that , in the words of Ivanka Corti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discrimination against Women , " millions of people will be born and die and will never know that they have human rights . " This is certainly true for those who are hungry . <p> It is up to the people of the world , and certainly us , who in our circumstances have been blessed with the freedom to learn and to act , to commit ourselves to transforming this situation . <p> Shulamith Koenig is founder and director of Peoples Decade for Human Rights Education , the initiator and promoter of The UN decade on Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 .

He fails to appreciate that the stance of critics of GE is a legacy of the well known negative ecological and social impacts that accompanied the first , chemical-intensive Green Revolution . Moreover , he fails to recognise that the fears about GE are not abstract but are concerns that are well-grounded empirically . <p> Proponents of GMOs have not been able to alleviate worries that transgenic foods have the potential for creating unexpected reactions in humans unless these foods , which have never been seen before and thus not selected for human consumption by eons of evolution , are tested rigorously in accordance with the universally recognized precautionary principle . Neither have they been able to allay worries that non-target populations might be negatively affected by genetic modification aimed at specific pests , as in the case of Bt corns impact on the monarch butterfly . Nor have they dispelled the very real threat of loss of biodiversity posed by GMOs . The risks are hardly trifling , as noted by one account : <p> The effects of transgenic crops on biodiversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Revolution . Not only is diversity decreased through the physical loss of species , but because of its ' live ' aspect , it has the potential to contaminate , and potentially to dominate , other strains of the same species . While this may be a limited concern with respect to the contamination of another commercial crop , it is significantly more worrisome when it could contaminate and eradicate generations of evolution of diverse and subtly differentiated strains of a single crop , such as the recently discovered transgenic contamination of landraces of indigenous corn in Mexico.3 <p> Colliers advocacy of GE is , in fact , out of line with even orthodox expert opinion at this point . The recently released International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge , Science , and Technology for Development ( IAASTD ) sponsored and funded by , among others , United Nations ( UN ) agencies , the World Bank , and other institutions failed to endorse GM crops , choosing instead to highlight the lingering doubts and uncertainties regarding their ecological and health impacts.4 <p> Colliers promotion of an African Green Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has been the non-development of commercial agriculture in Africa that has been responsible for the failure of supply to keep up with continental demand . Instead , ' over the past 40 years , African governments have worked to scale back large commercial agriculture . ' 5 For Collier , the solution to Africas food shortages are commercial agricultural farms employing genetically modified seeds . Further , peasant agriculture is part of the problem . Peasants , he says , are not entrepreneurs or innovators , being too concerned with their food security . Peasants would rather have jobs rather than be entrepreneurs , for which only a few people are fit . The most capable of fitting the role of innovative entrepreneurs are commercial farming operations : <p> ' Reluctant peasants are right : Their mode of production is ill-suited to modern agricultural production , in which scale is helpful . In modern agriculture , technology is fast-evolving , investment is lumpy , the private provision of transportation infrastructure is necessary to counter the lack of its public provision , consumer food chains are fast-changing and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising toward the holy grail of traceability of produce back to its source.6 ' <p> Colliers account has , at least , the merit of posing starkly a choice between peasant and small farmer-based agriculture and industrial agriculture as the solution to the worlds food needs . However , his choice , the ' Brazilian model ' of industrial agriculture , is not exactly one that would elicit enthusiasm , being a model identified with having placed tremendous stresses on the environment . Moreover , the Brazilian agro-enterprise is part of a larger system of global industrial agriculture , marked by large agribusiness that combines , monopolistic trading companies , long-distance transportation of food , and supermarkets , catering largely to the global elite and upper middle class . <p> This globalized system of production has created severe strains on the environment , effectively marginalized large numbers of people from the market , and contributed to greater poverty and greater income disparities within countries and globally . The Brazilian model is part of the problem but Collier 's awareness of the models systemic flaws only comes when he notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroying the rain forest , which has indeed happened in places where commercialism has gone unregulated. ' 7 <p> But what is most astounding in Colliers account is the absence of any reference to externally imposed policies that severely weakened agricultural capacity in a wide swath of developing countries and transitional economies . He notes that part of the problem in Africa has been the breaking down of publicly funded research stations that was part of a ' more widespread malfunctioning of the public sector . ' But he fails to point out that this breakdown was due to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank 's structural adjustment policies ( SAPs ) that systematically starved agriculture of state support . In October 2008 , a report by an independent evaluation team of the World Bank simply confirmed what others had pointed out for two decades : <p> ' Bank policies in the 1980s and 1990s that pushed African governments to cut or eliminate fertilizer subsidies , de-control prices and privatize may have improved fiscal discipline but did not accomplish much for food production . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers an incentive to grow more , while competition among private traders reduced the costs of seeds and fertilizer . But those market forces often failed to work as hoped . ' 8 <p> There was a link between the Brazilian model and SAPs . Both were central elements of a capitalist transformation of agriculture that was intended to integrate local food systems via trade liberalization , into a global system that is marked by a division of labor that would allegedly result in greater efficiency and greater prosperity in the aggregate . Collier fails to see that SAPs were the cutting edge of this process by seeking to supplant peasant producers with capitalist entrepreneurs who are producing not just for local but for global markets as one step towards large-scale globally integrated capitalist industrial agriculture . <p> Death of the peasantry ? <p> As for his put-down of peasants and small farmers , Collier is not unique . Many analysts share his view , some of them with progressive credentials . In his acclaimed 1994 book The Age of Extremes , Eric Hobsbawm wrote that ' the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social change of the second half of this century , ' one that cut ' us off forever from the world of the past.9 <p> Hobsbawms proclamation of their death as a class struck many as premature since as he himself noted , ' Admittedly regions of peasant dominance still represented half the human race at the end of our period . ' 10 Yet Hobsbawms views have a respectable pedigree . Marx himself compared peasants to a ' sack of potatoes ' with little real solidarity and even less class consciousness , and thus destined for the ash heap of history . <p> Yet peasants have refused to die and go gently into that good night to which Collier , Hobsbawm , and Marx have consigned them . Indeed , one year before Hobsbawms book was published , Via Campesina was founded in 1993 , and over the next decade this federation of peasants and small farmers would become an influential actor on the agriculture and trade scene globally . The spirit of internationalism and active identification of ones class interests with the universal interest of society that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display in the international peasant movement . <p> Certainly , de-peasantization and de-agrarianization have greatly advanced with globalization , with local self-subsistence production no longer , in many places , the escape that it usually provided for peasants who are caught up in market relations . Summing up a research on ' disappearing ' peasantries , Deborah Bryceson writes that under conditions of rapid globalization and neglected peasant hinterlands , peasants crossing international borders now provide a massive supply of labor for global capital . Although psychologically , many of these peasants still have the notion of a piece of land as a fallback in times of need , in fact , ' as a class , they face proletarianization by the force of global commodity and labor markets combined with government indifference . ' 11 <p> Yet the belief that the land is waiting , as a refuge of last resort , continues to persist among many peasants-turned-workers , among them those rural migrants in China who are returning en masse to the countryside as factories close owing to the spreading global recession.12 Indeed , peasants continue to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps nothing underlines this more than Mexican peasants who continue to plant corn for subsistence despite their having been priced out of the market by imported corn dumped by the United States . In other areas , small farmers have confounded those who have preached their demise by showing that labour-intensive small farms can be far more productive than big farms . To cite just one well known study , a World Bank report on agriculture in Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Colombia and Ecuador showed that small farms were three to 14 times more productive per acre than the large farms.13 <p> Perhaps the most significant recent development in the long struggle of the peasants as a class has been their organizing internationally to protect their interests from the steamroller of industrial capitalist agriculture . Via Campesina translated as the ' Peasant Way ' has not only been effective in mounting opposition to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) ; it has also offered an alternative paradigm for agricultural development called ' food sovereignty ' . The analysis and appeal of groups like Via Campesina resonate widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited under the conditions of inequitable globalization that in recent years , there has been a return to the countryside of significant numbers of both ex-peasants and semi-proletarians , such as the ex-urban dwellers that have driven the land occupations of the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra or Movement of the Landless ( MST ) in Brazil . <p> Indeed , not only in the South but also in the North , one witnesses farmers and others who seek to escape the dependency on capital by reproducing the peasant condition , where one works with nature from a limited resource base to create a condition of autonomy from the forces of capital and the market . The emergence of urban agriculture , the creation of networks linking consumers to farmers within a given region , the rise of new militant movements for land all these , according to Jan van der Ploeg , indicate a movement of ' repeasantization ' that has been created by the negative dynamics of ' Empire ' and seeks to reverse them . Under the conditions of the deep crisis of globalization , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasant principle , with its focus on the construction of an autonomous and self governed resource base , clearly specifies the way forward . ' 14 <p> Production paradigms in conflict <p> Romanticism , says Collier , is at the root of the increased salience of small-scale agriculture as an alternative to globalized farming in progressive circles . In this he is joined by some intellectuals of the left like Henry Bernstein , who refers to partisans of the new peasant movements as the ' new populists ' , implying their similarity to the Narodniks of pre-revolutionary Russia . But however their conditions and vicissitudes are analyzed by the intellectuals , some of whom even question the label ' peasant ' to describe many of them , small food producers are gathering allies , including many of the governments of the South , which torpedoed the Doha Round of the WTO by their stubbornly hanging on to their advocacy of ' Special Safeguard Mechanisms ' ( SSMs ) against agricultural imports and the designation of key commodities as ' Special Products ' ( SPs ) exempt from tariff liberalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . This resistance stemmed not only from the pressure exerted by groups like Via Campesina , which was not negligible , but to a growing sentiment in official circles that corporate industrial agriculture could not be allowed to completely restructure the global economy without any accountability . <p> More broadly , with environmental crises multiplying , the social dysfunctions of urban-industrial life piling up , and industrialized agriculture creating greater food insecurity , the ' peasant way ' has relevance not only to peasants but to everyone threatened by the catastrophic consequences of global capitals vision for organizing production , community , and life itself . It is this that lies at the heart of the ' romanticisation of the peasant ' that exercises Collier so much . <p> Ultimately , the battle between globalised agriculture and the new peasant movement will hinge on the question of food production carried out under different paradigms a global market-driven paradigm on the one hand and a local-market centered paradigm on the other . To people like Collier and Bernstein , the latter is no solution , with Bernstein asserting that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds population , which has grown so greatly almost everywhere in the modern epoch , in significant part because of the revolutions in productivity achieved by the development of capitalism . ' 15 <p> Partisans of the peasant way hotly dispute this , claiming that peasants and small farmers continue to be the backbone of global food production , constituting over a third of the worlds population and two thirds of the worlds food producers. 16 Indeed , according to agroecologist Miguel Altieri : <p> ' Millions of small farmers in the Global South still produce the majority of staple crops needed to feed the planets rural and urban populations . In Latin America , about 17 million peasant production units occupying close to 60.5 million hectares , or 34.5 per cent of the total cultivated land with average farm sizes of about 1.8 hectares , produce 51 per cent of the maize , 77 per cent of the beans , and 61 per cent of the potatoes for domestic consumption.17 <p> From the perspective of the defenders of peasant agriculture , it is capitalist industrial agriculture , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social relations , that is mainly responsible for todays food crises , and it points to a dead end both socially and ecologically . For instance , to capital , food , feed , and agrofuels are interchangeable as investment areas for capital , with rates of profit determining where investment will be allocated . Satisfying the real needs of the global majority is a secondary consideration , if indeed it enters the calculation at all . To the critics of capitalist agriculture , it is this devaluation and inversion of real relations into abstract relations of exchange otherwise known as commodification that is at the crux of the crisis of the contemporary food system . <p> Walden Bello is a Foreign Policy In Focus columnist , professor of sociology at the University of the Philippines and senior analyst at the Bangkok-based research and advocacy institute Focus on the Global South.This article is taken from the author 's upcoming book Food Wars , published by Verso Books .

@@75400223 @4100223/ <p> The 120th anniversary of Africas partition passed largely unmarked in November 2004 . While some no doubt would wonder what the significance of this is today those that are aware of the partition and its implications will be able to see its negative implication for Africas development and parallels with cold war era balkanization of the world into east versus west spheres of influence . Some would even argue that Hitlers brazen land grab or policy of " Lebensraum " in which the Nazis claimed expansionism and conquest was vital for the continued political and economic development of Germany sprang from the objectives of the <p> Berlin conference . Without doubt however the goal of the Berlin conference was to consolidate expansionism for resources and markets through negotiation rather than war . <p> Globalization came to Africa via the transatlantic slave trade about 500 years before the term became sexy or was even coined . This massive plundering and abuse of Africas most valuable resource its citizens provided millions of slave workers and stupendous profits for the forerunners of many of todays multi million dollar business empires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to have todays multinationals backed by states to forcibly recruit millions to work in factories and industries as slave labor for 400 years with absolutely no pay beyond food and water supported by floggings , amputations and hangings to keep the workers in line . The idea is not far fetched . The creation of an artificial class of non-persons by way of demonizing Jews created the slave labor for the companies behind the Nazi war production machine . If six million perished in Germany and some parts of Europe within six years in a state policy partially hidden from society but subsequently exposed , think what could have happened over a period of 400 years of unrestricted savagery by numerous states and a clearer picture emerges of the most savage , violent , and comprehensive mass violation of rights in human history . <p> Some experts squabble of whether Africa lost 25 , 50 million or 100 million to this bestial policy sanctioned by states , and use various criteria to compute varying figures abductees that actually arrived alive at slave plantations , those that ended up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those that died as a result of displacement and its consequences such as disease and hunger , children that died after loosing their families etc . This is beside the point . <p> Not only were millions in their youth and productive prime lost , millions more were psychologically destroyed and displaced and most importantly the development of society was more or less suspended for 400 years . We only need to look at the impact of the holocaust on Jews , or the current Darfur crisis to see what state sanctioned policies of destruction of a people can do to the stability , development and psychology of peoples and their societies . <p> But this is not the main focus of this write up . The significance of the above is that it was against this background that the Partition of Africa a continuation of the policy of plundering by other means from human to natural resources was enforced . The Berlin Conference of 1884 formalized the scramble for and partition of Africa by colonial powers . The conference was hosted by the German government of Otto Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploitation of its resources along the lines of modern day gangsters dividing cities into market spheres of influence to avoid arbitrary gang warfare that is bad for business . <p> By the end of the conference of 13 European powers and the United States , the template had been laid down for the creation or superimposition of roughly 50 countries the majority of which cut arbitrarily across the logic of nationality , geography , language or other uniting factors . The then major players were Britain , Germany , France , and Portugal , which between them already controlled most of the coastal territories where forts were established for protection of <p> trading companies . Belgium , Italy and Spain played supporting roles with the others haggling in vain for crumbs . The broad division that resulted was : <p> Great Britain pressed its naval and military advantage and secured Egypt , parts of Sudan , Uganda and Kenya ( or British East Africa ) , most of southern Africa including South Africa , Zambia , Zimbabwe ( or Rhodesia ) , Botswana and significant areas of West Africa especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and King Leopold II held tight to the Democratic Republic of Congo ( then known as Belgian Congo ) . <p> France secured most of western and central Africa , then known as French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa and later some of North Africa . <p> Portugal took Mozambique and Angola <p> Italy got Somalia ( Italian Somaliland ) and a portion of Ethiopia . <p> While Spain made do with the smallest territory Equatorial Guinea <p> ( Rio Muni ) . <p> The negative impact of the partition on Africa could not have been lost on the colonial powers especially Bismarck of Germany whose entire 40-year political career was devoted to the unification of Germanic states including fighting three wars including the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 and executing an endless series of diplomatic manoeuvres that played his neighbors against each other . ( The subsequent defeat of Germany in the first and second world wars led to the loss of its colonies . ) <p> For the " natives already disoriented by the slave trade and its consequences , expansionism , protectorates and artificial states not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant suppression and containment by state machineries designed for colonial rule . Colonial economies were not designed to develop the colonies but rather to create wealth for the colonial powers . An entire legislative framework and state apparatus was specifically designed to ensure that " the law " crushed any signs of dissidence . Sedition , criminal <p> defamation , insult laws , states of emergency , detention without trial , pass laws etc became key instruments of control by colonial authorities or white minority governments in southern Africa . These frameworks and culture of intolerance for opposing views were largely inherited by many African states and laid the foundation of institutional abuse of rights in many modern African countries today . <p> It is utterly impossible to sustain human rights within the context of unviable states , failed states , or states perpetually in a state of conflict either because they are an artificial construct with ruling elites based very narrowly ethnic , language , racial or other artificial divisions . Also , the artificial borders created by the partition of Africa broke apart ethnic nationalities and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . Ruling elites were cultivated either from minorities or majorities or artificially created and sustained using the army and or police . These divide and conquer policies were unsustainable indefinitely and it was just a matter of time before conflicts broke out over political or economic domination . In some countries , the process of independence leading to the withdrawal of colonial powers or served as the trigger for long suppressed divisions to boil over . Either way , the entire construct of these states was aimed at exploiting and violating the rights of citizens . <p> By the time of independence , many African countries were stuck with these artificial constructs and a change of guard offered no solution . Not insignificantly , the independence era coincided with the cold war era and any leaders actually asserting independence were promptly labeled communists and dispatched via coups , murder or both . Some countries such as the DRC are yet to recover from the consequences of such interference and disruption that led to the murder of its elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the imposition of Mobutu . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated African Unity and a reversal of the colonial borders and fiefdoms of new <p> political leaders then other insecure African governments anxious to maintain the status quo also opposed them . Where soldiers were not directly prompted to seize power , the fragile nature of many states and their non productive nature meant that in the struggle for political power , the most organized and best armed body of men would inevitably become aware of their potential power and sweep squabbling politicians aside . The assumption of power by armies largely trained to serve colonial interests by holding down populations could only lead to more institutional violation of rights . Despite their occasional anti-imperialist posturing and theatrics designed to confuse issues and consolidate their hold on power , this was the true nature of the Mobutus and Idi Amins . <p> The cold war also resulted in prolonging the life of white minority rule in southern Africa as the liberation movements were seen as pro-communist or socialist and the white minority governments pro-west and pro-capitalist . Cold war rivals sustained all sorts of undemocratic governments of the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arena of conflict . In other words , the interruption of social , economic and political development by four centuries of slavery , the repressive legislative frameworks , state apparatus , institutions and culture created by colonial authorities , the non-productive nature of many economies , the non-viability of others , artificially constructed states , long periods of military or civilian dictatorships that plundered the countries , the <p> cold war fall out and so forth have all combined to create the present political culture and political economy which prevails in much of Africa and makes it difficult if not impossible to uphold human rights in a sustainable form . Any move away from this past which had as its central feature the institutional violation of rights must therefore have as its new central feature , the institutional promotion of rights . It is not a coincidence that the new African Union has emerged in a decade that has seen more elections in Africa than in the last 40 to 50 years of independence of most Africa countries . In the case of some southern African countries , independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Compared to the relative 600 to 700 years of stability and development in Europe only accelerated or held back by revolution or war for certain periods its easy to see why Africa remains the least developed continent despite its potential . The context becomes clearer in comparison with the Asian colonies that had their civilizations , cultures and developmental trajectories affected by decades of colonialism but crucially not suspended or destroyed by 400 years of slavery followed by carving up and imposition of mostly artificial <p> states . The result is that Asia has an unbroken sense of history and culture and recovered quickly but not yet completely from colonialism . <p> In the case of China and Japan , the results of relative lack of disruption are clear to see . Were it not for the immortality of the pyramids , mummification techniques that indicate advancements in medical science and undeniable archaeological evidence of several African civilizations thousands of years older than many European and Asian civilizations , Africa and civilization would never be mentioned in the same breath . As it stands , Hollywood is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt by white actors . <p> This travesty and violation of historical and cultural rights can only be equaled by a spectacle of African actors portraying ancient Greece , Rome or China without any sense of irony . <p> The largely unbroken development of Europe over the last few centuries also explains why modern day European military dictatorships such as Franco in Spain , Salazar in Portugal or more recently in Greece and the Balkans did not fundamentally upset the development of those societies even though some of them and Franco in particular lasted over 30 years longer than most African dictatorships . Even where as in the case of Hitler and Mussolini dictatorship and war led to destruction , the Marshall plan with its more or less free billions of dollars reconstructed and even gave impetus to further development of those societies . <p> Most importantly and not surprisingly , major European governments subsequently came to the conclusion that the creation of a European Union would help break the cycle of wars and conflict in Europe and create the developmental basis for future socio economic and political stability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European level core rights instruments , which provide more protection to citizens than the rights regimes in many individual countries hence the tendency to resort to the European Courts for the protection of rights , denied in country . " I will go to Europe " has become a fashionable slang <p> by many that feel cheated and unprotected . <p> The adoption of several rights based treaties and protocols by the new African Union is a step in the right direction and the recent declaration of a treaty signing week within the last month shows that the Commission of the African Union in particular clearly understands the role that promotion of rights can play in the development of modern society . The mission , vision and strategic plan promoted by the Commission 's current Chair Prof. Alpha Konare are evidence of this . It is far from clear however that many African governments understand this as evidenced by the lethargy towards signing , ratifying and institutionalizing instruments that will enhance the protection of rights such as the African Court of Human Rights /Court of Justice and the Protocol for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reversed . The broad sketches of African and world history and development above demonstrate that no where on the planet is the institutionalization of rights more crucial to development than in Africa . <p> The political integration of Africa is aimless and doomed unless done on a rights basis that reverses hundreds of years of a largely imposed political culture rights abuses which can in turn unleash its creative and developmental potential . The protection of rights can also not be sustained on the basis of underdevelopment . Governments largely based on exploitation , preservation of ruling elites , or that preside over underdeveloped societies tend to deny free expression and core rights of association , assembly , political participation and ignore key economic and social rights such as health care , housing , food security and so forth . The summary and core of the rights imperative is that all societies need these rights to develop and can not develop further without the protection of these rights . <p> Sankore is Coordinator of CREDO for Freedom of Expression &amp; Associated Rights , an NGO focusing on rights issues in Africa ..

The creation of a statement of rights , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and the United Nations , which establishes means by which the nations of the world may take steps to protect these rights , together represent a fundamental step forward for mankind . <p> The development of the human rights system , which grew from the UNDHR , now provides a potent , but underused , alternative for combating world hunger . This anniversary , in our view , requires development professionals and institutions concerned with world hunger to learn and use the human rights approach to improve the food security of the over 800 million undernourished persons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies in this effort the very people who suffer from hunger and malnutrition , as well as possibly not without a struggle ! the states of which they are citizens . <p> The education and advocacy effort in this 50th Anniversary year seeks to bring back into focus and advance human rights objectives . As originally proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948 territories under their jurisdiction . <p> The international human rights system of norms , institutions and procedures to protect and promote human rights constitutes one of the three pillars of the UN Charter . Along with activities to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , human rights are of growing value and potential benefit to the nutrition of all the world 's people in the 21st century . <p> International human rights is both a moral code and a world legal code . <p> It is a moral code , as it expresses , perhaps imperfectly , and in legal terms , the outline of what many hundreds of millions of people think is a basis for human relations . It is an expression , not the only one , of peoples beliefs about how they should be considered and treated as human beings . These rights have been expressed and fought for over millennia , principally against their governments which have not been " of the people " but rather have been governments of conquest and of economic , military and political might directed against the powerless , those who have few , or no , rights . <p> It is also a world legal code , and this is also very important . The code consists of a number of conventions and other legal texts . Most of those conventions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of states . The situation with respect to five key treaties is summarized in the table accompanying the Marchione article . Ratification obliges the state to take steps to implement these conventions through legal and administrative measures to the maximum of their available resources . The quality of a state 's performance is judged by its progress toward meeting these human rights norms . <p> Translating these norms into political and practical goals for human and national development would link the international human rights system with national priority settings , resource allocation , planning and management . Omitting to do so basically means breaching international law for which states , in principle , can be held accountable . This monitoring and " calling to account " can and should be done by their citizens . The international human rights system of institutions and monitoring procedures , although not yet perfect , has been developed to supervise this and to provide for constructive dialogue with member states on any obstacles and opportunities for improved conduct . <p> To respect , protect , facilitate and as necessary , fulfill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens can be aided by international legally binding instruments if they are transformed into national legislation and corresponding administrative regulations . This will result in protection coming about not through charity or at the whims of political will , but in the form of responses to legitimate claims of rights that people have under international human rights law , including the rights to access to adequate food and to the conditions that will foster good nutrition throughout the life cycle . <p> In short , implemented human rights are powerful tools in the hunger fight , yet the international food and nutrition community has , with notable exceptions , hardly looked into the system . It is their obligation to learn it and see whether and how it could be of use to shape programs and strengthen advocacy , making states and all the agents within them more accountable in fulfilling their obligations to help improve the food and nutrition situation of their citizens . <p> As a step toward improved understanding , this issue directly addresses three common misunderstandings about the right to food : <p> A right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of human rights . The concept of a right to food is too theoretical : It is food that is needed . There is no need to establish a right to food . Rights make people lazy . This issue illustrates how events leading up to this human rights anniversary make it especially significant to world hunger issues . Among these changes have been the global sea change brought about by the end of the Cold War , the rise of power of civil society and NGOs , and specific international agreements , particularly the World Food Summit at the end of 1996 . <p> Arne Oshaug and Wenche Barth-Eide highlight the opportunities afforded in the follow-up to the World Food Summit . In elucidating the meaning of the right to food in commitment 7.4 in the 1996 Rome Declaration , actions are underway to clarify the obligation of states and the international community . This clarification , we think , will result in the understanding that states will be obliged to respect and protect peoples resources and entitlements and to facilitate their efforts to overcome undernutrition . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond with government programs , such as food stamps , that are direct feeding programs . The education and advocacy effort for food and the right to earn sufficient income to provide adequate nutrition , is , as Michael Windfuhr argues , that NGOs can contribute considerably to interpreting and advancing the obligations of states to realize food and nutrition rights of individuals under their jurisdiction . Uwe Kracht points out that the 1996 World Food Summit challenged the international community to give operational meaning to the human right to food . <p> Tom Marchione , in the article on nutrition practice after the Cold War , explains why the food and nutrition community now has special responsibility to look to the international human rights system for support . In part to take advantage of a liberalizing political environment , and in part because of the increasing need for protection of the individual in many parts of the world against adverse nutritional effects of such phenomena as rapid globalization , economic and trade liberalization , profit-driven food research , increased conflict , especially within states , and reduction of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , that responses to food rights claims should not primarily be carried out through measures such as unsustainable feeding programs but rather by including people in the productive economic system , ideally at increasing levels of nutrition and income . The nutritionist and food security expert must know how rights strengthen entitlements of families to the resources and conditions they must have so nutrition rights can be achieved before resorting to direct government programs becomes necessary . <p> Ultimately under democratic states human rights will have free play . The ideal of creating communities that understand human rights , as described by Shulamith Koenig , will reshape the basis of life at the grassroots level and make the continuing existence of hunger an impossibility . <p> In conclusion , application of the right to food and nutrition as human rights is not an alternative to ongoing efforts to reduce hunger and improve nutritional conditions . Rather , a human rights perspective constitutes an added dimension to present practice , with admittedly important changes in planning , decision making , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redirect all food and nutrition-related development activities , rather than replacing them , and as such would enhance effectiveness in fighting hunger and malnutrition . Unlike the technical efforts to overcome hunger , rights imply accountability , not only of the international community , but also of the domestic community government organizations , private corporations , and non-governmental organizations . However , the strongest contribution of rights is that they provide universal norms across the entire spectrum of economic , political and social activity , within which disparate organizations can cooperate in forging a more decent world . A world that will be rid of hunger early in the 21st century , and a global culture befitting the dignity of the human race . <p> Tom Marchione , Ph.D. , anthropologist , serves as an Evaluation Officer and Nutrition Advisor to the Bureau for Humanitarian Response at the United States Agency for International Development , where he evaluates assistance programs , and advises on aspects of nutrition and food security .

It is a particular hazard for populations affected by emergencies who rely for years on food aid which is typically poor in vitamin A content . Vitamin A is available mostly from meats and green leafy vegetables . Because vitamin A deficiency promotes not only more infections but also increases the fatality rate from infections , it underpins a great proportion of the deaths that occur in emergencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains for long periods are prone to zinc mineral deficiency , which stunts growth , though much of the evidence on this is recent . <p> Niacin deficiency , resulting in pellagra , is likely to occur in the ever-growing populations reliant on maize consumption ( i.e. , much of sub-Saharan Africa , and most of the population in southern and eastern Africa . Niacin deficiency is therefore localized to those areas where maize consumption is dominant . Because the niacin in maize is trapped , and biologically unavailable , populations consuming maize are particularly vulnerable to pellagra . Mozambican refugees living in Malawi in the late 1980s experienced a large pellagra epidemic that has subsequently dramatized the importance of paying attention to the niacin content of diets . Niacin-deficiency pellagra is not only associated with emergencies , but is also pervasive today in maize-reliant countries from Tanzania to Mozambique . <p> Beriberi is a thiamin ( vitamin B1 ) deficiency seen in various refugee communities that consume primarily polished rice , without other sources of B vitamins . Because it is associated with rice-based diets , this deficiency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even more localized than niacin and B1 deficiencies is vitamin C deficiency , which results in scurvy . Almost all the outbreaks of scurvy have occurred among Ethiopian and Somali emergency victims , principally those who have been cut off from camel milk markets for months . Though striking as an indicator of poor dietary variety , scurvy itself is not felt to be a pervasive risk nor a major life risk the way vitamin A deficiency can be . <p> Though not particular to emergencies , iodine deficiencies are particular to the poorest and more remote populations in the world . In any case , it has been important for aid agencies , such as the World Food Program ( WFP ) , and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , to promote adherence to strict standards of salt iodination in countries where they work , that is , only purchasing iodized salt for ration distributions . This can reinforce national efforts to encourage small-scale salt sellers to iodize salt as per regulations . <p> There are other micronutrients that are required in all diets , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium , magnesium , and vitamins B2 , B12 , D , and K. <p> Food Response Limitations <p> Most efforts to deal with vitamin and mineral gaps have been untimely , and have been undertaken only on a clinical or therapeutic basis , as , for example , when a child is referred to a supplementary feeding center . This misses opportunities for prevention and neglects the larger population , where subclinical deficiencies pose a much larger problem than the few clinical cases that are brought to the attention of health providers . <p> The problem historically is that there have been few foods that have the requisite micronutrient(s) , and those that do , such as Corn-Soy Blend , Animus , and Wheat Soy Blend , tend to be considerably more expensive than bulk grains . This is especially a problem when over four-fifths of blended foods delivered worldwide comes from the United States and U.S. food aid is appropriated in dollar , or total cost terms . <p> The extrusion , processing , and packaging attendant to making blended foods means that they tend to cost between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make up the bulk of the general refugee ration , cost significantly less , between $90 and $200 to procure . Thus , two to four times more emergency victims can be fed using bulk grains than blended foods . <p> Faced with this tradeoff , most aid agencies choose to reach the greater number of people with the resources available , using the enriched foods primarily for selective ( supplementary ) feedings where they are targeted to those persons who already manifest deficiencies . <p> Another difficulty is that blended foods also spoil more readily . Blended foods and flours are more prone to infestation and fungus spoilage . Frequently , entire batches need to be condemned and destroyed . <p> A further problem encountered with blended foods is that they are not consumed in equal amounts by all who who would benefit from them . Studies in Central America , the Horn of Africa and Asia have repeatedly shown that recipients of food aid exchange and trade foods between households , and , even within families , foods are consumed in different proportions . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while adults will eat more of the whole grains and purchased meats and other foods . <p> Over and over , it has been shown that families conduct a range of transactions , such as sales , bartering and gifts , that result in many families eating little or none of some food items included in the ration ? whether the vegetable oil , the beans , or the blended food . ( Recent research on this subject , conducted by Barbara Reed of Cornell , and by Catherine Mears and Helen Young of Oxfam , will be discussed at the workshop ) . <p> Only the grains , the basic food aid ration , are eaten by everyone . Thus , an effective way to supply micronutrients to the entire population receiving food aid is to fortify these grains , wheat , maize and rice , that are most of people 's food ration . ( Fortification refers to the addition of nutrients to foodstuffs somewhere in the food processing cycle for the purpose of restoring-- often nutrients are lost in processing-- or enhancing the nutritional quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years research has been focused on finding ways to fortify these grains . <p> Options for fortification are dependent on the state of science in food chemistry ? finding ways to add nutrients that do not adversely change the taste , appearance or smell of the food . <p> Nutritionists have long felt that fortification is affordable and effective , and brings a high return on investment . Fortification of basic foods with micronutrients is such common practice in developed countries that it is rarely debated . For example , in most European countries flour is fortified with thiamin , riboflavin , pyridoxine , niacin , calcium and iron . The World Bank , in its 1993 annual report , argued that micronutrient interventions like fortification are among the most cost-effective programs known for improving health and reducing disability-adjusted life-years . <p> During the 1990s , studies by OMNI , the Micronutrient Initiative of Canada , and private groups have looked at the feasibility , costs , and current practice of field-based fortification . During the last two years , it has become increasingly apparent that there are numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many micronutrients at once . <p> Field-based fortification is less expensive for several reasons . <p> First , the addition of micronutrients does not have to include the costs associated with the inclusion of protein , which drives up the cost of CSM . ( Blended foods are produced using gelatinized cornmeal or wheat flour , de-fatted soy flour and soy oil , and then an added mix of six essential minerals and 11 vitamins ) . <p> Secondly , with fortification in the field , extended storage , with the consequent danger of spoilage , is much less of a problem . <p> Finally , the costs of adding the micronutrient is reduced as labor is available on site and much less elaborate ( and costly ) packaging is required . <p> By fortifying flour at the point of milling in a refugee camp , the shelf-life of the grain is maximized while still adding vitamins and minerals close in time to their being eaten . <p> Adding an off-the-shelf micronutrient mix after the milling of a grain into flour is the logical point of fortification . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee camps . And in some camps , the WFP , or NGOs such as the International Rescue Committee , provide small mills as well . Though these small commercial hammer and plate mills generate great heat in grinding the grain , there is no reason that micronutrient mix can not be added immediately afterward , either by hand , or by a batch mixer or , if necessary , by in-line dosing equipment . <p> Technologies pioneered under support from the Micronutrient Initiative of Canada will be demonstrated and explained at the workshop . For example , ODJOB is a plastic blender that can be easily introduced at any field site for batch mixing of a premix with flour . Related low-cost efforts by MI funded field trials in Zambia and Zimbabwe , working with NGOs . <p> Fortification can also be approached at a regional level , where food aid passes through more sophisticated roller mills to produce flour . Ironically , much of the experience in the poorer countries is in fortifying animal feeds-- though the premix and dosing techniques-- are the same for enhancing foods for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field-based fortification as both an immediate response to nutritional needs of a target population and as a means to initiate and promote fortification practice into local industry practice . Field-based fortification salt iodination is well established in most of Latin America and Asia . Sugar fortification with vitamin A is now implemented on a regular basis in Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador . In the Philippines , rice is routinely fortified by small millers with thiamin , and more recently by them with iron . <p> Many of these best practices will be discussed at the April workshop ; and will become part of an ongoing dialogue about how to deliver appropriate nutritional foods to refugee and displaced populations in various field-based situations . <p> Steve Hansch is organizing the April conference for the Congressional Hunger Center , and is an editor of Hunger Notes . 
@@75400269 @4100269/ <p> Hunger is a term which has three meanings ( Oxford English Dictionary 1971 ) <p> the uneasy or painful sensation caused by want of food ; craving appetite . Also the exhausted condition caused by want of food <p> the want or scarcity of food in a country <p> a strong desire or craving <p> World hunger refers to the second definition , aggregated to the world level . The related technical term ( in this case operationalized in medicine ) is either malnutrition , or , if malnutriton is taken to refer to both undernutrtion and overnutrition , undernutrition . Both malnutriton and undernutriton have been used to refer to not having enough food . <p> There are two basic types of malnutrition . The first and most important is protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) . It is basically a lack of calories and protein . Food is converted into energy by humans , and the energy contained in food is measured by calories . Protein is necessary for key body functions including provision of essential amino acids and development and maintenance of muscles . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malnutrition that is referred to when world hunger is discussed . <p> The second type of malnutrition , also very important , is micronutrient ( vitamin and mineral ) deficiency . This is not the type of malnutrition that is referred to when world hunger is discussed , though it is certainly very important . <p> No one really knows how many people are malnourished . The statistic most frequently cited is that of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , which measures ' undernutrition ' . did not publish an estimate in its most recent publication , ' The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2011 ' as it is undertaking a major revision of how it estimates food insecurity ( FAO 2011 p. 10 ) . The 2010 estimate , the most recent , says that 925 million people were undernourished in 2010 ( FAO 2010 ) . As the figure below shows , the number of hungry people has increased since 1995-97 . The increase has been due to three factors : 1 ) neglect of agriculture relevant to very poor people by governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , and 3 ) the significant increase of food prices in the last several years which has been devastating to those with only a few dollars a day to spend . 925 million people is 13.6 percent of the estimated world population of 6.8 billion . Nearly all of the undernourished are in developing countries . <p> Number of hungry people , 1969-2010Source : FAO <p> In round numbers there are 7 billion people in the world . Thus , with an estimated 925 million hungry people in the world , 13.1 percent , or almost 1 in 7 people are hungry . <p> The FAO estimate is based on statistical aggregates . The FAO first estimates the total food supply of a country and derives the average per capita daily food intake from that . The distribution of average food intake for people in the country is then estimated from surveys measuring food expenditure . Using this information , and minimum food energy requirements , FAO estimates how many people are likely to receive such a low level of food intake that they are undernourished.3 <p> Undernutrition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be taken as similar to malnutrition . ( It should be said as an aside , that the idea of undernourishment , its relationship to malnutrition , and the reasons for its emergence as a concept is not clear to Hunger Notes . ) <p> Children are the most visible victims of undernutrition . Children who are poorly nourished suffer up to 160 days of illness each year . Poor nutrition plays a role in at least half of the 10.9 million child deaths each year--five million deaths . Undernutrition magnifies the effect of every disease , including measles and malaria . The estimated proportions of deaths in which undernutrition is an underlying cause are roughly similar for diarrhea ( 61% ) , malaria ( 57% ) , pneumonia ( 52% ) , and measles ( 45% ) ( Black 2003 , Bryce 2005 ) . Malnutrition can also be caused by diseases , such as the diseases that cause diarrhea , by reducing the body 's ability to convert food into usable nutrients . <p> According to the most recent estimate that Hunger Notes could find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children in developing countries--one of three ( de Onis 2000 ) . Geographically , more than 70 percent of malnourished children live in Asia , 26 percent in Africa and 4 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean . In many cases , their plight began even before birth with a malnourished mother . Under-nutrition among pregnant women in developing countries leads to 1 out of 6 infants born with low birth weight . This is not only a risk factor for neonatal deaths , but also causes learning disabilities , mental , retardation , poor health , blindness and premature death . <p> The world produces enough food to feed everyone . World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago , despite a 70 percent population increase . This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories ( kcal ) per person per day according to the most recent estimate that we could find . ( FAO 2002 , p.9 ) . The principal problem is that many people in the world do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough food . <p> What are the causes of hunger is a fundamental question , with varied answers . <p> Poverty is the principal cause of hunger . The causes of poverty include poor people 's lack of resources , an extremely unequal income distribution in the world and within specific countries , conflict , and hunger itself . As of 2008 ( 2005 statistics ) , the World Bank has estimated that there were an estimated 1,345 million poor people in developing countries who live on $1.25 a day or less.3 This compares to the later FAO estimate of 1.02 billion undernourished people . Extreme poverty remains an alarming problem in the worlds developing regions , despite some progress that reduced " dollar--now $1.25-- a day " poverty from ( an estimated ) 1900 million people in 1981 , a reduction of 29 percent over the period . Progress in poverty reduction has been concentrated in Asia , and especially , East Asia , with the major improvement occurring in China . In Sub-Saharan Africa , the number of people in extreme poverty has increased . The statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though correct , unsatisfying . Why then are ( so many ) people poor ? The next section summarizes Hunger Notes answer . <p> Harmful economic systems are the principal cause of poverty and hunger . Hunger Notes believes that the principal underlying cause of poverty and hunger is the ordinary operation of the economic and political systems in the world . Essentially control over resources and income is based on military , political and economic power that typically ends up in the hands of a minority , who live well , while those at the bottom barely survive , if they do . We have described the operation of this system in more detail in our special section on Harmful economic systems . <p> Conflict as a cause of hunger and poverty . At the end of 2005 , the global number of refugees was at its lowest level in almost a quarter of a century . Despite some large-scale repatriation movements , the last three years have witnessed a significant increase in refugee numbers , due primarily to the violence taking place in Iraq and Somalia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees under UNHCRs mandate exceeded 10 million . The number of conflict-induced internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) reached some 26 million worldwide at the end of the year . Providing exact figures on the number of stateless people is extremely difficult But , important , ( relatively ) visible though it is , and anguishing for those involved conflict is less important as poverty ( and its causes ) as a cause of hunger . ( Using the statistics above 1.02 billion people suffer from chronic hunger while 36 million people are displaced UNHCR 2008 ) <p> Hunger is also a cause of poverty , and thus of hunger . By causing poor health , low levels of energy , and even mental impairment , hunger can lead to even greater poverty by reducing people 's ability to work and learn , thus leading to even greater hunger . <p> The target set at the 1996 World Food Summit was to halve the number of undernourished people by 2015 from their number in 1990-92 . ( FAO uses three year averages in its calculation of undernourished people . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries was 824 million in 1990-92 . In 2010 , the number had climbed to 925 million people . The WFS goal is a global goal adopted by the nations of the world ; the present outcome indicates how marginal the efforts were in face of the real need . <p> So , overall , the world is not making progress toward the world food summit goal , although there has been progress in Asia , and in Latin America and the Caribbean . <p> Quite a few trace elements or micronutrients--vitamins and minerals--are important for health . 1 out of 3 people in developing countries are affected by vitamin and mineral deficiencies , according to the World Health Organization . Three , perhaps the most important in terms of health consequences for poor people in developing countries , are : <p> Vitamin A Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness and reduces the body 's resistance to disease . In children Vitamin A deficiency can also cause growth retardation . Between 100 and 140 million children are vitamin A deficient . An estimated 250,000 to 500 000 vitamin A-deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 12 months of losing their sight . ( World Health Organization ) <p> Iodine Iodine deficiency disorders ( IDD ) jeopardize childrens mental health often their very lives . Serious iodine deficiency during pregnancy may result in stillbirths , abortions and congenital abnormalities such as cretinism , a grave , irreversible form of mental retardation that affects people living in iodine-deficient areas of Africa and Asia . IDD also causes mental impairment that lowers intellectual prowess at home , at school , and at work . IDD affects over 740 million people , 13 percent of the worlds population . Fifty million people have some degree of mental impairment caused by IDD ( World Health Organization ) .

@@75400275 @4100275/ <p> Conflicts , especially those that occur within countries , are characterized both by intergroup divisions and by connections between the warring groups . <p> In spite of their best efforts to maintain non-partisanship in relation to the warring sides , international aid agencies inevitably affect these intergroup dividers and connectors . They can exacerbate , reinforce or prolong conflict by feeding into and worsening intergroup dividers or by ignoring and undermining intergroup connectors . On the other hand , their assistance can also help reduce intergroup dividers and/or build on and strengthen the connectors between people on different sides of a conflict . <p> By analyzing the context of a conflict and their aid program , humanitarian and development aid providers can do the good they mean to doalleviating human suffering and promoting sustainable enterprisesand , at the same time , encourage and enhance people 's capacities to disengage from conflict and find non-war options for solving problems . <p> These claims are neither theoretical nor speculative . They are based on the broad experience of many aid agencies providing assistance in many conflict areas in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working collaboratively , a number of aid agencies joined together with support from several donor governments , to understand how aid and conflict interact . In place after place , in spite of the differences that exist among cultures , types of wars and aid agencies and projects , aids effects on conflict followed similar and predictable patterns . <p> Theft is the most widely recognized process by which aid can feed into conflict . Theft is an issue of particular relevance to food providers.In the following excerpt from the book , Do No Harm1 , we outline some of the practical lessons the Local Capacities for Peace Project has learned about theft and how aid providers can reduce it to mitigate its impact upon conflict . <p> Because aid resources represent economic wealth and political power , people engaged in the struggles of war will always want to control them . <p> It would be oddeven subversive to their causeif they did not do so . Thus , it can be unproductive and naive for aid providers to expect warlords to accept fully the humanitarian principle that victims on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the " enemy " receives any kind of support , including humanitarian aid , it is always viewed as counter to the sought-after victory . <p> Warriors often steal aid goods and use these resources to finance their war efforts . Stolen food aid , blankets , vehicles and communications systems can be used by armies directly or be sold to buy the supplies they need . Theft is the most widely recognized process by which aid feeds into conflict . <p> In order to steal , thieves need information about what , where and when goods are or will be available . They need a location where they can gain control of the goods ( a check point , a narrow road , a warehouse ) . They need to know that there will be enough goods of enough value to make the theft worthwhile . They need to be able " to get away with it " not to be caught or , if caught , held accountable for their actions . <p> Strategies to avoid theft must disrupt one or more of these . Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some aid agencies deliver goods unannounced , episodically , according to no fixed schedule and never to the same location twice so thieves do not have sufficient knowledge to steal . Some advertise broadly their planned aid deliveries using radio , megaphones , bulletins or t.v. , so that communities for whom the aid is intended can hold thieves accountable if they do not receive what they expect . Some agencies consciously lower the re-sale value of their aid goods without damaging their usefulness , thus undermining thieves ' incentives . Others make theft so inconvenient that the effort required is not worth the return . <p> Strategies for delivering aid secretly thwart thieves ' need for knowledge . Strategies for dispersing aid thwart both opportunity and incentives . Strategies for lowering the resale value of aid also undermine incentives . Strategies for informing and involving civilian communities in monitoring the distribution of aid address the issues of impunity . <p> Below , we cite examples from a number of field sites . While each of these strategies made sense in the place where it was tried , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers always have to consider the realities in their own circumstance in order to come up with an effective approach that fits the realities in that setting . The Analytical Framework presented above helps aid workers consider what approaches could work in their immediate situations . The examples given here provide rich background that can prompt unconventional and imaginative ideas about what to do in other locations . <p> Not Worth the Effort . In Somalia , the Red Cross distributed blankets to families . Theft was common as blankets were scarce and profits could be made by their resale . Agency staff began to cut each blanket in half . Families could easily sew their blankets back together for use . Resale value dropped . In other situations , aid agencies have ceased delivery of high priced grains and substituted sorghum or other less valuable but equally nourishing products . The food sustains recipients ' health but , because resale is not lucrative , there is little incentive for theft . <p> +Making Theft Inconvenient . An aid worker who has supervised many deliveries of grain and cooking oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he routinely punches a hole with his knife in each bag of grain and removes the lids from the oil cans . Individual families can carry a bag of grain carefully , holding the hole closed to prevent spillage . They can stuff a bit of straw into the opening of an oil can so it does not leak out.But , when thieves load cut bags into the back of their trucks , much of the grain is lost as the bags bounce around . Oil cans piled in a truck slosh and spill and , finally , begin to slip and slide . The weight of shifting oil cans has , on occasion , caused trucks to tip over so that everything is lost ! <p> +Dispersal . In Cambodia , one aid agency needed to bring large amounts of cash to an outlying field site to pay local staff . When the cargo plane carrying bags of cash arrived at the airport , numerous small vehicles met it . One bag was loaded into the trunk of a passenger car and the driver drove away . Two bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took off . A jeep took two ; a cart was loaded with one . Each of these carriers took a different route to the office where the comptroller paid staff salaries as the money arrived . It was too much work for thieves to locate and stop so many vehicles ; if they got one or two , the losses to the project were minimal . Gains to the thieves were not worth the effort . <p> +Dispersal in a Hurry . In Tajikistan , UNHCR imported housing materials for communities to rebuild war-damaged homes . These materials were in great demand . The local authorities that had seized their positions in the recent war used their control of local rail and trucking to divert large amounts of the material . Field staff knew that theft usually occurred at night and that a few watchmen would be powerless against the gangs . They organized the massive and immediate distribution of the materials , on the day that they arrived by train , ensuring that they were in the hands of the recipient communities by nightfall . They hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of communities , the building supplies were better protected . Dispersal of goods and putting them in the hands of those who would use them reduced the ready opportunity for thieves to steal and heightened community ability to hold thieves accountable . <p> +Identifying Thieves . In a West African country , one agency worked with women on public health issues . As part of this program , they distributed inexpensive radios to village women so they could tune in to a weekly series of programs designed to focus on rebuilding the civil society . Soon , all these radios were stolen . So , the agency staff thought again . They reissued radiosthis time painted a bright pink . Any man seen with a pink radio was immediately accosted by others and challenged . No one could easily get away with stealing these radios . <p> +Civilian Protectors . During one period of work in Chechnya , aid agency vehicles traveling between communities were often the objects of theft , either being stolen themselves or providing the focus where aid workers were taken hostage ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuables were stolen . Drivers were always told not to pick up hitch-hikers . However , some began to realize that if they offered a ride to elderly men from the local communities , and sat them prominently in the front seat of the truck , the car-jackings were less likely . This was because any action taken against a vehicle in which a respected elder was riding would be considered a hostile act by his clan . Reprisals would follow . The theft of aid goods would be associated with disruption of inter-clan relations , and these were closely guarded and controlled by elder councils . The " costs " of theft thus became too high to make it worthwhile . <p> +Glut the Market . In Afghanistan , a World Food Programme ( WFP ) staff person told of distributing seeds within the volatile circumstances of local , inter-group fighting . During the first year it was possible for one group to control the seeds but after that first year , because farmers will propagate , sell and trade seeds , seed value fell and everyone had access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods to glut the market . The resale value to thieves becomes marginal . A caution : these goods must not be in competition with locally produced goods or they will undermine local production and increase dependency on outside aid . This strategy should only be used when goods can not also be produced in the recipient site . <p> Some options have been tried to avoid theft that , later , have been found to have a negative impact . These include : hiring armed guards to ride with convoys or to protect warehouses ; threatening to pull aid programs out of a region if goods are stolen ; and hiring local merchants to manage delivery . In some cases , hiring armed guards or threatening to withdraw can reinforce a war culture and hiring local merchants can reinforce a war economy by making the continuation of aid ( hence , the war that prompts it ) profitable . <p> The implications of these lessons about theft are clear.However , the theft of aid resources is just one way that aid can feed into a conflict.The Local Capacities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political resources represented by aid , including food aid , affect conflict . <p> +Aid affects markets , either reinforcing the war economy or reinforcing the peace economy ; <p> +Aid substitutes for local resources that would have been required to meet civilian needs , freeing them up to support conflict ; and <p> +Aid legitimizes people and their actions/agendas , either supporting the pursuit of war or the pursuit of peace . <p> While solutions to these other situations may be more complicated than those for theft , experience shows it is neither inevitable nor excusable that aid should worsen conflict . Aid agency staff have ample knowledge based on past field experience of how aid affects conflict . They can predict , and thus prevent , the repeated patterns by which aid worsens intergroup tensions . They can identify existing connectors among groups and design their programs in ways that build on and support these .

The amount of subsidies a cow in the developed world receives is almost twice the annual income of an average farmer in the Third World . <p> In the European Union , for instance , annual support for an estimated 300 million dairy cattle in the year 2000 was to the tune of 2,735 million euros for milk and milk products and another 4,465 million euros for beef and veal . Much of the support is in the form of direct payment to farmers and falls within the purview of the " green box " and " blue box " stipulations under the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . These are the subsidies that can not be reduced under the phaseout of market-distorting support mechanisms . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries provide to their farmers , and that too indirectly , are considered to be market-distorting and therefore have to be removed or drastically pruned . <p> For the dairy sector also , the aggregate quantum of subsidy as a percentage of the value of milk produced is measured in terms of a Producer Subsidy Equivalent . In 1997 , the PSE index stood at 82 per cent in Japan , 59 per cent in Canada , 54 per cent in the European Union , 47 per cent in the US and 23 per cent in Australia . Such has been the high level of protection provided to milk producers by the developed countries that even with the stipulated reduction in both the volume and the amount of subsidies , the EU and the US continue to flood and dump their highly subsidized milk and milk powder . While the dairy subsidies continue to be on the upswing , the PSE index indicates that farmers in India and in most developing countries were negatively taxed all these years . For India , which alone has one-fourth of the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus 2.33 per cent , whereas for Colombia it was minus 60 per cent . <p> Worse , while the world makes no effort to feed the estimated 800 million people , almost entirely in the developing countries , who go to bed hungry every night , no effort is spared to feed cattle in the rich and industrialized western countries . In recent years , the new system of direct payments to farmers ( since 1992 ) in the European Union has stipulated increase in consumption of cereals from 134.8 million tons in 1993 to 178.2 million tons in 2000 , largely through increased use of EU-produced cereals for animal feed . Even though the feeding of cereals to animals and then their subsequent slaughter for human consumption requires six times more grain than would be needed for the average dietary intake , there is no regret . <p> Ironically , the number of cattle that are reared in such luxury in the rich and industrialized countries ( including the OECD countries , the richest trading block ) , do not exceed 1.5 billion . Strange , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with further marginalization too does not exceed 1.5 billion . The clash of civilization therefore is too apparent , too loud and clear . Under such circumstances , to be amused at the abundance of stray cattle on Indian roads is perhaps a folly . After all , when the conflict for survival between man and animal reaches such extremes , it is the cattle in the developing world which first pay the price . No wonder , it is not unusual to find stray cattle battling for their life with over 20 tons of polythene in their stomachs . <p> But then , with due respect to George Orwell : " All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than even humans .

@@75400279 @4100279/ <p> Sub-Saharan Africa is in the midst of an oil boom as foreign energy companies pour billions of dollars into the region for the exploration and production of petroleum . African governments , in turn , are receiving billions of dollars in revenue from this boom . <p> Oil production on the continent is set to double by the end of the decade and the United States will soon be importing 25 percent of its petroleum from the region . Over $50 billion , the largest investment in African history , will be spent on African oil fields by the end of the decade . <p> The new African oil boom - centered on the oil-rich Atlantic waters of the Gulf of Guinea , from Nigeria to Angola - is a moment of great opportunity and great peril for countries beset by wide-scale poverty . On the one hand , revenues available for poverty reduction are huge ; Catholic Relief Services ( CRS ) conservatively estimates that sub-Saharan African governments will receive over $200 billion in oil revenues over the next decade . On the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn that petrodollars have not helped developing countries to reduce poverty ; in many cases , they have actually exacerbated it . <p> Photo : Ian Gary/CRS <p> Poverty amidst wealth : A shack made of scrap metal stands in the shadow of a Total petorleum terminal near Djeno , Congo-Brazzaville <p> Africa 's oil boom comes at a time when foreign aid to Africa from industrialized countries is falling and being replaced by an emphasis from donor nations on trade as a means for African countries to escape poverty . The dominance of oil and mining in Africa 's trade relationships , coupled with this decline in aid flows , means that it is especially vital that Africa make the best use of its oil . <p> CRS is committed to helping to ensure that Africa 's oil boom improves the lives of the poor through increased investment in education , health , water , roads , agriculture and other vital necessities . But for this to occur , these revenues must be well managed . Thus , this report addresses two fundamental questions : How can Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be implemented to promote the management and allocation of oil revenues in a way that will benefit ordinary Africans ? <p> Managing Petrodollars Well . Presently , Africa 's oil revenues are inserted into governments lacking in transparency , accountability and fairness . Without improving their democratic institutions and administrative capacity , it is unlikely that African oil exporters will be able to use petrodollars to fuel poverty reduction ; instead , oil monies are more likely to make matters worse for the poor . CRS supports the proper democratic management of this natural resource and the implementation of just development strategies that provide benefits for the poor . <p> A first step towards these goals is to build transparency . Oil is a natural resource owned by all Africans . Nevertheless , as this report describes , many aspects of the oil industry in Africa are concealed or shrouded in mystery ; key facts about oil are often treated as state secrets . Thus , it is difficult , if not impossible , to track how much money is being generated or how these revenues are spent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on governments revealing what they spend . <p> The Responsibility for Change : Like oil exporters in other regions , long-time African oil producers such as Nigeria , Angola , Congo-Brazzaville , Cameroon and Gabon , have been largely unable to convert their oil wealth into broad-based poverty reduction . Nor have these countries been able to diversify their economies or prepare for a post-oil future . To the contrary , petroleum has become a magnet for conflict and , in some cases , civil war . New oil producers , such as Equatorial Guinea , appear to be repeating some of the mistakes of their more experienced neighbors . <p> But while the record of oil exporters in Asia , Africa , Latin America and the Middle East shows that oil-dependence is most often a perilous development path , negative outcomes from oil booms are not inevitable . <p> The primary responsibility for managing Africa 's oil wealth in a transparent , fair , and accountable way lies with Africa 's governments . Building democratic states capable of focusing on reducing poverty is one of the key challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , though , are only one part of a web of interests and relationships in the African oil boom . Other key actors determining the outcomes of this boom are foreign oil companies , International Financial Institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , export credit agencies , and Northern governments . The World Bank Group has played a catalytic role by supporting changes in legal frameworks and investment environments , financing projects and providing risk insurance . Export credit agencies have provided additional finance in risky environments , with few strings attached . The U.S. has identified increasing African oil imports as an issue of " national security " and has used diplomacy to court African producers regardless of their record on transparency , democracy or human rights . <p> The Need for a " Big Push " . Many of these actors are now making tentative steps to address the " paradox of plenty " problem generated by Africa 's oil boom . They have begun to recognize that improving the distribution of benefits from oil production is not only an ethical mandate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable world . The IMF and World Bank are taking steps to increase transparency in Africa 's oil economies . Corporate actors are increasing their philanthropic programs and engaging in dialogue with civil society on ways to increase transparency in the sector . And Northern governments , such as the U.S. and U.K. , are beginning to acknowledge the need to address the perils of oil-led development . These actions , while welcome , are not enough . <p> Because developing oil fields and building pipelines happens faster than the construction of efficient states and good governance , only a sustained , coordinated and coherent international effort - a " big push " to change the policy environment - by the relevant actors involved in Africa 's oil boom can improve the prospects for transforming Africa 's oil wealth into improvements in the lives of the poor . Only a concerted change in the incentive structure surrounding oil can help to ensure that petroleum revenues will be well managed . <p> The Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project is the biggest international effort to date to focus an oil development project on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and governments are working to increase the benefits and minimize the harm of this oil project to local populations . International and local civil society groups are closely monitoring the project . In Chad , Africa 's newest petro-state , the explicit goal is to build government capacity to manage massive new oil wealth in a transparent and fair manner . To date , results have been mixed , but the real test will come when , in 2004 , oil revenues will more than double Chad 's national budget overnight . <p> To improve outcomes for the poor , all actors need to change some of their practices and work together in a more concerted manner . Unless the main players in the oil story make specific policy changes , more fully described in the report 's conclusion , Africa 's oil boom is unlikely to foster any significant poverty reduction . Instead , oil riches most probably will continue to produce corruption and mismanagement , environmental destruction , human rights violations , and conflict . It is urgent that improvements be made now to emphasize transparency and fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respect for human rights and the promotion of democratic space in oil-producing countries . <p> Summary Recommendations . <p> National governments should <p> Remove legal and extra-legal obstacles to transparent disclosure and monitoring of the oil sector <p> Guarantee respect for human rights , including freedom of expression , association , and the press <p> Collaborate with citizen groups monitoring the management and allocation of oil wealth . <p> Oil companies should <p> Support the international " Publish What You Pay " campaign by publicly disclosing , in a disaggregated , regular and timely manner , all net taxes , fees , royalties and other payments made to African states , at any level , or to local communities , including compensation payments and community development funding . <p> Fully respect human rights in their practices . <p> The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should <p> Use all of their leverage , with both companies and countries , to strategically promote transparency , fair and accountable revenue management and allocation , and respect for human rights .

@@75400280 @4100280/ <p> In the developing world , 17% of the population were undernourished during 1997-1999 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) . Astonishingly , this translates into 777.2 million individuals who did not have enough food to meet their daily energy needs.On the positive side , this is a decline from 816.3 million , or 20% of the population , who were undernourished from 1990-1992 . These numbers , however , are heavily influenced by China , which makes up a little more than 25 percent of the developing worlds population , and which decreased its proportion of undernourished by 7 percentage points between 1990-92 and 1997-99 . Therefore , excluding China , the number of undernourished in the developing world actually increased from 1990-92 to 1997-99 from 623.7 million to 660.9 million.There is still a decrease in the proportion of undernourished when China is excluded , from 22 to 20 percent . ( See Table 1 . ) <p> While there is some good news in these numbers , there is concern about reaching the 1996 World Food Summits goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to approximately 400 million by 2015 . If the decline continues at the current rate of 6 million per year , the goal will not be met.At this point , the rate would need to increase to 22 million a year to reach the Summits goal.An additional concern is that only 31 of the 97 countries included in these figures ( excluding China ) experienced a decrease in the number of undernourished in their population , revealing that many countries are struggling with how to feed their growing populations . <p> Regions and Countries <p> At the regional level , Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest proportion of undernourished from 1997-1999 at 34% . Asia and the Pacific follows at 20% ( excluding China ) , then Latin America and the Caribbean with 11% , and the Near East and North Africa region at 9% . Between the two time periods , 1990-1992 and 1997-1999 , the Near East and North Africa region performed the worst among the regions , increasing its proportion of undernourished by one percentage point.Sub-Saharan Africa decreased its prevalence by only one percentage point , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two points.The Asia and the Pacific region ( excluding China ) was the best performer , decreasing its prevalence by 3 points . <p> Taking a longer view , table 2 provides FAO data for developing regions with two Asia sub-regions for the percentage of undernourished for 1969-71 , 1979-81 , 1990-92 and 1996-98 . The best performer was East and South Asia , decreasing 30 percentage points from 43 to 13 percent over the time periods , although these data do include China.Both South Asia and the Near East and North Africa decreased their incidence of undernourished by 15 percentage points for the entire period.South Asia began at a high 38 percent , and did not decrease its proportion of undernourished until the 1990-92 time period when it dropped 12 percentage points.Interestingly , the Near East and North Africa region had its greatest decline between 1969-71 and 1979-81 , decreasing from 25 to 9 percent , but then experienced a slight increase from 1990-92 to 1996-98 by 2 percentage points.Latin America and the Caribbean experienced a total decline of 8 percentage points , dropping from 19 to 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 percent until a drop to 11 percent in 1996-98 .

Why does such poverty and injustice occur ? While answers are rarely simple , service-learning creates an abundance of " teachable moments " and students who are highly motivated to seek the answers . The challenge then is posed to educators to create a relevant curriculum that can build upon and respond to the potential learning space opened by service-learning experiences . <p> In many institutions , the development of service-learning programs opens important new lines of communication across disciplines , departments , and divisions .

Moreover , there are always multiple and conflicting goals within as well as between these different groups . <p> The students , for example , may be attracted to a service-learning trip out of general yearnings for travel , adventure and romance , or perhaps altruistic sentiments , cultural curiosity , desires to improve language skills , broaden their world perspective , prepare for a career in foreign service or international development organizations , or any combination of these reasons .

The only unacceptable one is to avert our eyes and leave the issue unaddressed . <p> Gender politics : The female student experience <p> The stereotype of the macho Latin American male has its counterpart in the stereotype of the " liberated " American female . Historically , both U.S. and Latin American males have confused some form of authentic female liberation with sexual availability . These stereotypes complicate the female student experience in Latin America . Add to this potent clash of stereotypes the double standard that exists in both cultures ( in similar and different shapes and forms ) regarding acceptable behavior for males and acceptable behavior for females and you have a very explosive brew . The North American female is highly sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the misunderstanding of liberation and the double standard that pervades all male-dominated societies . The increasing penetration of U.S. media can contribute to unfortunate cultural stereotypes about North American women . <p> All these issues are important to discuss . The success of any intercultural exchange can be measured , in part , by its success in moving people beyond these common stereotypes . <p> Gender politics : The male student experience <p> The male and female student experiences have in common the possibility of being highly sought after by the opposite sex . In this regard , North American students traveling abroad are in positions of unusual power . How can this power be handled responsibly ? <p> Beginning to answer that question requires a more in-depth examination of the reasons why North American students may be so highly sought after by Latin American young people . We have discussed the female experience where media stereotypes of North American women as highly sexualized objects have contributed to unfortunate misunderstandings . The attractiveness of U.S. students to Latin American young people may also be in response to highly constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of escaping to " the land of opportunity " by falling in love with the handsome or beautiful stranger is an old but still very powerful motif . What may be an interesting encounter , a fun evening of drink and dancing , or a casual walk along the beach to a young U.S. student could be the beginning of many hopes , fantasies and dreams to a young Latin American man or woman aspiring to new horizons and economic and social opportunities beyond those his/her small town or struggling country can offer . Given the unfortunate social attitudes that reward male behaviors of sexual conquest , male students are particularly at risk for engaging in exploitative behaviors in these situations . <p> Photo : <p> Students from Gettysburg College participate with a local group in a road improvement project in Cajamarca , Peru . <p> While these are not easy topics to discuss , they are important to touch upon prior to the trip . Students need to be sensitive to the possible dynamics in these situations and mature enough not to take advantage of socioeconomic inequities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip , concrete situations may provide ample opportunities for in-depth discussion and reflection on these issues . <p> Money matters : Food and entertainment <p> Service-learning immersion experiences are powerful because students have an opportunity to live daily lives shoulder to shoulder with Latin American families . Latin American families also get intimate glimpses of U.S. students . How should the students and their host families approach the fact that they are living in two different economies ( the dollar economy vs. the local economy ) ? <p> One of the most common reports students make upon their return is that they unknowingly offended their hosts by having too much money to throw around by local standards . Perhaps students decide to go out to dinner instead of eating at home with their families ( spending as much as their host 's daughter made that week ) . Perhaps they decide to go to the local nightclub and invite young people in the community ( not realizing that the entrance fee would be half their weekly salary ) . Students often comment with delight on how cheap local food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should these situations be approached ? Should students avoid restaurants and nightclubs ? Should they invite their host families along and make clear that they ( the students ) are paying the tab ? Would some families feel uncomfortable with this ? How much spending money should students bring ? While there are no simple answers to these questions , it is helpful if students arrive in the country having thought about these issues beforehand . Their sensitivities will be heightened . The daily dilemmas that come from these stark economic inequities are important topics for reflection , discussion , research and analysis . These daily dilemmas can encourage students to further investigate the economic realities in the communities in which they live . <p> The superpower mentality internalized <p> Service-learning immersion programs are usually organized to provide ample time for discussion and cultural exchange between U.S. students and other school groups , social organizations , families and communities . The Latin American or Caribbean participants in these cultural exchanges are often just as curious about U.S. life and society as the U.S. students are about the country they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotypes or misconceptions about U.S. society such as that everyone is comfortably well off or there are minimal social problems . U.S. students may be placed in the challenging position of needing to accurately represent the complexity of U.S. society and dispel some common stereotypes . <p> U.S. students , overwhelmed by the development challenges faced by the country they are visiting , may stumble upon their own arrogance during these cultural exchanges unless they have the benefit of some forethought or discussion . Common mistakes include : <p> " We do n't have these problems in our country . " This may or may not be true . But certainly the U.S. faces mammoth social problems-- including having the highest percentage of the population incarcerated in the world and the manufacturing and marketing of most of the sophisticated weaponry in the world . We clearly have some very profound social problems to address in our country . <p> " We can tell you how to solve your problems . " With the best of intentions , U.S. students can fall into the trap of thinking they can solve someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . <p> " Follow the path or model of the U.S. to solve your problems . " Because the United States is a world leader and a superpower , many students may assume that the U.S. is an appropriate and viable model for our countries to emulate . Again , this may or may not be true . But it certainly should not be assumed without careful examination of the situation . <p> Many students return from international service-learning trips overwhelmed by the economic deprivation they witnessed and frustrated by their inability to " really make a difference . " This discontent and searching on the part of U.S. students can bring them to a clearer understanding of the fundamental necessity for profound social change . And this , in turn , contributes to a much more solid foundation for global understanding and global action than the original ( well-meaning but simplistic ) desire to serve . <p> Service-learning , whether it takes place across borders or across neighborhoods , most often brings together oppressed , marginalized , or " underprivileged " groups of people with more privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of cultural arrogance , racism , stereotypes , privilege and economic disparities , which must be discussed . <p> It is my hope that this article enriches the dialogue on efforts to improve reflection , analysis and study as a vital component of service-learning experiences and excites social science educators about the tremendous potential of service-learning programs to reinvigorate the educational process .

At the start of war in the former Yugoslavia in 1992 , the Serbian government attacked Sarajevo , the Bosnian Capital . The 43-month siege and artillery bombardment killed civilians , separated families and made daily life a matter of survival . <p> In 1999-2000 , Ellen Messer was a Visiting Associate Professor at Tufts School of Nutrition Science and Policy and a Visiting Scholar in Anthropology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <p> Marc J. Cohen is special assistant to the director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute and the former editor of Bread for the World 's World Hunger Report . <p> Jashinta D'Costa is an independent consultant . She has been a consultant to the United Nations Development Program , Save the Children-U.S. , and National Council for Agricultural Education , as well as research associate with Bread for the World Institute . <p> " After 20 years of optimism , international food and nutrition experts are presenting a more cautious world food outlook ( see , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the world as a whole now enjoys a food surplus , over the next two decades annual growth rates of major cereal crop yields are expected to slow , while global population is expected to grow by 2 billion people . Cultivated land areas are diminishing , and environmental and biological resources are also being degraded and destroyed . Developing countries also face economic threats to their food security because multilateral trade agreements will likely reduce food surpluses in the developed countries , raise grain prices , and shrink food aid . Future food security in developing countries is also menaced by cutbacks in foreign assistance , an increasing proportion of which is now allocated to disaster situations , reducing the amount available for agricultural research investment . <p> These factors suggest that developing countries will face growing food deficits and food and nutritional insecurity . They may also face environmental degradation and natural resource scarcities that will end in greater competition and conflict ( Brown and Kane , 1994 ; Kaplan , 1994 ) . Several recent studies have proposed a significant link between environmental resource scarcity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This paper expands this proposition to consider significant linkages among environmental resource scarcities , conflict , food , and hunger . <p> The paper argues that armed conflicts ( those involving more than 1,000 deaths ) or " food wars " constitute a significant cause of deteriorating food scenarios in developing countries . Food wars are defined as wars involving the use of hunger as a weapon or hunger vulnerability that accompanies or follows from destructive conflict ( Messer , 1990 ) . They have already been shown to be a salient factor in the famines of the 1980s and 1990s ( see Bohle , 1993 ; Messer , 1994 ; Macrae and Zwi , 1993 , 1994 ; Messer , 1996a ) . Although geographic information and famine early warning systems and international food reserves established after the famines of the mid-1970s provide both timely early warning and a capacity for emergency response , the social disorganization that accompanies conflict prevents food distribution . <p> Food wars are also a growing cause of chronic underproduction and food insecurity , where prolonged conflicts prevent farming and marketing and where land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been destroyed . The data suggest that most countries and regions that are food insecure are not hopeless under producers but are experiencing the aftermath of conflicts , political instability , and poor governance . Their food production capacities are higher than current projections predict . <p> Reciprocally , food security can help prevent conflict and is essential for sustained and peaceful recovery after wars have ended . A principal source of conflict lies in lack of food security , as experienced by different households and communities ; religious , ethnic , and political groups ; and states . Yet both peace and food security remain elusive for many war-ravaged countries where decimation or flight of material and human resources make a return to normal food and livelihood security difficult to achieve . <p> To many analysts , this pernicious cycle of hunger , followed by conflict , followed by hunger , seems unbreakable . Neo-Malthusians , concerned about population growth and economic stagnation , especially in Africa , insist population-resource imbalances lead inevitably to hunger , accompanied by illness , warfare , and excess deaths . They view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder and violence or a basket case of environmental deterioration and destitution ( see Kaplan , 1988 , 1994 ) . But case studies so far have been unable to identify the exact thresholds of environmental deterioration or perceived scarcities that push populations over the line into decay or violence ( see Homer-Dixon , 1991 ) . <p> Anti-Malthusians counter that population pressure-led cycles of scarcity , crisis , and destruction can be averted and that scarcity is always relative to human ingenuity , technological innovation , social restructuring , and political and economic policy ( Boserup , 1965 ) . Technological optimists argue that population , far from being an inevitable time bomb , actually triggers technological and infrastructural improvements . This perspective appears in the early literature of the Green Revolution ( Sen , 1975 ) , in the writings of certain African technologists ( Juma , 1989 ) , and in the encouraging food outlooks of certain economists ( Mitchell and Ingco , 1993 ) and other analysts such as Simon ( in Myers and Simon , 1994 ) . These optimists argue that evidence for deteriorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the challenges . Unfortunately , none has been able to demonstrate how in contemporary war-ravaged settings , human populations might serve as a resource and stimulus to restore hope , rebuild food security , and remove despair . <p> This paper explores in detail the multiple connections between food insecurity and armed conflict by reviewing the extent of food wars , estimating agricultural and other costs of conflict , and extracting policy lessons from case studies in Rwanda and Eritrea that suggest ways to reduce linkages between conflict and food insecurity through more careful aid programs before , during , and after conflicts . The discussion brings together " world food and hunger outlook " and " armed conflict-food crisis " perspectives to create a more comprehensive food , agriculture , and environment vision for 2020 .

@@75400289 @4100289/ <p> This invited review by the Humanitarian Times focuses on the problems in preparedness and capability by humanitarian relief agencies to assist in the event of very large attacks on civilian populations with any of several increasingly-available weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) . <p> In modern conflict , more weapons are becoming , in effect , weapons of mass destruction , as their lethality increases and armies can not or do not separate combatants from non-combatants . Recent attention to the consequences of potential attacks involving Iraq , international rebel groups , and escalation of the India -Pakistan ( thermo-nuclear ) tension confront humanitarian relief organizations with a stark choice over their potential role in assisting civilian populations . Should they curtail operations and withdraw personnel in the face of the possible use of a weapon of mass destruction ( WMD ) or reinforce their local capacities to provide humanitarian assistance in the event of an attack by a weapon of mass destruction ? <p> Humanitarian aid agencies would seek to respond to instances of the use of weapons of mass destruction , as they do every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In current war-zones , nongovernmental relief organizations ( NGOs , non-profit charitable aid groups ) are often forced into tactical withdrawal to safer areas where they prepare material and staff to provide increased assistance as quickly as possible once violence subsides . Unfortunately , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) do not yet have experience with responding to hazards that involve the intentional use of lethal chemical , biological and thermonuclear weapons on civilian populations . So far in history , international NGOs have not provided immediate relief around disasters in Halabja , Chernobyl , Lake Nyos , Bhopal or the chemical spills during the Venezuela floods . <p> The likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons in the India -Pakistan conflict has declined since early 2002 . But it raised the awkward question of whether the humanitarian assistance community can respond to the possibly enormous death rates and disability around use of a weapon of mass destruction . Areas safe from a nuclear attack and fallout are hard to identify and probably distant from the areas of human needs . <p> Underlying this challenge is the fact that no doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the health , water , shelter and other consequences of the use of weapons of mass destruction on large civilian populations in remote , resource-scarce parts of the world . In such settings , the U.S.-based paradigm of hospital-based , high-tech response is not feasible . But no alternative has been proposed . <p> The skills and resources needed to address the civilian problems after a nuclear attack are different from what NGOs have trained to for dealing with the primary health care needs ( diarrhea , respiratory infections , malnutrition ) in famines and refugee camps . NGO guidelines do not address radiation illness and blindness , skin loss from vesicants or mass burns . NGOs are similarly ill-prepared to react to biological , chemical , radiological , industrial sabotage and related threats . Nor do even the state-of-the-art medical protocols for WMD in the US address the treatment of children . <p> The Red Cross movement recognizes that specialists are required for effective WMD response and therefore does not currently seek to have a lead role in the detection or clearance of WMD agents . Enormous speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body suites ) , identify and cleanse certain lethal chemicals , for example . However , NGOs and the Red Cross would readily manage the primary care problems involved in mass migration ( and other dislocation and panic ) that might be caused by a WMD . <p> How Weapons of Mass Destruction Emergencies Differ from Other Emergencies <p> Three key distinctions separate WMD emergencies from the kinds of other emergencies ( natural disasters , famine and refugees ) that NGOs are geared to respond to at present . <p> 1 . Potential for large area of impact <p> One unique challenge of these weapons comes from their ability to cause large destruction over large areas . Compared to conventional weapons , the impact of a weapon of mass destruction is more likely to be indiscriminate : to include noncombatant populations , even living far from the weapons main target . <p> At present , many of the treatment protocols regarding chemical , biological , and nuclear exposure situations were designed with military situations in mind , and not for civilian attacks . As a result , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , quarantine , triage , and mass treatment in a resource-poor areas of the world ( namely , most of the developing countries ) . More so than in the case of primary disease problems ( as seen in refugee camps ) , WMDs would harm entire families -- both parents and children simultaneously , complicating relief efforts which currently aim to empower parents to care effectively for children ( e.g. with diarrhea , malnutrition and other manageable illness ) . <p> 2 . Delays in when health and medical effects appear <p> The medical presentation of WMD victims may not be immediate , will vary over time and include large numbers not immediately affected , but emergent over days or months . Immediate physical trauma may or may not occur with the use of a WMD and there may , depending on the weapon , be proportionally few victims requiring intensive emergency care , as opposed to long-term care ( or those who die rapidly ) . <p> Many WMD agents cause indirect or delayed health impacts , not the least of which is the psychological impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed or infected . As well , long-term exposure will accumulate in subtle ways , through contaminated dust , living long periods in closed rooms , or soil , water and land contamination . The primary and secondary health impacts of a WMD will continue for years for large segments of the immediately surviving population . The scope and duration of medical services expected of NGOs will be greatly expanded from those provided following more conventional disasters . Decontamination , public health information , and life support care ( possibly on a large scale ) may be needed in greater proportion than the surgical ( in war zones ) or primary health care ( refugee camps ) NGOs currently implement . A capacity to manage large numbers of patients who are not in critical condition but require interventions to reduce future critical care load will be a new task faced by health care-oriented NGOs . Responding to these conditions will require NGOs to deploy staff with uncommon skills ( e.g. , decontamination ) and a likely reliance on the use of public information ( social mobilization ) and education to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Unusual Risks to Humanitarian Aid Staff <p> Much of the current attention NGOs are giving to WMD involves the uncommon risks that aid staff need to avoid in attempting to respond . Rushing into an area affected by a WMD will put relief personnel at significant risk of personal harm from the WMD hazard , with a consequent crippling of relief efforts . Because significant WMD risks are not immediately apparent ( without lab testing , for example ) , it will be difficult for field offices to know when or where they can deploy their teams . <p> NGOs need to consider use of the " precautionary principle " : the assumption of contamination or danger in an area unless positively demonstrated to be safe . First response would be like that in an industrial fire : withdraw to a safe parameter and assess the situation before entering . The step-back approach and delayed entry into areas with appropriate safety equipment only once they have been declared safe are procedures which will be difficult for organizations that are now culturally disposed to live among the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because a precautionary principle could slow assistance operations , field personnel will be tempted to ignore it . Therefore , NGOs will continue to struggle with decisions about how to deliver aid without the aid providers becoming victims as well . <p> Recognizing that NGO and related international relief organization field personnel will take risks in providing assistance , aid organization managers need to define how to ( 1 ) limit these risks , ( 2 ) ensure that the personnel are aware of the risks they are taking ( both a transparency and a liability issue ) and ( 3 ) prepare for and provide care and support to those relief personnel who become victims . <p> Strategies to Reduce Civilian Harm from WMDs Will be Different <p> Much of the effectiveness of NGOs rests on their long-term work with poor communities , effectively predicting and mitigating disasters . For example , the Famine Early Warning System in Africa has allowed early response to save millions of lives due to drought . While early warning systems are key to effective humanitarian response , NGOs do not have yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would significantly mitigate hazards and harm . NGOs can not now predict whether or when a country will initiate a WMD first-strike . <p> As in other types of disasters , the victims and host communities will play significant roles in dealing with the disaster . Potential victims of a WMD event need to be informed of anticipated impacts and self-help measures , if only to reduce demands on external assistance . Planning for evacuation from a WMD attack can borrow from evacuation plans for hurricane/cyclones . Similar information needs to be provided to potential host areas , both to alleviate fears of contamination ( which would reduce solidarity assistance ) and to enable these host communities to prepare for an influx of victims from the affected areas . On balance , information targeted at the host communities may be more important than that targeted to victims , as the perceptions of the host communities will be critical in deciding whether the victims are welcome or rejected by these communities . <p> The care and assistance to people moving from actual or suspected areas affected by a WMD may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other relief agencies . Mass movement may be life-saving , depopulating areas into which relief operations may not be able to go safely . Many evacuees may need to be decontaminated , medically assessed , fed , housed , and otherwise cared for as they move from danger to safety . The level and duration of contamination following a WMD event may make return impossible , leading to a need for permanent resettlement and a range of difficult choices and complicated consultations . <p> Relief Planning and Resource Mobilization <p> The uncertain impact of a WMD event complicates normal disaster planning and budgeting procedures . The up-front costs of a step-back assessment will be high , if only because the technologies and skills required are unlikely to be widely available . The conventional **33;172;TOOLONG operations process will be seriously constrained by ( 1 ) the difficulty in defining the scope of the WMD impact ( particularly but not only the health aspects ) , ( 2 ) the likelihood that assessments can not be completed quickly for large parts of any affected area , ( 3 ) the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) a continual identification of new impacts and needs as access is gained to the affected areas . <p> NGOs and Donors will need to rethink the process and procedures used to finance a WMD response . At present , NGOs would be slow to define exact relief goals in any given WMD event and will resort to expenditure-by-objective response operations , without a clear road map to reach the objectives . In the long-term , developing competency within an NGO would entail considerable expense , for maintaining equipment and material for WMD relief teams and the in-depth , specialized and repeated training . <p> Prospects for New and Strange Bedfellows <p> Government efforts to deal with the WMD threat rests largely within the domain of the intelligence , public safety and military communities . NGOs are shy about making contacts with these communities , which , in turn , tend not to widely disseminate threat information . Much of the current literature on dealing with WMD hazards has been produced by military organizations . These materials may articulate approaches which either are not acceptable to NGOs or wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developing country settings . The scale of a likely WMD event suggests that assigning military personnel to work out of uniform for NGOs wont be a sufficient solution to provide the number of personnel needed for post WMD event management and operations . A tight linking of uniformed military to NGO personnel in the field , as happened in Northern Iraq , may be difficult to plan and raises significant policy issues for both military and humanitarian systems . Military resources , particularly those available through NATO and from successor states to the Soviet Union , may be the best trained and equipped to deal with a range of WMD consequences . <p> As a result , humanitarian organizations may find themselves incapable of providing effective relief , unless they can link themselves to the military and security response to WMD events and provide specifically needed services and assistance . Past humanitarian assistance operations provide useful lessons about dealing with large-scale humanitarian crises . But , unless NGOs and international orgs recognize that a WMD event will be unlike previous humanitarian crisis and prepare accordingly , their effectiveness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet expectations , or the real needs of the victims . <p> Charles Kelly is an expert in emergency relief and disaster mitigation who has worked extensively with NGOs , international organizations and donors .

When you answer this quiz , Hunger Notes will make a donation to assist hungry people . <h> Hunger in the United States <p> According to USDA , an estimated 14% of American households ( 17.4 million households ) were food insecure in 2014 , meaning they lacked access to enough food for an active , healthy life for all household members . <p> The defining characteristic of very low food security is that , at times during the year , the food intake of household members is reduced and their normal eating patterns are disrupted because the household lacks money and other resources for food . On average , households with very low food security at some time during the year experienced it in 7 or 8 months during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those months . Ninety-seven percent of those classified as having low food security reported that an adult had cut the size of meals or skipped meals because there was not enough money for food and 27 percent reported that an adult did not eat for a whole day because there was not enough money for food . <p> In these food-insecure households , normal eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake was reduced at times during the year because they had insufficient money or other resources for food . 6.7 million US households ( 5.7 percent of all US households ) had very low food security at some time during 2008 , a 39 percent increase from 2007 ( 4.1 percent of US households ) . This was the largest increase ever recorded since nationally representative food security surveys were initiated in 1995 , as well as the largest year-to-year percentage increase . In 2014 , 6.9 million households ( 5.6 percent of U.S. households ) had very low food security which remains largely unchanged from 2008-2014 . <p> Children were food insecure at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of U.S. households with children ) , essentially unchanged from 9.9 percent in 2013 . These households were unable at times during the year to provide adequate , nutritious food for their children . <h> Hunger and Poverty <p> Food insecurity is strongly associated with poverty in the United States . According to Feeding America 's Map the Meal Gap Study which produces county-level , congressional district level , and food bank service area level food insecurity rates , poverty is one of the drivers of food insecurity in the United States , and a one percentage point increase in poverty leads to a 0.18 increase in food insecurity . ( See World Hunger and Poverty Facts and Statistics for relationship between hunger and poverty ) . There are differences in food security across demographic and geographic groups in the United States , and this reflect , in part , differences in income across those groups . <p> Rates of food insecurity were higher than the national average for the following groups : All households with children ( 19.2 percent ) Households with children under age 6 ( 19.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 35.3 percent ) or a single man ( 21.7 percent ) and other households with children ( 24.4 percent ) Households headed by Black , non-Hispanics ( 26.1 percent ) , and Hispanics ( 22.4 percent ) Low-income households with incomes below 185 percent of the poverty threshold ( 33.7 percent ) <h> Hunger , Poverty , Diet-related Diseases , and Costs for Hunger <p> Furthermore , hunger in the United States is strongly associated with obesity and diet-related diseases such as diabetes , high blood pressure and heart diseases . One important reason is that fresh vegetables and fruits that are beneficial for health are comparatively expensive , while processed foods with heavy sugar or/and fat are much cheaper to obtain calories for poor households . This was largely due to U.S. policies , particularly the federal farm subsidies which favor industrial farming system that produces great quantities of subsidized crops like the corn and soybeans used to make processed junk foods . ( See short video : Fixing Our Broken Food System , by Union of Concerned Scientists ) <p> According to Hunger in America 2014 survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity with a nationwide network of 200 member food banks that provides food assistance to an estimated 46.5 million Americans in needs each year , 33% of these client households have a member with diabetes and 58% of household have a member with high blood pressure . 66% of households reported that they had to choose between food and medical care . Hunger and food insecurity also drive up the healthcare costs , with an estimated $160 billion annual costs , according to Bread for the World Institute 2016 Hunger Report . <h> Food Waste <p> To capture a more complete image of the U.S. food system , it is worth noting that 40% of food is wasted , meanings that 40% of food grown , processed and transported in the U.S. is never consumed , albeit every one in every seven Americans in hunger . When food is disposed in a landfill it rots and becomes a significant source of methane a potent greenhouse gas with 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide . <p> To solve the hunger problem in the United States requires a systematic approach to fix the U.S. food system . 
@@75400291 @4100291/ <p> Trade and Transnational Corporations : the Solution to World Hunger or a Major Part of the Problem ? <p> Peter O'Driscoll <p> ( March 23 , 2004 ) A huge proportion of the world 's population still depends on subsistence farming or agricultural labor for its livelihood . Volatile climate conditions , long growing cycles and " information asymmetries " make it hard for farmers with limited resources to adapt quickly to market signals . Not surprisingly , poverty and malnutrition are most persistent in rural areas . Such factors lead many development experts to conclude that a judicious mix of government and market-based approaches must be applied to optimize food production and distribution and thereby reduce hunger . <p> But advocates of " free trade " have long resisted the argument that agriculture should be treated differently from other sectors of the economy , encouraging poor farmers instead to view tariff reduction and other liberalization measures as the best means to improve their prospects . Their views have definitely held sway in recent years . In 1995 , the World Trade Organization adopted an Agreement on Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in Rome for the 1996 World Food Summit and pledged to halve the number of hungry people in the world by 2015 , their final declaration included a commitment to " strive to ensure that food , agricultural trade and overall trade policies are conducive to fostering food security for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system . " 1 <p> Who Benefits ? <p> During the liberalization era , the volume of international agricultural trade has increased dramatically , growing four-fold over the past four decades to over 800 million tons per year.2 But who has benefited from this trend ? Evidence suggests that agricultural trade liberalization has proven disastrous for developing countries , dislocating farmers and accelerating the concentration of land ownership.3 Moreover , the December 2004 report of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on The State of Food Insecurity shows " the number of hungry people in the world rising to 852 million in 2000-2002 , up by 18 million from the mid-1990s. " 4 The report 's bottom line is sobering : a decade after the Agreement on Agriculture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline , the number of hungry people in the world is growing . Agricultural trade liberalization 's failure to deliver on the goal of reducing hunger is only one of several reasons why it has become a major stumbling block as the WTO attempts to push forward its " Doha Development Round . " Countries of the global south oppose the hypocrisy that forces them to open their markets to U.S. and European agri-food companies without reciprocal access for their own exports . They note that food production in the developed world still receives government subsidies that poor countries are not allowed to offer their farmers , even if they could afford them . <p> Those subsidies will also be a major topic for domestic debate over the two years leading up to the 2007 Farm Bill . Forced by exploding budget deficits to seek cost savings wherever he can , President Bush is proposing payment limitations on commodity subsidies to U.S. farmers . Some family farm groups here are ready to discuss subsidy reform in the context of broader efforts to combat the collapse of commodity prices .

But it need not lead to higher food prices for consumers . Even as farm income has progressively declined , especially under " free trade " agreements , retail food prices have risen . In 1970 , American farmers received 37 cents of every dollar spent on a market basket of food products , but by 2000 their share had fallen to 20 cents.6 The growing spread between farm revenue and consumer food prices has been driven by the market power of large agri-food companies . As explained by Dwayne Andreas , former chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co . ( ADM ) , " the food business is far and away the most important business in the world . Everything else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food companies choose not to pass their cost savings from low-farm prices on to consumers . Trade liberalization and monopoly power allow global processing companies like ADM and Cargill to force down the price of basic grains such as corn , wheat , rice and soy worldwide . Even as prices fall below the cost of production , farmers face a perverse incentive to increase their output to generate as much income as possible from a collapsing market , until they go out of business . In a vicious downward spiral of supply and demand , increased global production then drives farm prices even lower . Subsidies are lifelines that keep enough U.S. farmers on this production treadmill to guarantee continued low prices to the processing companies . <p> Subsidy payments ensure continued overproduction and low commodity prices because 60% of the U.S. subsidy budget goes to the largest 10% of farmers.8 Processing companies " dump " much of their subsidized cheap grain onto developing country markets , discouraging local production and gaining effective control of grain distribution . But even as American and European taxpayers subsidize farmers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the companies themselves know better . ADM 's Andreas acknowledged that " there is n't one grain of anything in the world that is sold in a free market . Not one ! The only place you see a free market is in the speeches of politicians . " 9 Corporate control of food policy and agricultural trade has been locked in by two factors : the industry 's extraordinary access to policymakers ( often through " revolving door " appointments of executives to key government posts ) , and the degree of market concentration in the food system . Big companies are not shy about their political influence . Cargill 's Chief Executive Warren Staley acknowledged last year that " when we suggest to someone we have an issue and would like to meet them , the doors are almost always open because of the courteous manner in which we approach things , and our credibility . " 10 Such influence was exemplified by the April 2003 appointment of former Cargill Vice-President Dan Amstutz to lead agricultural reconstruction efforts in Iraq . It was Amstutz who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreement on Agriculture within the World Trade Organization , considered by many developing countries and pro-development groups as innately unjust . The agreement allows rich countries to dump their subsidy-backed agricultural surpluses on world markets , depressing prices to levels at which producers in developing nations can no longer compete . " 11 Amstutz quickly used his authority to commit Iraq to controversial laws that forbid farmers to save seeds and thus produce a financial windfall for seed companies like Monsanto-an important business partner for Cargill.12 <p> Corporate Control of The Food System <p> As if the capacity to shape government policy were not enough , agri-food firms also use old-fashioned monopoly power to exert their control : in the absence of competition , they can fix prices both to farmers and consumers . A handful of companies now dominate every sector of the food system , from inputs like seeds , pesticides and fertilizers , through the processing and manufacturing of food products , all the way to retail and food service . Just two companies ( Monsanto and DuPont ) together dominate global seed markets for maize ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of all human food is grain-based , yet three companies ( Cargill , Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge ) control about 90% of the global grain trade.14 Over the past 20 years , the proportion of U.S. production controlled by the four largest firms has risen from 60% to 82% in beef packing , from 30% to 57% for pork , and from 54% to 80% in soybean crushing , to name a few key agricultural markets.15 Meanwhile , more than 300,000 U.S. family farms were lost over that same period.16 <p> Important voices are becoming alarmed by this trend . The U.S. Catholic Bishops noted in November 2003 that as a result of " increasing concentration at every level of agriculture ... fewer people are making important decisions that affect far more people than in the past .... These forces of increasing concentration and growing globalization are pushing ... us toward a world where the powerful can take advantage of the weak , where large institutions and corporations can overwhelm smaller structures , and where the production and distribution of food and the protection of land lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quest for monopoly profits can lead companies to constrain food access for poor people , United Nations Special Rapporteur Jean Ziegler affirmed in October 2003 that " despite the fact that Transnational Corporations increasingly control our food system , there are still relatively few mechanisms in place to ensure that they respect standards and do not violate human rights . " 18 Even the mainstream press has begun to focus on the problem . The editorial page of the New York Times declared last December that " it is essential to reverse the trend toward concentration in American farming . " 19 <p> Toward A Solution <p> Key stakeholder groups are similarly concerned . Since 2002 , in partnership with the National Catholic Rural Life Conference , the Center of Concern has been building the Agribusiness Accountability Initiative ( AAI ) into an international network of representatives from farm , labor , consumer , environment , church and development groups willing to work together to confront the political influence and market power of transnational agri-food companies . Hosting forum events in Chicago , Kansas City , London , Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society leaders from more than 30 countries to share their analysis of food industry issues , to support each other 's existing reform efforts , and to create new cross-constituency research and advocacy to promote a more socially , politically and environmentally sustainable food system . <p> AAI Forums have already achieved important results . The October 2003 Forum in Kansas City launched a crosssectoral working group to expose industry influence on U.S. agri-food policy , leading to the July 2004 publication of " USDA Inc. -How Agribusiness has Hijacked Regulatory Policy at the U.S. Department of Agriculture . " 20 AAI then reached out to groups exploring conflict of interest in other federal agencies , and has now formed a broad coalition to create ethics laws that prevent " revolving door " appointments . The Kansas City forum also set up a committee of food industry researchers to create a web-accessible matrix , showing which companies control what percentage of key agri-food markets around the world . AAI convened 24 researchers from around the world in Paris this January to share data , launch the matrix , and propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum in Brussels in January 2004 led to the formation of a continent-wide coalition of groups working to create European Union regulations to limit the monopoly power of supermarkets . <p> Plans are now in place for a global AAI Forum on corporate control of the food system , to be held in Europe in June , with partial funding from the European Commission . AAI hopes to convene some 80 activists and experts from around the world to plan a global campaign of coordinated research , advocacy and public education designed to rein in the power of the handful of companies that now determine what will be grown and who will eat it . Readers can track the development of AAI 's network online . <p> While food may be a " business " to Dwayne Andreas , those who see it primarily as a basic human right , as it is designated in Catholic social teaching texts , must work together to guarantee that food is available to all who need it-not just to those who can afford to pay a corporate premium . <p> 17 .

@@75400293 @4100293/ <h> Biotechnology : Meeting the Needs of the Poor ? <h> Bioengineered Food Crops Have Real Potential as a Tool in the War on Hunger , but So Far That Potential Remains Largely Untapped <p> Food and Agriculture Organization <p> ( FAO , May 17 , 2004 ) By introducing high-yielding plant varieties , agro-chemicals and new irrigation techniques into agriculture systems around the world , the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s boosted crop yields and helped lift millions of people out of hunger and poverty . <p> But today , many small-scale farmers remain trapped in subsistence agriculture , while each day over 842 million people go without enough to eat , according to FAO 's latest estimates . Billions suffer from micronutrient deficiencies , an insidious form of malnutrition caused by an inadequate diet . And over the next 30 years an additional 2 billion people will need food-- yet the natural resource base on which agriculture depends is growing increasingly fragile . <p> Can the " Gene Revolution " -- the use of biotechnology in agriculture-- contribute to meeting these challenges ? <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them produce more nutrients and vitamins . <p> A Global Debate <p> Science can be an ogre or an angel , depending on how one looks at it . The Green Revolution , for example , is not without its detractors , who argue that it promoted overuse of water , pesticides and chemical fertilizers , making poor farmers dependent on these inputs , and in some cases seriously damaging the environment in the process . <p> Today , the rising profile of biotechnology in agricultural production has sparked a similar global debate . <p> Some types of biotechnology have been around for millennia , and probably began when our ancestors used microorganisms to make bread , wine and cheese . The current era of modern biotechnology was made possible by the use of molecular techniques to " cut and paste " genes from one cell to another . <p> It is precisely this emerging science of genetic engineering that lies at the heart of today 's biotech polemic . <p> Supporters hail genetic engineering as essential for addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in developing countries . Opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunger , and lead to a corporate takeover of traditional agriculture and the global food supply . <p> On the one hand , there are compelling arguments for altering the genetic makeup of food crops , notes the report . <p> Doing so , it may be possible to increase the availability and variety of food by improving agricultural productivity and reducing seasonal variations in food supplies . Pest-resistant and stress-tolerant crops can be developed to reduce the risk of crop failure due to drought and disease . More nutrients and vitamins may be bred into plants , combating the nutrient deficiencies that affect so many of the world 's poor . Crops could be made to grow on poor soil in marginal lands , increasing overall food production . <p> Biotechnology also offers the possibility of reducing the use of toxic agricultural pesticides , and may also improve the efficiency of fertilizer and other soil amendments . <p> On the other hand , cautions FAO , the scientific assessment of the environmental and health impacts of genetic engineering of crop plants is still at an early stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the organization emphasizes the need to ensure that the prospective benefits of biotechnology in agriculture are shared by all people , rather than a select few . Indeed , while SOFA 2004 notes that poor farmers and consumers in developing countries can benefit greatly from biotechnology , it adds that so far only a few are actually doing so , and that as the biotech sector develops " there is clear evidence that the problems of the poor are being neglected . " <p> Issues of Equity <p> Unlike the Green Revolution , which came about through an international program of public-sector agricultural research specifically aimed at creating and transferring technologies to the developing world as free public goods , the ' Gene Revolution ' is primarily being driven by the private sector , which focuses on developing commercial products for large markets . <p> " This raises serious questions about the type of research that is being performed and the likelihood that the poor will benefit , " observes FAO in SOFA 2004 . <p> The report notes that while public- and private-sector biotech research and development are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are few major public- or private-sector biotech programs addressing the problems of small farmers in poor countries . <p> " Neither the private nor the public sector has invested significantly in new genetic technologies for the so-called ' orphan crops ' such as cowpea , millet , sorghum and teff that are critical for the food supply and livelihoods of the world 's poorest people , " explains FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf in the introduction to the report . <p> Even the major food crops of the poor-- wheat , rice , white maize , potato and cassava-- are also being neglected , according to SOFA 2004 . At the same time , biotech plants with traits of interest to the poor , including drought and salinity tolerance , disease resistance , or enhanced nutrition , are receiving little attention . <p> Important Questions Remain <p> Clearly , agricultural biotechnology has real potential as a new tool in the war on hunger . <p> As The State of Food and Agriculture 2004 points out , however , many pressing questions have yet to be answered . <p> How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are emerging from the Gene Revolution ? Which biotech research priorities could most directly benefit the poor , and who will develop innovations for the majority of developing countries that are too small in terms of market potential to attract large private-sector investments and too weak in scientific capacity to develop their own innovations ? How can we facilitate the development and international movement of safe transgenic organisms and promote the sharing of intellectual property for the public good ? <p> Another major issue : how to ensure that countries-- especially financially strapped ones in the developing world-- have adequate environmental- and human-health risk assessment regimes in place that let them assess new biotechnologies , both before they are introduced and after they begin to be used in the field . <p> In The State of Food and Agriculture 2004 , FAO takes up these and other issues and suggests some lines of action that individual countries and the international community could take in order to make biotechnology a more potent tool in the war on hunger . 
@@75400294 @4100294/ <p> On Wednesday , Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos declared that his country would go to the polls before the end of 2008 . Elections , not held since 1992 , have been constantly delayed in the country , leading human rights activists to accuse the government of clinging to power . Steve Kibble analyses the complex nature of the Angolan state , concluding that : " Despite rhetoric on increased transparency , accountability and democratization little has yet been accomplished to overcome the gap between ruler and ruled . " <p> Angola became independent from the Portuguese in 1975 after a costly and long running liberation war with three antagonistic independence movements based on different ethno-linguistic , ideological constituencies . In its almost fourth year of peace there is no immediate reason why war should resume . This follows 27 years of nearly continuous civil war between Uniao Nacional para a Independencia total de Angola ( UNITA ) rebels under their dictatorial leader Jonas Savimbi , and the governing Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola ( MPLA ) . The former were US and apartheid South Africa-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans of the interior . The governing party was based on the coastal elite which has large urban and mestizo elements , with a commitment to nationalism , socialism , and anti-imperialism in a conflict overlaid by the Cold War . <p> In 1991 the Stalinist state with an inefficient command economy changed to a supposed multiparty democratic state and market economy . Few freedoms were realized although free and fair elections were won by the government in 1992 the excuse for UNITA to renew the war . The state remained heavily centralized with the president able to control extra-budgetary revenues for his own accumulation and clientilist purposes . It has massive oil production , revenues and potential . Much of the infrastructure , agriculture and rudimentary health services were destroyed by war with millions of landmines being laid - with knock-on effects on agriculture , transport as well as peoples lives . <p> War also meant excess mortality of one million deaths - roughly a tenth of Angolas population , displacement and urbanization with about half of all Angolans , perhaps seven million people , living in cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education services only 37 percent of primary-aged children were enrolled in school whilst most of the health budget goes to hospital-based curative services , including elite spending in South Africa and Portugal . <p> Peace broke out in April 2002 when Savimbi was killed , leaving the MPLA-controlled government undisputed victor , but espousing reconciliation ( Although reconciliation here largely means ( six ) blanket amnesties , no truth commissions and inviting selected opposition elements into the elite ) - for which civil society can claim some credit . The country in theory faces a triple transition from war to peace , from devastation to reconstruction , and from a state/elite patronage system to a transparent market economy . The first two are better advanced including a greater commitment to infrastructural ( re ) construction . Many in civil society express concerns over delays in and government commitment to reform . Inflation has been brought down although no major structural reform has occurred . In particular there is unlikely to be a challenge to the key nature of the bazaar economy ( Cadongo ) in trade and services controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources by using special powers , granted them by senior politicians , to import goods ( Angola is ranked 133 out of 145 countries on Transparency Internationals corruption index . Between 1997 and 2001 , $8.45 billion of public money was unaccounted for ( an average of 23% of GDP ) - IMF ) . <p> Transition or Steady State ? <p> There is an assumption that Angola is in transition and that its current dysfunctionality will change . Conversely we can see the politics of disorder as a functional steady state for the Angolan elite . It holds a number of cards , despite dependence on conditionalities such as high oil prices and ability to attract concessional oil-backed loans such as from Standard Bank and $2billion from the Chinese Eximbank in 2005 ( As part of the loan agreement , the Chinese are repairing infrastructure but in an opaque non-competitive deal with only 30% of the work going to local ( elite-linked ) firms . ) . <p> Africa 's second largest producer is one of its fastest growing economies with some of its poorest people ( Revista Energia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puts yearly government oil revenues at between US $4 billion and $5 billion ) . In 2005 oil production was 1.3 million barrels a day set to increase to two million by 2008 . Much of this estimated $6.88 billion revenue goes to a small number of wealthy Angolans with little reaching citizens ( Nearly all of Angola 's production is offshore and for every million invested in the industry , only $100,000 is spent onshore . ) . The government budgeted for 16% growth although the IMF paper projected annual growth at 18% a year over 2005-2007 1 . <p> The country had a UNDP Human Development Index of 0.445 making it 160 of 177 . There was neither formal agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in 2005 or the much-heralded donors conference . Donors appeared reluctant to commit to a poor country with a rich elite in relation to a conference or humanitarian appeals . <p> Angola is also the 4th or 5th largest diamond producer - like oil , an enclave sector with little regulation or accountability , where forced labor , ill-treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $900 million despite continued smuggling ( Despite expulsions of 127,000 foreign nationals involved in the illegal diamond trade between April 2004 and February 2005 accompanied by allegations of brutality ) . <p> Like many oil-producing countries . Angola sees the paradox between exploitation of oil , gas and minerals and high rates of poverty indicators of child malnutrition , low health care spending , low school enrolment rates and poor adult literacy ( and war ) . Over one million Angolan people remained dependent on food aid , and one child died every three minutes of preventable causes 480 per day . <p> The effect of oil wealth ( Dutch disease ) is to cause economic contraction and inflation through high local prices , expensive exchange rates and depressed levels of manufacturing in other sectors plus lack of national accountability , especially with increased world demand , tightening supply and in 2005 continued high prices . The underlying problem is the resource curse of oil-based economic enclaves with greater external than internal linkages , meaning a lack of reciprocity between domestic rulers and ruled in all spheres a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employs only 10,000 , although accounting for 90% of exports and 80% of tax revenues . Necessary economic diversification is complicated because it is uncertain the elite wants diversification given its control over import and export and reluctance to allow an unfettered free market . <p> There have been changes . Transparency has improved in revenue if not expenditure through publication of an oil diagnostic undertaken by outside consultants KPMG and moves towards declaration of signature bonus payments . Although allegations of corruption persist , with high-ranking government officials implicated in private business deals related to their public office , there were successful prosecutions of senior officials in 2003-2004 . In July 2004 Angola signed up to the African Unions Peer Review Mechanism although it is far from meeting its conditions . <p> Angola then faces the task of moving from a state of non-war to a Civil / Social Peace . But despite GDP growth , a current account surplus , and the lowest inflation rate ever 3 , transition would have to be from a fragmented national economy with a history of financial embezzlement and misappropriation of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor administrative capacity , a large child population at risk from disease , and largely weak opposition and civil society . If a genuine transition it would mean ending corruption , tackling poverty , allowing the development of a genuinely independent private sector , creating an open and transparent tendering process , transforming the political system into a pluralist democracy . Civil society also calls for action on disarming the armed civilian Angolans ( an estimated one third of the population but not a government priority ) , clearing ( the unknown numbers of ) landmines , and addressing the exclusion of the poor and marginalized , especially women . A widely owned electoral process would legitimize the institutions of government , debatedly without it since 1996 , and lead to a constitution guaranteeing citizens ' rights . <p> But there are a number of reasons why the government can ignore these problems whilst maintaining its own stability and security . Renewal of war is highly unlikely whereas continued high oil prices and fields for development and oil-backed loans look set to continue . The latter are not as cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued Middle East instability combined with US ( disputed ) hegemony over the Gulf of Guinea/ the American Lake means that Washington is looking to increased African oil , expecting it to provide 25% of its supplies . The increasing market share for Angolan oil going to the USA and other states means national and international security considerations precede transparency or human rights questions . <p> Angola is a strong security state under few internal or regional threats . Cooption , division and occasional repression work well to negate any possible internal threats . The Angolan elite remain largely immune to what international pressure there is for good governance - directed more towards questions of transparency , and a secure climate for foreign investment ( FDI ) rather than democracy and poverty alleviation . The West wants to engage with a booming economy , keen to compete with Chinas lions share of contracts for infrastructural ( re ) construction . <p> The continuing geo-petroleo-strategic interest of the USA in the Gulf of Guinea and Angola in particular as alternative sources of supply to the Middle East was shown in continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US market ( although oil exports to China overtook those to the USA ) and the latter continues as Angolas chief trading partner , political patron and major aid donor and gives it on rather inconsistent grounds preferential African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) treatment . Relations improved with Bern after the resolution of Falconegate 4 whereby the Swiss released $17m for humanitarian purposes of frozen Angolan funds 5 . <p> This lack of international pressure is against the background of declining world oil production now over the Bell curve . Regionally , excluding Zimbabwe and ( parts of ) the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , the region has been stabilised - in part by previous Angolan interventions to destroy UNITA bases . Angola is able to use the rhetoric of sovereignty and anti-imperialism which resonates well in the southern African region , despite the more partial AU view of sovereignty as opposed to the absolutist OAU version . <p> Luanda alleges negotiations are taking place on ending the Cabindan separatist conflict - distinct from though entangled with the civil war . Cabinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for independence . Cabindan human rights organization Mpalabanda Cabinda Civic Association ( MACC ) says although it received a document from the government in February 2006 on greater autonomy for the enclave , it has heard little since of any negotiations . If Cabinda can be stabilized , Angolas rulers can open up human rights a little especially in the coastal region/ Luanda without endangering control . <p> Additionally , rather than seeing forthcoming elections whenever they are as an opportunity , the population being only too aware of what happened in 1992 , seems as much fearful or apathetic . <p> The governing MPLA can pay off and play off other parties 6 . Whilst there are factions , the president runs a parallel state and seems in control as with his reversal of not standing as its presidential candidate . Through government reshuffles he negates existing and potential opponents such as the chief of external intelligence agency General Fernando Miala ( who paid the price for becoming too popular ) . <p> UNITA formally reconciled its three factions after 2002 , but leader Isaias Samakuva is under threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other parties seem more concerned with getting their snouts in the trough rather than representing distinct interests and policies . <p> Political disorder and its uses <p> Angola is an example of the use of disorder as a political instrument where non-transparency , non-accountable authority , and a weak legal framework provide dynamics for elite accumulation . Historically there has been a Bermuda triangle of resource flows between Presidency , Sonangol and the national bank , bypassing formal organs such as the Ministry of Finance ( although the latter is gaining greater control ) . As well as vast corruption in the past detailed by many reports including from the IMF , Global Witness and Human Rights Watch etc , practices continue as shown in the reports from Brazil alleging illegal financial dealings linking the Angola Minister of Finance , and the Governor of the Central Bank 7 . <p> Sogge notes that the domestic Angolan political economy " can not be separated from the external constituencies , chiefly the global oil and banking industries , and strongly favourable diplomatic and military currents driven by Western ( especially US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of domestic governance " are at the same time problems of global governance " in which the constrained forms of global citizenship " practised by institutions offshore set limits to citizenship for ordinary Angolans onshore " . <p> Elections paths to democracy or ensuring the right result ? <p> Elections have been promised and not held since the end of the war in 2002 . The parliamentary and presidential elections announced unconvincingly in 2005 for September 2006 and 2007 respectively are now postponed until there are infrastructural improvements for which the government would gain electoral advantage and increased control over the process . <p> Civil society - small , autonomous but with some resistance <p> A third of Angolas population live in atomised musseques ( shantytowns ) , with little spontaneous collective action to solve common problems . Despite little alternative leadership and vision , there have recently been protests over forced removals in some neighbourhoods in Luanda , leading to the arrest of SOS-Habitat coordinator Luis Araujo and others . Change due to citizen pressure has been limited by the absence of public systems and institutions part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . There has been civil society questioning the continuation of JosT Eduardo dos Santos as President , transparency and corruption in government , the land law and the new constitution , the DDR process , police and military impunity , freedom of expression and political action , and Cabinda . <p> International activism has raised issues and set agendas in corporate behavior such as the Publish What You Pay campaign on transparency of payments by oil companies . <p> There has been talk of freeing up government control of the media and willingness to address the low rate of HIV/AIDS and associated vulnerabilities despite difficulties in access to rural areas . Despite low population density land is scarce , with an estimated four million people relying on subsistence agriculture for survival as the only source of family income . Land tenure and use are flashpoints for disputes with large-scale population return to rural areas . In the ideological shifts of the early 1990s , a huge privatisation program saw an elite land grab at the expense of small peasants . There is potential for conflict between customary law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although the 2005 land reform law allowed communities to access and legally register their land - leading to hopes of greater security for and improvement in Angola 's agricultural production - it is doubted it will eliminate conflict . <p> Women the burdens of war become those of peace <p> Women suffered enormously during the war both through the direct effects of violent conflict and the indirect effect of poverty on families and communities . 80% of IDPs were women and children , suffering high levels of mortality , malnutrition , illiteracy , poverty and HIV/AIDS and lack of access to health , information , education and water and decision-making . Current government crack downs on informal commercial activity increase poverty levels amongst poor urban women with a knock on effect on domestic violence against women . <p> Enter the IMF or not ? <p> Angola has applied for an IMF programme to restructure its debt 9 , but not for new loans given the tiny amounts compared to Chinese and other loans . A syndicate of European banks led by French bank Calyon are organizing a $2.25 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $800 million in new money for undisclosed use , with the Chinese buying the oil . Finance Minister Jose Pedro de Morais said endless failed talks with the IMF were due to its not having an accumulated knowledge of Angolan economics interpreted locally as being unwilling to understand elite needs . <p> Conclusion <p> The ruling MPLA has for many years with justification been able to blame the war for its repressive and unaccountable policies . Subsequently it has been able to point to the need to move from a war economy and polity into transition . But we do not have to believe the rhetoric over transition and its difficulties if we consider Angola as is in a steady state with economic and political policies marked heavily by the structures established by war and from command economy and state . It is able to use its oil wealth for elite accumulation and for overcoming resistance to its rule . Clientilism has largely replaced more repressive measures . As its oil wealth and ultra deep oil exploration possibilities increase it is increasingly able to ride out any international disquiet over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put resources where it wishes . There are some constraints in the present and future - such as wanting to present itself as not so corrupt to attract FDI , a desire to deal with its debts and its dependence on the maintenance of high oil prices but not sufficiently to disturb the equanimity of the elite and its accumulation strategy . Any opposition can be marginalized , bought off or in the last resort got rid of . <p> Despite rhetoric on increased transparency , accountability and democratization little has yet been accomplished to overcome the gap between ruler and ruled . Apart from some NGOs it seems there is little help they can expect in terms of support or pressure from the international community . As well as the increased autonomy for the elite with high oil prices and vulnerable supply , there are significant shifts in international and regional alliances in the face of the Chinese threat and the war against terror . <p> Dr. Steve Kibble is Advocacy Coordinator for Africa/Yemen , Progressio This is a revised version of a talk to the Africa Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a chapter on Angola for Africa Yearbook 2005 to be published by Brill on behalf of Africa Institute in Hamburg , Afrikacentrum , Leiden and Nordic Afrika Instituut Uppsala .

@@75400296 @4100296/ <p> ( October 11 , 2008 ) The proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 was an essential part of the globalizing vision of the United Nations Charter . This vision was formed during World War II , heavily influenced by the Roosevelt administration in the United States and deeply inspired by the famous message by President Roosevelt to the U.S. Congress in January 1941 " the Four Freedoms Speech ' in which he envisaged a new world order to be promoted when World War II had come to an end , ensuring four basic freedoms to everyone " freedom of speech , freedom of faith , freedom from want and freedom from fear " everywhere in the world . <p> It was a vision of global cooperation for common security and common wealth , through multilateral cooperation intended to replace unilateral self-assertion and power games . The vision in the Four Freedoms speech in January 1941 was repeated in the Atlantic Declaration between the United States and the United Kingdom in August 1941 and then built into the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Nations Charter , adopted in San Francisco in June 1945 , and later elaborated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . <p> The establishment of the United Nations implied a commitment by states to work together to maintain international peace ( UN Charter Article 1.1 ) , to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ( Article 1.2 ) and to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , , language , or religion ( Article 1.3 ) . <p> This vision of a global cooperation for the maintenance of peace , equal rights and self-determination of peoples and for global solutions of problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature underpinned by respect for human rights , was further elaborated by the adoption in December 1948 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole range of human rights that should guide the globalization process : Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . It was intended to be a cooperative process involving all nations and peoples on an equal level . <p> The process of globalization has unfortunately sixty years later ( in 2008 ) become deeply controversial . This is mainly because the main pursuit by dominant actors has been to globalize the market without paying sufficient attention to the other elements required for sustainable global cooperation . There should have been cooperation rather than dominance , and priority should have been given to the broad package of human rights including economic and social rights for the vulnerable . Instead , priority has been given to vast accumulation in the hands of few under the name of economic growth . <p> The right to food <p> The right to food which has formed part of internationally recognized human rights from their inception in 1948 has received increasing attention in recent years , not the least as a consequence of the food crisis . By internationally recognized human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the International Bill of Human Rights " the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted in 1948 and the two Covenants on Human Rights , on of them on civil and political rights , the other on economic , social and cultural rights , both adopted by the international community through the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948 . These rights are recognized in the sense that the community of states have agreed that these are the valid human rights . It does not mean , of course , that all states respect all these rights in practice . It remains a continuing struggle to ensure that all rights are respected and enjoyed by all . <p> One illustration of the growing recognition of the right to food as a human right is the adoption by the FAO Council in 2004 of the guidelines for states to realize the right to food in the context of food security ( see Arne Oshaug 's contribution ) . Another example is that the UN Human Rights Council convened a special session in May 2008 to emphasize the importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , and another is that the Parliament of the European Union adopted on May 22 , 2008 a resolution calling for the full implementation of the right to food . <p> In spite of this growing recognition and also the solemn commitments made by leaders of the world at the World Food Summit in 1996 and at the UN Millennium conference in 2000 to halve the number of hungry people , the stark fact is that there are more hungry people now than at the time of the World Food Summit . This is a dismal failure of the efforts made by world leaders to fulfill their commitments , and give grounds for suspicion that the commitments were not seriously intended to be followed up . <p> Realistically , we have to be aware that reduction of hunger does not have a high priority among influential decision-makers , particularly not if it conflicts with other aims that are considered more fruitful or beneficial from their perspective . Land reforms providing small plots for the landless and improvement of productivity for smallholders would substantially reduce hunger , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would be an obstacle to foreign or city-based capital investments in land . Economic growth through facilitation of large-scale investment and the expansion of international trade is more highly valued not only to ambitious entrepreneurs but also to national authorities , even if the benefits accrue to a limited number of persons and make others further impoverished . Significant tax incomes or royalties from investors are required to finance military expenditures , the national administration , and other expenses which are seen as desirable for national authorities . Modest but essential improvements for smallholders and the landless could significantly reduce hunger , but it will not provide taxes and other opportunities for central authorities and are therefore not encouraged . This is one of the reason why hunger is so persistent is so persistent in rural areas of developing countries <p> On contemporary globalization <p> Globalization in its present form is both a threat and a range of opportunities . As noted above , there was initially a vision reflected in the United Nations Charter of cooperative globalization for the solution of social and economic problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were efforts to follow it up by constructive developments in the early decades after World War II . It was severely hindered by the onset of the Cold War , when human rights of all kinds were frequently violated . <p> When that hindrance was slowly faded away new problems arouse : A narrower , purely market-oriented globalization gained grounds in the 1980s , benefiting those who were already economically strong but distributing the benefits extremely unevenly and aggravating the situation for many vulnerable peoples . I have described the process in a more extensive article to which interested readers are referredclick . <p> The dominant trend in present processes of globalization is to expand the global reach for investments and to broaden market for profit . Corporations are the main tool used by investors in this process . International financial institutions mainly serve to promote this process . There is a relentless pressure for unrestricted global trade and investment , which in general terms can be beneficial if carried out between equal partners , but can be very harmful between highly unequal partners . The distributional impact within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits some segments of national societies and is harmful to others . <p> Paradoxically , it is only in developed countries that groups such as farmers and organized labour , due to their political impact in the democratic process , manage to resist through subsidies and trade barriers some of the negative impact for them of free international trade . In most developing countries the truly vulnerable groups do not have the strength to resist the pressures of market globalization . For them , international trade can be doubly negative : They are neither protected against the harmful negative consequences arising from international trade on their established sources of livelihood , nor do they achieve the positive benefits that could have resulted for them had all trade barriers and subsidies in developed countries been eliminated . <p> This is sad , but at closer inspection it should not be surprising . Vulnerable groups in rural areas have little or no political influence even in political systems where formal democratic rules are applied , in spite of their significant numbers . It might be expected that they in a functioning democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only are they hungry which leaves them little energy beyond what is required for mere survival , but in many countries most of them are illiterate or semi-literate , with very little communication possibilities and with low levels of information about decisions made elsewhere which impact their livelihood . <p> Most members of the elite live in the urban areas " and it is the elite that determine the policy of their government . <p> In the present process of globalization , the international financial institutions are dominated by the developed countries , a fact which is also reflected in the voting rules for these institutions . To the extent that representatives of developing countries are given a voice in the decision-making of those institutions , they tend to be recruited from the national elite and have little motivation to protect the interests of the vulnerable but politically and economically insignificant groups . Should a bang of bad conscience occur , they can always fall back on the credo that in the long run the expanding investments , market and production will trickle down to the poor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are all dead , and what is very clear is that in the long run hundreds of millions will die from hunger while the markets expand . <p> Evictions and marginalization in the rural areas of developing countries <p> Taking into account the factors mentioned above , there should be no surprise that little attention has been given to rural development except in the form of encouragement of large-scale investments or capital-intensive production which is beyond the reach of most of the smallholders . The kind of agriculture that has been promoted in the past has been of little or no help for the rural poor . In order to pay foreign debt ( often recklessly incurred by political leaders ) and in order to be more competitive in international markets , several governments of developing countries have encouraged the export of national resources and agricultural products such as sugar , flowers , and coffee , in addition to timber and minerals . The new fascination is to go into production of liquid biofuel production . <p> In order to produce such agricultural products quickly , efficiently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often encouraged the eviction or marginalization of indigenous peoples , smallholders and peasants ( often women ) and have made the land and resource extraction to investors and their corporations , to facilitate an economy of scale and more modern ' forms of production . <p> Measures to help smallholders such as farm subsidies and cheap credit policies has been opposed by international financial institutions and has fallen out of favor at the national level of many developing countries because it does not serve the interests of those who influence the government . Large parts of the rural population either become landless people who can be exploited for seasonal labor , or who migrate to the urban areas where they hope to have a better life , often in vain because there in many countries there are very limited employment opportunities available . The double effect of the push factor " forcing the indigenous peoples or peasants out of their livelihood " and the pull factor , the dream of a better life with low food cost in the urban areas " are among the main factors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these new urbanites in their shantytown dwellings are able to influence their governments , their main interest is to get cheap food , requiring the state to maintain artificially low food prices or to import from abroad at prices which can not be met by the local producers . This further aggravates the situation of smallholders . <p> The situation has been aggravated during recent years by the soaring food prices which have seriously affected the urban poor and the landless rural people , but with no benefit to the smallholders who are not able to pay the higher costs of seeds , fertilizers and petrol . On the contrary , since the benefit of higher food prices can be obtained through an economy of scale , the attraction of higher food prices have further intensified the removal of smallholders in favour of investors going into large-scale , plantation-type production . <p> Biofuel production is likely to accelerate the trend towards concentration of land and the eviction of vulnerable groups . The production of biofuel has a much more drastic impact than other forms of intensive agriculture . Economy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will mostly be carried out on large-scale plantations . Smallholders are likely to have a minor space in this production , which requires an integrated industrial/agricultural organisation of production , factory processing , transport and distribution . <p> Plantation-type production is also much more attractive than other agricultural activities to non-local investors who are only interested in large-scale production which can be controlled from afar . Unless stringent regulations are put in place , it is likely that such production will speed up a negative process of evictions and marginalisation and to which there are no socially adequate safety nets , unless there is a full recognition of the problems and a willingness to take the necessary steps to minimize the risks.click <p> A related factor is that of speculations in the commodities market involving futures on food commodities : This has contributed significantly to the soaring food prices . Speculators base themselves on political decisions such as the establishment of high quotas for biofuel consumption . Speculators have predicted that this would lead to higher prices for food and have therefore gone into speculative transactions which indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for poor people . <p> Is there reconsideration under way ? <p> The present global policies for poverty eradication have failed miserably . The number of hungry people has grown . The high food prices are only to a very limited extent caused by temporary shortfalls in production , they are mainly the result of long-range policies including diversion of food resources to biofuel , the growing dependence on costly inputs such as fertilizers and petrol for motorized machinery in food production , and speculation in land aimed at increasing profit for large-scale investors and in future food commodities . <p> The current crisis has generated soul-searching and increasing willingness to discuss and even to recommend significant changes in polices . The fascination with liquid biofuel for transport has significantly decreased in some quarters . Many have recognized that it neither reduces global warming nor improves in any significant way the access to renewable energy and that , on the contrary , biofuel production in the developing countries will have serious negative social and environmental consequences . Investors still persist , however , and many governments encourage them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can make a profit , investors will continue until social and environmental objections become strong enough to stop it . <p> A highly important study , initiated by FAO and the World Bank called International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge , Science and Technology for Development , was recently completedclick . It contains significant pointers towards a new orientation of agricultural policy . It emphasizes the need to promote small-scale agricultural systems through development-oriented local government and through institutions such as cooperatives , farmer organizations and local business associations and unions to support small-scale farming systems , and to ensure greater and more effective involvement of women and the use of their knowledge , skills and experience . <p> Among the tools that could be used to bolster this reorientation is the human right to food , set out in Article 11 of the UN Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights whereby states recognize the right of everyone to the right to adequate food and to be free from hunger and to take steps to ensure that everyone can enjoy those rights , and also Articles 24 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby the right of every child to sufficient nutrition and adequate standard of living are recognized and the obligations to take appropriate measures are set out . All states in the world are parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , with the two exceptions of the USA and Somalia . <p> There is a growing number of nongovernmental organizations focusing on economic and social rights . Some of them , in particular FIAN , focus particularly on the right to food . These organizations are becoming increasingly active and with an expanding network in developing countries . <p> The adoption in 2004 by states through the FAO Council of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food is another important contribution , and it has been greatly strengthened by the establishment of the Right to Food Unit of the FAO Secretariat . <p> Another positive factor has been the activities of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food , appointed by the Human Rights Council . The annual reports of the first Rapporteur , Jean Ziegler , helped significantly by specific examples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the realization of the right to food , and his successor appointed in 2008 , Olivier De Schutter , has shown his ability to move forcefully on this issue by convincing the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session on the theme of the right to food in the context of soaring food prices ( May 2008 ) . <p> Real progress in the elimination of hunger will not be achieved , however , before states fully commit themselves to a human rights-based approach to development . Some states , including the United States , have not even ratified the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and are therefore not legally obliged to implement the right to food . Some of those who have ratified have done very little to implement their obligations , and there are hardly any sanctions which can pressure them to do so . <p> Economic growth in itself is no guarantee that hunger will be eradicated . India has had a fabulous economic growth in the last decade , but the conditions of the ordinary people have not improved much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrates that landless and small landholders can not through their democratic participation significantly improve their own situation " a commitment by the elite to economic and social rights for all is required . While democracies can prevent mass starvation , it can not without deliberate and targeted action prevent extensive , perennial , but silent hunger " which is still widespread in South Asia and in many other developing countries . <p> The improvement of conditions in European countries during the late 19th century and the 20th century was not due simply to economic growth . To a large extent , the dynamics was the opposite : Because economic and social rights were recognized ( safe tenure for smallholders , labour rights , rights of everyone to education , universal health services ) economic growth was accelerated . Why so ? Because more people became more productive and creative , with higher education and less hindered by hunger and diseases . <p> When political elites recognize that promotion of human rights including economic and social rights such as the right to food actually enhances sustainable economic growth , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of the past . In his Four Freedoms speech , Franklin Delano Roosevelt said that this was not something to be left to a distant millennium but something that could be achieved within his own generation .

Are they ready to support long-term development assistance as well as short-term hunger relief ? These are some of the questions that were explored in a recent study by the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) that included a nationwide poll of 901 randomly selected adult Americans , focus groups , and a review of polling from other organizations . <p> The results were very encouraging for those who would like to see the United States maintain or expand its efforts to stem world hunger . PIPA found overwhelming support for U.S. foreign aid programs aimed at reducing hunger as well as for U.S. participation in an effort to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong support for aid focused on Africa , where hunger is most pervasive and , in some areas , still on the rise . Support for development assistance was also strong . <p> Strong Support for Efforts to Reduce Hunger <p> Overwhelming majorities support U.S. efforts to alleviate hunger abroad in principle . In the survey , 87 percent favored the U.S. " giving food and medical assistance to people in needy countries . " Respondents were also asked to rate reasons for giving aid , as well as forms of aid , on a zero-to-ten scale , with zero being completely negative , 10 being completely positive , and 5 being neutral . The most popular reason for giving aid was to " alleviate hunger " , which received a mean score of 7.71 , with 77 percent giving a response of 6 or higher . Aid " to help poor countries develop their economies " was next , with a mean score of 6.42 ; 59 percent gave it a score above 5 . With regard to the forms of foreign aid , " child survival programs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent giving it a positive score ( i.e. , above 5 ) . <p> By contrast , reasons and forms of aid that stressed strategic goals received much lower marks . " To increase U.S. influence over other countries " was given a mean score of 4.40 , with just 23 percent giving a positive rating . The two forms of aid that ended up at the bottom were " aid to Israel and Egypt " , which was given a mean rating of 4.45 and viewed favorably by just 27 percent , and " military aid ... to countries that are friendly to the U.S. , " which was rated positively by only 25 percent , and earned a mean rating of just 4.26 . <p> Other results show a dramatic trend toward increased support for giving aid for hunger relief relative to other goals . For example , respondents were given three types of countries that might receive U.S. aid and were asked to say which they would select as " most important . " " Countries with the poorest economies " was chosen by a solid majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to U.S. security " ; and just 13 percent picked " countries needed by the U.S. as trade partners . " This is a dramatic shift from a 1986 poll , when a 44 percent plurality chose countries important for security and only 33% chose countries with the poorest economies . <p> Similarly , presented two arguments , only 34 percent preferred the one that said " we should only send aid to parts of the world where the U.S. has a security interest . " However , a strong 63 percent agreed with the argument that " when hunger is a major problem in some part of the world , we should send aid whether or not the U.S. has a security interest in the region . " <p> Other polls have also found strong support for putting a high priority on addressing the problems of world hunger and poverty . In a November , 1998 poll by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations , given a list of foreign policy goals , 62 percent said that " combating world hunger " should be a " very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it should not be an important goal . This was higher support than for the goal of " maintaining superior military power worldwide " ( 59 percent very important ) . <p> Attitudes about the current level of spending on hunger-related programs are much more positive than for spending on foreign aid in general . Less than one in four ( 23% ) said they felt the United States spends too much " on efforts to reduce hunger in poor countries , " while more than three in five ( 61% ) said the United States spends too much on " foreign aid . " Only 20 percent wanted to cut the amount spent to fight hunger , as compared with 40 percent who wanted to cut foreign aid overall . <p> Support for OECD Plan to Halve World Hunger <p> The poll contained a series of questions that tested attitudes regarding efforts by the OECD to carry out the 1996 World Food Summit pledge to cut world hunger in half by 2015 . We found that an overwhelming majority ( 83% ) supported U.S. participation in this effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the question , the pro arguments did much better than the con arguments ( see table ) . <p> Arguments For and Against a Program for Cutting Hunger <p> Given the high level of wealth in the industrialized countries , we have a moral responsibility to share some of this wealth to reduce hunger in the world . <p> Convincing : 69% Unconvincing : 29% <p> Because the world is so interconnected today , reducing hunger in the world ultimately serves U.S. interests . It creates more political stability , and by promoting economic growth helps create more markets for U.S. exports . <p> Convincing : 64% Unconvincing : 33% <p> The industrialized countries have huge economies and tremendous resources . If they would all chip in , hunger could be cut in half at an affordable cost . <p> Convincing : 75%Unconvincing 23% <p> It is not the responsibility of countries like the United States to take care of the hungry in other parts of the world ; that is the responsibility of their governments . <p> Convincing : 45%Unconvincing 52% <p> It is unrealistic to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than people in the industrialized countries would be willing to pay . <p> Convincing : 42%Unconvincing 53% <p> The causes of hunger in other countries are complex and poorly understood . It is naive to think that outsiders can really make a serious difference by throwing money at the problem . <p> Convincing : 41%Unconvincing 55% <p> Conclusion : So , having heard all these points of view , do you think that , if the other industrialized countries are willing to do their share , the U.S. should or should not be willing to commit to a joint plan for cutting world hunger in half by the year 2015 ? <p> Should : 83% Should Not : 13% <p> Perhaps most significant is how Americans feel about paying for a program to cut hunger in half . When we asked respondents how much it would cost the average taxpayer , the median estimate was $50 a year . To find out how Americans would feel about paying a set cost of $50 a year , PIPA in a different November , 2000 poll asked to assume that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries $50 a year , and that people in the other countries , as well as the U.S. , were willing to pay their share . " In this case , 75 percent said they would be willing to pay $50 , and just 19 percent would not . Thus , it is likely that a near-unanimous majority would be willing to pay the significantly smaller amount that many experts believe would be necessary for a program to cut world hunger in half . <p> Support for Aid to Africa <p> Consistent with the strong majority support for alleviating hunger and the relatively low priority given to strategic interests when thinking about foreign aid , Americans would also be likely to respond positively to an aid program aimed specifically at Africa . <p> In the survey , as with the OECD hunger plan , respondents were presented with strongly stated pro and con arguments on aid to Africa . An overwhelming 72 percent found convincing the argument that " Africa is the continent with the highest percentage of undernourished people , and where hunger is growing the fastest . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunger in Africa " ( unconvincing : 26% ) . <p> By a two-to-one margin ( 65% to 32% ) , respondents also found convincing the assertion that " Africa has the potential to become a significant market for U.S. trade . Therefore , the U.S. should make an effort to help Africa get on its feet . " By contrast , 70 percent rejected as unconvincing the argument that " The U.S. has no vital interests in Africa . Therefore the United States should make Africa a lower priority when deciding where to distribute its aid " ( convincing : 24% ) . <p> After having heard all the arguments , respondents were asked if " U.S. aid to Africa should be increased , cut , or kept about the same . " An overwhelming 81 percent said that aid to the continent should be increased ( 31% ) or kept about the same ( 50% ) . Only 12 percent wanted to cut aid to Africa . This is far lower than the percentage that wanted to cut foreign aid in general ( 40% ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount spent to reduce hunger in poor countries ( 20% ) . This is particularly striking because a 53 percent majority found convincing the argument that " the corruption in the governments of African countries is so widespread that U.S. aid does little good there . " <p> Other recent surveys by Gallup , Newsweek , Harvard University , and CNN/Time have found strong support for aid to Africa and a desire for greater focus on the continent , particularly in light of the AIDS crisis there . <p> Support For Development Assistance <p> In addition to supporting efforts to reduce hunger in poor countries , a large majority also supports development assistance for such countries . Seventy-three percent said they favored " aid that helps needy countries develop their economies . " As noted above , " helping poor countries develop their economies " was the second-highest-rated reason for giving aid . <p> Arguments against development assistance - i.e. , that it is ineffective , too complicated , or that it simply ends up in the pockets of corrupt officials - do not persuade the majority . <p> Presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " helping poor countries develop their economies is too complicated and we can not really tell if it is doing much good , " while 71 percent agreed that , " It is important to help poor countries develop their economies so that they can become more self-sufficient .

The public overwhelmingly believes the United States should commit to a plan to cut world hunger in half by 2015 , and a strong majority appears willing to pay for it .

@@75400301 @4100301/ <h> European Union Polices Block African Agricultural Exports <p> Action for Southern Africa ( ACTSA ) <p> ( July 2002 ) During recent years , it has become clear that Southern African countries have a large market for their horticultural produce - vegetables , fruits and flowers - in the European Union ( EU ) . Horticultural crops , especially processed ones , present a convenient and lucrative trading opportunity for many African countries . However , the EU keeps out African horticultural produce from its markets by subsidizing its own farmers disproportionately and by setting over-stringent requirements for imported produce . <p> Trading out of poverty Africa needs to trade if it is to make money for development . The United Nations Development Program Human Development Index for 2001 states that Zimbabwe made ten times as much money from exports than from Overseas Development Assistance , for Mozambique the ratio is fourfold . <p> Until recently , agricultural trade for Africa has generally meant exporting a readily available , little processed commodity such as coffee , tea or cocoa . Many of these agricultural products are of low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world market price which can leave a country 's economic base in a very precarious position . Exporters like Tanzania and Ghana have been riding the rollercoaster of fluctuating world prices for coffee and cocoa for decades . Diversifying exports and switching to higher-value goods is identified by many , not least the IMF and World Bank , as an economic priority . <p> Business is booming Horticulture is defined as the cultivation of garden crops , i.e. fruit , vegetables , flowers and nuts . Familiar Southern African horticulture crops include chillies , green beans , mangetouts , cut flowers , citrus fruits and cashew nuts . The majority of the people of Southern Africa earn their livelihoods from agriculture - in many cases taking the form of horticulture . If Southern African countries were able to expand in this area they could earn extra foreign exchange and create more jobs . <p> In some parts of Southern Africa horticulture is already a booming business . Horticulture is a vital export-earning sector , especially for Malawi , South Africa , Zambia and Zimbabwe and the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambia exported over 5,000 tons of horticultural products in the 1997-8 season recording earnings of $48 million . By the 1999-2000 season this had risen to 8,400 tons and $62.6 million . <p> European markets are critical for Southern African exporters , with just under half the region 's agricultural exports being sold in the EU . Some Southern African horticulture exporters have had success on the EU market by selling their produce when it is out of season in Europe . Others have managed to compete on European markets throughout the year and have attracted reasonable prices . <p> For example in Zimbabwe , the export of peas to the EU grew by 53% between 1993 and 1997 , leading Zimbabwe to account for 12% of the EU 's leguminous vegetable imports like peas and beans . Many other horticulture products originating in Southern Africa are now also sold in the EU market . <p> Profit from processing Horticulture not only provides much needed income to farmers and employment for farm workers , but by processing these crops even more jobs can be created . According to the Zimbabwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue creates four jobs in agriculture and one and a half jobs in processing . <p> Processing crops also adds value to the exports . Mozambique is earning far more from peeled and roasted cashew nuts than it does from the export of raw cashews , and in South Africa the production of tinned and juiced fruit and vegetables has become a significant industry . <p> Other Southern African countries could benefit from developing similar industries . At first glance the EU appears to support trade with Southern Africa . However it also pursues a range of policies which serve to discourage Southern African producers from exporting their processed horticultural produce to Europe . <p> Mozambique 's cashew workers <p> A World Bank report concluded that Mozambique could earn between US $130 and $230 more for a ton of shelled cashews than for a ton of raw nuts . However , in 1995 the World Bank and IMF forced Mozambique to phase out the tax that it used to discourage the export of unprocessed cashews . As a result the cashew processing industry collapsed and 7000 Mozambican workers lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozambique won the right to start protecting its cashew processing industry again . The EU had gone along with the World Bank 's job-destroying policy and is now giving aid to help small farmers and businesses get the sector back on track . <p> The European markets European markets are very important for Southern Africa 's agricultural produce . In many cases the European Union gives special access to its markets to products from African countries , whilst trying to prevent imports from elsewhere by charging high tariffs on imports from countries outside the EU . However , the EU has given even better deals to countries which are not as poor as those in Southern Africa but are politically favored by the EU . For example , Zimbabwe pays 9.2 Euros for every 100kg of sweet corn it exports to the EU , whereas Moroccan sweet corn enters Europe duty free . <p> Southern African countries are exempt from most of these tariffs as a result of various trade agreements . The Cotonou Agreement is an agreement between the European Union and African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , which has signed a separate bilateral agreement with the EU ) are part of this agreement . Under Cotonou , African countries are exempted from paying tariffs for most of their agricultural primary exports to the EU . <p> Most Southern African countries also have special trade privileges due to the recent Everything but Arms ( EBA ) treaty introduced by the EU . This allows all Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) tariff-free access to Europe 's markets for all their goods except arms . Although many of the countries in Southern Africa are classified as LDCs , some , which are still extremely poor , are not - including Zimbabwe and Swaziland . <p> Whilst on the one hand the EU is opening its markets to African producers ( through agreements such as Cotonou and the EBA Treaty ) on the other it is making it harder for them to be competitive . Through a range of policies , which include intervention in markets to keep prices artificially high , subsidising the processing of European horticultural produce , and the imposition of non-tariff barriers such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fiercely protect its markets in horticultural produce . <p> Unfair subsidies Even if all tariff barriers were removed overnight European farmers would remain at an enormous advantage . Despite the fact that European farming methods are expensive and African agricultural producers are often highly efficient , African farmers find it impossible to compete . The EU boosts its agricultural competitiveness through a complex web of policies called the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) . <p> Through the CAP , Europe 's farmers are given various support programs and large subsidies including producer subsidies , subsidies to processors , and export subsidies . These enable farmers to earn a high price for their products while consumers still pay reasonable prices in the shops . African governments simply can not afford to give their farmers the same benefits as European farmers receive through the CAP . Subsidies to processors of tomatoes , peaches , pears , citrus fruits and dried fruits have increased recently by 75 million Euros , to180 million Euros in 2001 . <p> If the EU continues to use these support mechanisms for European producers it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to pay tariffs when their produce enters European markets . This would inevitably reduce the amount of Southern African produce entering the EU . These subsidies and support for European farmers also lead to cheap European agricultural produce being sold on other markets across the world . This can mean that even within Southern Africa heavily subsidized produce from Europe can be sold so cheaply that products from neighboring Southern African countries can not compete . <p> Tomato canning in South Africa <p> The EU gives aid to its tomato canners and to the EU farmers whose tomatoes are canned . It also drastically limits the amount of South African canned tomatoes sold in the EU by imposing a 14.4% tariff on entry . EU canners are displacing South African canned tomatoes in the USA , Japan and in South Africa itself . This has already resulted in two thousand seasonal and permanent job losses in the South African canning industry . The EU does allow other Southern African countries to export canned tomatoes to the EU duty free . But , as none except South Africa has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system continues to ensure that European tomatoes are protected from competition . <p> While propping up its own , economically inefficient farmers against competition , the EU is a vociferous and aggressive proponent of trade liberalization and open markets elsewhere . Under the Cotonou Agreement , ACP countries will benefit from tariff free access to EU markets but crucially they will also be obliged to reciprocate and abolish their tariffs on imports from the EU . As a result , their markets will then be open to produce from the EU without them being able to use subsidies to protect their own producers . <p> Backdoor protectionism Another way in which the EU keeps out African horticulture produce is by applying overly restrictive rules on Maximum Residue Levels ( MRLs ) of contaminants that are permissible in food . These rules are often the main stumbling block for potential African exporters . <p> Under WTO rules countries have the right to introduce barriers to stop food entering their country if they are not satisfied that it meets high enough sanitary and phytosanitary standards i.e that levels of biological and chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) analyses evidence and makes recommendations to a body called the Codex Alimentarius Commission . Codex then sets MRLs that are held as being the universal standard . The EU , however , frequently chooses to ignore Codex recommendations and is often much stricter , only permitting very low levels of residues to be left on produce . Many producers and activists in Southern Africa feel this legislation is a form of back door trade protectionism . <p> One type of food residue that has been monitored by JECFA is aflatoxins . Aflatoxins occur naturally in or on certain foods including processed nuts and dried fruit . Aflatoxins are toxic and their occurrence in food has been linked to the incidence of certain cancers . JECFA analysed the potential human health impact of aflatoxins and concluded that even if they insisted on halving the level of residue allowed on food this would only lead to approximately two fewer deaths per billion people per year in the EU . Despite this , the European Union has chosen to demand that food entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less aflatoxins residue . World Bank research has shown that adhering to higher standards rather than sticking to Codex MRLs for aflatoxins could cost Africa $220 million a year , equating to a massive 47% of the trade of dried fruit and nuts alone . <p> Excluding small scale farmers Whilst reducing agrochemical use and protecting workers and consumers from exposure to dangerous toxins is very important , the sanitary legislation of the EU is out of touch with realities on the ground in Africa . Particularly small , independent farmers find it impossible to comply with over-stringent EU legislation and as a result are effectively excluded from the horticultural supply chain . <p> The EU is in the process of " harmonizing " MRLS for 100 pesticide active ingredients . This process puts the onus ( and cost ) for proving that pesticides are safe on pesticide producers . As African horticultural crops are comparatively small-scale the pesticide producers are often unwilling to enter in to the process of proving that their products with low turnovers are safe . Without proof , MRLs are set at zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . <p> If the EU genuinely intends to improve quality of life by its food standards regulations , instead of simply setting rigid limits , it needs to make an effort to help Southern farmers comply with them . Instead of the ' stick ' approach , British-based group , the Pesticide Action Network suggests the EU needs to invest in training . Poor-country farmers should learn about the use of chemicals , chemical-free Integrated Pest Management , marketing , and not least , current EU legislation on pesticides . Aid could also be targeted to improving infrastructure and reliability of supply chains . Otherwise , small-scale growers will suffer most , being the least able to keep up with standards and legislation . <p> ACTSA 's demands To support horticultural production in Southern Africa the EU should : <p> Cut subsidies as part of the ongoing review of the CAP <p> Stop using non-tariff barriers to prevent Southern African produce being imported in to Europe <p> Stop the over zealous application of quality standards and help Southern African farmers to comply with necessary health and safety regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Africa 's capacity to benefit from trade and calls on the EU to : <p> Remove all barriers that stop Southern Africa selling to EU markets <p> Allow Southern Africa to develop its ability to trade by protecting key sectors <p> Ensure that its trading policy promotes development and co-operation in Southern Africa . <p> This briefing was produced with support from DFID and the European Union . <p> Action for Southern Africa ( ACTSA ) , based in Great Britain , campaigns with the people of Southern Africa as they strive to build a better future . Working for peace , democracy and development across the region , ACTSA is the successor organization to the Anti-Apartheid Movement . ACTSA influences decision-makers in Britain and Europe on policies that affect Southern Africa . It keeps the region in the public and political spotlight through lobbying , publication of reports and briefings and media work . 
@@75400302 @4100302/ <p> The economics of famine does not lend itself to scientific treatment . Research such as this book summarizes must be done under the most difficult , dangerous and unpredictable of institutional and environmental hardships . Research contrasts with the horror and moral judgment most observers experience when famine strikes . Famines and poisonous snakes are things one would rather not meet in the wild , and in chance encounters the compulsion is either to avoid or eliminate them as soon as possible . However , for those of us faced with the task of dealing with their anatomy and effects , there is no substitute for good science . Famine in Africa is good science . <p> The soundness of the research is assured in that the three authors early in their careers were the Institute for Food Policy Research . Joachim von Braun is now at the University of Bonn , Germany where he heads the Economics Department in the Center for Development Research , and Patrick Webb is now on the faculty of Tufts University 's School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research done on famine in Africa over the past two decades , particularly in Ethiopia and Sudan , supplemented with key work in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa . The research is organized around a conceptual framework consisting of a matrix of three determinants of famine : 1 ) policy , institutional and organizational failures , 2 ) resource poverty , climate shocks , and 3 ) population pressures . Each of these are interrelated and connected to a country 's strategic policies , organization and governance , program interventions , and household income , nutrition , mortality , services , and migration during a famine event . <p> The three chapters devoted to the three determinants advances our understanding through new empirical studies , but the overall analysis is limited by the general lack of understanding of the complexity of the interplay of natural and human forces behind the famines analyzed . Perhaps the most original contribution in these chapters is the urban unemployment problems created by rural famines . <p> The following two chapters are more assessable with the empirical approach taken to market success , market failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can begin to see the plight and struggle of the families undergoing famine . Some the best information on household food insecurity and its relationship to child nutritional status under the coping dynamics of famine stresses can be found in this book . <p> The final chapter applies the analysis together with reviews of policies and relief , employment ( particularly labor intensive employment programs ) and agricultural programs that have been tried in African famines . The strengths and weaknesses of empirical studies of each approach to famine are carefully summarized . The chapter concludes with six hard won conclusions about the dynamics and lack of political , financial and research commitment to deal with famine in Africa by the international community . <p> As I began writing this review , I was reminded of two experiences I had related to famine in Ethiopia . Although I believe this book is a required part of the library of all workers on the relief situations so characteristic of the post-Cold War era , neither of my experiences is illuminated by it . <p> The first was on a rapid assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Eritrea had just ended . Although it was very clear that authorities in Addis Ababa maintained some degree of overall control , the government had no local capacity or will to implement the policies that would effect local relief or rehabilitation efforts one way or the other . International NGOs , such as CARE , had considerable latitude and in effect were a shadow government in some of the poorest sections of the country . It is not clear that the authors give enough attention to the role or ingenuity of local or international NGOs . <p> The second experience was on a brief sabbatical at Brown University 's World Hunger Program in 1995 , managing research on the Ethiopian conflict , specifically the work of an Ethiopian and an Eritrean graduate student . It became increasingly clear to me that the perspectives on the history and events surrounding the conflict and famines in Ethiopia were very different between persons from different parts of the country .

@@75400303 @4100303/ <p> This article contains the main text from a recent article by Richard Garfield . Potential humanitarian consequences of war with Iraq have been widely discussed . Reports from UN agencies and research organizations claim that thousands or millions of people will starve , be killed , become victims of weapons of mass destruction , or become refugees . Most of these reports are highly speculative and based on little substantive information . Here , instead , information from Iraqs experience in the Gulf war is combined with more recent observations on living conditions and current vulnerabilities . Data are tempered by personal observations during visits to Iraq and as consultant to international organizations there , most recently in January 2003 . Reasoned analysis of such information is key if unnecessary suffering is to be avoided . <p> The Magnitude of Excess Deaths . No reasonable basis to estimate the number of excess deaths in a future war exists . Military planners prepare for a very wide range of possible outcomes and their best estimates are often quite wrong . But l in a burning building , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of risk are well known . In the 1991 Gulf war casualties from chemical exposures were mainly related to oil well fires and numbered in the hundreds . Since biological and chemical weapons are difficult to disseminate they too may cause a relatively small number of casualties . This is especially true if they are not used in urban areas , where more people would be exposed in an attack . <p> Heavy bombardment in 1991 resulted in an estimated 3500 civilian deaths . This is a relatively small number of deaths given the number of explosives used and the large exposed urban population . Improved targeting could further reduce the number of deaths from bombings . Refugees and displaced people experience mortality rates about ten times higher than the settled populations from which they come . In 1991 , there were an estimated 14,000 deaths among IDPs , mainly among the half a million Kurds in the inhospitable northern border region . Far more deaths were caused from two other types of exposures after formal hostilities ended . Internal fighting and among insurgents and vengeance attacks claimed about 35,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number approaches the total of 56,000 soldiers killed in the Gulf war . The majority of post-war deaths resulted from destruction of essential goods and loss of access to services among the civilian population . A doubling of mortality rates during this period among Iraqs population of 18 million over eight months resulted in 111,000 excess deaths . This exceeds the total number of deaths from all other causes combined. ( 1 ) <p> Food and Nutrition . In 1991 domestic grain production was high , the populations nutritional status was good , extensive central stockpiles were in place , and buying power among most Iraqi families was good . A food crisis occurred during 1992 1997 . Improved rations via the Oil for Food program after 1997 gradually led to improved nutrition . This contributed to both a decline in malnutrition and an increase in obesity. ( 2 ) In the North in 2000 , about 5% of people subsist exclusively on the ration and another 11% were able to only slightly supplement it ( 3 ) . It can be assumed that the conditions of people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food production more limited in the Center and South . The poor are those at greatest nutritional risk today , along with those in hospitals , orphanages , and prisons . <p> Child malnutrition rates in the Center and South of the country have in the last two years declined to the levels similar to those in 1991 . Malnutrition rates in the North are lower now than at any time in the past ( 4 ) . Since late 2002 the Iraqi government has attempted to stockpile foodstuffs ( 6 ) but is limited by a decline in oil revenues since 2000 and limits to authorized food purchases in the Oil for Food ( OFF ) program . The distribution of double rations for several months has increased household stocks . In addition , most people have purchased additional food in anticipation of war . Household stocks in 2003 include an average of 5 weeks worth of food stocks . In 2003 grain production rebounded from drought but is still below 1990 levels . <p> Food Delivery Systems . The interruption of rationed food distribution and markets during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of dependence on the centralized provision of foodstuffs would require new supplies within weeks to avoid nutritional problems . ( 7 ) Airdrop of food parcels , like during last years war in Afghanistan , would require about 700 full Hercules transport flights per day to deliver the 350,000 metric tons of food per month provided by the current Government food ration . The duration of conflict is a key variable for humanitarian conditions . If stability is established quickly , transport is available , warehouse stocks are released , and the importation of essential goods continues , the market there will likely be no food crisis . Most important in this regard is a need for the UN Security Council to establish a new mechanism to pay food suppliers from existing funds in OFF accounts . Without such legislation , payment is not assured once war begins and ships are likely to divert cargoes to other countries . <p> Damage to essential infrastructure <p> Electricity . A war in Iraq would likely start with a bombing campaign . The impact of bombings on the civilian population will depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilized . Area impact munitions such as cluster bombs and thermobaric weapons , used in Afghanistan , would cause massive disabilities if employed in urban areas . As in wars in Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Iraq in 1991 , the number of post-bombing casualties due to loss of essential infrastructure would likely be much larger than the number of deaths directly attributable to bombings . This can be avoided only if bombers carefully avoid targets including water pumping and chlorination stations , water sanitation plants , clinics , hospitals , transportation , electric generators , and communications . Similarly , collateral damage to such installations should be repaired immediately to limit humanitarian impact . Forward placement of spare parts and engineers , and alternative sources of water , food , and health care should be set up immediately following the securing of an area . <p> Iraqs electrical grid is likely to be one of the first targets of US military action . In 1991 , electrical power was the most severely damaged component of civil infrastructure with Baghdad losing power 10 minutes after initiation of the air war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cease-fire , nearly three months later . ( 8 ) Duplicate parts were available for most key items at that time ; such spares are not available today . <p> Before OFF materials for Iraqs electric system arrived in 2001 , generating capacity had deteriorated to 38% of previous capacity during peak summer load . ( 9,10 ) Iraq remains " dependent on electrical power for water purification and distribution , sewage treatment , and the functioning of hospitals and health care centers " ( 11 ) . Importation of electric generation equipment in the last 18 months under OFF has greatly increased production capacity in the national grid . The shortfall in production is estimated to be 10-15% during winter 2003 , when for the first time since 1991 rolling blackouts is no longer common in central Baghdad . More importantly , an estimated 70% of health institutions and water pumping stations have back-up generators that received frequent use during blackouts in recent years . If these generators are supplied with fuel and maintenance they will be capable of supporting some essential services in urban areas throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Water . Damage to water treatment plants removed 2.5 million people from water supply after 1991 . Iraqis received one quarter of pre-war water levels and water quality declined rapidly . Water pumping capacity in Baghdad increased from 166 liters per person per day in 1997 to 197 liters in 2002 . Moreover , loss to leakage is estimated to have declined from 40% to 30% in the last year with the use of new OFF-supplied pipe . Virtually all-urban water systems are chlorinated and a 6-month supply of chlorine is in place . Local government is now very busy sinking shallow wells in many neighborhoods to provide a source for emergency water supply . <p> Medical Care Services . Iraqs network of 129 hospitals and 900 clinics is now better supplied than at any time in the last 10 years . Six months worth of medical supplies are in the country and the health system is increasing their distribution from central to regional warehouses and service centers . Most health institutions have back up generators able to function at least part time . However , specialized medicines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate training in triage . It is not known if Iraqi health professionals will be available to civilians during the war ; much appears to depend on the local security situation and competence of local administration . <p> Discussion . The Gulf war and a decade of post-war crisis have had a major impact on nutrition , education , sanitation , and health . From a country that was approaching the level of developed country standards in health and nutrition , Iraq since 1990 experienced a precipitous decline towards levels characteristic of poor underdeveloped countries . Recovery gained momentum only slowly after the OFF program supplied large stocks of humanitarian goods starting in 1997 . This momentum showed more impact during 2001 2003 . Iraqis await war with better conditions than at any time since the 1991 Gulf war , but poorer conditions than before it . <p> Among the casualties has been the collection and analysis of data to assess living conditions , medical care services , and the impact of OFF program inputs . In the absence of good and timely information on conditions , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chemical and biological weapons . Historical experience suggests that civilians would likely suffer more from disruption in the supply of essential goods , especially if it lasted for more than a few weeks . Similarly , a risk of a rapid rise in mortality is great if security is not assured even where organized military engagements have ceased . As during the 1991 Gulf War , those at greatest risk are likely to be those in rural areas , women , those with low educational achievement , and those without extended family support networks . It is the risks posed by interruption of essential services or lack of security among these population groups which most requires our attention . <p> Richard Garfield , RN DrPH , Is Professor of Clinical International Nursing , School of Nursing , Columbia University and Visiting Professor , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health/Medical Advisor to the International Medical Corps . <p> 11. 17 July 1991 .

The United States needs to reverse this decline with a substantial new initiative . <p> Over 800 million people are malnourished , according to the Food and Agricultural Organization . The number of malnourished people declined during the 1970s and 1980s , but has risen during this decade , with the worst malnutrition occurring in Africa and Asia . Of the 12 million children who die each year in developing countries , 55 percent are attributable to malnutrition , according to UNICEF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the end of the Cold War , both of which should have increased resources available to address festering world problems , and the World Food Summit , which brought the nations of the world together to discuss the problem and make commitments to reducing malnutrition , resulting in the subsequent U.S. plan of action , resources from the United States directed toward reducing malnutrition have shrunk , not increased . <p> Table l indicates how a key component of U.S. assistance to prevent malnutrition , assistance to agriculture , has fared . USAID 's assistance to developing country agriculture has declined from $806 million in 1989 to $306 million in 1999 . This is a shocking decline of $500 million--62 percent ! <p> USAID 's Agricultural Assistance : 1989-1999 ( $ millions ) <p> 1989 <p> 1992 <p> 1994 <p> 1999 <p> Agricultural Assistance <p> 806 <p> 626 <p> 418 <p> 306 <p> Source : USAID <p> The other principal source of funding for preventing malnutrition has been food assistance . Food for Peace has declined substantially . Title II , the most important part of Food for Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and III have declined drastically . Title II provides assistance for emergency situations , and also for non-emergency situations such as using food assistance to increase agricultural production . However , the number of food emergencies have increased significantly , in part due to conflict , leaving a declining amount which can be used to address malnutrition and other development problems in non-emergency situations . Thus , we are faced with a substantial decline in U.S. resources devoted to preventing malnutrition in ordinary circumstances . Ordinary circumstances for the poor cause malnutrition all too frequently . <p> There could have been-- should have been-- a substantial U.S. initiative for fiscal 2000 to address the problem of malnutrition and the decline in U.S. resources directed to reducing malnutrition . Otherwise what was the point of the World Food Summit and the elaborate activities around the development of the U.S. Action Plan , which was supposed to respond to the challenges of the summit . The Plan however can be more accurately described as a U.S. Inaction Plan . The plan proposed no additional resources to combat malnutrition in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual U.S. response to meeting the world food summit goals . The actual U.S. response in the area of international food security for FY 2000 is to propose an increase of $15 million in the Africa Food Security Initiative . The world food summit goal is to reduce the number of malnourished people by half-- to 400 million , even as the world population grows . An increase in food security funding by $15 million is probably not enough to compensate for the cost of inflation in food security programs , and is a woefully inadequate U.S. contribution toward meeting these goals . <p> As the Administration has now submitted its budget , an improvement in the response to malnutrition must be provided by Congress . We acknowledge Congress ' and this subcommittee 's strong support for child survival . Efforts to reduce malnutrition also deserve the strong support of Congress and this subcommittee . <p> The World Hunger Education Service calls on Congress to provide an additional $120 million in U.S. foreign assistance funds to reduce malnutrition . This amount is not all that should be allocated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade-long decline in U.S. assistance for preventing malnutrition . <p> Let us indicate how the money might be used . <p> An additional $30 million should be provided for the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) . We believe that this important anti-hunger organization has not been accorded reasonable treatment by the United States government in recent years . Why has IFAD 's funding been cut so drastically ? The vast majority of the world 's poor , malnourished , and food insecure people either live in rural areas or support their families through agriculture-related activities . I would like to emphasize our support for this institution , the only international financial institution that focuses exclusively on this important rural population . This year , IFAD 's member states will examine the adequacy of IFAD 's resources to meet the growing need for its agricultural development activities . Given IFAD 's unique and effective role in promoting food security , we hope the United States , Administration and Congress alike , will play a constructive role in that examination and in the replenishment of IFAD 's resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that calls on the administration to contribute significantly to IFAD 's resources so the institution can continue its much-needed efforts to promote food security in developing countries worldwide . <p> We believe that $90 million should support USAID initiatives for the express purpose of reducing malnutrition . <p> Support to U.S. private voluntary organizations ( PVOs ) for the purpose of reducing malnutrition should be substantially increased . PVOs can reach rural areas where malnutrition is a problem and address the needs of low income communities . This is not actually an increase in U.S. funding for PVOs but rather a recognition of the fact that food aid funding-- Title II-- for the purchase of food which is delivered to developing countries and used for development purposes has been declining in the past decades . This increase merely restores some of the funding that has been lost , and in the foreign operations budget rather than the agriculture budget . <p> Aid to agriculture in Africa should also be increased . Most poor Africans depend on agriculture for their livelihoods . Congress recently passed the Africa : Seeds of Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated to implement the legislation . Again an increase in funding for African agriculture would not be an increase to new high levels of assistance , but would only serve to arrest the decline in assistance to African agriculture that has taken place . <p> We urge Congress , and the Administration , to make a commitment to reducing malnutrition in the world , and to providing sufficient resources to carry out that commitment . 
@@75400308 @4100308/ <p> A communitarian by conviction and contrarian by nature , John McKnight uses both probe lights in this collection of essays to examine how America has become " so dispirited . " His conclusion ? People are right to point to the burgeoning professional class . We know we are in trouble when we seek the approval of those who have commodified and packaged the emotions of normal human passages , such as grief , and referred them for specialized " treatment " by " experts . " In so doing , we become less and less able to form the mutual commitments that are the roots of community . The professionalization of our relationships gnaws away at the emotional ligatures that bind communities together and , as community is disabled at the local level , so is the hope for a nation of spirited people . <p> How , according to McKnight , does this happen ? Services to assist the poor transform citizens into professional " clients " and engender impotence psychological and social . The worst emasculators are those that pose as community counterfeits : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are especially pernicious , in his view , because they undermine a communitys confidence in its ability to address its own problems , all the while masquerading as its more knowledgeable substitutes . They spawn a " serviced society " whose culture feeds on management in lieu of community , commodities in lieu of care , and curricula where the oral wisdom of stories once nurtured the next generations survival . <p> The worst " institutional invader " of community life , as far as McKnight is concerned , is the medicalized health " care industry , " whose very name reveals it as a social oxymoron . Furthermore , the mystification of the medical field has given it so much power that its language and ideology labeling a persons " needs " and offering specialized " therapy " have been adopted throughout the service sector , which is a service-producing economy , yet he seems as dispirited as most when it comes to how individuals and communities can address that . Not surprisingly , perhaps , given the globalization of the economy and its increasing social and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critic would have some guiding insights . Maybe this is too much to ask . Perhaps it is a symptom of the very malady he is talking about . After all , it is not just the poor who are anesthetized by professionalism . The service sectors growth ( to 90 percent of the workforce by the year 2000 ) means that , until we retire , we all participate as servers and as the clients who serve to keep the servers in business in an alienating game of musical chairs . <p> For those who would like to know how to engage in community building at home , McKnight suggested in an interview that we look into the Movement for a Living Wage and some of the trade unions ( such as AFSCME and the SEIU ) that are taking the lead in the struggle to obtain adequate incomes . Income is income , he notes , and can not be siphoned off or tailored according to race and location , as are many services . <p> How might McKnights book apply to " development " work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign experts to boot . Our macro " clients " tend to be entire nations or regions of nations . Even those of us who flinch at many of the notions underlying such roles know that we must maintain our voices of authority even as we espouse the sanctity of local community or what ? Is the only authentic alternative to quit and go live among those whose lot we are paid to think we are improving ? <p> It may be the kind of revisionism McKnight abhors , but it seems that at a minimum we could design our projects and analyze policies to strengthen rather than obstruct local community . At first glance , that may make sense ; we will be considering strengthening NGOs , for instance , and since that emphasis has been in vogue since the Reagan years , can not we sit back and breathe more easily ? <p> But are NGOs necessarily more authentic representatives of the communities in which they work ? Do they promote a shared and consistent charter of human rights , income distribution , and local participatory democracy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance civil society , democratization , and the improvement of the quality of life should be furthered ; those that do not should be scuttled . Nothing novel here . But how often do we review our projects explicitly with this in mind ? And even if we do , does that make us truer to local communities ? Or are we crashing against long-held " community " values as we select and strengthen some of its players ? <p> It could all boil down to what we mean by community . Existing " community " may throttle the creativity , health , and human rights as we see them of women , indigenous populations , vast numbers of children , most of the poorer classes . In that sense , development work deliberately subverts some community authority , the way campaigns against domestic violence and discrimination against immigrants do that at home . Do the language and concerns about sustainability and local participation cover these contingencies ? Where does sustainability of a health project intersect with the sustainability of the community it serves ? And how does that communitys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture ? When we espouse family planning and the empowerment of women , for one , are n't  we knowingly and exuberantly hoping to alter those very things ? And when we invoke " community participation " is that not a tad paternalistic , when " origination " might be more democratic ? <p> There is no such thing as " technical " development work . It is all value-laden . So let 's accept that and take it from there . If we believe that the disruption we cause is ethical , we must believe that we are offering an ethical alternative and do so wholeheartedly , without the pretense of " technical neutrality . " <p> Are we inherently disrespecting the integrity of the communities whose problems and needs we take it upon ourselves to identify and set out to repair ? The mere fact that we do so implies we know something more or better . Do we ultimately benefit from the existence of those we are supposed to be benefiting ? Yes . That 's how we earn our livings . And there is no doubt that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often laden with turgid bureaucratic prose that would set us apart from and implicitly disqualify those who do n't  use it . <p> What does this mean we should do ? When we evaluate our work with open eyes at the end of the day , do we still feel that , on balance , the good outweighs whatever community disruption it unleashes ? Have we kept our promises and commitments ? Have we done our work in such a way that we have strengthened rather than weakened local capacity , autonomy , well-being , whatever our values are ? Have we deliberately considered " their " values in the process ? Have we made any difference at all ? That , I think , is up to each of us to determine . 
@@75400309 @4100309/ <p> Is development education taking place in the United States formal education sector : K-12 ( Kindergarten to 12th Grade ) and higher education ? <p> I posed this question to some teachers and professors working in this country 's schools and universities . Their almost unanimous response : " no . " <p> With a little more discussion , however , they may actually be responding " yes . " <p> Let us explore what this means and how this comes about , taking into consideration four key issues : terminology , standards , teaching , and teachers . <p> Anne Baker <p> Terminology <p> One obstacle to the understanding of , and , hence , implementation of development education is terminology . " We talk about internationalizing the curriculum at the college level , " states Dr. Angene Wilson of the University of Kentucky , " but we do not typically use the term global education or development education . " <p> The same is true for K-12 education , What one person calls " development education " may be what someone else terms " global education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corcoran/Roberts Peace Corps Partnership Project <p> Corcoran High School student Ronni Copeland and Roberts teacher are leading Roberts 3rd graders in an Ashanti children 's game . The Corcoran/Roberts Peace Corps Partnership Project funded the construction of a kindergarten for the villagers of Mensase , Ghana . Corcoran students taught lessons about the Ashanti culture-- language , foods , dance , customs-- to the Roberts classes . <p> Or it may be that some do not have a definition for it at all . In fact , beyond the education and development communities ( e.g. , the readers of this publication ) , the term elicits confused looks . " Does n't that have to do with fundraising ? " is a typical response . <p> While the lack of a consistent terminology may cause some confusion , there are more important issues in establishing development education however referred to in the curriculum . These refer to characteristics and requirements of the formal education sector in the U.S. today and how formal education relates to and/or supports development education . <p> Standards <p> In the K-12 classroom , the driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject has them . Every teacher must know them and must teach them . National and state standards prescribe what teachers should teach and students should be able to do at each stage in their academic career . Every teacher I have spoken to recently has indicated that unless what we are asking them to do fits the standards , they can not do it . So , is development education in the standards ? No , not exactly . Does it fit the standards ? Most certainly . <p> Teaching <p> Consider one example . <p> As a mathematics teacher , I knew from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards that my students must be able to understand and use functions . I often felt constrained by typical textbook examples asking students simply to plug numbers into given equations or to write mathematical models for seemingly trivial situations . I shared my students ' frustration at not being able to grasp textbook examples showing that y ( some unidentified variable ) is a function of x ( another unidentified variable ) . Typical examples from a textbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long it takes you to wake up-- an abstract concept-- depending on the temperature outside . Students are frequently given data ( and often simply whole numbers ) that fit neatly into an equation . <p> A High School , an Elementary School , and a Partnership with a Peace Corps Volunteer Overseas <p> Since 1983 the students at Corcoran High School in Syracuse , NY , have been raising awareness , as well as needed funds , for projects coordinated annually by Peace Corps Volunteers in their countries of service through the Corcoran-Roberts Peace Corps Partnership ( **31;303;TOOLONG ) . <p> Each year students in the International Relations Club choose one of many projects in communities requesting funding through the Peace Corps overseas . Over the years they have raised over $85,000 and funded 15 partnerships in Asia , Africa and Latin America , including five primary schools , a school for the blind ( the first in all of central Africa ) , a water well , a medicinal herb garden and ( this past school year ) an adult literacy project . <p> From their newsletter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in managing the projects over the years , with hundreds more drawing designs for the card competitions . Some of our students , having taught youngsters at Roberts a neighboring elementary school about the partnership villages , have gone on to or are going on to the teaching profession . And although we are presently funding our Partnership with a Corcoran graduate , we ca n't yet claim influence over the students . Our dream is to have students who were involved in high school join the Peace Corps . " <p> The program incorporates the target project into the Global Studies curriculum , as well as other classes through the drawing of note cards ( then sold to raise funds ) and cross-cultural exchanges with villagers supported by the project through letters , photos and artifacts . The high school students study the culture of the villages they support , then share their knowledge with the students at Roberts . Both Roberts and Corcoran students engage in special projects to raise the needed funds . The students do n't keep quiet about their efforts : their project has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps Times , at the biannual International Development Conference , and at regional and national education conferences . <p> Why not teach the same lesson using " real world " data now available at the click of a mouse on the Internet or in numerous readily available booklets ? For example , is there a relationship between education levels and health for girls and their families in the developing world ? ( Notice the open-ended exploration instead of " plug and chug " into equations already provided by the textbook ) . Students learn not only how to interpolate or extrapolate from an equation , but also how to pose a question , find data to fit their needs , determine their own mathematical model and then use it to make predictions on real world situations . ( The necessary statistical calculations can be done by hand-held calculators ) . <p> Thus , approaching the study of mathematics in such a manner not only teaches the skills prescribed in the standards ( national or local ) but also provides an exploration and better understanding of the " developing " world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , development education is commonly viewed as " belonging " in the social studies . However , significant development education can take place in other disciplines . In fact , it is a natural for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching . My mathematics example above could easily draw in the social studies and sciences , as well as the foreign languages depending on the countries of focus . Gabriell Paye teaches her high school biology classes in Boston about Ethnobotany , incorporating cultural exploration through research and interviews ( the social sciences ) and experimental design and implementation ( science ) . The possibilities are limitless . <p> Photo : Kris Hoffer , Peace Corps volunteer <p> Youngsters from Guimini , Mali showing off a book of stories written and illustrated by kindergarten students at John T.

Students at Roberts are taught about the culture of the Peace Corps Partnership village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities exist at the university level . " I think our problem in higher education is that we are bound by disciplines , " continues Dr. Angene Wilson , " so perhaps , for example , a political science instructor teaching World Politics will focus on world hunger and poverty as an issue or perhaps not . " Perhaps s/he will focus on other important issues , such as race . Dr. Merry Merryfield of The Ohio State University concurs . " Development education is taught at the college level in Rural Sociology along with women in development and courses in agriculture related to agriculture in developing countries . " Wilson is optimistic that discussion has taken place about " the need to cross disciplines , to look at issues more holistically . " <p> Teachers <p> What do the above obstacles mean for the implementation of development education ? Development education can happen . BUT it takes an extra effort on the part of the teacher to make it happen . <p> Photo : ODW <p> To launch Operation Day 's Work-USA ( ODW ) , students and teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official kick-off event that included a tour of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency ( ADRA ) Global Village . The purpose of the tour was to expose students to lifestyles in various developing countries and to choose a country that they would like to support through work . At the Global Village , the students participated in activities such as pumping water and here using bicycles to grind corn . <p> This need for extra effort , however , does not stop many . Development education is happening in elementary , middle and high schools , as well as in universities , as the examples in the sidebars indicate . Teachers and students with the motivation to do development education can find the resources and support they need . Many teachers have experience in the developing world already . Additional resources and support are available from NGOs and from the federal government . The resource list gives a few key examples of support available . <p> The sidebars provide a few examples of what educators in the U.S. are doing . While the numbers of activities are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort aimed at exploring the roles of youth in their communities both domestic and international , the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and a number of public and private partners are replicating a highly successful Norwegian development education program , Operation Day 's Work .

This past year ( the pilot year for the project ) , middle and high school students in Minneapolis , MN ; Thetford , VT ; Washington , DC ; Milwaukee , WI ; Grand Forks , ND ; and Quincy , MA worked with USAID , local officials , NGOs and the private sector to design , promote and implement the US version of Operation Day 's Work . This is how it works : <p> At the start of the school year students solicit and select proposals from NGOs working with communities in economically developing countries .

Although this program is currently coordinated from the top down , it will ultimately mirror the Norwegian model , which is entirely student-run throughout Norway . ( See related article in this issue . ) <p> In two of the three K-12 cases , the projects were carried out because of the interest and experience of the teacher . Teachers are not comfortable having to cover topics of which they know little or nothing . Most of the work described in these examples was initiated and implemented by those who had done their homework . Certainly those who had served in the Peace Corps or who worked for such organizations as USAID have first-hand experience in the developing world . Or , if they did not have direct experience themselves , they have the passion and drive to put the extra time and effort in on their own . There is very little preparation of new teachers or professional development of experienced teachers that provides training in development education . It takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn and to share their own learning with their students . <p> High School Students Experience Hunger Globally while Combating Hunger Locally <p> A growing number of schools , colleges and universities are experiencing first hand ( however short term ) the realities of the availability and distribution of food throughout the world through a Hunger Banquet . One such school is St. George 's School in Newport , RI , where students and faculty have been involved in this and other projects promoted by Oxfam America for 10 years . Through educational programs leading up to the Hunger Banquet , students learn that there is adequate food to feed the world , yet the resources are not distributed adequately . At the Banquet itself , a simple drawing of a ticket at the entrance to the dining hall determines if that student ( or faculty member ) will eat a three-course meal served by candlelight by waiters ( 15 percent ) , rice and sauce at a plain table ( 25 percent ) or simply rice from their crowded seat ( if they can find space ) on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequities in food distribution often leads to mixed emotions by the participants , ranging from guilt to indifference ( and enjoyment of much rich food ) by the " First World " group and placid acceptance to begging from their " Third World " neighbors . <p> The students at St. George 's arranged this event not only to raise awareness of the causes of and potential solutions to world hunger and poverty , but also to raise funds for their other programming . The students of the sponsoring club , Cultural Outreach , chose to put those funds right back into their local community . They used the money raised through this event for a soup kitchen in downtown Newport . Once a month , the students and a faculty advisor set up , prepare , serve and clean up a meal for approximately 100 men , women and children . <p> In the case of Operation Day 's Work , USA , much of the initial work was done by the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and its partners directly , from the planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classroom was provided in part " ready to go .

@@75400312 @4100312/ <p> Children suffer most from hunger , also referred to as malnutrition or undernutrition . Their mothers also suffer greatly from malnutrition , which affects the child before birth . There are two basic types of malnutrition . The first and most important is proteinenergy malnutritionthe lack of enough protein ( from meat and other sources ) and food that provides energy ( measured in calories ) which all of the basic food groups provide . This is the type of malnutrition referred to when world hunger is discussed . The second type of malnutrition is micronutrient ( vitamin and mineral ) deficiency . This is not the type of malnutrition referred to when world hunger is discussed , though it is certainly very important . <p> The meaning of hunger and its measurement in children <p> Protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) , in some degree , is essentially what is meant by hunger . Protein-energy malnutrition is basically a lack of calories and protein . Food is converted into energy by humans , and the energy contained in food is measured by calories . Protein is necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and maintenance of muscles . <p> Undernutrition in children appears in three ways , and it is most commonly assessed through the measurement of weight and height . A child can be too short for his or her age ( stunted ) , have low weight for his or her height ( wasted ) , or have low weight for his or her age ( underweight ) . A child who is underweight can also be stunted or wasted or both ( UNICEF 2009 , p. 13 ) . <p> Stunting . Stunting affects approximately 195 million children under 5 years old in the developing world , or about one in three . Africa and Asia have high stunting rates40 percent and 36 percent , respectivelyand more than 90 percent of the world 's stunted children live on these two continents . ( UNICEF 2009 , pp. 1519 ) . <p> Wasting . Children who suffer from wasting face a markedly increased chance of death . According to UNICEF , 13 percent of children under 5 years old in the developing world are wasted , and 5 percent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , p. 20 ) . <p> Underweight . UNICEF estimates that 129 million children under 5 years old in the developing world are underweight--nearly one in four . Ten percent of children in the developing world are severely underweight . The prevalence of underweight is higher in Asia than in Africa , with rates of 27 percent and 21 percent , respectively . ( UNICEF 2009 , p. 17 ) . <p> Other key facts about child hunger and mortality <p> The estimated number of childhood deaths in 2010 was 7.6 million . Since 1990 the golobal under-five mortality rate has dropped 35 percentfrom 88 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 57 in 2010 . The highest rates of child mortality are still in Sub-Saharan Africawhere 1 in 8 children dies before age 5 , more than 17 times the average for developed regions ( 1 in 43 ) and Southern Asia ( 1 in 15 ) . Under-five deaths are increasingly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia . <p> Poor nutrition plays a role in at least half of the 7.6 million child deaths each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children who are poorly nourished suffer up to 160 days of illness each year . Undernutrition magnifies the effect of every disease , including measles and malaria . The estimated proportions of deaths in which undernutrition is an underlying cause are roughly similar for diarrhea ( 61% ) , malaria ( 57% ) , pneumonia ( 52% ) , and measles ( 45% ) ( Black 2003 , Bryce et al . 2005 ) . Malnutrition can also be caused by diseases , such as the diseases that cause diarrhea , by reducing the body 's ability to convert food into usable nutrients . <p> In developing countries , almost one out of every 15 children will die before they reach the age of five ( derived from UNICEF 2008 Summary table 1 p. 117 and also from UNICME p. 6 Table 1 ) . <p> The main cause of child hunger is poverty . Extreme poverty remains an alarming problem in the worlds developing countries , despite some progress that reduced " dollarnow $1.25a day " poverty from ( an estimated ) 1900 million people in 1981 to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 ) , a reduction of 29 percent over the period . Two significant , but less important , causes are conflict , often euphemistically referred to as a ' man-made disaster ' and natural disasters such as droughts and floods . Both conflict and natural disasters as causes of hunger occur almost exclusively in poor countries . <p> Poverty causes other aspects of children 's poor health , not only their hunger , increasing the impact of both hunger and other types of poor health .. To take a key example , poor children live in urban slums or in poor agricultural communities without sewers or other sanitation facilities for removal of human and animal excrement or garbage removal . This lack of sanitation can cause sickness , and also , by contaminating the the water supply , cause further sickness . From these sources , children get diarrhea , to name just one important cause of illness .

@@75400313 @4100313/ <p> ( January 20 , 2003 ) Currently more than a million Salvadorans in the United States routinely send money , known as remittances , back to family members in El Salvador . In 1999 , remittances surpassed official development assistance , foreign direct investment , and tourism as a source of foreign exchange for El Salvador . Remittances have surged in recent years in this small Central American country making it the second highest recipient of remittances in all of Latin America and the Caribbean . <p> Increasingly , El Salvador relies on remittances to sustain its economy . Accounting for 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , remittances have bolstered the national economy , enabled consumerism to grow within Salvadoran borders , and provided a windfall to families suffering from natural disasters such as the earthquakes and the drought of 2001 . Remittances often sustain the present day Salvadoran family budget , paying for health care costs , school fees , debt payments , and daily household needs . However , the sustainability of remittances as a main source of income should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications , discussed below , that should be strongly considered as the Salvadoran government promotes remittances as a pillar of their economic strategy . <p> The high rate of migration from El Salvador to the United States is symptomatic of deeply rooted structural problems in El Salvador . During the 1980s , Salvadorans largely fled as wartime refugees . Today people leave , not as wartime refugees , but as economic refugees as both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors struggle to create new employment opportunities . Workers are increasingly displaced from traditional economic activities in the agricultural sector , and face few opportunities outside of agriculture . While some Salvadorans find low paying jobs in maquilas , or sweatshops , many see migration as their only viable option . Salvadorans migrate to find work abroad to support family members who remain in El Salvador and generally find relatively low-paying jobs in the United States and other countries in Central America . Typically , remittances sent by individuals range from $200-$300 every four to six weeks , though the amount varies widely . <p> Remittances help to boost individual household consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial relief at the household level . In El Salvador , a large portion of remittances is sent to the poorest segment of the population . Often these households , headed by women , use remittances for household necessities such as food , clothing , and health care for themselves and their children . <p> Socially , the culture of remittances has a strong impact . Increasing dependence on remittances implicitly introduces a new family structure . The new Salvadoran family typically consists of a mother or grandmother raising children whose parents live in the United States . Growing up in this family structure , it is natural for these children to migrate also , as they see this as the only option to earn a living . This trend has community level implications as well , since young adults have little incentive to contribute to their own community 's growth and well being since their ultimate goal is to leave El Salvador to find work in the United States . <p> Migration is destructive to Salvadoran family structure and often dangerous for those who migrate . Many times migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coyotes " , or middlemen , to help them across the border . This trend is a problem both for the United States and El Salvador . Migrants are extremely vulnerable during the journey to the United States , and remain vulnerable under the constant threat of deportation once inside the United States . Several recent cases that discovered chains of child smugglers , transporting children from Central America to the United States , highlight this very problem . <p> The economic impact of remittances also deserves more analysis . In the long run reliance on remittances sets up an arguably more steadfast low-level equilibrium , dependent on remittances and migration . Using remittances as a primary source of economic sustenance and growth is risky . Remittances generally have minimal impact on investment spending , savings , or other indicators of economic development since they are used primarily for daily expenditures . <p> Migrants , in the case of El Salvador , are disproportionately poor , rural men . These men have historically supported their family with the sales of modest agricultural surpluses from small commercial and subsistence farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of Salvadoran agricultural products diminishes . Salvadorans have very few employment options besides farming in the rural areas . With falling global commodity prices , rising input costs , and unstable markets , farmers are being squeezed out of agriculture . This is leading to exploding cities and massive migration out of rural areas . However , leaving the risky business of agriculture does not necessarily ensure a reliable source of family income . As the United States goes into recession , and low-paying jobs dry up quickly , so do remittances . Without remittances , many families are acutely vulnerable to food insecurity . Rural families , whose male household heads have left the farm , have lower household food production capacity , and without remittances can not afford to buy food in the market . <p> Due to the necessity of remittances for daily needs , remittances are rarely invested in economic ventures or used as productive capital . They therefore have had minimal impact on efforts to improve public services or remedy other critical problems that reinforce the cycle of poverty . Remittances overwhelmingly remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking system . The current remittance system therefore fails to contribute to the multiplier effect essential for economic growth . <p> In order to break the long run cycle of poverty through equitable and sustainable agricultural and industrial development , employment opportunities in El Salvador need to be created through microproductive investment in small businesses ; improved education and health services ; and catastrophic environmental degradation needs to be halted . Remittances so far have largely failed to support the fundamental building blocks toward sustainable economic development . This failure is in large part due to a weak institutional system that fails to provide economic incentives , investor confidence , and transparent markets , as well as the fact that remittances , rather than supplementing existing incomes , are increasingly the main source of income for many poor families . <p> Currently , the Salvadoran government 's long run economic plan is based on two main inputs , remittances and sweatshops . Both may offer short-term solutions to immediate household food insecurity ; however , neither offer options to break the endemic cycle of long-term poverty . The cycle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutional reform that would provide opportunities to collectively leverage remittances to address root causes of hunger and poverty . Additionally , international labor market reforms allowing workers to move safely and more freely between the United States and El Salvador must also be implemented . The dependence on remittances within the current policy framework arguably has an aggregately negative effect , breeding economic dependence on family members abroad , fostering cultural erosion , splitting families , as well as providing disincentives to invest in real domestic economic growth . Remittances further allow the government and international agencies to become complacent since many of the basic needs of poor families are met through the tenuous system of remittances . <p> There are examples of policies that provide incentives for families and communities to invest remittances into productive activities . Mexico , for example , is one of the leaders in this area . The Mexican government developed a matching funds program , where every dollar sent from abroad and invested in a community project or activity is matched threefold by the local , state , and federal government . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local and regional development in Mexico . El Salvador is following Mexico 's example in this area and has recently started a matching funds program , also . However , in the case of El Salvador , funds directed at community projects are in large part raised by community associations in the United States that send money back to their communities as a whole . Matching funds programs have yet to come up with a strategy to provide incentives for individuals to invest in projects or employment-generating activities . <p> Is development based on remittances a viable long-term development option ? Does several hundred dollars every six weeks from a father abroad really constitute a step in the right direction , toward sustainable and equitable development ? While it may be the only option many families have at this time , the real challenge lies in developing a vibrant , healthy , and equitable economy in El Salvador that can provide meaningful work , contribute to the improvement of public services , and ultimately maintain the Salvadoran social fabric . The reality of the situation is that the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place and growing . Therefore , the challenge lies in harnessing the enormous potential of remittances to help build a strong , equitable , and dynamic national economy . Remittances have the potential to help this internal transformation , however remittances should be looked at as a means toward developing an internal engine of growth in El Salvador , not an engine of growth in and of itself . <p> Damon is a Mickey Leland International Congressional Hunger Fellow of the Congressional Hunger Center .

Figures for 2003/04 are not yet available , but in late 2003 the government had acquired just 124 farms , totaling more than 700,000 hectares , since land reform began in 1995 . Well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pressure has mounted for more radical measures , with newspaper headlines drawing comparisons to Zimbabwes controversial fast-track program . In recent months Namibias farmworkers union threatened to invade commercial farms in what they dubbed " land-sharing and not land grabbing " . The union said the move was prompted by the eviction of farmworkers from farms across the country . <p> In a statement condemning the planned land invasions , the Lands and Resettlement Minister , Hifikepunye Pohamba , acknowledged that the " pace of acquiring land meant for resettling formerly disadvantaged landless Namibians is not moving fast " . <p> He said this was because " some farmland offered to the government was totally unsuitable for resettlement purposes . Some of these farms offered are very stony and desert-like areas . Therefore , the ministry can not buy these unproductive farms and put people on them " . <p> Pohamba noted that land was a sensitive issue in Namibia and the entire southern African region , and had to be handled " with the utmost care " . Upon launching the Land Tribunal , he said the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that it is the most important and primary means of production , because every development activity takes place on land " . <p> His ministry was about to complete a database of all beneficiaries resettled over the years , their dependents and livestock . <h> QUESTIONING LAND REFORM <p> In its " Vision 2030 " statement , the ministry said the annual average resettlement rate was 2,222 people , and it was hoping to resettle between 68,000 and 70,000 by 2030 . An amount of N $50 million ( US $6.5 million ) has been set aside over the next five years for the purchase of farms . <p> It admitted that the " acquisition of land and the subsequent process of land distribution and access , through resettlement and rehabilitation programs , have so far proved to be a hard nut to crack . Its complexity stems from various inherent factors , such as land availability in relation to the skyrocketing demand for it " . <p> Namibia is very dry , making much of the land suitable principally for pasture and leaving farmers who receive relatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The ministry is now questioning whether the current mode of land reform is the best one for the country . In an overview of its work , the ministry asked : " Does resettlement and rehabilitation ( as part of land reform ) contribute positively to the overall goals for national development , and if so , how much ? " <p> Analysts have pointed to a lack of post-resettlement support as a major stumbling block to successful implementation of land reform policyA report by Namibias Legal Assistance Center ( LAC ) , One Day We Will Be Equal A socio-legal perspective on Namibian Land Reform and Resettlement Process , said " the only reason that rampant starvation and malnutrition do not ravage the resettlement projects is because the government operates a food-for-work program in virtually every resettlement project " . <p> " Beneficiaries of resettlement projects are caught in a vicious cycle because of their poverty : they have to sell agricultural produce to obtain some cash , which in turn lands them in a food deficit situation . " <p> It added that " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not provide sufficient training on how to effectively utilize land obtained from the government , nor does it provide access to modern farm equipment " . <p> LAC researcher Willem Odendaal , who co-authored the report , told IRIN that " there 's a definite lack of capacity building programs " . There was " a lack of transferring skills , basic technical skills and basic managerial skills to the beneficiaries on these projects " . <p> " Another problem is that people are not close to markets . Also , if they are lucky to produce some produce for the markets , they do n't  have the means , the organisational or managerial skills , to organize themselves , " he explained . <p> " Its very difficult for people to have access to credit to make improvements on the piece of land they are allocated , as there 's definite insecurity in terms of the transfer of ownership of title deeds , " Odendaal said . Many beneficiaries of land reform were unable to secure loans because they had a long-term lease agreement with the state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A TITLE DEED <p> The ministry has argued that " long-term lease agreements with the incumbent beneficiaries give new impetus to the resettlement program in general , and will raise revenue to secure the long-term sustainability of the program " . <p> " Lease agreements will encourage beneficiaries to increase the productivity of their respective plots and add value to the resettlement program , " the ministry said . <p> However , the research conducted by LAC indicated that " lending institutions , inherently conservative in nature , are not likely to lend money based on collateral of uncertain legal title , although ( in theory ) a loan might be given on a properly registered 99-year lease which had some marketable value " . <p> But there " is no substitute for clear and unambiguous legal rights to land which was absolutely necessary for new settlers to compete in a modern agricultural economy " , the report added . <p> " If your property is not registered , then it has complications in the sense that you can not get a loan to improve your land , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy basic equipment , " Odendaal said . <p> " Thus , the reality of life in the resettlement projects is of settlers being dumped on a few hectares of poor land , equipped with hoes and shovels , and expected to earn a living . This is a process certain to fail a viable resettlement program requires an infrastructure to support settlers while they gain access to the kind of substantial agricultural enterprises that can support a reasonable lifestyle , " the report concluded . <p> With all this in mind , many resettled beneficiaries have opted to lease their plots , mostly to communal farmers from overgrazed areas , for as much as N $200 ( US $30 ) a month . Some , said Odendaal , had opted to abandon their plots for a chance at a better life in urban areas . <h> TIME FOR A RE-THINK <p> A newly created Permanent Technical Team ( PTT ) on Land Reform will undertake a survey of 40 percent of the 124 farms acquired by government that are earmarked for resettlement , to " establish the socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the existing policy and legal framework dealing with land reform and natural resources management . <p> The PTT hopes to develop " a comprehensive Land Reform Plan of Action " .

Therefore , resettling 100,000 or more Namibians on small-scale agricultural schemes may never be an effective way to reduce rural poverty , " the report concluded . <p> The country is currently in the grip of a food security crisis , with some 650,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food aid this year . <p> A combination of ongoing drought and flash floods has severely eroded the coping ability of rural dwellers and subsistence farmers . <p> According to Odendaal , " in Namibia there 's a history of how commercial farmers were supported with subsidies in the old apartheid days and in the dry season their subsidies just increased " . <p> " Its very difficult to farm in Namibia , and I think government has been under-estimating climate conditions in this country , " he noted .

@@75400322 @4100322/ <p> Since the 1990s , increasing attention has been drawn to child soldiering in Africa . While greater awareness is important in responding to the use of children as soldiers , popular images have too often sensationalized the issue , with counter-productive consequences . Ubiquitous media images of boys with guns as the epitome of child soldiering and girl sex slaves as ' victims ' of conflict obscure the fact that many other children and young people , both male and female , play a variety of different , and often simultaneous , roles in conflict . <p> In recognition of these multiple roles , and concerned that some of the less visible child soldiers were being ignored and hence overlooked in demobilization programs , a group of agencies working with children in conflict met in Cape Town in 1997 to establish a working definition : <p> " A child soldier is any person under 18 years of age who is part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or armed group in any capacity , including but not limited to cooks , porters , messengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members . " <p> By casting the net wide , this definition challenges the predominant narrow conceptualization of child soldiers and takes into account less visible roles , often played by girls and young women . In order to adequately ' see ' both girls and boys in fighting forces , we need to sharpen our insight into differential patterns of recruitment , experiences in conflict and demobilization in different contexts , taking into account factors such as sex , age , ethnicity , and socioeconomic status . <p> Recruitment <p> While it is often assumed that children are forcibly recruited into armed forces and groups , conscription , abduction , and gang-pressing of children are relatively rare , although highest in Africa . Despite the ambiguity of ' voluntary ' recruitment in contexts of severely constrained choices , we must seek to understand the complex rationale in young people 's decision to join out of ideological commitment , self-defense , economic survival or increased opportunities . <p> In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo , for example , ethnic dimensions of the conflict and deliberate targeting of civilians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or avenge deaths . Viewing defense as a collective responsibility for communities in conflict areas , boys and young men have historically joined local militias and defense units , such as the gardiens de la paix in Burundi . <p> In the face of widespread sexual violence and gender inequality , girls in different contexts have joined armed forces and groups seeking protection or social mobility . Finally , both male and female children and young people have seen armed forces and groups as one of the only means of employment , and hence survival , in contexts of widespread socioeconomic deprivation . <p> Roles and Experiences <p> Monolithic stereotypes of boys with guns and girls as ' simply ' ' bush wives , ' ' sex slaves ' or ' camp followers ' belie the multiple roles and experiences of young people in fighting forces . While girls have historically played support roles within armed forces and groups , acting as domestic workers , cooks and porters , many others actively engage in hostilities as combatants , suicide bombers and commanders . For example , the Liberians United for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliary corps , in which many girls have participated . <p> Children may also act as spies , undertaking fact-finding and reconnaissance missions because they are less conspicuous and therefore less likely to be regarded with suspicion . These roles are not mutually exclusive ; in many contexts , children undertake both combatant , as well as non-combatant , reproductive and productive labor . For example , Mazurana and McKay ( 2004 ) report that girls in Angola were often simultaneously fighters and ' wives . ' Although child soldiers-- both boys and girls-- are often more at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation than their adult counterparts ( Alfredson , 2001 ) , it should not be assumed that all children and young people have had these experiences . As Brett ( 2002 ) argues , to do so is to deny their individual experiences , treat them as actual or potential sexual objects and contribute to their further stigmatization and discrimination . <p> Demobilization and Reintegration <p> In many situations , the erroneous equation of ' child soldier ' with ' combatant ' has meant that children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups have been neglected in disarmament , demobilization and reintegration ( DDR ) programs . For example , in March , 2000 , the UN Security Council noted that the DDR process in Angola had inadvertently excluded some children , particularly girls , by making the surrender of weapons the criterion for eligibility in the programs . Some girls and young women face additional barriers to participation in demobilization programs , particularly if they have been sexually involved with members of armed forces or groups . These men may consider them their ' wives ' or ' property ' and block their demobilization ( McConnan and Uppard , 2001 ) . The shame of pre-marital sex in many cultures may prevent girls and young women from returning to communities , fearing social stigma and rejection ( McKay and Mazurana , 2000 ) . <p> DDR policy and programming also often fail to address the causes , including gendered dimensions , of children 's recruitment in the first place . For children and young people who have gained a sense of power and belonging within armed forces and groups , peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 ) , if they are expected to return to traditional roles in hierarchical societies segregated by age and sex ( La Fontaine , 1985 ) . <p> Demobilized young people may not stay in their former communities because they have experienced many identity and personal changes . For girls , this may result in gender role discontinuity at all levels of daily life . " Because they changed as a result of their experiences , they challenge traditional roles that they can not accept , hence the notion of ' troublesome girls ' who do not adhere to normal gender roles " ( McKay and Mazurana , 2004 ) . <p> Reintegration approaches must therefore involve entire communities , taking into account shifting social , political , economic , and gender contexts . This dynamic process entails not only young people adapting to often " disjointed , displaced , reconfigured " communities , but also communities recognizing and accepting how girls and boys have changed because of their experiences ( McKay and Mazurana , 2004 ) . <p> Toward an Alternative Approach : Engaging with Children as Actors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guns ' and ' girls as sex slaves ' requires a recognition of children and young people as actors in the context of conflict . Taking into account the multiplicity of roles and experiences of girls and boys involved in fighting forces means analyzing patterns of individual experiences against the backdrop of specific , gendered , localized contexts . In other words , we need to ensure that the general categorization of ' child soldiers ' does not essentialize particular groups of children , masking their individual differences . The challenge is to render visible all of the so-called ' invisible soldiers ' ( Brett and McCallin , 1998 ) -- male and female ; combatant and non-combatant ; in government forces and armed opposition groups-- and to seek to understand their experiences as human beings , rather than as objectified stereotypes . <p> Christina Clark volunteers for Fahamu and is currently undertaking doctoral research on the political roles of displaced young people at the Refugee Studies Centre , University of Oxford .

He undertook this fast to protest an action of Congress . He fasted from April 4 to April 26 , 1993three weeks and one day . <p> Being hungry for three weeks , in Halls words : <p> Physically and psychologically , the first week of the fast was the hardest . I was horribly hungryI could say in agony and getting weaker by the day . I thought constantly about what I would like to eatthat last meal of fried chicken , mashed potatoes , and Caesar salad ; some future meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roast beef , and key lime pie . <p> Family mealtimes were the worst . I could n't go to the table because the food would be too tempting , and not being able to eat it would be agonizing . Janet , Matt , and Jyl would try to hide from me when they snacked between meals .. I followed Dick Gregorys advice to fill up on water . I really poured it down . Since it was the only thing I was consuming , I paid a great deal more attention to it than I ever had before . I really noticed the difference in taste when drunk from the tap at home , the office , or someplace else . My sense of smell also heightened throughout the fast . I could tell what people had eaten because their bodies gave off aromas that I had never noticed before . <p> The hardest day of the fast came on Easter , which was my seventh day without eating . Janet and I had gone on a retreat in Maryland with some friends , and our friends prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pie , cake . It drove me nuts . I had to leave them , go outside and take a walk , to get away from those wonderful aromas . I decided that if I could get through this day , I would be over the hump . I did , and I was . <p> Just as Dick Gregory said , the sensation of hunger faded in about a week . Its as if the body gives up on getting food and stops demanding it . From then on , I could join my family at mealtimes and not be bothered a bit . It was a revelation about the poor and the hungry , to whom I came to feel exceptionally close as the fast went on . I now fully understood , in a way I never had before , a strange phenomenon I had witnessed during famines : starving children who refused to eat when food was finally offered to them . <p> The absence of hunger pangs did not mean I was n't feeling the physical effects of the fast , however . I 'd wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear . I would think I had lots of energy . But after noon , I would fade . The energy would desert me and weakness would take over . I 'd need to nap .

It also seemed my brain slowed down in the afternoon ; I felt " dull . " I thought of poor children who do n't  do well in school , who fall asleep in the afternoon , who become poor students because of poor nutrition . Remarkably , some of my vital signsblood pressure , the results of blood testsactually improved . <p> On April 26 , Hall ended his fast .

Multinational corporations and multilateral institutions , including the World Bank , International Monetary Fund and the G-8 , are all seen as reinforcing a logic of profit and exploitation of the land and people . Does this system work for the betterment of all as proponents of the " free market " would contend ?

@@75400330 @4100330/ <p> Brazil and the United States may have settled , for now , their long-running WTO dispute over U.S. cotton subsidies , but the issues it raised remain . After all , Brazilian producers were not the only ones hurt by U.S. dumping of its highly subsidized cotton on world markets , which not only took market share from competing producers , it depressed the international price for all producers . <p> How much does agricultural dumping cost farmers in developing countries ? I recently completed a study for a Woodrow Wilson Center project that highlights just how high the cost of dumping can be . I benefited from the somewhat controlled experiment represented by U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade under the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . I call it a controlled experiment because NAFTA liberalized agricultural trade dramatically over a short period of time , Mexico imports most basic grains and meats almost exclusively from the United States , and Mexican farmers grow many of the crops that compete with the imports . In such a case , one can easily see the increase in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is reasonable to assume that the U.S. export price is the reference price for these products in Mexico . <p> Using one of the definitions of dumping listed by the WTO ( GATT Article VI Sec. 2.2 ) , we estimated the extent to which U.S. export prices to Mexico were below U.S. farmer costs of production ( plus transportation and handling ) . We looked at the nine-year period 1997-2005 . We began in 1997 because NAFTAs agricultural provisions were mostly implemented and the 1996 U.S. Farm Bill , which had a price-depressing effect on most major crops , had taken effect . We ended the period in 2005 to avoid the confounding effects of the speculative commodity price boom , which began in late 2006 . We simply calculated the extent to which Mexican producer prices were lowered by U.S. dumping , and then estimated how much more Mexican producers would have earned if they had received non-dumping prices at least high enough to cover U.S. costs of production . <p> As the table shows , Mexico was indeed flooded with imports , they were exported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices fell dramatically , and production declined in many cases . <p> The eight products studied all saw significant growth in U.S. exports , from the 159% increase in soybean exports to the 707% increase in pork exports . All eight products showed positive dumping margins 5-10% for the meats , 17-38% for the crops . For all eight products , real producer prices in Mexico fell dramatically , with real 2005 prices 44%-67% lower than their levels in the early 1990s . Mexican production fell for all the crops except corn , and rose significantly for meats , reflecting the rising demand for meat-based protein in the Mexican diet . Import dependency increased dramatically for all products . <p> What was the cost to Mexican producers of these dumping-level prices ? We estimated the nine-year cost at $12.8 billion ( in 2000 US$ ) , $1.4 billion per year . To put these numbers in context , the annual losses are more than 10% of the value of all Mexican agricultural exports to the United States ( including beer , which Mexico , oddly , classifies as its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpass the total value of Mexicos annual tomato exports to the United States , widely touted as Mexicos biggest NAFTA success story in agriculture . <p> Not surprisingly , corn farmers suffered the highest losses . U.S. exports increased 413% , arrived at prices 19% below production costs , and real producer prices in Mexico declined 66% . We estimated losses to Mexican corn farmers of $6.6 billion over the nine-year period , over $700 million per year . These losses amount to $99/hectare per year , a crushing blow to struggling smallholders . <p> Given how sluggishly the Mexican economy has performed under NAFTA , these are also crushing losses for Mexico . An estimated 2.3 million people have left agriculture in a country desperate for livelihoods . ( See our report , " Rethinking Trade Policy for Development . " ) And food dependency has risen dramatically ( see graph ) , which cost Mexico dearly when commodity prices spiked in 2006-8 . <p> Mexico certainly serves as a warning to developing countries considering agricultural trade liberalization .

@@75400332 @4100332/ <p> ( Updated November 16 , 2003 ) The standard economic model of how things work is that people produce and exchange goods . Governments exist to provide " government goods " things that people can not provide for themselves , such as national defense . Thus the standard economic view is that activities are essentially productive . While this view has made for a thriving profession of economics , it is not a correct view of reality . The principal difficulty is that there is economic activity that is unproductive and harmful ( from the point of view of those being harmed ) , and that this is a key feature of the economic organization of societies . What follows is a brief analytical description of these societies . <p> Many societies are run on this basic set of principals . Take and maintain control of the government . Use powers of the government to obtain income . Key elements of this process are described in five sections : <p> The influence on development of poor nations is profound . The government/people in the government , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping the people of the country , but rather in helping themselves . This has had and continues to have a disastrous effect on development and the incomes of poor people . The final section of this article discusses this more fully . This article exists to provide an analytical framework to understand the situation and events in many countries , which , considered separately , may be confusing . <p> The basic idea and activity in productive societies is helping to produce goods things that are useful to someone food , light bulbs , cars and then exchanging the income received for goods that are desirable to you . This fundamental economic mechanism exists in " harmful " economic societies as well . Unfortunately , also existing , and why we describe these societies as harmful , a certain strata usually the top also exists to obtain goods through means which may be described as unproductive or extractive . <p> The principal ways in which income is obtained in a harmful economic system are twofold : 1 ) obtain it through the government , or , 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income that are ( apparently ) obtained in other ways . The first is most typical or at least most evident in developing countries . Armed conflict--typically the fight for control of the government or territory , frequently with natural resources , by groups deserves a separate discussion , because it has been throughout history the principal way in which harmful economic societies have been established and because of its importance in the world today . <p> There are a wide variety of means in which government officials and others obtain revenue from the government . The first thing to recognize is that people at the top of government , or those who have significant control over the government but who are not government officials--often entrepreneurs or corporations ) can and do plunder resources coming into the government . Government revenue is often not devoted to productive services but siphoned off by those in control of the government . A nation expects that its national resources will be used for the benefit of the nation . However very large amounts of such revenue are often used to enrich those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government can plunder resources too , by not providing services which they are paid to provide , by charging for services which they should provide , or by taking goods , such as medical supplies or automobiles/trucks , which should be used for government service . <p> Corruption . One name for the unproductive allocation of resources is corruption . Corruption basically means that government officials get extra-official payments ( frequently very large but also often very small ) for duties that they are paid for and obliged to perform as their duties as government officials . See the most recent Transparency International annual report on corruption worldwide . Reprinted here are the Corruption rankings of the countries of the world ( PDF file ) . <p> Pay for little or no work . Another concern is that government officials receive pay without delivering ( often anything near ) an adequate level of services . What they have done is support the current political system , not deliver government services . <p> Allocation of resources . The government frequently allocates resources , such as land and other natural resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself and its supporters . <p> A very large part of this allocation/corruption is diversion of revenues from goods exported from or imported to the country . The big ticket item is natural resource exports , including oil . One would think that discovering oil and being able to export it would enable governments in developing countries to provide sufficient resources for assisting poor people in that country to have education and health services and to provide productive employment . NOT ! In fact what HN has described as harmful economic systems mean that very little---a token amount-- gets to poor people . The following brief article and link to the full report describe the ( mis ) use of oil revenues in developing countries . The African Oil Boom : Peril or Opportunity for Africa 's Poor People ? Catholic Relief Services ( November 8 , 2003 ) <p> Crime and looting are examples of harmful economic activity in which poor people can participate . Crime , frequently a terrorist activity-- using terror to obtain income " your money or your life " -- happens everywhere . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only partially with crime . Many neighborhoods in the United States are subjugated to gangs that sell drugs , kill people , and maintain control of their activities through intimidation and murder . <p> Armed Conflict . Unfortunately there are many examples of armed conflict in the world today . Examined more closely this conflict is typically over control of the government or territory--often territory with natural resources . Thus this conflict is over who will establish a harmful economic system and subsequently over control over resources , including the power to tax , arrange oil leases , and so on . In conflict , in addition to the struggle for control over resources , there is typically great harm done to ordinary people , such as murder , amputation of limbs , rape , taking of family food and other resources . ( This can be so bad that an end to conflict , even if it then means establishment of an organized system of oppression , is preferable to people . ) More <p> In essence , there is part of the population that is living well because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose assets and income have been reallocated do n't  like this and thus there is the threat of revolution overturning the minority in benefit of the majority . This is prevented in a number of ways . <p> A principal way certainly a very clear way of keeping people oppressed and unable to move to a situation that might be characterized as democratic , is terrorizing the subject population , including murder and torture . Especially important is killing leaders of the subject population(s) or otherwise keeping them from being a source of unrest ( by such means as imprisonment , exile , or bribery ) . One favorite way of maintaining oppression is to stay in power for a long time , frequently by manipulating or subverting an ostensibly democratic legal framework . Election fraud/rigged elections is a principal way of staying in power . Sometimes legitimate regimes take power . The response of harmful economic regimes will be to try to maintain its sources of power , in preparation for a counter-revolution . Both Liberia and Serbia ( and Iraq ) are examples . More <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized in this section is preventing overthrow by others who would maintain a structure of harm . Put in another way , how is a structure of harm maintained ? <p> The following story describes the lack of economic mobility in Brazil through one man 's story . " A study by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics shows that Brazilians are nearly four times less likely to improve their economic standing from one generation to the next than Canadians or Swedes , a level comparable to South Africa . Americans are somewhere in between . Immobility , academics agree , is a conspiracy of bad schools and bad homes , inadequate health care , a loan or patch of land that is too often out of reach . So poor is the quality of Brazilian public elementary and high schools that , until rigid quota systems were implemented this year , nearly 90 percent of all admissions to competitive and lauded public universities were graduates of costly , superior private high schools . <p> " Quite simply , said David Lam , an economics professor at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its public institutions work very well for the poor . " <p> The impact on development of harmful economic systems has been enormous . Try to think about some of the consequences of what has been described above . They include war , continued devastation over centuries , and control of the government and productive resources , that have left hundreds of millions confronting starvation , while those who " govern " and " own " live very well . A recipe for disaster ! And we should not blame the victims--poor people across the world . Rather we should think about how we can help them . <p> War , basically caused by armed groups seeking to control the government , or territory or resources , has devastated vast regions of the world , and more importantly , vast numbers of the people of the world . <p> Where is there major armed conflict now ? These countries include the Sudan , the Congo , Israel/Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Northern Uganda , and Colombia , Nepal , Kashmir ( conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countries themselves ) . <p> Where has there been major conflict in the past which is now somewhat abated but which has still greatly affected the society and its progress ? Sri Lanka , Peru , El Salvador , Guatemala--to name a few . <p> We do not want to think about this , perhaps , as the government and people of the United States , has participated in this devastation over the past four centuries . It is hard to say what is " we , " but after acknowledging this , we , the people of the United States and the preceding colonies drove the native Americans from almost all of the United States , and settled them in very inhospitable places , benefited from slavery including the transport of slaves , production of crops such as cotton and other goods produced by slavery , We tolerated in the North , and accepted with a vengeance in the South , the return of extreme discrimination after the Civil War , which ostensibly freed the slaves . Did we benefit from all of this ? Well of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past make ? --so we are not only unable to answer the question , we are unable even to ask it in the regular operation of our society . However let us ask it here . How have African Americans ( or Native Americans ) been harmed by the past 400 years of white European control/domination of North America ? <p> Africa <p> The people of Africa--Sub-Saharan Africa-- have been injured greatly by the operation of the world economic/political system . This can be divided into three parts , slavery , " classical " imperialism , and the modern world . <p> Slavery . How many slaves were taken from Africa ? What kind of social system--in Africa and in the world--permitted them to be taken ? ( Under what circumstances would you give your daughter or son up to slavery And if the answer is never--what circumstances would make your answer irrelevant ? ) <p> Slavery and the accompanying social system imposed on Africa began in the 1600s and continued until the late 19th century and , to some real extent , even today . <p> Imperialism . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole continent by England , France , Belgium , Spain , Portugal and Germany . Why should this be allowed ! Well of course it was , due to superior arms and organization , not to mention control of the relevant international organizations which " sanctioned " such things .

@@75400335 @4100335/ <p> The dollar value of development assistance may have to double to more than $100 billion a year to achieve the internationally agreed goal of halving extreme poverty by the target date of 2015 . <p> Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) is one of the most important issues being discussed the week of March 18-22 in Monterrey , Mexico , at the International Conference on Financing for Development . <p> Levels of development assistance currently are on an overall 30-year downward trajectory . As a percentage of Gross National Income , the United States contributes the least of all developed countries , contributing only .1 ( one tenth of one percent ) of GNI while the United Kingdom , for example , contributes .32 , as the table below shows . <p> On average , ODA as a percentage of donor countries ' Gross National Product ( GNP ) was already falling when the international community first adopted in 1970 the target of contributing 0.7 percent of GNP . The ratio did stabilize at between 0.3 and 0.35 until the early 1990s , but then began to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 's Development Assistance Committee was 0.22 percent of their GNP . Even excluding the United States , which has never committed itself to the 0.7 percent target , the average was only 0.33 percent . <p> In terms of absolute dollars ( uncorrected for inflation ) , the amount of aid rose steadily until 1992 . But even in absolute terms , total aid has yet to regain its 1992 peak of over $60 billion . ODA fell from $56.4 billion in 1999 to $53.1 billion in 2000 , a decline of 6 percent in nominal terms , or of 1.6 percent taking into account inflation and changes in exchange rates UN World Economic and Social Survey 2001 . <p> The decline in ODA in the 1990s sometimes has been attributed to fiscal deficits in donor countries . However , since the mid 1990s fiscal balances of most donor countries have greatly improved . Other main factors cited as reasons for the decline of aid in the 1990s are the loss of motivation after the end of the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and projects , and bigger flows of private capital to developing countries . ( The last point is highly debatable : private capital does not undertake most of what ODA is usually asked to finance , and the countries that are most dependent on ODA are not often viewed as good prospects by private foreign investors ) . <p> For the 49 least developed countries ( LDCs ) ( all of which have per capita GDP of less than $900 ) , ODA remains crucial . In 1998 , it accounted for 84 percent of total resource flows to 48 LDCs . In the same year , the LDCs received less than 4 percent of long-term capital inflows going to all developing countries . <p> Meeting the Millennium Development Goals <p> It appears that the 30-year drop in aid will end . President Bush has promised to increase U.S. development assistance beginning in 2003 . There has been some criticism that this increase is not sufficient . The United Kingdom has made a commitment to increase its aid from 0.26 percent of GNP in 1997 to 0.33 percent in 2003-04 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers agreed to set a target date for meeting the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP . In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States , there has been a general upsurge in public discourse about the need to invest more in development . <p> However , as some donor governments have announced intentions to cut back on ODA , it is unclear how large the net increases will be . The Zedillo Commission of high-level experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 2001 called for an additional $50 billion in aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals , or roughly double the current ODA level . This will require a concerted effort of the donors . <p> According to the World Bank , the target for halving income poverty in developing countries by 2015 - adopted by Member States during the Millennium Summit in September , 2000 - is in grave danger of being missed . In some developing countries , poor policies reduce the effectiveness of development programs , and thus of aid . There is increasing reluctance to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries have stronger policies and can make good use of additional assistance . The question is whether it will be supplied in sufficient amounts . <p> " The Monterrey Conference must mark a turning point in the history of Official Development Assistance , " UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the January , 2002 session of the Financing for Development Preparatory Committee . " We simply can not allow the decline in ODA to continue , if we want our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals to be taken seriously at all . " <p> Aid Effectiveness <p> Some progress has been made in recent years in understanding the preconditions for aid effectiveness . It is judged to center on two basic principles : that it should reduce poverty , and rely on policies that recipient countries ' governments and civil societies helped to formulate and in which they feel a sense of ownership . <p> Studies show that aid can have a direct impact on poverty when it is targeted to programs such as those for children , nutrition and emergency relief . More importantly , aid can play an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducive to reform . This underscores the importance of a national commitment to the reform process . Rather than conditioning assistance on the visions and priorities of donors , it is increasingly accepted that domestic-initiated reform efforts are key . <p> Some problems hampering aid effectiveness originate in the donor countries . <p> One widely criticized practice is " tied " aid , which requires that project procurement must draw on firms in the donor country . A positive step was taken at a Paris meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) in May , 2001 , at which donor countries agreed to " untie " an additional $2 billion in aid to LDCs . <p> Confusing and sometimes contradictory aid standards present another problem . Each of the 22 OECD donor countries and a wide range of international institutions maintain their own decision-making , monitoring and evaluation systems . A blizzard of paperwork and staff are needed in recipient countries simply to meet reporting requirements . Better donor coordination is recognized to be crucial , and efforts to merge requirements and reporting formats are underway .

The population of seniors increasingly consists of workers who turned 60 after the rapid wage growth of the 1990s lifted average wages . For seniors as a group , Social Security benefits are rising now due in part to the wage growth of the 1990s , although these gains have been somewhat offset by the benefit reductions resulting from the gradual increase , starting in 2000 , in Social Securitys full retirement age . ) <p> A second reason elderly incomes have increased since 2001 is that more retirees are working .

They show that during the 2001-2007 expansion , a range of economic indicators including gross domestic product , wages and salaries , employment , consumption , total compensation , and net worth grew more slowly , on an average annual basis , than they did during the recovery of the 1990s . Growth in every one of these key indicators from 2001 to 2007 also was slower than the average level of growth in the nine previous economic expansions since World War II .

The Census data fail to capture a substantial amount of income at the top of the income scale , in part because the Census Bureau records income only up to certain specified levels .

The number of poor citizens grew by 416,000 , while the number of poor non-citizens grew by 400,000 . Census data show that the growth in poverty among non-citizens between 2006 and 2007 was due to an increase in the poverty rate among that group , not to an increase in the number non-citizens residing in the United States . <p> The growth in poverty among non-citizens in 2007 may be due in part to weakness in certain sectors of the labor market that employ a larger share of immigrants than other sectors . More data and research are needed to understand what drove the trends in poverty among non-citizens in 2007 . <p> Economy Has Soured Since 2007 <p> The Census figures released today cover 2007 . There are clear signs that the economic situation has deteriorated in 2008 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly rising now , and median income is almost certainly falling . <p> Labor Department data show marked deterioration in employment , unemployment , and weekly earnings in recent months . The unemployment rate reached 5.7 percent in July 2008 , up from 4.7 percent 12 months earlier , and the number of jobs in the economy fell by 463,000 over the first seven months of this year . The number of long- term unemployed workers workers who have not been able to find a job despite looking for 27 weeks or more rose to 1.7 million in July 2008 , up 28 percent from the year before . The average hourly earnings of production workers fell by 2.9 percentin inflation-adjusted terms during the same period , as high food and energy prices contributed to the rising cost of living . <p> Similarly , the Commerce Department reports that economic growth has slowed to a stall . The size of the economy , as measured by real gross domestic product , declined in late 2007 and , on a per-person basis , remains below the level in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep rising toward 6 percent in the second half of the year , because they do not see underlying strength in an economy that continues to fight the headwinds of high food and energy prices , ongoing housing market woes , and credit market jitters . <p> The downturn in economic indicators , if sustained throughout 2008 , bodes poorly for poverty and income . In the past , when the unemployment rate has risen and weekly earnings have declined , median annual income has always fallen and poverty has always increased . Unless the economic situation improves unexpectedly in coming months , the 2008 income and poverty figures will be worse than those for 2007 . <p> This also means that 2007 may represent the final year of the economic expansion that began in late 2001 , making it possible to compare that expansion with other periods of economic growth in the past . Such a comparison shows that the period from 2001 to 2007 was unique . In no other six-year period of economic growth on record was the poverty rate higher , and median income of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . <p> Percentage and Number of Uninsured Remain High <p> In 2007 , some 45.7 million Americans 15.3 percent of the population were uninsured . These figures represent an improvement over the figures for 2006 , but marked deterioration since 2001 , when nearly 6 million fewer Americans lacked insurance . <p> The main reason for the increase in the uninsured population over this period is that the percentage of people with employer-sponsored health insurance decreased significantly from 2001 when 63.2 percent of Americans had employer-sponsored coverage to 2007 , when 59.3 percent did . Employer-sponsored coverage rates are likely to decline further in 2008 , in part due to the economic downturn . <p> Employer-based coverage declined once again between 2006 and 2007 , from 59.7 percent to 59.3 percent . The reason that the percentage and number of uninsured people fell in 2007 is that more Americans were able to obtain government-funded health insurance . The percentage of Americans with insurance through a public program increased from 27.0 percent in 2006 to 27.8 percentage in 2007 , primarily as a result of gains in coverage through Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid to offset erosion in employer-sponsored health insurance could disappear in 2008 or 2009 . Medicaid programs face a risk of cuts in numerous states , because a growing majority of the states face budget deficits due to the economic slowdown . Since nearly every state is required to balance its budget each year , an increasing number of states may consider scaling back Medicaid benefits and eligibility in the year ahead . Congress could help states to avert or minimize such cuts by temporarily increasing the federal share of Medicaid costs , as it did in response to the last economic downturn . <p> The data for 2007 show some improvement in childrens health coverage . The percentage of children without coverage dropped from 11.7 percent in 2006 to 11.0 percent , and the number without coverage dropped by 500,000 , from 8.66 million to 8.15 million . This erased about half of the increase in the number of uninsured children that occurred between 2004 and 2006 , but still left childrens coverage well short of its level in 2004 , when the number of uninsured children stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in trends in childrens health insurance over the past decade . The number and percentage of children who are uninsured fell consistently from 1998 , when the State Childrens Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) started , to 2004 , as increasing enrollment of low-income children in SCHIP and Medicaid more than offset declines in employer-based coverage . Between 2004 and 2006 , however , progress in covering children largely ceased as SCHIP and Medicaid enrollment slowed while employer-based coverage continued to erode . <p> States were again able to make some progress in enrolling more children in SCHIP and Medicaid in 2007 . However , last year Congress failed to override a presidential veto of SCHIP legislation that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would have led by 2012 to coverage for nearly 4 million children who otherwise will be uninsured ; this means many states likely will be unable to sustain or build upon this progress in 2008 . Congress may reconsider this legislation in September . <p> 1 The poverty data date back to 1959 , while the data on incomes of typical working-age households date back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 2006 and 2007 .

Some have argued that wages and salaries have grown slowly in the recent recovery only because the cost of other forms of employee compensation , such as employer-provided health care benefits , has grown rapidly . The Commerce Department data show , however , that while total employee compensation has grown somewhat more rapidly than wages and salaries , total compensation itself has grown more slowly than in the average recovery since World War II . <p> 4 An examination of data for 2006 illustrates how much of the change in inequality is missed in the annual Census income data .

Yet highly regarded research conducted by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez , using IRS tax-return data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , shows that income inequality grew markedly in 2006 .

Barriers to entry into the harmful sector include : <p> being of a different tribe , nationality or religion <p> racism or other strong prejudice against a given group . <p> 2 .

@@75400347 @4100347/ <p> ( August 23 , 2004 ) This year marks the 60th anniversary of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . Through their propaganda machines , both institutions will attempt to highlight their " assistance " to Africa . But in reality , since the 1970s , these institutions have gradually become the chief architects of policies , known as " the Washington Consensus , " which are responsible for the worst inequalities and the explosion of poverty in the world , especially in Africa . <p> Yet , when they began to intervene on that continent in the late 1970s and early 1980s , their stated goal was to " accelerate development , " according to a World Bank document , familiarly known as the " Berg Report , " published in 1981 . But as the following editorial will show , the actual record is just disastrous . <p> The main pretext for their intervention was to " help solve " the debt crisis that hit African countries in the late 1970s , following the combination of internal and external shocks , notably sharp fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they proposed , known as stabilization and structural adjustment programs ( SAPs ) , achieved the opposite , and contributed to worsening the external debt and exacerbating the overall economic and social crisis . <p> In 1980 , at the onset of their intervention , the ratios of debt to gross domestic product ( GDP ) and exports of goods and services were 23.4 percent and 65.2 percent , respectively . Ten years later , in 1990 , they had deteriorated to 63 percent and 210 percent , respectively . In 2000 , the debt to GDP ratio stood at 71 percent while the ratio of debt to exports of goods and services had " improved " somewhat , at 80.2 percent , according to the World Bank 's Global Development Finance . <p> The deterioration in debt ratios is reflected in the inability of many African countries to service their external debt . As a result , accumulated arrears on principals and interest have become a growing share of outstanding debt . In 1999 , those arrears accounted for 30 percent of the continent 's debt , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries . To compound the crisis , African countries are getting very little , in terms of new loans , except to pay back old debts . As a result , since 1988 , the part of accumulated arrears in " new " debt is estimated at more than 65 percent . <p> Between 1980 and 2000 , Sub-Saharan African countries ( SSA ) had paid more than $240 billion as debt service , that is , about four times the amount of their debt in 1980 . Yet , despite this financial hemorrhage , SSA still owes almost four times what it was owed more than 20 years ago ! One of the most striking illustrations of this apparent paradox is the case of the Nigerian debt . In 1978 , the country had borrowed $5 billion . By 2000 , it had reimbursed $16 billion , but still owed $31 billion , according to President Obasanjo . <p> The Nigerian case is a good example of the structural nature of Africa 's debt crisis and of the power imbalance that characterizes world economic and financial relationships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank to increase their influence in African countries . One good illustration of this has been the rapid rise in the share of the World Bank and its affiliate , the International Development Association ( IDA ) , in SSA 's debt . The combined share of both , which was barely 5.1 percent of SSA 's total debt in 1980 , had jumped to 25.0 percent in 1990 and to more than 37 percent in 2000 , according to the World Bank . In other words , the World Bank group has become the principal " creditor " of many Sub-Saharan countries , which explains the enormous sway it holds over these countries ' policies . <p> One way they exercise this influence is through the imposition of stiff conditionalities on African countries in exchange for loans and credits . Financial liberalization , aimed at attracting more foreign investments to compensate for shortfalls in export revenues , instead fostered more instability , due to the volatility of exchange rates resulting from speculative short-term capital flows . This , combined with higher interest rates , " crowded " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a percentage of gross domestic production ( GDP ) fell from an annual average of 23 percent between 1975 and 1979 to an average of 18 percent between 1980 and 1984 , and 16 percent between 1985 and 1989 . They recovered somewhat in the 1990s , but averaged only 18.2 percent between 1990 and 1997 , according to UNCTAD . These statistics are consistent with those given by the World Bank , which show that the annual investment ratio averaged 18.6 percent and 17.2 percent in 1981-1990 and 1991-2000 , respectively . <p> These low investment ratios resulted in a contraction of output . Real GDP growth , which averaged 3.5 percent in the 1970s , fell to 1.7 percent , between 1981 and 1990 , according to the World Bank . However , this masks the sharp declines recorded in the 1980s , dubbed " the lost decade " for Africa . This is better illustrated by the negative growth rates of both GDP and consumption per capita . They fell respectively by 1.2 percent and 0.9 percent a year between 1981 and 1990 . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita income for the continent as a whole was equivalent to more than 21 percent of real GDP . <p> In a report released in September 2001 , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) indicated that the average income per capita in SSA was 10 percent lower in 2000 than its 1980 level . In monetary terms , average income per capita fell from $522 in 1981 to $323 in 1997 , a loss of nearly $200 . The same report said that rural areas experienced an even greater decline in income . These statistics were confirmed by the World Bank , which says that income per capita in Sub Saharan Africa contracted by a cumulative 13 percent between 1981 and 2001 . <p> The 2004 edition of the World Development Indicators says that SSA is the only region in the world where poverty has continued to rise since the early 1980s , that is , at the onset of IFIs ' intervention . According to that document , in 1981 , an estimated 160 million people lived on less than $1 a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost double its 1981 level . This means that approximately 50 percent of Africa 's population lives in poverty . When the threshold is $2 a day , the numbers rise from 288 million to 518 million , during the same period . <p> The Costs of Trade Liberalization <p> According to the IMF and World Bank , one of the sources of Africa 's crisis is its inward-looking trade system , characterized by the protection of domestic markets , subsidies , overvalued exchange rates and other " market distortions " that made African exports less " competitive " in world markets . In place of this system , they propose an open and liberal trading system in which tariff and non-tariff barriers are kept to a minimum or even eliminated . Such a system , combined with an export-led growth strategy , would put Africa on a solid path to economic recovery , according to both institutions . <p> The costs associated with trade liberalization have largely offset any potential " benefits " African countries were supposed to derive from that liberalization . First of all , trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries depend on import taxation as their main source of fiscal revenues . Therefore , the elimination of , or reduction in , import tariffs has led to lower government revenues . <p> But one of the most negative impacts of trade liberalization has been the collapse of many domestic industries , unable to sustain competition from powerful and subsidized competitors from industrialized countries . In fact , Africa 's industrial sector has been among the biggest victims of structural adjustment . <p> From Senegal to Zambia , from Mali to Tanzania , from Cote d'Ivoire to Uganda , entire sectors of the domestic industry have been wiped out , with devastating consequences . Not only has the industrial sector contribution to domestic product continued to fall , but also the industrial workforce has continued to shrink dramatically . In Senegal , more than one-third of industrial workers lost their jobs in the 1980s . The trend was accentuated in the 1990s , following sweeping trade liberalization policies and privatization imposed by the IMF and the World Bank , especially after the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA Franc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 78,700 in 1987 to 28,000 in 1993 . In Zambia , in the textile sector alone , more than 75 percent of workers lost their jobs in less than a decade , as a result of the complete dismantling of that sector by the Chiluba presidency . In other countries , such as Cote d'Ivoire , Burkina Faso , Mali , Togo , Zambia , Tanzania , etc. similar trends can be observed . <p> In several annual and special reports , the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) has documented the devastating impact of SAPs on employment and wages . The African Union seems to have come to grips with that devastation . It organized a special Summit on Employment and Poverty , in the capital of Burkina Faso , September 9 and 10 , 2004 . It was revealed during that Summit that only 25 percent of the African workforce is employed in the formal sector . The rest , 75 percent , is either in the subsistence agriculture or in the informal sector . In light of this reality , the Summit issued a Plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But such a Plan will only be credible if African countries are ready to move away from IMF and World Bank recipes , which were harshly criticized during the Summit . <p> UNCTAD has reported that more than 70 percent of Africa 's exports are still composed of primary products , more than 62 percent of which are non- processed products . This helps justify the need for more liberalization and deregulation to make African exports more " competitive . " The second objective is to help justify the need for more liberalization and deregulation to make African economies more " competitive " and " attractive " to foreign direct investments . This also explains the push for more privatization . <p> In the name of " comparative advantage , " the export-led growth strategy forces African countries to compete fiercely for market shares , leading them to flood the same markets with more of their commodities . As a result , trade liberalization has accentuated the volatility of African commodities , whose prices experienced twice the volatility of East Asian commodity prices and nearly four times the volatility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s . This has contributed to worsening Africa 's terms of trade . <p> According to UNCTAD , if Africa 's terms of trade had remained at their 1980 level : <p> - Africa 's share in world trade would have been twice its current level , <p> - the investment ratio would have been raised by 6 percent per annum in non-oil exporting countries , <p> - it would have added to annual growth of 1.4 percent per annum , and <p> - it would have raised GDP per capita by at least 50 percent to $478 in 1997 compared with the actual figure of $323 during that year . <p> The Costs of Financial Liberalization <p> One of the main objectives of financial liberalization is to make African countries " attractive " to foreign direct investments . But as the experience of development shows , foreign direct investments follow development , not the other way around . In addition , despite all " the right financial policies , " foreign investments continue to elude Africa , with less than 2 percent of flows to developing countries , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . And these flows are concentrated in a few oil-producing and mineral-rich countries , according to UNCTAD and the World Bank . <p> In reality , financial liberalization has yielded little gains . For most African countries , it has been associated with huge costs . First , it entails higher levels of foreign exchange reserves to protect domestic currencies against attacks resulting from speculative short-term capital outflows . Second , financial liberalization has increased the likelihood of capital flight , in part as a result of a greater volatility of domestic currencies . The high costs of trade and financial liberalization further weakened African economies and opened the way to the privatization of the continent . <p> The Privatization of Africa <p> Privatization , like financial liberalization , is seen by the IMF and World Bank as an instrument to promote private sector development , which has been elevated to the status of " engine of growth . " The privatization of State-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , including water and power utilities , has been one of the core conditionalities imposed by the two institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most of the foreign direct investments registered by African countries in the 1990s came as a response to privatization of SOEs . No sector was spared , even those considered as " strategic " in the 1980s , such as telecommunications , energy , water and the extractive industries . In 1994 , the World Bank published a report assessing the process of privatization in SSA . After complaining about the slow pace of privatization throughout the region , it issued a warning to African governments to accelerate the dismantling of their public sector , accused of being " at the heart of Africa 's economic crisis . " The process of privatization peaked in the late 1990s and ever since has leveled off , despite more deregulation , liberalization and all kinds of incentives offered to would be investors . <p> To date , it is estimated that more than 40,000 SOEs have been sold off in Africa . However , the " gains " from privatization , projected by the World Bank and the IMF , have been elusive . In fact , many privatization schemes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost everywhere , privatization has been associated with massive job losses and higher prices of goods and services that put them out of reach of most citizens . <p> Building a Neoliberal State <p> The concept of " good governance " was promoted by the IMF and World Bank to explain the failure of SAPs . It tends to convey the idea that SAPs have failed , in large part , because African States are " corrupt , " " wasteful , " and " rent-seeking , " and because of the " poor implementation " of policies . In other words , SAPs were basically " sound . " It is the combination of " rampant corruption " and lack of qualified personnel that led to the failure of these policies . Thus , " good governance " means nothing else than the need to build a neoliberal State , subservient to the IFIs , able to effectively implement " sound policies " and to protect the interests of foreign investors . <p> Indeed , one of the main goals of the IMF and World Bank has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why one of the main targets of these institutions has been the role of the African State in economic and social development . To discredit that role , a two-track strategy was adopted . The first track was to attack the credibility of the African State as an agent of development . To achieve that goal , an abundant literature has been published by the two institutions , highlighting the " corrupt , " " predatory , " " wasteful , " and " rent-seeking " nature of the African State . To justify these epithets , the IFIs pointed to the " mismanagement " of the public sector , accused of being an obstacle to economic growth and development . These attacks helped make the case for the sweeping restructure of the public sector , which , in many cases , led to its dismantling in favor of the private sector . <p> The second track in weakening the role of the State in development was to deprive it of financial resources . Trade and financial liberalization achieved , in part , that goal . As already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of fiscal revenues , following lower tariff barriers , but it also led to huge trade losses . This was compounded by financial liberalization which entailed further fiscal losses resulting from tax holidays and low income tax rates . To make up for these losses , the African State had to resort to more and more multilateral and bilateral loans and credits , which further alienated its sovereignty . <p> As a result , many African States have been stripped of all but a handful of their economic and social functions . Cuts in spending mostly fell on social sectors . State retrenchment primarily aimed at eliminating subsidies for the poor , removing social protection , and abandoning its role in fighting for social justice through income redistribution and other social transfers to the most disadvantaged segments of society . This explains , among other things , the degradation of many basic social services and the explosion of poverty in Africa , since 1981 , as the World Bank itself has acknowledged . <p> While dismantling or weakening the economic and social roles of the State , the IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions most useful to the implementation of neoliberal policies and the promotion of private sector development . This explains the insistence on " capacity building " or on " institution building , " heard over the last few years . However , the institutions that the IMF and World Bank talk about are not for development , but for markets . In other words , they propose building institutions supportive of neoliberal policies and in the service of the private sector , especially foreign investors . <p> Thus , the " institution building " agenda promoted by the IMF and the World Bank has nothing to do with promoting democracy and protecting human rights . In fact , the neoliberal conception of governance undermines both since it deprives representative institutions of their role in formulating public policies following open and democratic debates . They are reduced to implementing what the IMF and World Bank and their G- 8 masters decide for African countries and their people . <p> From Structural Adjustment to Poverty " Reduction " <p> After producing poverty and deprivation on a massive scale in Africa and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1999 could not be more suspect . But to make this shift a bit more credible , the IMF 's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) was renamed " Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility " ( PRGF ) and the World Bank has set up a " Poverty Reduction Support Credit " ( PRSC ) . <p> There is no doubt that the shift in the rhetoric of the IFIs amounts to an admission of failure of past policies , which put too much emphasis on correcting macroeconomic imbalances and " market distortions " at the expense of economic growth and social progress . The disastrous record of SAPs and the continued deterioration in the economic and social situation of countries subjected to IMF and World Bank programs put into question the credibility and even the legitimacy of these institutions . Their crisis of legitimacy was exacerbated by stepped up attacks by the Global Justice Movement and growing criticism from mainstream economists , especially from Joseph E. Stiglitz , former World Bank Chief Economist . <p> The Nature of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide more freedom to developing countries in formulating their policies . This is what the Bank and the Fund call " national ownership . " Representatives from the government , the private sector , civil society organizations-- and even the poor-- are supposed to " participate " in drafting the PRSP of each country to decide on how to use the proceeds released by " debt relief " to achieve " poverty reduction . " <p> In reality , the macroeconomic framework that underpins the PRSPs is the same as that which underpinned the now discredited SAPs . That framework is non-negotiable and includes fiscal austerity , trade and financial liberalization , privatization , deregulation and State retrenchment , etc . In essence , despite the disastrous outcome of their past policies , the IMF and the World Bank still believe that those policies are in the " interests of the poor . " In particular , they think that trade liberalization and openness are the best-- if not the only-- road to growth , which they see as a " prerequisite " for poverty reduction . Hence the export-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a big failure in African and in other developing countries . <p> A survey of 27 African PRSPs by UNCTAD in 2002 has demonstrated that all of them , without exception , contain the policies outlined above . Policies which are at odds with both the wishes and the interests of the poor , observes the document . It is this straight jacket that ties up developing countries ' hands and prevents them from achieving any substantial gain in poverty " reduction . " Most of the time , countries have failed to implement these conditions , leading to the suspension of their programs . <p> In fact , the IFIs ' conception of poverty views it as an isolated aspect of overall economic and social development that should be dealt with by short-term measures . Hence , the emphasis in the PRSPs on more spending for primary education and health , among others . Thus , PRSPs contain some short-term measures aimed at mitigating the negative impact of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms on the most vulnerable groups , notably the poor . However , the tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this goal are the same as those already tested in the past and that have aggravated poverty and deprivation in much of Africa . <p> In reality , PRSPs are SAPs with more conditionalities and less resources . As already indicated , a new " generation " of conditionalities has been added to old conditionalities , with the concept of " good governance , " analyzed above . UNCTAD ( 2002 ) has revealed that between 1999 and 2000 , 13 African countries had signed programs containing an average of 114 conditionalities , 75 percent of which are governance-related conditionalities . One can imagine the enormous human and financial resources needed to deal with such a number of conditionalities . For this reason , the degree of compliance with IMF and World Bank-sponsored programs has significantly declined since the mid-1990s . For instance , the rate of compliance was estimated at about 28 percent of the 41 agreements signed between 1993 and 1997 , according to UNCTAD . <p> With the PRSPs , the IMF and the World Bank pursue three objectives . First , mislead world public opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really serious about " reducing poverty .

Many governments and senior civil servants have bought into the agenda promoted by the IMF and World Bank . Therefore , they bear a great responsibility in the current state of the continent .

" A woman on her own is deemed to be odd , or promiscuous . " <p> Kenyan girls/women and HIV <p> At the end of 2,000 , the Kenyan Ministry of Health estimated that there were 2.2 million people living with HIV infection or AIDS .

Girls start sexual activity earlier than boys , have large numbers of sexual partners , a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases , and are victim to a high incidence of violent sexual contact . On top of this - and much more difficult to combat - are the age-old practices such as wife-inheritance , coupled with beliefs about female roles in society , which make women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akinyi , a social worker working with Slums Information Development &amp; Resource Centers in the capital , Nairobi , told IRIN that most girls she worked with started sexual activity at around 10 , while pregnancy at 13 to 14 was " very common " .

Parents who did not marry off their daughters were often aware that they were having sex with older men , but poverty made them turn a blind eye .

Oral sex could cost half that sum , she added . <p> Poverty and lack of education are among the greatest contributing factors to girls ' early sexual activity . " The environment promotes a lot of sexual behavior . Children grow up knowing it 's something you can do for money , " said Marita . Many children from poor households grow up in cramped , run-down housing , seeing their mothers selling their bodies , so it becomes a natural progression . <p> " And once they the girls start , they do n't stop , " she said .

A nationwide study of Kenyan women aged between 12 and 24 found that one quarter had lost their virginity because they had been " forced " , the ministry reported . Many Kenyan women say this figure is grossly underestimated ; the incidence of rape , normally perpetrated by relatives , neighbors or family friends , is much more widespread , they say . And where force is used , abrasions and cuts are more likely , thus making it easier for the virus to enter the bloodstream . <p> The politics of marriage <p> Many Kenyans admit that unfaithfulness within marriage , among both sexes , is extremely common .

" You 're his wife , you 're supposed to give in to him , " Marita told IRIN . " You are his property , his belonging . You have no rights over yourself - your body is his . It does n't matter whether you are participating or not . " <p> In cases where wives suspect that their husbands are unfaithful , or that they may be HIV-positive , there is little they can do to stop being infected themselves .

@@75400352 @4100352/ <h> The Food Emergency in Ethiopia : What the Drought Conceals <p> Fabrice Weissman <p> 22 April 2003 ( HPN ) - According to the Ethiopian Prime Minister and the United Nations ( UN ) food agencies , around 11 million people in Ethiopia will face serious food shortages in 2003 as a result of drought . Unless the international community provides one and one-half million tons of food aid , Ethiopia will allegedly be the scene of mass starvation . <p> This appeal , relayed by the majority of humanitarian organizations , comes barely three years after Ethiopia declared that it was on the brink of a famine rivalling that of 198485 . While at war with Eritrea and engaged in a crucial election period , Addis Ababa claimed in 2000 that a serious drought threatened the lives of 10.5 million people . <p> As a result of an intense advocacy campaign involving the Western media , the UN , nearly all NGOs , and even Sir Bob Geldof , donors gave the government one of the highest volumes of assistance in its history : 1.2 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopian Somalis died of hunger in the Ogaden region because they did not receive sufficient relief . <p> The rapid succession of these appeals and the mixed results of previous aid operations raises the question of whether it is Ethiopias climate that condemns the country to regular famines , or whether the priorities and policies of the government are partly to blame . <p> A real risk of famine <p> There is a real risk of famine in Ethiopia . Commercial food imports are limited by economic constraints and the country has to rely on its own agricultural production to feed its people . <p> Yet the farming sector has difficulty keeping up with demographic growth . The Ethiopian population doubled between 1969 and 1999 , but the five-year average of cereal and pulses production rose by only 50 percent . After a significant drop in the 1980s , per capita production has now recovered to levels comparable to the 1960s . However , there are periodic downturns ( as in 200203 ) , and output just meets national demand : assuming that all the food available in Ethiopia were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread scarcity , even in good years . <p> In reality , however , the entire population does not pay the price of the national food deficit ; rather , it is the politically- and **25;509;TOOLONG communities that face a growing inability to cover their food needs even when they receive good rains . <p> These include sedentary farmers in the highlands who live in densely-populated areas where there are few job opportunities . Their small agricultural plots ( less than 0.5 hectare ) are situated on rocky soil prone to erosion and in zones particularly vulnerable to climatic hazards . <p> For some years , small farmers in Tigray ( East and Center ) , Wollo , Wag Hamra and Hararghe have experienced regular food shortages , obliging them progressively to deplete their meager capital . Caught in a spiral of pauperization , they are becoming structurally dependent on outside food aid . A well documented study by SCF-UK in Wollo , for instance , shows that the proportion of households with no animal holdings doubled between 1996 and 2000 ( rising from 15 to 20 percent to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arid and semi-arid plains surrounding the Abyssinian plateaus are also exposed to a high risk of famine . For the last few years , the nomadic economy has been experiencing a deepening crisis caused , among other things , by the encroachment of farmland on grazing areas ; obstructions to pastoral migration ; the increasing scarcity of fodder ; and the disappearance of caravan trading . <p> The experience of the Afars , one of the main victims of the 2003 food shortages , is a good example . The development of cotton growing on state farms in the Awash valley has considerably reduced traditional grazing areas and encroached on fallback pasture formerly used during droughts . At times of low rainfall , the irrigation of cotton fields deprives sedentarized agro-pastoral communities downstream of the water they need for the crops . <p> In addition , there is evidence of wastage : diverting the river transforms pastures into unproductive marshes that livestock are unable to graze . Moreover , the Afars face competition from other pastoralists Somalis in this case facing a similar economic crisis , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water points , and commercial and smuggling routes . <p> In such fragile conditions , it only takes small disturbances , such as low rainfall or the reduction of animal export opportunities ( as is currently the case due to the closure of the Eritrean border and the lack of demand for Ethiopian beef following a recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease ) to trigger food shortages which can lead to famine if nothing is done to prevent it . <p> Localized famines are not new to Ethiopia : they have punctuated the countrys history since the Axumite empire of antiquity . In the second half of the 20th century alone , there have been two major crises : the 197374 famine , which killed between 50,000 and 200,000 people and precipitated the overthrow of Haile Selassies imperial regime ; and the 198485 famine , which caused a million deaths . The latter was skilfully manipulated by the Mengistu regime in support of a policy of forced population displacement and asphyxiation of the Eritrean and Tigrayan guerrilla movements . <p> The various actors on the Ethiopian political scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . Hunger has often accompanied when it has not precipitated radical transformation in Abyssinian society . <p> The failure of agricultural development <p> Various tensions within Ethiopian politics oblige the government to handle the shortage carefully . Food issues are high on the official agenda of the current regime , with no less than 12 national programs wholly or partially devoted to them . <p> The food security strategy and program ( 1996 and 1998 ) aims at the elimination of food security problems within seven years ( 19982004 ) . Despite the enthusiastic declaration of the Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister in 1998 that hunger in Ethiopia has been eliminated , results have been mediocre . <p> Ethiopian farming suffers from serious structural problems . The consequences of the famines of 197475 and 198485 have repercussions to this day : studies have shown that the inhabitants of regions hard hit by the 198485 crisis had only achieved 60 percent restocking of their herds by the beginning of the 1990s . <p> Furthermore , in the mid-1990s , two-thirds of Ethiopian households had farms of less than one hectare whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor performance is partly due to deforestation and soil erosion , rudimentary farming techniques , and dependence on erratic rainfall ( barely 3 percent of farmland is irrigated ) . Moreover , public ownership of land discourages farmers from investing in improving their fields and prevents land consolidation . <p> The main initiative taken by the authorities to achieve food security has been to extend the economic liberalization introduced by Mengistu toward the end of his reign in 1988 , and to launch an extension program ( PADETES ) designed to increase crop yields . <p> The package includes the sale of improved seeds , pesticides and chemical fertilizers , education in new farming techniques and preferential access to credit . Loan-repayment conditions , however , are draconian . Farmers who can not repay their debts due to a poor harvest have their belongings confiscated or are sent to prison ( this has triggered several revolts in the southern regions ) . Under such conditions , only the richer farmers in traditional surplus-producing areas participate in the program . <p> Furthermore , the government refuses to consider changing the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling their plots and migrating en masse to urban centers . Travel permits from the Mengistu regime have been replaced by the threat of permanent expulsion if farmers abandon their land , even temporarily . <p> Finally , the regime has had no more success than its predecessors in pastoral development . In a bid to encourage the sedentarization of nomads , it is encouraging the development of irrigated cash-cropping on the semi-arid plains , further reducing grazing areas . Very little is being done to stop the collapse of the pastoral economy . The few projects devoted to this have been designed around a technical approach to soil conservation , ignoring the complexity of the relationship to the land in nomadic cultures . All the projects have encountered steadfast hostility from the populations concerned . <p> Although the food situation in Ethiopia has improved substantially since the fall of Mengistu , this improvement is fragile , and does not benefit all segments of the population . Not surprisingly , it is the nomadic groups and marginalized farmers who form the majority of the beneficiaries registered as natural-disaster victims on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DPPC ) , the government ministry in charge of relief . <p> The relief system <p> The DPPC plays a key role in assessing food crises and implementing relief operations . With few exceptions , donors , NGOs and UN agencies have to accept its estimates , follow its beneficiary lists , and at no time intervene in distributions except to monitor operations . As Ethiopian legislation states , needless to say , NGOs should adhere to the policy of the Government , and need not interfere with or override the operations which it organizes . <p> According to USAID and the public statements of NGOs working in Ethiopia , the national distribution system is effective and transparent . This was not , however , the conclusion of a 1998 survey of more than 4,000 households cited in T. S. Jayne et al. , Targeting of Food Aid in Ethiopia : Chronic Need or Inertia ? ( East Lansing , MI : Michigan State University , 2000 ) which sought to identify the profile of groups that actually received food aid from the DPPC in 199596 . The survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that households suffering from a shortage of food received less food aid than households with a surplus . Families with an intake of more than 2,800 kcal per person per day received as much as those whose intake was less than 1,000 kcal per person per day , and those receiving the least assistance were found in the critical bracket of 1,000 to 1,679 kcal per person per day . Average aid per capita allocated in Tigray ( where the regimes leaders originate ) was eight times higher than the national average . Finally , the researchers observed that households are more likely to receive food aid in the current year if they received food aid in past years , regardless of their actual vulnerability at the time of distribution . <p> In regions where aid operations are well established after several years of investment in monitoring and targeting procedures usually financed by NGOs the bureaucratic infrastructure has become blind to real developments in food security . Beneficiaries have developed skills enabling them to take advantage of these institutional arrangements . A small farmer in Wollo , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to claim that his harvest has failed and convince the authorities of his eligibility for food aid , which will bring him two or three quintals more than a risky harvest . <p> Rather than a dependency syndrome , he and other beneficiaries have developed genuine skills allowing them to diversify their methods of obtaining food . Strategies such as these flourish mainly in areas such as Wollo , where farming no longer provides enough to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged . <p> Targeting errors also reflect political choices . Disparities between regions are the direct result of the central governments control over the allocation of relief . Priority is given to politically useful areas and regions that have powerful contacts in Addis Ababa able to tip the balance in their favor . In other words , decisions about food allocation reflect the balance of power between the various components of the ruling coalition as much as the actual or supposed status of food security across the country . <p> At the lowest tier of the distribution system , local government officials are responsible for identifying beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use relief to support patronage or policing . Hence , during the famine in the Ogaden in 2000 , some communities spared by the food crisis received relief while others , although disaster-stricken , were excluded because they did not belong to the dominant clans in the areas in which they sought help . <p> Clearly , the national production deficit recorded in 2003 will , together with the drought , make things worse for hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians who already face chronic food shortages . While it is not up to humanitarian agencies to solve the food problems of Ethiopia , humanitarian NGOs do have a responsibility not to hide the social and political origins of the crisis afflicting marginalized populations , and to ensure that relief actually gets to those who need it . It is crucial that they preserve their operational independence from the DPPC in order to reach those who might otherwise be excluded from vital assistance . <p> Fabrice Weissman is Research Director at the Fondation MTdecins sans FrontiFres .

This was compounded by a steep decline in the flow of external assistance to their agricultural sector .

Millions of Ethiopians are facing their old enemy again for the third time in nearly forty years . The black horseman of famine is stalking that ancient land .

The regime boldly predicted a 710 per cent increase in the annual harvest over 2007 . Simon Mechale , head of the country 's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency , proudly declared , ' Ethiopia will soon fully ensure its food security . ' For several years , the regime has been touting that its Productive Safety Net Program would result in ending the ' cycle of dependence on food aid ' by bridging production deficits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages were officially ostracized from Ethiopia . <p> But the famine juggernaut could not be stopped . Recently , Mitiku Kassa , Ethiopia 's state minister for agriculture and rural development , was panhandling international donors to give US$121 million in food aid to feed some 5 million people . The United Nations World Food Program says a much larger emergency fund of US$285 million in international food aid is needed to avert mass starvation just in the next six months . <p> Zenawi 's regime has been downplaying and double-talking the famine situation . It is too embarrassed to admit the astronomical number of people facing starvation in a country which , by the regime 's own accounts , is bursting at the seams from runaway economic development . USAID 's Famine Early Warning Systems Network in its September 2009 Situation Report indicated that there are ' an additional 7.5 million ' individuals to those reported by the Ethiopian government who are ' chronically food insecure ' .

Emperor Haile Selassie said he was unaware of the magnitude of the famine . He lost his throne and life in the ensuing military coup . In 198485 , the Soviet-supported socialist military junta known as the ' Derg ' denied the existence of a famine which consumed over 1 million Ethiopians . Today , the regime of Meles Zenawi shamelessly presides over a third apocalyptic famine in 40 years while boasting to the world an ' 11 per cent economic growth over the past six years ' . <p> Every Ethiopian government over the past four decades has blamed famine on ' acts of God ' .

Ethiopia 's famine today is a famine of food scarcity as much as it is a famine of democracy and good governance . Ethiopians are starved for human rights , thirst for the rule of law , ache for accountability of those in power and yearn to breathe free from the chokehold of dictatorship . They are dying at the hands of corrupt , foreign-aid profiteering and ethnically-polarizing dictators who cling to the Ethiopian body politic like blood-sucking ticks on a milk cow . <p> Sen 's democratic network of ' famine early warning systems ' does not exist in Ethiopia .

The organisation says it still needs US$90 million in assistance to cover the organisation 's 2003 emergency operation . <p> WFP 's executive director James Morris is blunt : " We have not had enough support to give out a complete cereal ration in Ethiopia and we and our partners have been forced to reduce it from 15 kilos a month to 12.5 kilos . Currently we have commitments of about half of what we need for the new emergency operation . A threat of a pipeline break in September remains ...

In the Somali region , in particular , some 90,000 people have been affected with household food stocks destroyed or washed away . <p> But in most of the affected parts of the country , farmers are facing a lack of both food and water - a legacy of 2002 . Some farmers saw a total failure of their harvests last year . And drought does not only affect food production ; it has a devastating impact on whole communities . Families say they can not send their children to school , because they are hungry and can not cope with the trek to school , let alone studying . <p> Wagdi Othman , is the WFP spokesman in Ethiopia based in the capital , Addis Ababa . He talked to Ofeibea Quist-Arcton about the impact of successive droughts on the country 's people . <p> Would you please assess the current humanitarian situation in Ethiopia . In 2002 , we were told that Ethiopia was facing possible famine . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We are still in the middle of a crisis . We have about 11 million people relying on food aid in Ethiopia . The drought has affected food production in almost the entire country . And if you look at a map of Ethiopia , from north to south , it is the eastern part of the country that has been severely affected by erratic and sometimes insufficient rains throughout last year . <p> Farmers in Ethiopia are now facing the lack of food and the lack of water that has been the legacy of the year 2002 . <p> Which are the worst-affected provinces ? <p> Oromiya Region is one of the hardest-hit regions in this country . It is the southern and central part of Ethiopia , a mainly farming region where most people are farmers and they produce most of the food for the country . They have been affected in the eastern part of Oromiya where some of the farmers saw a total failure of the harvest in 2002 . <p> They had then to sell off all their assets , they had to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They even had to sell personal belongings . I even met one woman who told me that she sold the only bed she had . We saw at the end of 2002 a very dramatic situation where children and the elderly were really seriously affected by the lack of food . <p> And apart from Oromiya Province ? <p> Apart from Oromiya , the second seriously hit part of the country is Tigre in the north . Then there 's also part of Amhara and north and southern Wollo . These are normally the drought-prone regions of Ethiopia . They are densely populated areas of the country . They are highlands and people really rely on what they produce to be able to feed their families . <p> Unfortunately , in much of the country , that did not happen last year . Production was down about 25 percent overall in Ethiopia . That is a serious reduction in food production I this country . And nomadic people in the Afar and Somali region were also affected . <p> They really rely on water and grazing for their animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat the meat when they can afford it . But Afar was severely hit by two years of drought and in July we could see animals dying in their thousands all over Afar and the people were really affected , because they could not get the milk for their children and could not sell their animals to be able to buy cereals from the market . <p> In the Somali regions , we saw the migration of entire families out of the Somali regions in 2002 - towards Djibouti and Somaliland across the border . Now this was a really interesting phenomenon , because usually nomadic people will go with their animals in search of pasture and water in neighbouring areas . <p> But this time , because they knew the situation was so bad and they had no hope , they took their entire families and moved across the border to get food and water for themselves and for their animals . And that is not very good , because what we want to do at the World Food Programme , or what we always try to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are not on the move , because when people are on the move , they get weaker and weaker and they usually die more quickly . <p> So how much food is the World Food Programme providing ? And would you call the people you are assisting hungry or starving in the first half of 2003 ? <p> We are now taking care of the food needs of about 4.5 million people throughout Ethiopia . The rest of the food is in fact coming from donations given directly to the government , or to non governmental organisations operating in this country . What we do is to provide the people with , normally , about 15kg of food per person per month . <p> But because we have less food available , the government decided to reduce rations to 12.5kg . That is in fact very bad for the population , because they are not getting enough . Already they are already getting only one type of food , which is wheat . Wheat is not very nutritious . When we see that the nutritional situation of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheat is a corn and soya blend . It 's a fortified nutritious food that we give especially to children , the frail and the elderly so that they can recover quickly from malnutrition . <p> The people currently assisted in Ethiopia - the 11.3 million people we are currently assisting - are just about surviving . They are not receiving a lot of food , or all the food they require , but they are just being kept alive , so that at the end of this year they will be able to harvest . They can then rebuild their lives and start again . <p> But what they are getting right now is just not enough to have a normal life . When you go to villages , for somebody who is not used to a situation like ours - like the people who are working with communities - if you look at people , you 'd say that the people are still malnourished , they are still not very fit . <p> That 's the problem . We can get just them the basics , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So are we talking about subsistence rations for these millions of people in Ethiopia ? <p> Let me be even more blunt . These are just survival rations . They can just survive on what we are giving them . That 's not enough to be able to lead normal lives . It 's just to keep your family alive until you can get food for your family and yourself , until you can buy sugar and other things you need in life . They are just being given wheat and , when the situation is very bad , corn and soya blend supplementary food and a little bit of cooking oil sometimes . But really that does not reflect the food basket that people in Ethiopia have access to in normal times . <p> You have said that the Ethiopian government decided to reduce the rations from 15kg per person per month to 12.5kg . Why ? <p> The main reason is because the government is worried that the food we currently have will not be enough to be supplied to the needy people , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas of the country . <p> It 's a kind of automatic contingency plan by the government , saying " maybe we should reduce the rations and give just what the people need so that we can give them this food for a longer period . " At the same time , they hope that donors will be able to provide the food so that these rations can be brought back to the normal levels . <p> Really , they are reducing the rations because they are forced to do it . It 's not an option in fact , because they want they food they have currently to last longer . <p> How confident are you that the shortfall in food aid you still require will reach Ethiopia in time ? And at this time let me ask you what effect the US-led war on Iraq has had on donations ? <p> So far , we have n't seen any effect of the war on the amount of food aid Ethiopian has received . Because maybe we were wise enough to alert the international community in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was needed . With the current food aid available in the country , we can feed people until early August . From then , we will need food aid . <p> But because we know that bringing in food to Ethiopia takes between 2-3 months , we will need food to be arriving here by mid-June , so that we are able to put it in place in areas where it is needed and we can distribute it there . <p> And you must remember that it 's not as if we can have food immediately . Food is not shipped in by air . It comes from the US or European countries by ship . It can take sometimes up to 3-4 weeks to reach the port of neighbouring Djibouti . As you know , Ethiopia is landlocked , so from Djibouti you have to truck the food to the main warehouses and hubs in the country . And from there we take the food to the places where it 's needed . Because in June the main rainy season starts , most places will be inaccessible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the international community to provide the food as quickly as possible , so that we have the time to pre-position the food where it 's needed before the onset of the rainy season . <p> Last year , the Ethiopian prime minister , Meles Zenawi , said that because of the drought in Ethiopia , the prospect of famine could be worse than the famine of 1984 . Firstly , has that materialised and , secondly , was it an accurate prediction ? <p> Thank God it did not materialise . Why ? Because the situation we had in 1984-85 is totally different from the situation we have today . Simply put , at that time the government was hiding the situation . It was an embarrassment that there was fighting all over the country and they wanted to hide the situation . <p> Today , we have excellent cooperation with the government . We have access to all parts of the country . We work together to assess the situation and we respond to the situation together . So it 's totally different . In ' 84- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the areas . There were ' no-go ' areas for NGOs and humanitarian agencies . <p> Today , we can go anywhere . We can assess the situation whenever we want and we work hand in hand with the government . <p> So why do you think Prime Minister Meles then make the comparison between the 1984 famine and the current crisis in Ethiopia ? <p> I think he made the comparison because the numbers involved were so high . This is maybe the first time in history we have more than 11 million people in need of food aid . Usually , you have between 5-10 million people in need of food . But here in Ethiopia the numbers were so huge . We knew that 11.3 million people would need food aid and that 3 million people could have needed food aid some time in 2003 . <p> When you add up those two figures , you get almost 15 million people . That 's about 20 percent of the Ethiopian population needing food aid and 20 percent of the population at risk of starvation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> So , really the prime minister was right in highlighting the situation and making that comparison . I think that alert and that message jolted donors into responding to the situation and we got the food aid needed . The prime minister made his appeal in November ( 2002 ) and by end of November and December , I think , we got most of the food we needed . So this was clearly a good message to give to donors . <p> He was not lying . When you looked at the figures and the assessment , if food had not been forthcoming , we might have had a famine by now . <p> So it was an early warning , sounding the alarm bells in time ? <p> Absolutely ! We have been criticised in the past for not giving the true picture , for not ringing the alarm bells early enough so that donors can respond . This time the humanitarian agencies and the Ethiopian government did sound the alarm bells in time , starting from July 2002 . That gave donors the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situations , how can you compare the drought in Ethiopia , and the numbers involved , to the drought affecting southern Africa ? <p> If you take just the numbers of people affected or at risk of starvation , Ethiopia has about 14 million people at risk . And if you take all the six countries in southern Africa affected by drought , the numbers are the same . <p> It shows that in Ethiopia alone , we have almost the same numbers of people affected as in the whole of southern Africa . That 's a lot . But what is different is that , in Ethiopia , you do n't have the other underlying problems exacerbating the situation in southern Africa . You do n't have the same prevalence of HIV-Aids or a political situation that is hampering food distribution as you have in , say , Zimbabwe . <p> That comparison stops at the figures though . The magnitude of the situation is similar , but southern Africa has other problems that Ethiopia does not have . <p> What about the climate and what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rural farmers of Ethiopia ? Will there be a normal planting season and harvesting season as far as you can predict at the moment ? Will people have home-produced food to eat ? <p> Normally you have a small rainy season , starting in February . It 's called the belg season . It starts in February until the end of April , normally , or sometimes until mid-May . This year , we saw a good start to the belg rainy season , but it has n't been as good as expected all over the belg region - that 's in the highlands and the central part of the country and to some extent in the eastern part of Ethiopia . <p> For the moment , we have n't seen good rains . But farmers are very wise people and they will tell you that they can not judge a rainy season until they have the food in bags and stored in the warehouses . This is why we wait until the beginning of May , end of April , before we start judging the belg season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total food production of the country . <p> The main season is the meher season . The rains start in June and they end in October . In November and December , you have the harvest . If that harvest is good , Ethiopia can feed itself . But if it 's not good , then we might have an even bigger problem . And once farmers experience successive shocks and successive droughts , they plunge deeper into poverty and for them to recover is even more difficult , because then they will leave even more assets and they may become completely destitute , leave their lands and go into town to search for work . But they wo n't find work because the rate of unemployment in the country is high . There is no chance for them to get work anywhere . So you end up with children begging on the streets , parents not having work and girls perhaps forced into prostitution in the towns . <p> If this happens , you have an ' exploded ' family that may never come together again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will not go back to their villages , adding to the problems that big urban centres have in this country . <p> How has the current food insecurity affected attendance at schools and other normal everyday activities ? How normal a life can families live in the affected areas at present ? <p> Drought is having a devastating effect on families and communities and villages . It is having also a major impact on the schooling of children . A lot of families have told us that they can not send their children to school when they are already hungry . In most of Ethiopia , you have to walk at least two hours to reach your school . You have another two hours to get home . <p> And what is the purpose of a child sitting in a classroom when he/she can not concentrate or follow what the teacher is saying ? We 've been told in schools that teachers have noticed that when children are normally fed , they play around , they shout and you can hear a lot of noise at school . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't hear children playing and you do n't hear the noise of a normal schoolyard . That 's very bad because , even if they try and come to school , they ca n't get an education . <p> What is the most worrying phenomenon is that you have drought affecting children when they need food the most , when they need food to grow . Without food , there is no way for them to grow into normal adults . We know that when a child has been affected by drought , his ability to develop into an adult is jeopardised . You will have children who will not be able to lead a normal adult life if they have been affected by one , two , three droughts . <p> This cycle of natural disasters in Ethiopia is now shorter and shorter . We had a drought in 1999-2000 and now we have one in 2003-2003 . And that is really short for farmers and their families to recover from these types of shocks . <p> So , ultimately , what is WFP 's message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country will get normal rains , because 90 percent of food production in Ethiopia is based on rainfall . We hope that people will have other means of survival , even if they can not live on their land , that they can find another type of work - say in cities - that something will be started so that they can get work and other means to help their families . <p> We also hope that donors will be more generous in other types of aid , because Ethiopia does not only need emergency aid . This country needs development aid and development money for other activities that are helping farmers and other Ethiopians to lead a normal life . We hope that money will be coming , so that Ethiopia can develop into a better country .

@@75400367 @4100367/ <h> Social injustice is killing people on a ' grand scale ' <p> World Health Organization <p> ( Geneva , 28 August 2008 ) A child born in a Glasgow , Scotland suburb can expect a life 28 years shorter than another living only 13 kilometers away . A girl in Lesotho is likely to live 42 years less than another in Japan . In Sweden , the risk of a woman dying during pregnancy and childbirth is 1 in 17 400 ; in Afghanistan , the odds are 1 in 8 . Biology does not explain any of this . Instead , the differences between - and within - countries result from the social environment where people are born , live , grow , work and age . <p> These " social determinants of health " have been the focus of a three-year investigation by an eminent group of policy makers , academics , former heads of state and former ministers of health . Together , they comprise the World Health Organization 's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health . <p> " Health inequity really is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Margaret Chan . " But health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity . Unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors , including those beyond the health sector , to examine their impact on health . Primary health care , which integrates health in all of government 's policies , is the best framework for doing so . " <p> Sir Michael Marmot , Commission Chair said : " Central to the Commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered , to have freedom to lead flourishing lives . Nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world . Health suffers as a result . Following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people . " <h> Inequities within countries <p> Health inequities unfair , unjust and avoidable causes of i 'll health have long been measured between countries but the Commission documents " health gradients " within countries as well . For example : <p> Life expectancy for Indigenous Australian males is shorter by 17 years than all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the poor compared to the rich in Indonesia . The difference in adult mortality between least and most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK is more than 2.5 times . <p> Child mortality in the slums of Nairobi is 2.5 times higher than in other parts of the city . A baby born to a Bolivian mother with no education has 10% chance of dying , while one born to a woman with at least secondary education has a 0.4% chance . <p> In the United States , 886 202 deaths would have been averted between 1991 and 2000 if mortality rates between white and African Americans were equalized . ( This contrasts to 176 633 lives saved in the US by medical advances in the same period . ) <p> In Uganda the death rate of children under 5 years in the richest fifth of households is 106 per 1000 live births but in the poorest fifth of households in Uganda it is even worse 192 deaths per 1000 live births that is nearly a fifth of all babies born alive to the poorest households destined to die before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average death rate for under fives in high income countries of 7 deaths per 1000 . <p> The Commission found evidence that demonstrates in general the poor are worse off than those less deprived , but they also found that the less deprived are in turn worse than those with average incomes , and so on . This slope linking income and health is the social gradient , and is seen everywhere not just in developing countries , but all countries , including the richest . The slope may be more or less steep in different countries , but the phenomenon is universal . <h> Wealth is not necessarily a determinant <p> Economic growth is raising incomes in many countries but increasing national wealth alone does not necessarily increase national health . Without equitable distribution of benefits , national growth can even exacerbate inequities . <p> While there has been enormous increase in global wealth , technology and living standards in recent years , the key question is how it is used for fair distribution of services and institution-building especially in low-income countries . In 1980 , the richest countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 times that of the poorest countries with 10% of the world 's population . After 25 years of globalization , this difference increased to 122 , reports the Commission . Worse , in the last 15 years , the poorest quintile in many low-income countries have shown a declining share in national consumption . <p> Wealth alone does not have to determine the health of a nation 's population . Some low-income countries such as Cuba , Costa Rica , China , state of Kerala in India and Sri Lanka have achieved levels of good health despite relatively low national incomes . But , the Commission points out , wealth can be wisely used . Nordic countries , for example , have followed policies that encouraged equality of benefits and services , full employment , gender equity and low levels of social exclusion . This , said the Commission , is an outstanding example of what needs to be done everywhere . <h> Solutions from beyond the health sector <p> Much of the work to redress health inequities lies beyond the health sector . According to the Commission 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of antibiotics but by dirty water , and by the political , social , and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all ; heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead , which are shaped by the environments in which they live ; obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high-fat and high-sugar foods . " Consequently , the health sector globally and nationally needs to focus attention on addressing the root causes of inequities in health . <p> " We rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy " explained Sir Michael . " A more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and program to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity ; to make health and health equity a marker for government performance . " <h> Recommendations <p> Based on this compelling evidence , the Commission makes three overarching recommendations to tackle the " corrosive effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living conditions , including the circumstances in which people are born , grow , live , work and age . <p> Tackle the inequitable distribution of power , money and resources the structural drivers of those conditions globally , nationally and locally . <p> Measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action . <h> Recommendations for daily living <p> Improving daily living conditions begins at the start of life . The Commission recommends that countries set up an interagency mechanism to ensure effective collaboration and coherent policy between all sectors for early childhood development , and aim to provide early childhood services to all of their young citizens . Investing in early childhood development provides one of the best ways to reduce health inequities . Evidence shows that investment in the education of women pays for itself many times over . <p> Billions of people live without adequate shelter and clean water . The Commission 's report pays particular attention to the increasing numbers of people who live in urban slums , and the impact of urban governance on health . The Commission joins other voices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electricity for all , as well as better urban planning to address the epidemic of chronic disease . <p> Health systems also have an important role to play . While the Commission report shows how the health sector can not reduce health inequities on its own , providing universal coverage and ensuring a focus on equity throughout health systems are important steps . <p> The report also highlights how over 100 million people are impoverished due to paying for health care a key contributor to health inequity . The Commission thus calls for health systems to be based on principles of equity , disease prevention and health promotion with universal coverage , based on primary health care . <h> Distribution of resources <p> Enacting the recommendations of the Commission to improve daily living conditions will also require tackling the inequitable distribution of resources . This requires far-reaching and systematic action . <p> The report foregrounds a range of recommendations aimed at ensuring fair financing , corporate social responsibility , gender equity and better governance . These include using health equity as an indicator of government performance and overall social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ensuring that rich countries honour their commitment to provide 0.7% of their GNP as aid , strengthening legislation to prohibit discrimination by gender and improving the capacity for all groups in society to participate in policy-making with space for civil society to work unencumbered to promote and protect political and social rights . At the global level , the Commission recommends that health equity should be a core development goal and that a social determinants of health framework should be used to monitor progress . <p> The Commission also highlights how implementing any of the above recommendations requires measurement of the existing problem of health inequity ( where in many countries adequate data does not exist ) and then monitoring the impact on health equity of the proposed interventions . To do this will require firstly investing in basic vital registration systems which have seen limited progress in the last thirty years . There is also a great need for training of policy-makers , health workers and workers in other sectors to understand the need for and how to act on the social determinants of health . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers to initiate action . The feasibility of action is indicated in the change that is already occurring . Egypt has shown a remarkable drop in child mortality from 235 to 33 per 1000 in 30 years .

Cuba achieved more than 99% coverage of its child development services in 2000 . But trends showing improved health are not foreordained . In fact , without attention health can decline rapidly <p> The World Health Organization is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system .

@@75400370 @4100370/ <p> What can governments in rich countries do about poverty in poor countries , apart from increasing and improving aid and endorsing ambitious poverty reduction goals ? Answer : get serious about reforming their own farm policies and start dismantling the agricultural trade restrictions and subsidies that contribute to mass poverty across the developing world . <p> When the current round of World Trade Organization ( WTO ) talks was launched at the end of 2001 , northern governments promised to overhaul agricultural trade rulesand their own farm policies . That commitment is at the heart of the so-called Doha " development agenda . " Unfortunately , fine words have been followed by business as usual . Disagreements between the agricultural superpowers , the United States ( U.S. ) and the European Union ( EU ) , have produced the familiar pattern of mutual recrimination and deadlock at the WTO , potentially jeopardizing the entire round . And neither protagonist shows any inclination to cut agricultural subsidies at home . The EU reform of the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) of June 2003 was at best a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries have failed to develop the alliances that might shift the terms of the debate at the WTO . The Cairns Group ( an alliance of agricultural exporting countries , 3 of which are developed and 14 of which are developing ) is seen as a representative of large-scale commercial exporters , African interests have been particularly neglected , and India and China continue to wrestle below their weight class , even though their joint engagement could fundamentally change the WTO round . At risk of understatement , the crucial links between agricultural trade , poverty , and food security do not figure prominently on the WTO agenda . <p> All of this is bad news for global poverty reduction efforts . More than three-quarters of the poor in the developing worldsome 900 million peoplelive in rural areas . Most are small farmers . That is why agricultural growth based on smallholder producers is one of the most powerful catalysts for poverty reduction : for every additional $1 generated through agricultural production , economic linkages can add another $3 to the rural economy . Support to agriculture in rich countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that northern governments like to endorse at international meetings . And it matters because the rural poor can not wait any longer for meaningful reform . <p> There is a cruel irony at the heart of the current agricultural trading system . In rich countries , agriculture represents a small share of national income and employment , typically less than 2 percent of the total . By contrast , agriculture accounts for 17 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in middle-income countries , rising to 35 percent in the poorest countries . Agricultural exports exceed one-third of the total in almost half of all developing countries . Yet industrialized countries systematically use subsidies to skew the benefits of agricultural trade in their favor . <p> It does not automatically follow that northern agricultural policy reform will create a new , more equitable pattern of globalization . In the absence of wider measures taken by developing-country governments themselves to address the underlying causes of poverty and inequality , the opportunities created by trade will bypass the poor . <p> There are four priorities for developing-country policymakers . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies ( see the accompanying essay by Eugenio Dfaz-Bonilla and Ashok Gulati ) . Second , rural development needs to figure more prominently in national budgets . Third , more weight has to be attached to improving poor people 's access to education , health services , and productive assets . Fourth , countries must provide effective institutions , through which the poor can articulate their interests . But agricultural trade reform in rich countries is necessary to create an enabling environment in which pro-poor domestic reforms can workand it is a condition for making globalization work for the poor . <p> The fundamental problem at the heart of the WTO negotiations is this . Each year , rich countries spend in excess of US$300 billion in support of agriculturesome six times the amount they allocate to foreign development assistance . Most of the subsidies end up supporting production and generating large surpluses , which are then dumped on world markets at prices that bear no relation to production costs . <p> Meanwhile , high tariffs and other trade barriers are used to keep imports out . Tariffs on agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times those applied to manufactured goods , and peaks in excess of 100 percentfor groundnuts in the U.S. and dairy produce in Europe , for exampleare common . While the poorest African countries may not be able to produce an exportable surplus of dairy products , they could do so for beef , sugar , and cotton . Beef and sugar , however , are the most protected products in the EU , even more than dairy products , and U.S. cotton policy hinders African growth . <p> WINNERS AND LOSERS <p> Who benefits from these policies ? Research by Oxfam has shown that the distribution of subsidies among farmers in both Europe and the U.S. is more unequal than the distribution of income in Brazil , one of the world 's most unequal countries in terms of income . The biggest 25 percent of EU subsidy recipients receive more than 60 percent of all subsidies . In the U.S. 60 percent of farmers get no support at all , while the biggest 7 percent account for 50 percent of government payments . The large slice of subsidies directed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . To make matters worse , most of the benefits generated through agricultural support do not even reach producers : the supports are capitalized into higher land values and higher input prices . According to OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ) estimates only 25 percent of price supports end up as net income gain for farmers . The system results in unfair distribution and is highly inefficient . In the long run it provides false signals to the incoming generation of farmers and contributes to loss in equity for many . Furthermore , it contributes to disarray in world agriculture and to poverty worldwide . <p> Whoever wins from the farm subsidy bonanza in rich countries , it is the developing countries that lose in aggregate , even though a few may gain with the EU 's " Everything but Arms " initiative ( EBA ) . An IFPRI model predicts that an end to rich-country support in agriculture would generate annual gains of US$40 billion for developing countries , with Sub-Saharan Africa , the world 's poorest region , gaining US$3.3 billion . The gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ) and import substitution effects . <p> Small farmers in developing countries suffer on several counts from rich-country farm policies . Northern production subsidies lower prices for farm produce . Unable to compete against subsidized competition , the world 's poorest farmers are often pushed out of international and even domestic markets . The upshot is an agricultural trading system in which success depends less on comparative advantage than on comparative access to subsidies . Small farmers are efficient , innovative , and potentially competitive , and creatively combine farming with off-farm work . But the world 's poorest farmers can not compete against the world 's richest treasuries , nor should they have to . <p> RESTRICTED EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES <p> Northern import restrictions and production subsidies help to explain two features of the world agricultural trading system left intact under globalization : slow growth and continued domination by industrialized countries . Agricultural growth in developing countries declined to 2.2 percent per year in the past 10 years , compared to 3.4 percent in the previous decade . Although agricultural trade has increased in absolute terms over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 10 percent . And developing countries account for about one-third of exports , roughly the same share of exports as in 1980 . <p> The structure of agricultural protectionism in rich countries reinforces unequal globalization . Within the agricultural sector , high-value-added goods represent the most dynamic growth point . These goods include products such as meat , fruits and vegetables , and nuts . Exports for this category of goods are growing in excess of 8 percent a yearalmost four times the growth rate for the sector as a whole . But developing countries seeking access to high-value-added markets face a daunting array of trade barriers . <p> Tariff escalation , or duties that rise with each step of processing , is a standard feature of industrialized-country protectionism . In the EU fully processed food products face tariffs almost twice as high as tariffs in the first stage of processing . Latin American exporters to the EU face tariffs that are five times higher for tomato sauces than those levied on fresh tomatoes . At the same time , fresh tomatoes may face prohibitive tariffs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian and Spanish producers from Latin America , and less so from African producers , who benefit from the EU 's ACP ( African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States ) agreement and the EBA . <p> Such practices create disincentives for investment in local processing and deny producers in developing countries opportunities to enter higher-value-added markets , where new jobs could be created . Other high-value-added markets are protected by huge tariff peaks . Developing countries ( other than ACP and EBA countries ) wanting to export beef to Europe face tariffs of up to 150 percent , while fruit and nut exporters to the United States face tariffs of 200 percent or more . And this is before taking into account the arsenal of non-tariff barriers , including phytosanitary regulations . While the protection of consumer health is clearly a legitimate priority , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the selective application of health standards is often directed toward protectionist goals . <p> The upshot is that many developing-country agricultural exporters are operating in the least dynamic part of the global economyand they are systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present pattern of agricultural trade is thus reinforcing wider inequalities in globalization , with attendant implications for poverty . <p> Of course , there are those who see restrictions on export opportunities for developing-country agriculture as a blessing in disguise . In recent years EU ministers for agriculture and some in the anti-globalization movement have joined hands to warn against the perils of export agriculture , claiming that it will displace local food production , exacerbate inequalities , and reinforce poverty in developing countries . Whether motivated by a concern to defend indefensible farm policies or by genuine conviction , these siren voices are wrong . The problem is not agricultural trade per se , but the rules that govern it and skew the benefits away from poor countries and poor farmers . <p> Under the right conditions , agricultural exports can act as a dynamic force for poverty reduction , providing small farmers with opportunities to generate income , diversify their livelihoods , and reduce vulnerability . In parts of East Africa and Central America , small farmers have succeeded in entering markets for high-value-added fruit and vegetable exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical role in reducing rural poverty in Uganda and Vietnam . Far from displacing food production , export success in both countries has gone hand in hand with an increase in output of basic food staples . <p> None of this implies that agricultural trade generates automatic benefits for poverty reduction . Small farmersespecially womenoften lack access to the land , capital , information , and marketing infrastructure needed to take advantage of export opportunities . In the absence of public policies in developing countries to overcome these disadvantagesespecially land tenure and credit policiesexport growth can marginalize the poor . Surely this situation calls for domestic policies that redistribute opportunities to the poor , rather than denying the potential benefits of agricultural exports or turning a blind eye to northern policies that restrict those benefits . <p> HARVESTING THE COTTON SUBSIDY <p> When it comes to harvesting subsidies , the U.S. 's 25,000 cotton producers are first among equals . In 2001 , government support to the sector reached about US$3.4 billiona sum that exceeds U.S. aid to Sub-Saharan Africa . Most of this support is directed toward agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates . Because the U.S. is the world 's largest exporter of cotton , accounting for about 40 percent of the world market , its domestic subsidy programs have global market implications . According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee , these programs artificially lowered world prices by about one-quarter in 2001 . <p> The losers have included desperately poor farmers in West Africa . This is potentially one of the world 's most productive cotton-producing regions , thanks partly to the high quality associated with non-mechanized production . Over the past decade production has almost doubled , creating benefits for household income , agricultural growth , and exports . An estimated 10 to 11 million people now depend on cotton production . For many households , cotton is the only cash crop . It is often grown on small farms jointly with basic food staples , such as maize . Not only does cotton production have a major bearing on household food security , agricultural investment , and rural wages , in several countries it is the largest source of export receipts and government revenue . <p> African cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . They ought to . Using household survey data on income and expenditure for Benin , IFPRI has simulated the effect of a 25 percent increase in the world price of cotton , roughly corresponding to the effect of the elimination of U.S. subsidies . The estimates suggest that a price increase of 25 percent would cause the national incidence of poverty in Benin to decline by 4 percent , enabling 250,000 people to rise above the poverty line , which , in this context , consigns those who live below it to hunger . <p> West Africa 's experience also highlights tensions between aid policies on the one side and agricultural trade policies on the other . The lower world prices induced by U.S. subsidies are estimated to have cost the region about US$190 million in 2001 , exacerbating foreign debt and balance-of-payment constraints . Much has been made of the debt relief provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative . Yet Burkina Faso has lost more as a direct consequence of U.S. cotton subsidies than it receives in debt relief . And Mali 's losses dwarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLICY <p> In the interest of balance , we must also acknowledge the egregious role of the EU 's Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) . The EU likes to defend its record by pointing out that , on a per capita basis , American farmers get more subsidies . On the other side of the coin , it should be pointed out that the US$104 billion in producer support provided by Europe accounts for one-third of the value of output , compared with one-fifth in the United States . <p> Transatlantic rivalries aside , there is no doubt that on aggregate the CAP hurts poor farmers . Take the sugar sector . By world standards Europe is an exceptionally high-cost producer of sugar . It is also the world 's largest exporter of white sugar , accounting for 40 percent of the global market . Under the CAP , farmers in Europe receive a guaranteed price that is typically two to three times the world market price . Some developing countries in the ACP groupnotably Mauritiusalso benefit from this price for a fixed quota of exports under a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excess of 140 percent . The high margins provided by guaranteed prices support levels of production far in excess of domestic demandhence the large exports . <p> Subsidized EU exports , stimulation of domestic production , and taxation of domestic consumption hurt non-subsidizing , developing-country exporters , forcing countries such as Malawi , Thailand , and Zambia out of third markets . CAP exports also lower world sugar prices by around 15 percent . <p> In 2001 Europe announced the EBA initiative , aimed at removing all import barriers for developing countries . But sugaralong with rice and bananaswas put on the back burner . The reason : vigorous lobbying by assorted sugar-processing and big-farm interests . Developing countries will either have to grow other crops or will continue to lose , as world prices for sugar remain lower than under non-protectionist policies . The EBA initiative is positive because it will force EU policies to change , but the situation would be better if EU policies had changed beforehand . <p> Hopes that CAP reform would usher in a new approach to agricultural trade by the EU were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission had proposed real decoupling , aimed at reducing market-based incentives to produce . However , at the end of the process of member-state wrangling , decoupling has been only partially introduced in cereals , but countries can delay this until 2007 . Sectors such as sugar and dairy that account for the bulk of export subsidies are either untouched or subject to only modest reforms . <p> Meanwhile , overall levels of subsidy spending will probably continue to rise until 2013 . <p> IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD IMPORTERS <p> For countries that are net food importers , standard consumer welfare models register the lower food prices associated with northern production subsidies and export dumping as a positive gain . This situation raises an important policy question that has figured prominently in debates at the WTO : namely , would an end to export dumping by rich countries hurt food security in developing countries ? <p> The answer is no . Standard consumer welfare models tend to obscure the damage caused by agricultural dumping . Export subsidies in industrialized countries undermine incentives for small farmers in developing countries , and destabilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in developing countries , notably with regard to import liberalization . <p> In India , surges in imports of dairy products forced the government to sharply increase tariffs at the end of the 1990s . Some critical voices saw the move as a retreat from free trade . But what does free trade mean in a context where the world 's largest exporter of dairy produce , the EU , is providing subsidies in excess of US$3 billion a year ? <p> Under prevailing market conditions , rapid import liberalization can inflict enormous adjustment costs on small farmers . When Haiti opened up its rice market in 1995 , imports from the U.S. flooded in , driving prices down by 25 percent and displacing local farmers . At the time agricultural subsidies to U.S. rice producers represented 40 percent of the value of output . <p> Without fundamental reform of northern agricultural support systems , import liberalization will remain a prescription for unfair competition . For example , the 2.4 million Mexican farmers whose livelihoods partly depend on maize production are currently being integrated into a regional market with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at US$9 billion a year , according to the OECD . Given the dilapidated state of the infrastructure supporting Mexican maize farmers , especially in rain-fed areas , the unbalanced competition would appear likely to reinforce rural poverty and migration . <p> While developing countries may suffer from opening their markets to cheap imports , they also lose from keeping their markets closed . IFPRI research on African markets has shown that the indirect effects of protectionism in undermining the very creation and growth of market institutions , including those related to financing and banking in rural areas , have adverse long-term consequences for development . <p> Among the most serious problems associated with northern export dumping is the signal it has sent to governments in developing countries , notably in Sub-Saharan Africa . The ready availability of cheap food for urban populations has provided a rationale for failing to give priority to the economic setting in which small farmers operate and for neglecting rural infrastructure . In fact , public investment in agriculture and rural development had fallen off the agenda of ministries of finance , despite the developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by donors , such as the World Bank , once the detrimental effects of its neglect had become clear . <p> One consequence of falling agricultural investment has been the dangerously high level of dependence on food aid and commercial imports witnessed in many countries . Of course , these countries should not seek food self-sufficiency for its own sake , but instead seek food security . A central challenge for these countries , and for much of Africa , is to increase smallholder production of food , not just to reduce foreign exchange costs , but also to generate income and employment . Northern export subsidies make this task less attractive . <p> THE WAY AHEAD <p> The Doha " development round " provides a critical opportunity to start making agricultural trade work for the poor zand to chart a new course toward a more equitable pattern of globalization . Seizing that opportunity is vital , not just in the interest of small farmers in developing countries , but also in the interest of restoring the credibility of the rules-based multilateral trading system . <p> Five things need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into action . <p> First , we need an honest assessment of what has happened under the Agreement on Agriculture ( AoA ) adopted at the end of the last round of world trade talks , the Uruguay Round . And what has happened is not encouraging . Under the AoA industrialized countries promised to cut agricultural support by 20 percent . The pattern of subsidies has somewhat changed from subsidies tied to production to those that are partly decoupled . The June 2003 reform of the EU CAP promises to go further in the right direction . Much will depend , however , on actual implementation of the stated policies , because " coupled elements of payments may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , " as the EU deal states . Developing-country small farmers can not even dream of such policy stipulations for themselves . <p> Broadly speaking , there has been a diminishing use of policy instruments that reward farmers for what they produce with price supports ( defined by the WTO as " trade-distorting " ) . Although there is no question that some subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help sustain production capacities . Producer support estimates ( PSEs ) , which include both types of subsidies ( coupled and decoupled ) , have actually increased under the AoA , as measured by the OECD . <p> How has this been possible ? The European Union and the United States have invented a category of support-known as the Green Box and the Blue Box in WTO talks-deemed to be decoupled from production and therefore exempt from cuts in subsidies . In effect , they have shifted their support channels through an elaborate repackaging exercise . Blue box measures were allowed only because the EU had lowered grain prices by 30 percent and had instituted measures to curtail production ( set-aside ) . Blue-box payments are related to land , and to the number of cows for beef production . Subsidies for beef production were introduced at a time when beef prices were lowered . Nevertheless , this category of subsidies should be forbidden . These subsidies might have been justified at the time of the price cuts in order to provide some adjustment aid . But such adjustments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU cereals . Currently , wheat producers receive a direct payment equivalent to about US$60 per metric ton , or some 60 percent of the export price . Under WTO rules this payment does not count either as a production subsidy or as an export subsidy . The reason : it is classified as a " decoupled " payment because it is not coupled to current production . This rationale might make sense to trade lawyers and accountants . But food staple producers in West Africa trying to compete against EU imports might take a less benign view . It is vital that the Doha Round deliver real decoupling and real cuts in all support measures that create unfair competition . <p> Second , the Doha Round must deliver a comprehensive prohibition against export support measures that act directly or indirectly as export subsidies . Farmers in developing countries need rules that outlaw the export of agricultural goods at prices below those received by producers . Those rules must extend beyond direct export subsidies to cover the full range of measures currently in place . These include : <p> direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and U.S. cotton ; <p> export credit programs , such as the US$5.7 billion in officially supported export credit provided under the 2002 U.S. Farm Act ; and <p> food aid programs used to indirectly cofinance commercial exports . <p> In this round donors must make a credible commitment to adequate levels of food aid , delivered in non-distorting ways , effectively reaching the needy , and responding swiftly to emergencies . <p> Third , rich countries need to open their own markets . As the president of Brazil , Luis Incio " Lula " da Silva , has written : " Any export efforts we might make will be worth nothing if the rich countries continue to preach free trade and practice protectionism . " One of the aims of the Doha Round should be an " early harvest " of measures to lower tariff and nontariff barriers on agricultural goods and to eliminate tariff escalation . <p> Fourth , developing countries must retain the right to protect their agricultural systems from instability and unfair competition associated with northern agricultural subsidies . Developing countries themselves have put forward proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India has advocated a " special safeguard " provision under which higher tariffs would be triggered if import prices fall below specified levels . <p> For their part , the EU and the U.S. have resisted calls for entrenched rights to protect food security , arguing that any safeguards should be limited to a narrow range of " food staples " and a small group of countries . This is a particularly hypocritical way of thinking about food security . Protection of the livelihoods of small farmers can not be reduced to a small range of food crops . <p> Fifth , while the largest benefits of agricultural liberalization would arise from multilateral negotiations under WTO , regional and bilateral negotiations of free trade agreements ( FTAs ) are currently ongoing . These negotiations put healthy pressure on the WTO process , but they also endanger progress at the global level , if continued in an erratic fashion . For the time being , Europe and the United States should hold back on further bilateral FTAs and fully concentrate on achieving progress in the WTO negotiations . <p> These five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade that is not rigged against small farmers in developing countries . By ending the self-serving instincts that currently dictate their approach to agricultural trade , rich countries can help to create an enabling environment for poor farmers . Then it is up to developing-country governments themselves to create the conditions under which their people can exploit trade opportunities to reduce poverty and hunger . Under these conditions international development finance would have a greater , more beneficial impact as well . <p> Kevin Watkins is director of research for Oxfam .

@@75400371 @4100371/ <p> There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to explaining the cause of the economic meltdown that has many Asian countries in its grip . On the global level , the economic policies espoused by the United States , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and the World Bank , added to the activities of the international investors and currency speculators , all share responsibility . On the national level , unwise investment choices , lax banking regulations , corruption , excessive public and corporate debt , excessive expansion of credit and inadequate foreign currency reserves all played their part . <p> From the late 1980s until mid-1997 , Southeast Asian currencies were set at a fixed exchange rate tied to the U.S. dollar . As the dollar lost value against the yen , their exports to Japan and Europe became cheaper and labor and land in the region also became cheaper , so foreign money flooded in and many Japanese manufacturers moved their factories to Southeast Asian countries . Although this resulted in higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities did not allow them to rise against the dollar . High interest rates and undervalued currencies attracted even more foreign money . In 1995 , however , when the United States and Japan agreed that the yen was overvalued and took steps to devalue it , resulting in the dollar appreciating from -80 to -130 , Southeast Asias low-cost advantages began to be lost , for the ASEAN nations currencies were still pegged to the dollar . As exports became more expensive in Europe and Japan , long term investment became less attractive to Japan , growth slowed drastically , the current account ( balance of trade ) grew to a negative 8 percent , and ASEAN currencies came to be seen as overvalued . Thailands baht was the first to be sold short , in February , 1997 and again in May , and on July 2nd , the Thai government gave up on supporting the baht and let it float . <p> The float , however , was only the beginning of Thailands troubles . Currency speculators dumped baht , driving its value further down . Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates to finance its current account deficit . The fact that many of its long-term loans had been used for real-estate speculation meant that many of them could not be repaid when called and this led to a rash of bank and business failures and large numbers of employee layoffs . Thailand was forced to seek IMF aid . <p> The fall of the baht made investors nervous about other Asian currencies . Soon the Indonesian rupiah was under attack and had fallen to less than half of its previous value . The domestic consequences of bank and business failures and job loss were worse than Thailands so that Indonesia , too , was soon forced to request IMF loans . <p> Next , foreign investors and speculators , in November , pulled their short-term loans out of South Korea . Its foreign currency reserves were soon depleted and it , too , fell into the clutches of the IMF . <p> The Asian economies were certainly not blameless for what happened . Thailand could have mobilized more domestic capital and relied less on foreign loans . It could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and run " behavior that so exacerbated the situation could not have happened . It could have regulated its own banking industry more carefully so that there would n't have been so many of the speculative investments that turned into unredeemable loans . <p> Many of the same " could haves " apply even more to Indonesia . Its authoritarian , nepotistic Suharto government has been even more dependent upon short-term foreign investment and characterized by more lax banking regulation than Thailand . <p> In South Korea , the chaebol , with their high debt-to-capital ratio , politically-motivated investment decisions and their close ties to the banking community and the latters practice of overextended loans , were highly vulnerable to investment decisions made abroad . <p> Notwithstanding the misjudgments of the Asian nations , events beyond their control had much to do with their troubles . In 1971 , with the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates between major currencies linked with gold , economic growth was freed from the constraints of a relatively inflexible monetary supply , but the door was also opened to speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major cause of Asias present economic troubles . <p> Another external factor was the **34;536;TOOLONG measures of the Reagan/Thatcher governments , policies also adopted by the IMF and World Bank . These measures , together with the debt crisis of the early 1980s , led to a rash of corporate mergers , buyouts , and bankruptcies , changes accelerated by the 1987 stock market crash . These changes shifted the center of economic activity and power from producers and marketers to financiers merchant banks , institutional investors ( managing pension and mutual funds ) , stockbrokers , currency speculators , etc . <p> These changes resulted in an unprecedented concentration of financial power and an attitude that finance capital and its manipulations are the essence of economic activity . In 1975 , about 80 percent of foreign exchange transactions went to pay for the production or trade of goods and services ; the remaining 20 percent was in expectation of profit from the buying and selling of currencies themselves , based on their changing values . Since then , currency deregulation , the " electronification " of money and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transaction costs much lower . Thus , today we find that a mere 2.5 percent of foreign currency exchange is to pay for goods and services and 97.5 percent is speculative . About $2 trillion in currencies is now traded each day . " This is equivalent to the entire gross domestic product ( GDP ) volume of the United States being turned over via currency trading every three days . " Banks are now only a minority player in a game dominated by institutional investors , but even they now derive 30 to 50 percent of their profit from currency transactions rather than interest from loans . <p> The changing value of currencies , a source of great wealth for speculators , is a threat to manufacturing business and national governments and economies . Total central bank reserves worldwide total about $600 billion , equivalent to only a few hours of currency trading , so if the traders make a concerted " attack " on a particular currency , no government , even that of the United States , has sufficient dollar reserves to defend its currency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nations economy is brought to its knees by the currency speculators and must call on the IMF for help , it is the ordinary citizens who bear the brunt of the austerity measures mandated by the IMF through unemployment and cutback of social , educational , and medical services . <p> While speculators can profit handsomely from fluctuations in the value of currency they thrive on instability manufacturing businesses are hurt by uncertainty and instability . For example , suppose a Japanese or American firm , attracted by low land and labor costs , sets up a factory in Thailand . It converts dollars or yen into baht to buy the land and build the factory . In operating it and selling its product , most transactions are in baht . In the meantime , however , if the value of the baht drops by half , a profit earned within Thailand will be greatly reduced when converted into yen or dollars . If the owner should decide to liquidate the business and repatriate the proceeds , half the value of the investment is lost simply because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $17.2 billion for Thailand , $43 billion for Indonesia , and $57 billion for South Korea . There are , of course , strings attached and the aid will be dribbled out as the IMFs conditions are met . Some of these are reforms that most everybody agrees should have been made long ago : freeing central banks from political control , opening the finance sector to public scrutiny ( thereby reducing cronyism and corruption in the granting of loans ) , requiring reasonable reserves to back up loans , etc . In Indonesia , the breakup of the cartels and monopolies that have made some of President Suhartos family and friends wealthy is part of the IMF requirements . <p> It is what the IMF is demanding that nations do vis-+ -vis the outside world that worries the Asian nations and arouses suspicion that the IMF package is simply a plot by the multinationals to gain control of national firms on the cheap . For example , in Korea , the package requires raising the limit on foreign ownership of Korean stocks to 55 percent , permitting the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial/capital market , diversifying import sources , abolishing the car classification system ( thus making it easier for U.S. and Japanese automakers to break into the Korean market ) , etc . These measures , plus the requirements that the national governments reduce taxes and spending , are seen by social critics as virtual enslavement to the IMF . Why , they ask , should Thais , Indonesians , and Koreans have to suffer for the greed of money speculators ? <p> Although there is anger and bitterness that the " Asian Tigers " have so suddenly become housecats in the lap of the IMF , there is also much self-reflection and a determination that this shall not happen again . There is a resolve to rely more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital , a will to strengthen the of-late much-neglected agricultural sector , recognizing a strong farm economy provides a cushion against urban unemployment and a higher degree of national self-sufficiency . There is also talk of a retreat from rampant materialism and consumerism , and a return to spiritual values and simpler living . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it leads to strengthened local communities , greater democracy and perhaps even new media of exchange , it could form a bulwark against the relentless and undemocratic global economy . <p> Lewis and his wife Rose Lewis edit Windows East and West , a Society of Friends publication on Asian issues .

@@75400372 @4100372/ <h> Report on the World Food Summit <p> Martin McLaughlin <p> The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( UN/FAO ) World Food Summit , held June 10-13 in Rome , practically disappeared from the news after brief mention of its lavish opening banquet and its otherwise unimpressive start . The Summit ultimately failed to accomplish much because it did not address the core systemic issue affecting food securitythe disproportionate power of transnational agribusiness corporations . Social justice demands we understand and challenge this power structure . <p> HOW THE MEETING CAME ABOUT <p> The event was supposed to have been held in November , 2001 , the fifth anniversary of the original 1996 World Food Summit , but was postponed by the Italian government mainly for security reasons . Attendance in June , 2002 disappointed nearly everyone : although 82 heads of state or government from the developing countries of the South attended , only two industrialized countries were represented at that levelItaly , the host , by President Carlo Ciampi , Premier Silvio Berlusconi , and European Commission President Romano Brodi ; and Spain , which holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Jose Maria Aznar . Most delegations were headed by Ministers of Agriculture , while the United Kingdom sent only a junior cabinet official . <p> The 186 national delegations that attended the 1996 Summit had agreed that access to adequate food is a basic human right . They accepted the FAOs statement that 840 million people ( more than one seventh of the human race ) lacked food securitythat is , they do not have access to an adequate human diet by either growing the food or buying it . The 1996 Summit set out to reduce the number of food-insecure people by half by 2015 . This major goal was accepted by all countries and later included in the UNs Millennium Goals . <p> The stated purpose of the five-year follow-up Summit this past June was to assess statistical progress toward that goal , which would require a decrease of 22 million people in the food-insecure category per year . The actual annual reduction has only been between 6 and 8 million , nearly 90 percent of which occurred in China . At this rate , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the world would even approach the overall goal . <p> After three days of official speeches and conferences , the 2002 Rome delegations signed off on the Declaration of the World Food Summit : Five Years Latera preparatory document they had agreed on beforehand to avoid debate , and then had approved unanimously on the first day of the meeting following the customary UN participial prologue , the relatively short , 35 paragraph Declaration added little to the 1996 commitments except exhortations to recommit and to implement the outcome of the WTO Ministerial in Doha with respect to agriculture . There was also a carefully worded endorsement of agricultural biotechnology an entirely new topic , despite the FAOs insistence that no new matters be raised . This addition , pushed mainly by the United States , caused more debate than any other item . <p> The new Declaration did not mention the $24 billion in additional annual public investment that would be required to meet the 2015 goal of halving hunger , according to the FAOs proposed Anti-Hunger Program . Some observers , however , contrasted this amount with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the OECD countries spent on subsidies to their own food and agriculture producers in 2001 . <p> A CONTEXT FOR THE FOOD SUMMIT <p> The participants explicitly connected this Summit with " the outcomes of other global conferences " notably the Financing for Development ( FFD ) Conference in Monterrey , Mexico ( March , 2002 ) , the 4th Ministerial Conference of the WTO at Doha , Qatar ( November , 2001 ) , and the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development ( WSSD ) in Johannesburg ( August , 2002 ) . Like these other official events , the Food Summit coincided with a much livelier NGO Forum for Food Sovereignty , which took place at the same time in another part of Rome . NGO participants issued a Call for Action for Food Sovereignty , decrying governments failure to fulfill the 1996 Summits commitments . They stated that the lack of " political will " demonstrated after the 1996 Summit has " opened the doors to the unbridled monopolization and concentration of resources and productive processes in the hands of a few giant corporations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support at WSSD . <p> Many participants in both the Summit and the Forum , however , suggested that a certain amount of " conference fatigue " may be setting in . If so , one reason may be that advocates of food security and poverty eradication are frustrated with the failure of political leaders to acknowledge the fundamental structural problems inherent in globalization a process that threatens to complete the marginalization of the relatively powerless . <p> The basic question in the food and agriculture sector why , in a world whose food supply every year is enough to feed everyone an adequate human diet , are one-seventh of these people denied their right to that food ? was not asked by the organizers of this event . Nor was it asked at the 1996 Summit or earlier relevant UN conferences . <p> WHY NO PROGRESS ? <p> In the Centers view , the primary reason for the failure to move vigorously toward the agreed goal continues to be a lack of understanding of how the global food system works . This is part of a general failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As in other sectors of that economy , nearly all the elements of both the structure and the dynamics of the food system are dominated by a de facto cartel of corporations of various kinds ( in this case agribusiness ) : seed , machinery , and other input providers ; global trading companies ; fast food and other consumer food services ; grocery chains ; and vertically integrated production and processing corporations . <p> The favorite of the 1996 Summits seven commitments was to expand trade in food and agricultural products . This mantra of free trade is constantly put forward as the panacea , in this case for overcoming food insecurity . The thesis is that with more free trade in food and other agricultural products , everybody will be fed , and everybodys poverty will be relieved . But studies conducted since 1996 clearly show that such trade expansion has hurt small farmers in the developing countries , and retarded any reduction in food insecurity . <p> In fact , there is no such thing as free trade ; food and agricultural trade , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and neither do most governments , unless they have <p> a state trading entity . Companies trade , and their purpose is not to compete , but to expand the market and divide it up so that each maximizes profit . These companies , most of them headquartered in the United States , decide what people will eat , and how it will be produced , packaged , marketed , and above all priced . And they are accountable to no one ; boards , stockholders , and even accountants do n't  count . <p> Until those who want to reform the global food system face the reality of this power structure , no global meetings or lists of remedial actions based on personal commitment or thorough documentation will bring about the necessary changes . People are hungry because they are poor , and they are poor because they lack the power effectively to choose otherwise . Unaccountable power is undemocratic and immoral , and its top-down concentration protects it from citizen participation . <p> The Director General of the FAO , Mr. Jacques Diouf , was described in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from industrialized countries at the Rome meeting . During a July visit to the United States , he called attention to the prospective famine that menaces several countries in southern Africa and pleaded once more for the political will as he had in the introduction to the documentation for the Summits anniversary . U.S. President John F. Kennedy made that same call in 1963almost 40 years ago . But where is that political will today ? Or , perhaps more pointedly , who has both the will and the power to bring about preventive and remedial changes ? <p> THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE <p> Action has to take place at the grassroots , where countless well intentioned , useful , and effective programs are already underway some with strong institutional foundation or with government support . But it is also needed at the policy level , where despite strong rhetoric from several quarters , there is little indication that the public interest will prevail in any of the four agriculture processes under way this year . These four processes are : <p> --The WFS+5 process , which culminated in Junes Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless agricultural trade negotiations taking place in the World Trade Organization since the 4th WTO Ministerial meeting in Doha , Qatar <p> --The WSSD , which will deal with sustainable agriculture <p> --The recently enacted U.S. farm bill , which contains a mixed bag of program and financial authorizations , including more subsidies for the richest U.S. farmers and agribusinesses . <p> The relevance of this fourth point is that what the United States does profoundly affects howand perhaps whetherthe rest of the world eats . The U.S. floods developing countries with cheap grain at prices far below the cost of production , pushing down world prices and thus ruining grain markets for smallholders in countries that do not provide subsidies . Local farmers here and abroad lose income , leave the farm , and swell the ranks of the unemployed in overcrowded cities in nearly every country in the world . <p> In the face of conditions like these there is little to offer except hope , the virtue we are urged not to abandon . Democracy is hopeful , and justice is hopeful , and cooperation is hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible ; corrections can take place . But we will all have to work very hard on both the policy and the grassroots level in order to trigger an authentic , just change of direction ( metanoia ) that is needed . <p> Martin McLaughlin , Ph.D. , is an Adjunct Associate at the Center of Concern and author of a new book on World Food Security : A Catholic View of Food Policy in the New Millennium , which is available at www.coc.org .

@@75400378 @4100378/ <p> Since 1975 , the Group of 8 ( G8 ) Summit has been the principal forum for the leaders of the major industrial democracies to discuss the significant economic and political issues facing their nations , most often security , trade , and growth . But in the last five years , in large part due to citizen action , the G8 leaders have also put the concerns of poor countries on their agenda . Debt relief has been a key topic since 1999so much so , in fact , that todays G8 leaders are now conversant in the technical jargon of debt relief . Thus it is unfortunate that after so much analysis and so many discussions , this years G8 Summit was mostly talk and no action . <p> There were opportunities to make financial commitments to support meaningful debt relief , prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS , even to address unfair trade practices that keep Africa from thriving . There were also opportunities to support the blueprints for development that were crafted by African leaders themselves . But the absence of a concrete action plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G8 , and especially the U.S. , to improve the situation of the poorest continent in the world is simply not there . <p> A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA ? <p> This year , the leaders of the G8 countriesUnited States , United Kingdom , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , and Russiainvited the Presidents of South Africa , Nigeria , Senegal , and Algeria to join them to discuss the New Economic Partnership for Africas Development ( NEPAD ) , an innovative plan drawn up by African leaders that would allow them to set their own goals for development and then monitor their own progress . But the G8 leaders carefully avoided the issues that the Africans most wanted to focus on : debt relief , large-scale investment in infrastructure , unfair trade practices , and HIV/AIDS . <p> No More Debt Relief . The G8 leaders discussed the Heavily Indebted Poor Country ( HIPC ) initiative in depth . They noted that the initiative provides only limited relief and that outside events , such as the recent collapse of export commodity prices , cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for all creditors to contribute to the initiative and called for better monitoring and reporting . They even promised to fill a $1 billion shortfall in funding . But they did not offer the financial resources that would allow an expansion of the initiative to more of the fifty-plus countries that still need debt relief . To date , only six countries have received the full amount of relief available under the HIPC initiative , and that amount is still not enough to make a real difference . At this rate , the HIPC initiative will remain a weak response to the debt crisis . <p> Not Enough Aid . Prior to the G8 meeting , the World Bank had estimated that $40 billion-$60 billion a year was required to provide food , shelter , clean water , and primary education for all of Africa , while African leaders estimated they needed $64 billion per year to meet these goals and to invest in infrastructure that would stimulate economic growth . The African leaders offered to provide some of this money themselves , noting that the rest would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the rich nations together promised only $6 billion , less than one-tenth of the requested amount , and the U.S. earmarked its $200 million contribution for education only . TheG8 leaders spent their time instead discussing how African nations could improve governance , respect human rights , abide by the rule of law , initiate private investment , improve womens lives , and resolve conflict . These concerns , while very important , were supposed to be worked out by the African leaders in consultation with civil society in their countries , not by the G8 leaders . In fact , the aspect of NEPAD that was considered groundbreaking was that it would make the governments of Africa responsible for assessing one anothers commitment to democracy and development . The G8 undermined the Africans efforts in this area . <p> Unfair trade practices will continue . The G8 leaders said that the answer to Africas financial needs is not merely aid , but also trade and investment . They promised to provide more trade-related technical assistance to help African countries benefit from global trade ( particularly through U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate the financing of private investment through their own export credit agencies , which are notorious examples of corporate welfare . ( See **28;572;TOOLONG for more on this topic . ) <p> But the G8 would not discuss the fact that record-high agricultural subsidies in the U.S. and Europe drive down the price of agricultural products worldwide , making it impossible for African farmers to export competitively or even to compete in their own markets . The new U.S. Farm Bill will provide $15 billion per year to U.S. farmers , while the European Union provides its farmers even more$43 billion a year . Even worse , the U.S. and its G7 partners ( all but Russia ) work actively in other venues such as the World Trade Organization to prevent developing countries from subsidizing their own industries , thus ensuring that Africas new industries will never take off . <p> No new money for HIV/AIDS . Again , the G8 leaders discussed AIDS prevention and treatment as well as the need to support the Global Fund for AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria ( known as the Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . Instead , they agreed to report on the Global Funds progress at next years G8 Summit in France . President Bush recently learned that HIV/AIDs can be transmitted from mothers to infants , and just before leaving for the G8 Summit , he announced that he would put $500 million into the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative . He said the program would reach one million women each year , reduce mother to infant transmission by forty percent , and improve health care delivery in Africa and the Caribbean . <p> What was not mentioned was that $200 million of the $500 million had already been approved by Congress in an unrelated emergency spending bill . The remaining $300 million would be spread out over three years and might even be taken from other development assistance programs . In addition , the Administration had tried to undermine bipartisan efforts in the Senate to allocate more than twice as much money to the Global ATM Fund . <p> IS THERE HOPE FOR AFRICA IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ? <p> The Bush Administration appears interested in Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill visited four countries in Africa with the rock singer Bono in May , and President Bush is planning a trip to Africa next year . On his visit , Secretary ONeill said he was struck by the devastating levels of poverty and HIV/AIDS , and the impact of the debt . He repeated these observations and commented on the need for meaningful debt relief in testimony that he delivered on June 27 to the House International Relations Committeethe same day that President Bush was discussing debt relief at the G8 Summit . Secretary ONeill said : <p> Debt relief is in many cases an absolute necessity for Africajust to square ourselves with reality . . . I think if were going to do the right thing , we must move in the directions that President Bush has suggested ; for example , by stopping the fiction of being party to making loans to countries that could never possibly pay them back . If you ca n't pay , the idea of debt is an absurdity on its face . In the corporate world , if you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write it off . <p> Unfortunately , Secretary ONeills words have not yet been translated into an effective response by the U.S. government . We now know that HIV/AIDs kills more than two million people in Africa every year , a figure that is projected to double in five years . By the year 2020 , more than twenty five percent of the work force may be lost to AIDS in severely affected countries ; already it has practically destroyed the managerial sector in many African countries . The growth rate in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen as much as four percent because of AIDS . If the Administration knows that the HIV/AIDS crisis is a matter of national security , why is it limiting its focus to preventing mother-to-infant transmission ? And why is it not taking more effective steps to eliminate the debt payments that African governments must make instead of using that scarce money to deal with their health and economic crises ? Absent a real response to the HIV/AIDS crisis , there is no hope for development in Africa . President Bush has called for more development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called for a Millennium Challenge Account to provide up to $10 billion by 2006 and an extra $5 billion a year thereafter to countries that " govern justly , invest in their own people and promote economic freedom . " And the Administration also negotiated with fellow donor nations to convert about one-fifth of the loans that the World Bank makes to poor countries to grants . These sound like steps in the right direction , but critical questions remain . Who will decide whether a country governs justly ? And based on what criteria ? Is " economic freedom " code language for market reforms that leave poor people with fewer opportunities ? On the face of it , it seems that the Administration is creating a special fund to reward developing countries that further the U.S.s economic agenda in the world . Finally , President Bush began his Administration with the clear intention of staying out of other countries affairs . September 11 and the current crisis in the Middle East have forced a change . But why does the Administration insist on interfering in the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to improve governance and eliminate corruption ? <p> The Administration clearly lacks the will , or possibly the ability , to tackle the difficult problems of debt , HIV/AIDS , and economic growth in Africa . But other policymakers are asking the critical questions . Consider the statement of Representative Tom Lantos ( D-CA ) also at the June 27 hearing of the House International Relations Committee : <p> It is simply utterly irrational to anticipate some of the poorest countries on the face of this planet , which are at present unable to provide clean water , minimal health care , minimal primary education to their tens of millions of children , to seriously contemplate repaying tens of billions of dollars in debt . <p> This statement is a welcome reminder that some lawmakers are concerned about the worlds poor . <p> Barbara Kohnen served as Director of the Rethinking Bretton Woods Project at the Center of Concern.Reprinted from the Center of Concerns quarterly newsletter , CENTER FOCUS , Issue # 157 , September 2002 .

@@75400379 @4100379/ <p> ( August 8 , 2004 ) In 1986 , The Lesotho Highlands Water Project ( LHWP ) was set up between the governments of Lesotho and South Africa as a multi-billion rand infrastructure project designed to control the flow of the Senqu/Orange river and in doing so provide water for the people of Gauteng province , and electricity and money for the people of Lesotho . <p> Corruption concerns first surfaced in 1993 when a civil government was elected in Lesotho . The government commissioned an audit of both of the parastatal bodies which shared responsibility for the project . The audit revealed obvious and substantial administrative irregularities within the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority ( LHDA ) . After an audit of its chief executive officer , Masupha Ephraim Sole , Sole was then subjected to a disciplinary enquiry , and subsequently he was dismissed . <p> The investigations had revealed that Sole was clearly living far beyond his means : his housing , cars , holiday arrangements , and instances of nepotism were the obvious indicators . Civil proceedings were instituted to recoup the funds which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produced evidence of bank accounts that included accounts with the Union Bank of Switzerland . <p> In August , 1997 , the Lesotho government applied to the Swiss court for disclosure of a number of Swiss bank accounts , including those belonging to Sole . The application was resisted by a number of the contractors/consultants working on the LHWP , but in early 1999 , bank records were handed over . Those which belonged to Sole indicated that he had received millions of maloti for which he offered no explanation . Civil proceedings concluded in October , 1999 , with judgment given against Sole for the sum of 8.9 million maloti . His appeal , in April , 2001 , failed . <p> The bank records obtained from Switzerland indicated that throughout the lifetime of the project , Sole , using middlemen or intermediaries , had indirectly received vast sums of money from certain companies and consortia who had been awarded contracts in the project . The patterns , size , and timing of the payments gave rise to the notion that bribery had taken place on a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sole as well as many of the corporations and members of consortia who had made secret payments into various Swiss bank accounts , together with the intermediaries who acted as conduits . In December , 1999 , 19 defendants were charged with bribery . Sole also faced charges of fraud and perjury . Seven of the defendants failed to attend this initial hearing . <p> By February , 2001 , the landscape had altered substantially . The court had ruled that the defendants should not be tried together , and a long program of trials of individual defendants began with that of Masupha Ephraim Sole , on June 11 , 2001 . He was charged with 16 counts of bribery and two counts of fraud . During his trial , Sole chose not to give evidence . Evidence which had been gathered for the civil proceedings was now used to show that he had lied repeatedly in denying the existence of any accounts in Zurich . Such accounts existed , and showed a complex pattern of payments which had been made indirectly to him by a very large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a comprehensive judgment , finding Sole guilty as charged , Acting Judge Cullinan , a former Chief Justice of Lesotho , observed that the patterns of payments which had emerged during the trial had arisen from transactions which inextricably bound together the defendant consultants/contractors , the intermediaries , and Sole himself . Sole was subsequently imprisoned for 18 years , reduced on appeal to 15 years . <p> The trial of Acres International , the Canadian engineering company , now followed . Prior to the criminal proceedings , the World Bank had begun debarment proceedings against Acres and Lahmeyer , a German engineering consulting firm , both of which had received funding from the Bank for the contracts . It is worth noting that the evidence of secret payments into numbered Swiss accounts was not deemed to amount to sufficient grounds for the debarment of the companies at that stage . Acres continued to apply for , and receive , funding for projects from the Bank . However , the Bank reserved its position , saying that it would reopen debarment proceedings if new evidence against Acres were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged that Acres had made payments to Sole through the offices of Zaliswonga Bam , one of three intermediaries originally identified . Bam had died of a heart attack in 1999 . Although he was , at the relevant time , working for a housing association in Botswana , Bam and his wife had numbered Swiss bank accounts into which money was put by Acres amongst others and a proportion of which was then placed in one of Sole 's many accounts . <p> Acres had to accept that it had made payments to Bam ; the company argued that such payments were customary practice , and had been made pursuant to the representation agreement it had made with Bam for services rendered by him to the company in his capacity as its agent or representative . With little evidence to substantiate their case , Acres argued that Bam had performed such services , that payment of such sums of money was commonplace in such circumstances , that nothing adverse should be inferred from the fact that the payments were made in such secrecy , and that in any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making payments to Sole . <p> The company comprehensively failed to convince the judge of the virtue of these arguments . In a colourful and literary judgment , Judge Lehohla concluded that in the light of the established relationship between Acres and the LHDA , Acres personnel were so embedded in the LHDA that there was simply no need for a representative. Bam 's representative status with Acres was not public knowledge , neither was it generally known that Bam was on the payroll of other companies working on the LHWP . The judge could see no evidence to show what services Bam performed , nor why he performed them , particularly in light of the work he was doing at the material time . The judge concluded that the representation agreement was a sham , that Acres had benefited from bribing Sole , to the detriment of its competitors , and that the company was therefore guilty as charged . <p> Acres was convicted , and sentenced to a fine of CAD3.8M . The company refused to accept the ruling of the court , suggesting that the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial had been unfair , and that this error would be corrected in the Appeal Court . Acres then lost its appeal . At the time of writing , the company , pleading poverty , has paid a little under half of the fine which was imposed upon it by the Court of Appeals . <p> After the appeal hearing , debarment proceedings were recommenced by the World Bank and in August , 2004 the Sanctions Committee debarred Acres from applying to the Bank for financial support for a period of three years . Shortly before the Sanctions Committee gave its ruling , the company was bought by a larger corporation , Hatch . The implications for Hatch 's dealings with the World Bank remain unknown . <p> A trial against Lahmeyer followed the same pattern as the Acres ' proceedings , as did the appeal ; and it is anticipated that a similar pattern of events will flow in the debarment proceedings with the World Bank , although one can not predict the view of the Sanctions Committee . Proceedings have now been instituted against Impregilo , an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 . Evidence is now being gathered against others . <p> Conclusions <p> Whilst these trials have earned Lesotho a unique place in legal history , it has been an expensive business . At an international level , many have expressed their admiration for the determination which the Attorney General has shown in proceeding with these difficult cases , and for the tenacity of purpose in the prosecutors , without whose sustained efforts the trials would simply not have been possible . No financial support for these trials has been forthcoming from outside the country . Many institutions and governments promised financial support at the outset of the trials , but none has yet been forthcoming . A conclusion drawn by some in Lesotho is that institutional support for a prosecution may be lacking from a country where the defendant company is registered , and where there may be a corresponding conflict of political interest . <p> Many of the legal aspects of corruption have now been thoroughly and recently tested in the Lesotho courts . In particular , there is now clear , developed common law jurisprudence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and citation ( with regards whether a company has a legal personality ) . In addition , the definition of bribery has been further refined to ensure that equal resonance accrues to the two parts of the offense - netting both the bribee and the briber . <p> From the perspective of the international community , these trials pose challenges to Parties to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery about the ways in which corruption is detected and punished in different parts of the world . Canadian lawyers have expressed doubt as to whether Acres would have been prosecuted in Canada . The high moral tone taken throughout by Acres , which has , throughout , been disinclined publicly to express remorse for its actions , might have deterred a decision to prosecute . Lahmeyer could not be prosecuted under the provisions of German criminal law in any event , since corporate offenses are dealt with under administrative law only , punishable by means of fines . <p> With regards to the international financial institutions , Judge Steyn gave the clearest indication of the Court 's view of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will revisit its practices and procedures in general , but for present purposes , more particularly the practice of the employment of representatives who can play the obfuscating role played so frequently in this mammoth project . But also , that it will be firm and resolute in enforcing its disciplinary proceedings on any agency , company , individual or institution who participates in the practice of bribing those employed on development projects. <p> In terms of the Acres debarment , the company has been debarred for three years . The period of debarment is shorter than it might have been , because the Sanctions Committee took into account the fine that had already been imposed by the Lesotho courts , and the fact that those who had been responsible for the bribery no longer worked for the company . The Bank has conducted its own inquiry into corporate corruption in Lesotho : its procedures are not vulnerable to judicial scrutiny . However , the trials in Lesotho have been subject to such scrutiny at every turn ; they have effectively provided the World Bank with the materials used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank to debar Acres has been heralded as a clear indication from the Bank that it means business , in excising corruption from its lending practices .

People at lower levels of government can plunder resources too , by not providing services which they are paid to provide , by charging for services which they should provide , or by taking goods , such as medical supplies or automobiles/trucks , which should be used for government service . <p> Corruption .

@@75400385 @4100385/ <p> Attacking Poverty , the World Bank 's 2000/2001 World Development Report ( WDR ) was released in September , 2000 . The WDR illustrates that poverty remains a global problem , with 1.2 billion people in the world living on less than $1 a day , and 2.8 billion living on less than $2 a day . To reduce poverty , the WDR promotes a three-part framework of promoting opportunity , facilitating empowerment and enhancing security for those who are poor . <p> The World Bank has produced its WDR annually since 1978 . Along with providing selected world development indicators , each release addresses at least one topic in the development field , such as education or health . Poverty has been addressed by the WDR at the beginning of each decade , in 1980 , 1990 and now 2000/2001 . The 2000/2001 Report was the first in which the team director resigned in protest months before the release . In June , 2000 , team director Ravi Kanbur resigned citing personal reservations regarding the emphasis of the main messages of the Report . <p> Research for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning with discussions with more than 60,000 poor women and men in 60 countries , in order to understand poverty from the perspective of the poor themselves . In 1999 , a three-month electronic discussion took place regarding the main themes of the WDR . In January , 2000 , a consultation draft was posted on the World Bank 's web site , and a month-long public electronic discussion of the draft followed . <p> Poverty , as addressed in the WDR 2000/2001 , has four dimensions . These dimensions are : 1 ) income , 2 ) health and education , 3 ) vulnerability , and 4 ) powerlessness of those without a voice . The WDR 's poverty reduction strategy addresses these four aspects of being poor in a three-part framework , which includes : Opportunity , Empowerment and Security . <p> The first pillar of the poverty reduction framework , " Opportunity , " has two main categories : 1 ) " Making Markets Work Better for Poor People , " and 2 ) " Expanding Poor People 's Assets and Tackling Inequalities . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report acknowledges that market-oriented reforms influence different groups in different ways , and that in order to help the poor the following three areas must be addressed . These three areas are as follows : 1 ) to lighten the regulatory burden , especially for small businesses , 2 ) to promote core labor standards , such as elimination of forced labor and child labor , and 3 ) to improve access to financial markets for poor people so they can benefit from credit , savings and insurance services . In " Expanding Poor People 's Assets and Tackling Inequalities , " assets include human , physical , natural , financial and social assets that can enable the poor to advance economically and socially . The WDR proposes three guiding principles for building up assets and tackling inequalities . These principles are as follows : 1 ) to use the power of the state to redistribute resources , especially education , health and infrastructure , 2 ) to implement policy and institutional reforms to ensure effective delivery of services , and 3 ) to engage poor households and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second pillar , " Empowerment , " addresses the voicelessness and powerlessness of the poor . Empowerment involves 1 ) Making State Institutions More Responsive to Poor People , and 2 ) Removing Social Barriers and Building Social Institutions . The report calls on state institutions to include the poor and consider their interests in political processes , to change laws and make legal proceedings more responsive to the poor , to support legal service organizations for the poor , and to decentralize and move programs closer to the users . The report recognizes the importance of social structures and networks and calls for the removal of social barriers and the building of social institutions of and for the poor . Discrimination based on gender , ethnicity , race , religion or social status is identified as a major barrier to moving out of poverty , and must be removed . In addition , the social institutions of the poor such as local organizations , networks , and kinship systems must be supported to help the poor build their social capital and increase their participation in political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security , " encompasses : 1 ) Helping Poor People Manage Risk , and 2 ) Managing Economic Crises and National Disasters . As a result of the World Banks consultations with the poor , the report acknowledges that part of being poor is not being able to prepare for tragedies . Helping Poor People Manage Risk involves policies that reduce risk and safety net programs that can lessen the impact of shocks so the poor can continue to move out of poverty instead of being hopelessly set back . Seven instruments of protection are discussed . These seven instruments are : 1 ) health insurance , 2 ) old age assistance and pensions , 3 ) unemployment insurance and assistance , 4 ) workfare programs , 5 ) social funds , 6 ) microfinance programs , and 7 ) cash transfers . The second aspect to Security , Managing Economic Crises and Natural Disasters , considers approaches to the link between macroeconomic downturns and rising poverty . To address the vulnerability of the poor to economic crises and natural disasters , the report advocates a two-part approach : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor when events do occur . <p> Most importantly , the WDR 2000/2001 emphasizes that the three pillars of Opportunity , Empowerment and Security do not form a rigid prescription for poverty reduction , but a flexible framework that should be adapted to the needs of particular regions , countries , communities , households or groups . A closer look at poverty data reveals variations in the occurrence of poverty . For example , while global levels of poverty have remained about the same over the past decade , East Asia saw a decrease in poverty while all other regions experienced an increase . Similarly , within regions , some African countries experienced a decrease in poverty even though the region as a whole unfortunately saw an increase . Within the country of Mexico , poverty fell by two-thirds in Mexico City between 1989 and 1994 but rose by 10 percent in the Southeast . In Sub-Saharan Africa , life expectancy for men has improved much faster than that for women , and in Europe and Central Asia , the ratio of female to male life expectancy rose only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of poverty , the WDR argues , illustrate the need for carefully tailored approaches to poverty reduction , formed within a comprehensive framework . <p> Diane E.

" Only through an information campaign can the population receive the necessary information it needs about the dangers of trafficking , " the IOM official said , noting a mechanism of reintegration and assistance for the victims of trafficking needed to be developed-- including psychological rehabilitation . <p> In an effort to raise such awareness , Internews , an international non-profit group supporting open media worldwide , has been working closely with the IOM training media professionals on how to produce social advertisements for radio and TV spots . " These spots are now broadcast regularly by 14 independent TV stations in Tajikistan , and also by three independent radio stations , " Franz Wennberg , country director for the NGO told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included phone numbers to hot lines where additional information could be sought . <p> " One of the problems for many Tajiks is how little they are informed about what awaits them in Russia the primary destination for Tajik labor migrants , and also about their legal rights and obligations , " Wennberg explained . " This lack of knowledge obviously makes it easier for corrupt state officials and criminal structures to harass and exploit Tajik labour migrants , " he added , noting the information campaigns by Internews and the IOM were working to mitigate that . <p> But despite the challenge , over the past three years Tajikistan has made strong inroads in combating the global problem , Mamadjanova maintained . The impoverished former Soviet republic was the first country among the CIS ( Commonwealth of Independent States ) countries to sign the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two additional protocols and ratified on May 29 , 2002 . Subsequently , Tajikistan prepared draft legislation on the trafficking in persons which was now in its last stage of consideration . <p> According to one IOM report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year worldwide . CIS countries are becoming the most important geographical source of trafficking in women in Asia , with the Central Asian states of Tajikistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan being no exception . <p> Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , economic hardship and widespread unemployment made the desire to emigrate abroad even stronger , providing a more conducive environment for traffickers to recruit , cheat , abuse and exploit their victims . <p> IRIN is the acronym for the Integrated Regional Information Networks of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .

WHES has been in existence for 33 years informing people about world hunger and poverty issues . WHES has not received funding from the United States Government in any of the past three years . We would like to thank this committee for its long record of permitting public testimony . Foreign policy is too important to be left to the foreign policy apparatus . <p> In this testimony , we are principally criticizing the current United States security/foreign policy approach . In addition we make observations about funding . <p> We have no problem with the United States government having as a principal focus protecting the United States from possible foreign threats including military measures . However , the United States has embarked on a course which <p> overemphasizes its own security <p> has a concept of its own security which is in fact narrowly conceived , and which vastly overemphasizes a military response to that security . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discretionary U.S. budget ( basically one that does not include Medicare and Medicaid ) <p> Thus 64 percent of the U.S. budget is used for U.S. security . This is appalling . <p> We note in passing that this ( what we believe to be ) overemphasis on security has had important consequences for the American people in addition to the one we discuss more fully below , including inaction on vital economic security issues facing large numbers of U.S. citizens . <p> These economic security issues include : <p> 36.5 million Americans roughly one in eight live in poverty . Todays poverty rate is higher than it was during the last recession . <p> Some 12.6 million households , containing 35.5 million people , lacked access to adequate food at some point during the year because they did n't  have enough money for groceries . <p> 16 million low-income households either paid more for rent and utilities than the federal government says is affordable or lived in overcrowded or substandard housing . <p> 47 million Americans more than one in every seven did not have medical insurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us turn to the security budget . <p> The major criticism we have is just this . The security budget is almost entirely defined as protecting us against enemies . This should be done . But security is much more than that . It is understanding people and helping them ( or permitting ourselves to be helped , if we need help ) . The major way in which security has happened in history is not that enemies have been conquered , but that people have agreed not to fight and to live in peace . The foreign policy apparatus of the United States , including this committee , needs to focus its policy much more on understanding others and helping them . One quote from the Bible illustrates the needed direction . ( A similar message of understanding and helping others , especially those in need , is a key element of other major religions . ) <p> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus . " Teacher , " he asked , " what must I do to inherit eternal life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied . <p> " How do you read and with all your mind ' ; and , ' Love your neighbor as yourself . ' " " You have answered correctly , " Jesus replied . " Do this and you will live . " But he wanted to justify himself , so he asked Jesus , " And who is my neighbor ? " <p> In reply Jesus said : " A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , when he fell into the hands of robbers . They stripped him of his clothes , beat him and went away , leaving him half dead . A priest happened to be going down the same road , and when he saw the man , he passed by on the other a Samaritan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he saw him , he took pity on him . He went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . Then he put the man on his own donkey , took him to an inn in Jericho and took care of him . The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper . ' Look after him , ' he said , ' and when I return , I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have . ' <p> " Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers ? " <p> The expert in the law replied , " The one who had mercy on him . " Jesus told him , " Go and do likewise . " ( Gospel of Luke , chapter 10 verses 25-37 . ) <p> What mercy has the U.S. government--our government-- had ? We have the capability to ' project force ' everywhere , and do so when our government feels it is necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Iraq , our sea power roams the seas of the globe , we are setting up a new military command in Africa , we have bombed villages in Somalia in order to try to kill suspected terrorists who may have been in the villages , we have been willing to finance wars in many countries including Nicaragua and El Salvador .... Our security force is very large but where is our mercy ? To discuss this , we now turn to the function 150 account . <p> The function 150 account is part of the security budget , and it does include security of others items . Running down the list of State Department and other international programs2 , we estimate that of the total of $25.896 billion outlays in 2007 falling under Foreign Operations , $14.107 billion or approximately 55 percent could be counted as security of others expenditure. 3 ( For the State Department table that was used for this estimate see either the citation or Hunger Notes pdf of the relevant table . ) So using this approximate measure for the security of others expenditure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total U.S. security expenditure equals $14 billion divided by the total U.S. security budget of $682 billion . Thus expenditure on the security of others is approximately 2 percent of the U.S. security budget . This is far from sufficient.Both the overemphasis on our own security , especially the military emphasis , and our minimal concern for the welfare of others , is a fundamental problem in our relations with the developing world . <p> Two areas where much more should be done : assisting developing country agriculture and reducing malnutrition among pregnant women and the very young . <p> Agriculture <p> Agricultures share of Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) declined sharply from 1985-86 to 2005-06 , from over 12 to just 3.1 percent . 4 In absolute terms , support for agriculture went from a high of about $8 billion in 1984 to $3.4 billion in 2004. 5 Although donors have declared that they wanted to increase their support for agriculture and rural development , these declarations have not resulted in actual funding increases for agriculture , as Figure 1 below shows. 6 <p> This is certainly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earmarks from both the administration and Congress has tended to squeeze out funding for agriculture. 7 WHES supports substantially increased funding for agriculture , including support for the International Fund for Agricultural Developments new replenishment . <p> Child malnutrition <p> This subcommittee has been a long-term supporter of Child Survival efforts . We commend the subcommittee for its concern . We would like to call attention to a key issue : malnutrition is still the largely preventable cause of 2.2 millionapproximately 25 percentof all child deaths . We believe that this key issue needs to be addressed . <p> In summary : We believe that the United States does not focus sufficiently on the security of others , especially ordinary people , using avenues of cooperation opened up by this approach to achieve a greater level of security for all .

Malnutrition rates have reached alarming levels in some areas.In Eritrea , poor rainfall since October , 2001 has meant that cereal planting was delayed and was not as extensive as usual . Recent estimates indicate an almost complete loss in the country 's cereal harvest . <p> " We are facing a serious humanitarian catastrophe . At least ten million people will need food aid just in Ethiopia . But if this month 's rains stop early , up to 14 million people there will require urgent assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris . " In Eritrea , the total number of people affected by this drought is estimated at over 2 million , or about 60 percent of the entire population , " he said . " These figures are large and dramatic and the international community should take notice . If donors respond quickly , we can help avoid an immense human tragedy there , " said Mr. Morris . " Unless we come to grips with this problem very soon , we face the real possibility of witnessing a devastating wave of human suffering and death as early as next year . " <p> In southern Africa , drought is also the prime cause of hunger that is now threatening an estimated 14.4 million people . On the other side of the African continent , lack of rain is already causing serious hardship and is spreading in five Western Sahelian countries , affecting up to 1.5 million people . <p> Most of these crises are related to erratic weather patterns . The statistics point to an alarming trend . According to the World Disasters Report : 2002 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather-related disasters reported over the decade . " This has meant that millions of people , who were already vulnerable , have had to contend with the destructive power of major natural disasters and it has fallen to the humanitarian community to assist them . <p> In Central America , over 1.5 million people have seen their food supplies wither because of drought . In Afghanistan , four years of drought and decades of conflict are still wreaking havoc on the lives of almost 10 million people . <p> North Korea continues to experience acute food shortages . Insufficient funding of WFP operations there has led to the suspension of food aid rations for three million hungry women , children and elderly people-- with 1.5 million more people likely to be cut off in January . <p> Mieso , West Hararghe - Sani Yuya 's two-year-old son , Ahmed , is malnourished .

Across Ethiopia , the drought could result in 10 to 14 million people needing food aid in 2003 , depending on October 's rainfall . <p> In this context , WFP is calling for the international community to rethink the way it responds to the world 's growing food emergencies . According to Morris , " While modern society is not prepared to tolerate the face of mass hunger , agencies like WFP , as well as hundreds of highly effective NGOs , are finding it increasingly difficult to find the resources to respond adequately to the growing number of emergencies . " <p> " Dependent on voluntary contributions , WFP and NGOs are caught between the rising needs of millions of hungry people and government budgets that are already stretched and contending with a global economic slowdown , " he said .

They would survive if their bodies and immune systems had not been weakened by hunger and malnutrition . <p> Hunger and malnutrition are among the root causes of poverty , illiteracy , disease and mortality of millions of people in developing countries , the report said . <p> The FAO hunger report focuses on the critical importance of hunger reduction , which is the explicit target of the 1996 World Food Summit ( WFS ) and of the first Millennium Development Goal ( MDG 1 ) calling for the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger . The report stresses that hunger reduction is also essential for meeting all other MDGs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in developing countries by half by 2015 has been very slow and the international community is far from reaching its hunger reduction targets and commitments set by the MDGs and the WFS , " wrote FAO Director-General Dr Jacques Diouf in the foreword to the report . <p> " If each of the developing regions continues to reduce hunger at the current pace , only South America and the Caribbean will reach the Millennium Development Goal target of cutting the proportion of hungry people by half . None will reach the more ambitious World Food Summit goal of halving the number of hungry people , " Diouf said . <p> The Asia-Pacific region also has a good chance of reaching the MDG target if it can accelerate progress slightly over the next few years . In the Near East and North Africa , the prevalence of hunger is low , but it is increasing . <p> In sub-Saharan Africa , the prevalence of undernourishment , FAO 's measure of hunger , has been decreasing very slowly .

This figure includes 815 million in developing countries , 28 million in the countries in transition and 9 million in the industrialized countries . The new hunger report does not provide a new update on the number of hungry people ; new estimates will be provided in next year 's edition . <p> Eliminating hunger to achieve the MDGs <p> Around 75 percent of the world 's hungry and poor people live in rural areas in poor countries . These regions are home to the vast majority of the nearly 11 million children who die before reaching the age of five , including 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during pregnancy and childbirth ; of the 300 million cases of acute malaria and more than one million malaria deaths each year ; and of the 121 million children who do not attend school . <p> Providing children with adequate food is crucial for breaking the poverty and hunger cycle and for meeting the MDGs . Reducing the prevalence of child underweight by only five percentage points , on average , could save the lives of 30% of children between one and five . This is based on a study of 59 developing countries . In some of the worst affected countries , the prevalence of underweight children under-five goes up to 45 percent . <p> " Reducing hunger should become the driving force for progress and hope , as improved nutrition fuels better health , increases school attendance , reduces child and maternal mortality , empowers women , and lowers the incidence and mortality rates of HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " Dr Diouf wrote . <p> Ideal and reality <p> Economic growth , investment in agriculture , good governance , political stability , internal peace , rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education for children in rural areas and improving the situation of women are all essential for increasing agricultural production and reducing hunger and poverty in rural areas , the report said . <p> However , many countries are unable to meet these essentials . When governments can not preserve internal peace , violent conflict disrupts agricultural production and access to food . In Africa , per capita food production dropped by an average of around 12.5 percent during times of conflict . <p> Rural infrastructure tends to be least developed in countries and regions with the highest levels of hunger . Road density in Africa in the early 1990s , for example , was less than one-sixth the density in India at the time of independence in 1950 . Studies in China and India have identified building roads as the single most effective public goods investment in terms of poverty reduction . Evidence suggests that it has a similar impact on reducing hunger . <p> Millions of children do not have the chance to obtain a basic education . Poor health and stunting caused by malnutrition often prevent or delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 3.5 years of school in sub-Saharan Africa and only 4.5 years in South Asia . These are also the two sub-regions where hunger is most prevalent . In addition , low birth weight , protein-energy malnutrition , anaemia and iodine deficiency reduce children 's ability to learn . <p> Inequalities between women and men prevent women from improving their families ' livelihoods . Research confirms that educated women have healthier families . Their children are better nourished , less likely to die in infancy and more likely to attend school . Giving women better access to land and credit and promoting gender equality could do more to reduce hunger and malnutrition than any of the other MDGs , the report stressed . <p> HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis kill more than six million people each year . Most of the cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia , the regions with the highest rates of undernourishment and extreme poverty . The hungry and poor are hit the hardest . Millions of families are pushed deeper into hunger and poverty by the illness and death of breadwinners and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support for orphans . <p> HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are all diseases that are greatly exacerbated by hunger and poverty . Halting and reversing the spread of these diseases would save millions of lives and tens of billions of dollars . <p> To achieve agreed development goals and targets , the FAO hunger report calls for a twin-track approach consisting of national and international investments in strengthening productivity and incomes , including through investment in small-scale irrigation , infrastructure ( roads , water etc. ) , the promotion of fisheries and agro-forestry , while also providing direct access to food through social safety nets for the poor , feeding programmes for mothers and infants , school meals and school gardens , food-for-work and food-for-education programmes .

Mr. President , First Lady , King Abdullah , Other heads of State , Members of Congress , distinguished guests Please join me in praying that I do n't  say something well all regret . That was for the FCC . If you 're wondering what I 'm doing here , at a prayer breakfast , well , so am I. Im certainly not here as a man of the cloth , unless that cloth is leather . Its certainly not because I 'm a rock star . Which leaves one possible explanation : I 'm here because I 've got a messianic complex . Yes , its true . And for anyone who knows me , its hardly a revelation . Well , I 'm the first to admit that there 's something unnatural something unseemly about rock stars mounting the pulpit and preaching at presidents , and then disappearing to their villas in the South of France . Talk about a fish out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up at a U2 concert but this is really weird , is n't it ? You know , one of the things I love about this country is its separation of church and state . Although I have to say : in inviting me here , both church and state have been separated from something else completely : their mind . . Mr. President , are you sure about this ? Its very humbling and I will try to keep my homily brief . But be warned " I 'm Irish . I 'd like to talk about the laws of man , here in this city where those laws are written . And I 'd like to talk about higher laws . It would be great to assume that the one serves the other ; that the laws of man serve these higher laws but of course , they do n't  always . And I presume that , in a sense , is why youre here . I presume the reason for this gathering is that all of us here " Muslims , Jews , Christians " all are searching our souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our nation , our God . I know I am . Searching , I mean . And that , I suppose , is what led me here , too . Yes , its odd , having a rock star here " but maybe its odder for me than for you . You see , I avoided religious people most of my life . Maybe it had something to do with having a father who was Protestant and a mother who was Catholic in a country where the line between the two was , quite literally , a battle line . Where the line between church and state was well , a little blurry , and hard to see . I remember how my mother would bring us to chapel on Sundays and my father used to wait outside . One of the things that I picked up from my father and my mother was the sense that religion often gets in the way of God . For me , at least , it got in the way . Seeing what religious people , in the name of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Gods second-hand car salesmen on the cable TV channels , offering indulgences for cash in fact , all over the world , seeing the self-righteousness roll down like a mighty stream from certain corners of the religious establishment I must confess , I changed the channel . I wanted my MTV . Even though I was a believer . Perhaps because I was a believer . I was cynical not about God , but about Gods politics . ( There you are , Jim . ) Then , in 1997 , a couple of eccentric , septuagenarian British Christians went and ruined my shtick " my reproachfulness . They did it by describing the Millennium , the year 2000 , as a Jubilee year , as an opportunity to cancel the chronic debts of the worlds poorest people . They had the audacity to renew the Lords call " and were joined by Pope John Paul II , who , from an Irish half-Catholics point of view , may have had a more direct line to the Almighty . Jubilee " why Jubilee ? What was this year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always read the Scriptures , even the obscure stuff . There it was in Leviticus ( 25:35 ) If your brother becomes poor , the Scriptures say , and can not maintain himself you shall maintain him You shall not lend him your money at interest , not give him your food for profit. It is such an important idea , Jubilee , that Jesus begins his ministry with this . Jesus is a young man , he s met with the rabbis , impressed everyone , people are talking . The elders say , he s a clever guy , this Jesus , but he has n't  done much yet . He has n't  spoken in public before When he does , is first words are from Isaiah : The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , he says , because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. And Jesus proclaims the year of the Lords favour , the year of Jubilee . ( Luke 4:18 ) What he was really talking about was an era of grace " and were still in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , was made incarnate " in a movement of all kinds of people . It was n't a bless-me club it was n't a holy huddle . These religious guys were willing to get out in the streets , get their boots dirty , wave the placards , follow their convictions with actions making it really hard for people like me to keep their distance . It was amazing . I almost started to like these church people . But then my cynicism got another helping hand . It was what Colin Powell , a five-star general , called the greatest W.M.D. of them all : a tiny little virus called A.I.D.S. And the religious community , in large part , missed it . The ones that did n't  miss it could only see it as divine retribution for bad behaviour . Even on children Even fastest growing group of HIV infections were married , faithful women . Aha , there they go again ! I thought to myself Judgmentalism is back ! But in truth , I was wrong again . The church was slow but the church got busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the move . Mercy was on the move . God was on the move . Moving people of all kinds to work with others they had never met , never would have cared to meet Conservative church groups hanging out with spokesmen for the gay community , all singing off the same hymn sheet on AIDS Soccer moms and quarterbacks hip-hop stars and country stars This is what happens when God gets on the move : crazy stuff happens ! Popes were seen wearing sunglasses ! Jesse Helms was seen with a ghetto blaster ! Crazy stuff . Evidence of the spirit . It was breathtaking . Literally . It stopped the world in its tracks . When churches started demonstrating on debt , governments listened " and acted . When churches starting organising , petitioning , and even " that most unholy of acts today , God forbid , lobbying on AIDS and global health , governments listened " and acted . I 'm here today in all humility to say : you changed minds ; you changed policy ; you changed the world . Look , whatever thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He exists , most will agree that if there is a God , He has a special place for the poor . In fact , the poor are where God lives . Check Judaism . Check Islam . Check pretty much anyone . I mean , God may well be with us in our mansions on the hill I hope so . He may well be with us as in all manner of controversial stuff maybe , maybe not But the one thing we can all agree , all faiths and ideologies , is that God is with the vulnerable and poor . God is in the slums , in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives , and God is with us if we are with them . " If you remove the yolk from your midst , the pointing of the finger and speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfy the desire of the afflicted , then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom with become like midday and the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places " Its not a coincidence that in the Scriptures , poverty is mentioned more than 2,100 times . Its not an accident . That 's a lot of air time , 2,100 mentions . You know , the only time Christ is judgmental is on the subject of the poor . As you have done it unto the least of these my brethren , you have done it unto me. ( Matthew 25:40 ) . As I say , good news to the poor . here 's some good news for the President . After 9-11 we were told America would have no time for the Worlds poor . America would be taken up with its own problems of safety . And its true these are dangerous times , but America has not drawn the blinds and double-locked the doors . In fact , you have doubled aid to Africa . You have tripled funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS relief and support for the Global Fund " you and Congress " have put 700,000 people onto life-saving anti-retroviral drugs and provided 8 million bed nets to protect children from malaria . Outstanding human achievements . Counterintuitive . Historic . Be very , very proud . But here 's the bad news . From charity to justice , the good news is yet to come . There 's is much more to do . There 's a gigantic chasm between the scale of the emergency and the scale of the response . And finally , its not about charity after all , is it ? Its about justice . Let me repeat that : Its not about charity , its about justice . And that 's too bad . Because you 're good at charity . Americans , like the Irish , are good at it . We like to give , and we give a lot , even those who ca n't afford it . But justice is a higher standard . Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice ; it makes a farce of our idea of equality . It mocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our commitment . 6,500 Africans are still dying every day of a preventable , treatable disease , for lack of drugs we can buy at any drugstore . This is not about charity , this is about Justice and Equality . Because there 's no way we can look at what 's happening in Africa and , if were honest , conclude that deep down , we really accept that Africans are equal to us . Anywhere else in the world , we would n't accept it . Look at what happened in South East Asia with the Tsunami. 150 , 000 lives lost to that misnomer of all misnomers , " mother nature " . In Africa , 150,000 lives are lost every month . A tsunami every month . And its a completely avoidable catastrophe . Its annoying but justice and equality are mates . Are n't  they ? Justice always wants to hang out with equality . And equality is a real pain . You know , think of those Jewish sheep-herders going to meet the Pharaoh , mud on their shoes , and the Pharaoh says , " Equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal ? And they say , " Yeah , equal , that 's what it says here in this book . Were all made in the image of God . " And eventually the Pharaoh says , " OK , I can accept that . I can accept the Jews " but not the blacks . " " Not the women . Not the gays . Not the Irish . No way , man . " So on we go with our journey of equality . On we go in the pursuit of justice . We hear that call in the ONE Campaign , a growing movement of more than two million Americans left and right together united in the belief that where you live should no longer determine whether you live . We hear that call even more powerfully today , as we mourn the loss of Coretta Scott King " mother of a movement for equality , one that changed the world but is only just getting started . These issues are as alive as they ever were ; they just change shape and cross the seas . Preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sing the virtues of the free market that 's a justice issue . Holding children to ransom for the debts of their grandparents That 's a justice issue . Withholding life-saving medicines out of deference to the Office of Patents that 's a justice issue . And while the law is what we say it is , God is not silent on the subject . That 's why I say there 's the law of the land and then there is a higher standard . There 's the law of the land , and we can hire experts to write them so they benefit us , so the laws say its OK to protect our agriculture but its not OK for African farmers to do the same , to earn a living ? As the laws of man are written , that 's what they say . God will not accept that . Mine wont , at least . Will yours ? pause I close this morning on very thin ice . This is a dangerous idea I 've put on the table : my God vs. your God , their God vs. our God vs. no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see religion as a force for division rather than unity . And this is a town " Washington " that knows something of division . But the reason I am here , and the reason I keep coming back to Washington , is because this is a town that is proving it can come together on behalf of what the Scriptures call the least of these . This is not a Republican idea . It is not a Democratic idea . It is not even , with all due respect , an American idea . Nor it is unique to any one faith . Do to others as you would have them do to you. ( Luke 6:30 ) Jesus says that . Righteousness is this : that one should give away wealth out of love for Him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for the emancipation of the captives. The Koran says that . ( 2.177 ) Thus sayeth the Lord : Bring the homeless poor into the house , when you see the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the dawn and your recovery will speedily spring fourth , then your Lord will be your rear guard. The jewish scripture says that . Isaiah 58 again . That is a powerful incentive : The Lord will watch your back. Sounds like a good deal to me , right now . A number of years ago , I met a wise man who changed my life . In countless ways , large and small , I was always seeking the Lords blessing . I was saying , you know , I have a new song , look after it I have a family , please look after them I have this crazy idea And this wise man said : stop . He said , stop asking God to bless what you 're doing . Get involved in what God is doing " because its already blessed . Well , God , as I said , is with the poor . That , I believe , is what God is doing . And that is what He s calling us to do . I was amazed when I first got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up to ten percent of the family budget . Well , how does that compare the federal budget , the budget for the entire American family ? How much of that goes to the poorest people in the world ? Less than one percent . Mr. President , Congress , people of faith , people of America : I want to suggest to you today that you see the flow of effective foreign assistance as tithing . Which , to be truly meaningful , will mean an additional one percent of the federal budget tithed to the poor . What is one percent ? One percent is not merely a number on a balance sheet . One percent is the girl in Africa who gets to go to school , thanks to you . One percent is the AIDS patient who gets her medicine , thanks to you . One percent is the African entrepreneur who can start a small family business thanks to you . One percent is not redecorating presidential palaces or money flowing down a rat hole . This one percent is digging waterholes to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , not paternalism towards Africa , where increased assistance flows toward improved governance and initiatives with proven track records and away from boondoggles and white elephants of every description . America gives less than one percent now . Were asking for an extra one percent to change the world . to transform millions of lives " but not just that and I say this to the military men now " to transform the way that they see us . One percent is national security , enlightened economic self interest , and a better safer world rolled into one . Sounds to me that in this town of deals and compromises , one percent is the best bargain around . These goals " clean water for all ; school for every child ; medicine for the afflicted , an end to extreme and senseless poverty " these are not just any goals ; they are the Millennium Development goals , which this country supports . And they are more than that . They are the Beatitudes for a Globalised World . Now , I 'm very lucky . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly do n't  have to sit where you do , Mr. President . I do n't  have to make the tough choices . But I can tell you this : To give one percent more is right . Its smart . And its blessed . There is a continent " Africa " being consumed by flames . I truly believe that when the history books are written , our age will be remembered for three things : the war on terror , the digital revolution , and what we did " or did not to " to put the fire out in Africa . History , like God , is watching what we do . Thank you . Thank you , America , and God bless you all . 
@@75400393 @4100393/ <h> The Missionary Position : NGOs and Development in Africa <p> ( August 2002 ) Development NGOs operating in Africa have inadvertently become part of the neo-liberal global agenda , serving to undermine the battle for social justice and human rights in much the same way as their missionary predecessors , argues a paper in the July issue of International Affairs . The paper says that the contribution of NGOs to relieving poverty is minimal , while they play a " significant role " in undermining the struggle of African people to emancipate themselves from economic , social and political oppression . In this compromised position , NGOs face a stark choice : They can move into the political domain and support social movements that seek to challenge a social system that benefits a few and impoverishes the majority ; or they can continue unchanged and thus become complicit in a system that leaves the majority in misery . <p> Entitled ' The Missionary Position : NGOs and Development in Africa ' , and co-authored by Firoze Manji and Carl O'Coill , the paper traces the emergence and role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the discourse of ' development ' that emerged in the post-independence period and the later influence of structural adjustment programs and globalization . Beginning in colonial Africa , the paper argues that missionary organizations played a key role in winning the ideological war that supported the colonial apparatus . " While colonial philanthropy may have been motivated by religious conviction , status , compassion or guilt , it was also motivated by fear . In Britain and the colonies alike , politicians frequently alluded to the threat of revolution and actively encouraged greater interest in works of benevolence as a solution to social unrest . In short , charity was not only designed to help the poor , it also served to protect the rich . " <p> In some cases , charitable organizations " actively " helped to suppress anti-colonial struggles , as was the case in Kenya , where the Women 's Association , Maendeleo Ya Wanawake ( MYWO ) and the Christian Council of Kenya ( CCK ) were both involved in government-funded schemes designed to subvert black resistance during the ' Mau Mau ' uprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had in many cases opposed nationalistic tendencies . However , instead of dying a natural death they were in fact able to prosper - a result Manji and O'Coill argue was due to the emergence of the ' development NGO ' on the national and international stage . <p> Independence , they argue , had forced missionary societies and charitable organizations to reinvent their attitude of ' trusteeship ' associated with colonial oppression . They did this by replacing white staff with black and revamping their ideological outlook by appropriating the new discourse on ' development ' in place of overt racism . <p> The difference was in name only , say the authors . Development discourse was flawed from the beginning because non-Western people were defined by their divergence from Western cultural standards . " While the vision of ' development ' appeared to offer a more inclusive path to ' progress ' than had previously been the case , in fact the discourse was little more than a superficial reformulation of old colonial prejudices . " <p> However , during this time period NGOs were regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the state assuming overarching responsibility for this role . This meant that the role of NGOs in the post-independent period remained marginal . <p> This was set to change with a new set of political circumstances that led to a boom in NGOs on the continent . The late 1970s saw the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US , with both leaders championing the concept of the minimalist state . According to this outlook the state had to take a backseat in development and create the economic conditions for the accumulation of wealth by a minority . The rest of society would begin to benefit when growth " trickled down " from the wealthy . This neo-liberal agenda " radically " altered the landscape of development practice say Manji and O'Coill . <p> African countries were at this time heavily in debt and this gave the multilateral lending agencies the leverage they needed to impose their neo-liberal policy demands , something that was not always popular with African people . Manji and O'Coill argue that unhappiness with economic adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were sometimes violently suppressed . The protests in turn led to an attempt by lending agencies to present a " human face " to their policies . What emerged was the ' good governance ' agenda of the 1990s and the decision to co-opt NGOs and other civil society organizations to a repackaged program of welfare provision . <p> NGOs suddenly found themselves in the situation where they usurped the state as the provider of social services to the ' vulnerable ' and became the beneficiaries of funds intended to mitigate the inequalities of adjustment policies . This had a " profound " impact on the sector and together with an increase in their function as a conduit for government aid led to dramatic growth in the number of NGOs in Africa . <p> Globalization therefore led to a " loss of authority " by African states over social development and policy . At the same time , Manji and O'Coill point out , social conditions worsened because of external controls over areas such as health , education and welfare measures and social programmes , tax concessions on profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned enterprises . <p> In fact , development appears to have failed , says the paper , with real per capita GDP falling and welfare gains achieved after independence reversed . Per-capita incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa fell by 21 percent in real terms between 1981 and 1989 . In 16 other Sub-Saharan countries per capita incomes were lower in 1999 than in 1975 . <p> The situation in which NGOs thrived , was therefore one of continued poverty and an increase in armed conflict . " As African governments increasingly become pushed into becoming caretakers of what might be described as the peripheral Bantustans of globalization , are we seeing a return to the colonial paradigm in which social services are delivered on the basis of favor or charity and their power to placate ? " <p> Manji and O'Coill state that NGOs have come to be preferred to the state as providers of services . " Development NGOs have become an integral , and necessary , part of a system that sacrifices respect for justice and rights . They have taken the ' missionary position ' - service delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing things for people ( implicitly who ca n't do it for themselves ) , albeit with the verbiage of participatory approaches . " <p> Manji and O'Coill use the example of apartheid South Africa to illustrate the choice open to NGOs . NGOs either supported the emerging movements that aimed to topple the Nationalist regime or they kept quiet -- a position tantamount to complicity with a system of exploitation . <p> " The challenge that both local and Western NGOs face in making this choice will be that funding - at least from the bilateral and multilateral agencies - will not necessarily be forthcoming to support the struggle for emancipation . But then , one would hardly have expected the apartheid regime in South Africa to have funded the movement that brought about the downfall of the regime , " the paper concludes .

An anticipated El Nino year in 2003 threatens another drought , but that is likely to be overshadowed by the expected war in Iraq , which will divert attention from the Southern Africa crisis , Kaye said . <p> The humanitarian response of providing food aid " will not solve the problem because the underlying causes of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will not make this famine a normal famine . There is no end to it because people are too weak to plant , too weak to harvest so this will go on . The problems do n't go away with better weather . That means the response of governments and the international community make must recognise that , " Urban Jonsson , the UN Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa told IRIN in November . <p> " There are no answers at the moment , " Michael Drinkwater , the regional coordinator of the development NGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation where countries will need ongoing assistance for many years to come in agriculture , health , at the macro-economic level ... Throwing money at it is not going to help , we need to work much more strategically . " <p> The failure of rains over two consecutive seasons should not have precipitated a crisis as deep as the region has now experienced . The current emergency , therefore , points to a slow erosion of people 's coping mechanisms exposing a more deep-seated and complex problem of vulnerability . According to UNICEF , for example , 59 percent of Zambian children under five were already malnourished in 2000 . In Malawi it was 49 percent , 44 percent in Lesotho and 27 percent in Zimbabwe . <p> Even under normal conditions , subsistence farmers in Malawi can only grow 90 percent of their food needs . From December until the next harvest in March , many eke out an existence by providing casual labour known as " ganyu " within the community , using money earned to buy food on the market . But if the planting season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of food on the market rises . <p> " That daily wage rate has not changed in five years , it 's about 20 kwacha US 27 cents per day . But the inflation rate in Malawi has been outstanding . So you have this inflation rate , to which all the other prices get adjusted accordingly - fuel transport , maize prices , they 're all directly linked . But the casual labour rate has n't budged - it 's a precarious situation , " Nicholas Haan , Regional Programme Advisor of the World Food Programme 's ( WFP ) Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping unit told IRIN in June . <p> A FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT ? <p> Most of Southern Africa 's agriculture is rain fed . The staple crop is maize , a non-indigenous plant which is not drought-resistant , but as a commercial crop has edged out more traditional and hardier cereals from national diets . The lack of irrigation and crop diversification means that small-scale farmers are particularly vulnerable to climatic changes in a region where drought is endemic . <p> " A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Reggie Mugwara , the director of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) Food and Natural Resources Unit explained . " I think we need to redirect our investments back into agriculture , particularly smallholder agriculture , which is the engine of growth for most of the countries that have been affected by the drought . " <p> A failure of governance - poor accountability and a lack of democratisation - has been cited as one of the key causes for the region 's emergency . The finger has been repeatedly pointed at Zimbabwe 's land reform programme , which has undermined a previously robust agricultural economy , and financial mismanagement in Malawi , which led to a decision to sell off the country 's grain reserve as shortages were already becoming apparent . <p> " Famine is always a product of decision-making failures . Southern Africa is where it is now because of the decisions and actions of the powerful . Thus , the key solution to preventing hunger lies in increasing people 's participation in , and the effectiveness of , governance , " Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid wrote in in an Overseas Development Institute ( ODI ) report . <p> A lack of management capacity by governments has also been mentioned as a contributory factor . " Disasters happen , whether it is floods or whatever . What is important is what capacity , what policies have been put in place , what is it that needs to be done institutionally to strengthen the institutions in order to respond effectively ? " Mugwara asked . This was a goal that greater regional policy integration through SADC could help to achieve , he noted . <p> Famine early warning systems in Southern Africa have in the past typically looked at " macro data " of rainfall and crop yields rather than the " ground-truthing " to determine people 's ability to afford food - the kind of analysis that raised the first alarm over conditions in Malawi in 2001 . " At present many governments in Southern Africa do not have the capacity for a well-functioning statistics system . Economic liberalisation has led to contracts for data collection and analysis being put up on a two-three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnover is too high to help Africa , " participants at an ODI meeting in July noted . <p> QUESTIONING THE DONORS <p> But at the policy level , there is also little room for new thinking by African governments . They are constrained by the " Washington consensus " on market reforms championed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as the ideologically correct development path . It frowns on government intervention , and looks at short-term financial considerations rather than medium-term food security , critics argue . The debt burden also robs governments of development resources . <p> The role of the state has been downsized - it is no longer that of a food security guarantor , however inefficiently it operated in the past . Subsidised inputs such as fertiliser were stopped , social services starved of funds , and the commodity boards that fixed producer prices and collected farmers ' produce abolished . They were supposed to have been replaced by the private sector , but in most cases local entrepreneurs could not rise to the challenge or lacked the profit incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the most part , are now on their own . " The reform programmes , yes are necessary , but they are painful ... I think we need some contingency plans in order to minimise the worst effects , " said Mugwara . " You ca n't go back to the old ways , but we can not also ignore the present realities ... that the vulnerable are much more vulnerable than they were . " <p> Smallholder agriculture , the predominant source of livelihoods in Africa , had proved to be at least as efficient as large farms when farmers received similar support services in inputs like seeds , fertiliser and credit , the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) said in a report last year . Raising their output would stimulate the rest of the economy . Each 1 percent increase in agricultural productivity had been shown to reduce poverty by 0.6 percent , the institute said . But public investment in African agriculture has been falling for many years . World Bank lending for agriculture slumped from about 31 percent of its total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The funding levels required to boost agriculture " depart sharply from recent trends " , IFPRI acknowledged . <p> In a report on the food crisis released in June , Oxfam warned that until the right to food was put at the top of the agenda of international financial institutions and national governments , food security would remain precarious . It said Africa needed policies that were carefully thought-out and implemented , and not driven by dogma , political opportunism or hypocrisy . <p> " At the same time as African farmers are told that they can no longer have free seeds or fertilisers , US farmers are receiving an average US $20,000 a year in subsidies - which is soon to increase by 70 percent - and EU European Union farmers US $16,000 , " noted the briefing paper . <p> It cited an IMF evaluation that found that in Zambia between 1991 and 1994 , the liberalisation of state marketing had contributed to a 30 percent increase in rural poverty . " It is clear that without some form of state intervention as a safety net , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as erratic weather . Unfortunately , the IMF and other donors are not learning this lesson . " <p> African countries also face gigantic hurdles in establishing an agro-export economy to trade their way out of poverty , due to tariff barriers and produce dumping by European and US producers . " Rich countries spend vast sums of money protecting the interests of their producers , while at the same time forcing poor countries to open their markets to subsidised imports , " Oxfam argued . <p> Chris Kaye believes that both regional governments and the international community need to reform the way they operate , and develop a " compact " on the way forward . <p> " Governments must wake up to their responsibilities and show they are caring for their own people , because if they do n't , no self-respecting donor will do that for them . " By the same token , he said , the depth of the problems confronted by the region required a " much more concerted effort by donors ... otherwise Southern Africa will go down the tube " .

@@75400397 @4100397/ <p> " Is the world the way it should be ? Or do you think that something ought to be different ? " This was the question that thousands of posters asked Norwegian students a couple of years ago . It was the end of October , and International Week had started . <p> Norway occupies a small spot in the upper corner of the world , and only about four million people live here . Because there happens to be tons of oil in our oceans , we are a very wealthy people . Still , a lot of young people are not satisfied . Some of them are involved in Operation Day 's Work ( ODW ) . <p> Operation Day 's Work , which began in Norway in 1964 , had its origins in the " Give a Day " campaign organized by students in Sweden two years earlier . Norwegian students , realizing that 1.3 billion people worldwide live in poverty , wanted to take action . <p> The Norwegian School Student Union took the initiative , arguing that in Norway everyone is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth in the world have little or no education . They decided to do something , and convinced their schools to suspend one day of classes each year to allow them to work that day to earn money for their less fortunate counterparts around the world . <p> They convinced their schools to suspend one day of classes each year to earn money for their less fortunate counterparts around the world . <p> Students also organized a 10-day information campaign preceding their work day called , " International Week , " devoted to studying all aspects of their project country . In the first year of Operation Day 's Work , 35,000 thousand Norwegian students participated in the program . They worked in factories and offices , washed cars and windows , sold cakes and cookies , and raised $15,000 for educational programs in Algeria . <p> The program has grown by leaps and bounds . In the last three decades , Operation Day 's Work has supported projects in 35 different countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America . Over the last five years , the students have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating 115,000 Norwegian students raised $3 million . <p> But the amount of money raised is not the focus of the campaign . The most remarkable and characteristic thing about ODW is that it is entirely run by young people . There are between 5,000 and 6,000 students between the ages of 13 and 19 who organize the campaign , from the grassroots level as action committees at every participating school , through the 20 district committees in each county , and finally the National Committee with its nine members in Oslo . <p> The world is not the way it should be , and everybody has a responsibility to do something about it . <p> How can school students arrange such a thing , you might ask . To start with , let 's eliminate the idea that Norwegian teenagers are any different from other teenagers . They are usually looked upon as being self-centered and lazy , mainly spending time on themselves . So what makes them go beyond their own person and get engaged in something like ODW ? <p> The three crucial things are probably : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , and , 3 ) the results of the campaign . <p> The ideology of ODW is quite simple . The world is not the way it should be , and everybody has a responsibility to do something about it . What makes ODW a bit special is the contrast we make between solidarity and charity . ODW wants the students to work in solidarity , not out of charity . That kind of attitude is suppressive and can do more harm than good . It does something to the symptoms rather than the cause of the unfairness . Help is to be triggered by mutual respect , not pity . This means that the main work of Operation Day 's Work is done in Norway , by educating students about causes and connections in a world where the majority is poor and minority rich . <p> During International Week , students are exposed to the Third World in a new way . Through people , literature , music and culture from the South , ODW 's aim is to show " the real South " its strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Third World than the war-catastrophe-misery one . <p> 1.3 billion people worldwide live in poverty . <p> It is our hope that the students will realize that these people are not merely hungry , pitiable objects that need our goodwill to survive . Working in the spirit of solidarity is working with the understanding that we are not all similar , but we are all equal , and both rich and poor can learn from each other . <p> While the ideology appeals to most people , that alone is n't enough to explain the success of ODW . The strength lies in the feeling of ownership and the responsibility that is given to the students . This is our own campaign , we make the decisions and use our language . Even though some things stay the same , two campaigns are never the same . The dynamic structure ensures renewal , but also requires good routines in order to keep the acquired knowledge and experiences within the organization . Most of the volunteers are new every year , and the training is mainly done through instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motivation is the motor of ODW , and through seminars the sense of community and the spirit is conveyed from one level in the organization to the next . Each year the National Committee gives a seminar for the leaders of each district committee in April , and one for four members of the district committees in August . One of the district committees ' most important tasks is to arrange two seminars , one for the action committees of the schools in that particular county , and one for the teachers of the participating schools . The size of the campaign requires three permanent adult employees . These are the only people in the entire campaign who receive a salary , and they are important for continuity within the organizational work , the credibility of the economic overview and the follow-up on the running projects . <p> Each October , Norwegian NGOs apply for next year 's project . The ODW Council , consisting of adult people with many years of experience in foreign aid , eliminate the projects that do n't fulfill ODW 's principles . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be educational , they have to support young people , and they have to be sustainable and built on local knowledge and support . Information is gathered and disseminated to student councils of last year 's participating schools for a vote , which takes place in the spring . The National Committee is elected at the annual meeting of the Norwegian School Student Union , based on the recommendations of last year 's National Committee . <p> These nine people start their work immediately and work full time from May on forming the material and the campaign . Each member has a certain area of responsibility and is also a contact person for two or three counties . It is their job to prepare International Week . With the philosophy that knowledge is part of the campaign , 10 percent of the money raised for the project is spent on International Week . <p> Working in the spirit of solidarity is working with the understanding that we are not all similar , but we are all equal , and both rich and poor can learn from each other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students , devoted to all aspects of the project country , including its culture , history , religion , politics , and education . A teacher 's guide on how to incorporate the project country into that year 's school curriculum is produced , as are posters , stickers , slide shows , radio and television spots , websites and guidebooks for the district and school committees . Ten guests from the project country are invited , and one person on the National Committee locates translators and arranges everything for the trip . The guests travel around the country to visit the students , each covering one county . <p> In addition to this , the schools can get lectures from members of the district and the National Committee , and also from external lecturers that the cooperating NGO is required to provide . The schools decide how they want their International Week to be , and everything is done to make this a special happening . Culture and dancing groups are popular , and many action committees arrange exhibitions , international cafes and workshops where students can prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , from the project country . Only the imagination sets the limits . <p> Young Norwegians of today know a lot about the world 's miseries and often feel that they can not do anything to change them . Operation Day 's Work offers students an opportunity to make a difference . This is especially true for the students involved in arranging the campaign . At each level in the organization , they are allowed to use and develop their abilities , and at the same time they help their fellow brothers and sisters in the Third World . But , most important , this something everybody can participate in . After 10 days of International Week , students have a chance to take action by working for one day . They are responsible for finding their own day 's work , although the school committee will assist those unable to come up with a job . Employers pay the student workers a minimum wage of $20 or $30 , depending on their age . <p> The workday also has positive consequences for the local community . Students brighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies , giving shows , etc . The students often do the work that never gets done , such as cleaning streets , doing the dirty work in shops , mowing yards , helping in nurseries , etc . <p> Three million dollars raised annually will not change the world . Even being young and idealistic , we in ODW know that . But for the young people who , through the projects we support , get the chance to fulfill their dreams of an education , it really makes a difference . And when one experiences what ODW does to oneself and to thousands of other Norwegians , it is easy to believe that changes come from knowledge and mutual understanding . <p> Lillian Strand is a student at the University of Oslo , where she studies economics and political science . She has been involved with Operation Day 's Work for four years , in 1998 as a member of the National Committee , and in 1999 as the leader of Operation Day 's Work International Committee .

@@75400409 @4100409/ <p> ( London/Berlin , 26 September 2007 ) The divide in perceived levels of corruption in rich and poor countries remains as sharp as ever , according to the 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ( CPI ) , released today by Transparency International , the global coalition against corruption . Developed and developing countries must share responsibility for reducing corruption , in tackling both the supply and demand sides . <p> " Despite some gains , corruption remains an enormous drain on resources sorely needed for education , health and infrastructure , " said Huguette Labelle , Chair of Transparency International . " Low scoring countries need to take these results seriously and act now to strengthen accountability in public institutions . But action from top scoring countries is just as important , particularly in cracking down on corrupt activity in the private sector . " <p> The 2007 results <p> The 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index looks at perceptions of public sector corruption in 180 countries and territories - the greatest country coverage of any CPI to date and is a composite index that draws on 14 expert opinion surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , with zero indicating high levels of perceived corruption and ten indicating low levels of perceived corruption . <p> A strong correlation between corruption and poverty continues to be evident . Forty percent of those scoring below three , indicating that corruption is perceived as rampant , are classified by the World Bank as low income countries . Somalia and Myanmar share the lowest score of 1.4 , while Denmark has edged up to share the top score of 9.4 with perennial high-flyers Finland and New Zealand . <p> Scores are significantly higher in several African countries in the 2007 CPI . These include Namibia , Seychelles , South Africa and Swaziland . These results reflect the positive progress of anti-corruption efforts in Africa and show that genuine political will and reform can lower perceived levels of corruption . <p> The concentration of gainers in South East and Eastern Europe testifies to the galvanizing effect of the European Union accession process on the fight against corruption . <p> At the same time , deeply troubled states such as Afghanistan , Iraq , Myanmar , Somalia , and Sudan remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn apart by conflict pay a huge toll in their capacity to govern . With public institutions crippled or non-existent , mercenary individuals help themselves to public resources and corruption thrives , " said Labelle . <p> Good governance begins at home <p> The poorest countries suffer most under the yoke of corruption . And it is ultimately their responsibility to tackle the problem . Low scores in the CPI indicate that public institutions are heavily compromised . The first order of business is to improve transparency in financial management , from revenue collection to expenditure , as well as strengthening oversight and putting an end to the impunity of corrupt officials . <p> An independent and professional judicial system is critical to ending impunity and enforcing the impartial rule of law , to promoting public , donor and investor confidence . If courts can not be relied upon to pursue corrupt officials or to assist in tracing and returning illicit wealth , progress against corruption is unlikely . <p> " Partnering with civil society and citizens is another essential strategy for developing countries seeking to strengthen the accountability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can help stimulate demand for reform and also bring in expertise on technical issues , " said Cobus de Swardt , Managing Director of Transparency International . " But , increasingly , many governments are moving to restrict the operating space of civil society . " <p> In addition , many countries are unable to shoulder the burden of reform alone . In countries where public sector institutions were historically based on patronage and nepotism rather than merit , reform takes time and can require a substantial investment of resources , as well as technical assistance . As significant development assistance donors , top scoring countries play a special role in supporting greater accountability and institutional integrity in countries plagued by the highest levels of public sector corruption . Technical assistance is a key requirement of the landmark United Nations Convention against Corruption ( UNCAC ) . <p> Corruption is a problem with global roots <p> The top scores of wealthy countries and territories , largely in Europe , East Asia and North America , reflect their relatively clean public sectors , enabled by political stability , well-established conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society free to exercise oversight . <p> But corruption by high-level public officials in poor countries has an international dimension that implicates the CPIs top scorers . Bribe money often stems from multinationals based in the worlds richest countries . It can no longer be acceptable for these companies to regard bribery in export markets as a legitimate business strategy . <p> In addition , global financial centers play a pivotal role in allowing corrupt officials to move , hide and invest their illicitly gained wealth . Offshore financing , for example , played a crucial role in the looting of millions from developing countries such as Nigeria and the Philippines , facilitating the misdeeds of corrupt leaders and impoverishing those they governed . <p> Akere Muna , Vice Chair of Transparency International , pointed to the recovery of stolen assets as another area ripe for enhanced action by developed nations , noting , " Criticism by rich countries of corruption in poor ones has little credibility while their financial institutions sit on wealth stolen from the worlds poorest people . " <p> In many cases , asset tracing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks in jurisdictions where banking secrecy remains the norm . Through the United Nations Convention against Corruption ( UNCAC ) , priority should be given to improving international cooperation and mutual legal assistance , expediting action to recover assets , and developing legal and technical expertise in nations requesting the return of looted assets . <p> For many countries , repatriation of funds will mean long and extensive litigation . " In addition to ensuring adequate legal funding , simplifying recovery procedures and provisions for third party institutions to act as escrows during litigation must be a high priority , " Muna added . <p> Act now : urgent steps <p> As a problem of global scale , with global roots , fighting corruption demands action on a broad front . <p> Developing countries should use aid money to strengthen their governance institutions , guided by national assessments and development strategies , and to incorporate strengthened integrity and corruption prevention as an integral part of poverty reduction programmes . <p> Judicial independence , integrity and accountability must be enhanced to improve the credibility of justice systems in poorer countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judges themselves must be subject to disciplinary rules , limited immunity and a code of judicial conduct to help ensure that justice is served . A clean and capable judiciary is essential if developing countries are to manage requests for assistance in the recovery of stolen assets from abroad . <p> Governments must introduce anti-money laundering measures to eradicate safe havens for stolen assets , as prescribed by the UNCAC . Leading banking centres should explore the development of uniform expedited procedures for the identification , freezing and repatriation of the proceeds of corruption . Clear escrow provisions for disputed funds are essential . <p> Wealthy countries must regulate their financial centers more strictly . Focusing on the roles of trusts , demanding knowledge of beneficial ownership and strengthening anti-money laundering provisions are just a few of the ways that rich governments can tackle the facilitators of corruption . <p> The worlds wealthiest governments must strictly enforce the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention , which criminalizes the bribery of foreign public officials .

@@75400412 @4100412/ <p> Trade relations between developed and developing countries are structured in favor of the developed countries : the United States and Canada , countries of Western Europe , and Japan . This is because some of the developed countries have been in charge of making the rules for a very long time--since before the 1700 's . The way that the rules are made have certainly changed . At one time , Spain with colonies and control of the seas , established the rules . Later , Great Britain took control of the seas , had colonies and did the same thing . ( For example , Great Britain had colonies and defined ( limited ) how the United States and other nations could trade with these colonies . ) Now we have the World Trade Organization , quite a number of regional or specialized trade agreements , and the operation of country legal systems , which can be used to enforce business practices such as contracts and patents . <p> This page deals with the following topics : <p> realigning exchange rates The principal issue here is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rate is too low , leading to large Chinese trade surpluses and deficits in other countries , including a large trade deficit in the United States . <p> other trade agreements , including the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) and the United States ' Generalized System of Preferences ( GSP ) <p> realigning representation on global organizations , including the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the WTO , that establish and control important parts of the international economic and non-economic framework toward poor countries and ( ideally ) poor people . <p> After World War II the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) was established to set rules for international trade . The successor to the GATT is the World Trade Organization . It was established , in Hunger Notes view , in large part so that developed countries could extend their control of international transactions into key new areas , especially including intellectual property rights ( e.g. Microsoft did n't want people in developing countries copying computer code ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While legal safeguards were presumably in place to protect these property rights in developing countries , this was viewed as not sufficient . Much better--from the point of view of firms in developed countries and their active supporters , developed country governments--to make the right of trade dependent on compliance with a broad range of controls embodied in the " new and expanded " WTO . This would mean " one stop shopping " with respect to rules enforcement . While the developed countries are ostensibly in favor of free trade--free trade is a mantra with the previous Bush administration and Republican law makers for example--developed countries are not in favor of free trade when it does not suit their interests . The key example is agriculture . The United States , Japan , and European countries have giant agricultural subsides and even quota limitations--the U.S. sugar quota is a major example . How do they get away with it ? Well of course they wrote the original WTO rules which provide for " differential treatment " for agriculture . The Doha round of trade negotiations is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing country agricultural products . Developed country governments do not much want to do this , and so a major theme in recent years has been a struggle over agricultural trade rules , where the developed countries have essentially stonewalled attempts to reduce subsidies . <p> At 15,000 feet , Mount Toromocho , 86 miles from Lima , is comparable to any mountain in Europe . It gets its name from its shape - The Bull With No Horns . And it is composed almost entirely of copper ore : two billion tons of it . It could become the most productive copper mine anywhere on earth . Now it belongs , in effect , to China . Photo : BBC <p> There are other trade agreements , often regional , such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) . European countries are also negotiating regional trade agreements .

This **28;629;TOOLONG poor countries and poor people . In the IMF , for example , voting power is based on economic strength calculated many years ago . Even though economic strength ( size of economies ) has changed greatly in the intervening years , voting power in these international institutions has not changed to reflect these changes . Much less has it changed towards a more democratic ideal--one country , one vote ( a la the U.S. Senate ) , or proportional voting by population . The control of these institutions greatly helps the developed countries impose their will on other countries--for example through sanctions or through the granting or withholding of loan approvals . Minimal progress has been made in realigning representation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to increasing prosperity in developing countries , the IMF and the World Bank are needed less . <p> The forced resignation of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank has highlighted the fact that in an unwritten deal ( a ' gentlemen 's agreement ' ) , the United States gets to select the president of the World Bank while the European nations get to select the managing director of the International Monetary Fund . Similar deals appear to hold in the United Nations , where the United States appears to be able to select the head of UNICEF , among others . Not democratic . <p> The following articles give fairly clear examples of how the current trade and legal system can lead to injustice . Trademarks , in these cases , and copyrights or patents in others ( in the case , for example of patenting of traditional herbal remedies or crop varieties ) , are used to appropriate the good name and knowledge of others . A similar phenomenon was called ' claim jumping ' in the American west .

Due to international public outcry from farmers and civil society worldwide , Terminator has never been commercialized anywhere . But various developments , including acquisition of the patent rights to terminator technology by Monsanto , the largest seed company in the world , have increased pressure to adopt the technology .

China slams U.S. piracy complaintBBC News April 10 , 2007 ( You will leave this site . ) What is piracy in this case ? Is it robbery of a ship on the high seas ? No , it is using someone else 's ideas . <p> When do ideas become the ' intellectual property ' of a person or corporation ? Almost all our knowledge is based on the knowledge of others . We rely on English and other languages to communicate . Languages are certainly a powerful tool , developed by others . The sermon on the mount certainly did a lot of good . Mathematics ? Developed by others ! Most good ideas that we use are developed by others and also not charged for . There is an extremely large cultural and intellectual heritage of the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their ideas and , if not paid , restrict the use of their ideas ? We take it as a fact that someone , if they get a patent , are able to charge others for the use of that patent . It is a fact ( of our current situation ) but it is a cultural artifact , and actually was extensively debated with the founding of patent systems , which have as a key feature patent protection offered by the legal system . And enforced by the legal system . Humans will work to develop good ideas without the protection of the patent system . Newton developed the laws of gravity and motion without the need for patent protection , for example . The idea in offering patent protection , always thought of as protection for a limited term , was that patent protection would spur invention and technological change . But the central idea in the development of patent law was how to promote overall human welfare , not to just secure advantages for a few . When developed countries seek to apply patent protection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent protection must be considered in terms of its overall human usefulness . The market for drugs in developed countries may well be sufficient to lead to the development of new drugs ; if so , why should very poor people in developing countries have to pay a royalty fee to use these drugs ? Our automatic response is --if you get a patent--then you can charge or prohibit use of the information patented . But the deeper question is : what system of patent arrangements will best promote human welfare ? This is compounded when developed country firms , backed by their governments , try to strengthen their position . For example , U.S. firms in China ( or any other country ) , faced with piracy , have the option to pursue this through the Chinese ( or any other country ) legal system . Instead firms , backed by developed country governments , have successfully established intellectual property rights in international trade law .

On balance , a net of some 1.5 billion tons of carbon were being released into the atmosphere each year , contributing to global warming . <p> The tropical deforestation in Asia is driven primarily by the fast-growing demand for timber .

Today , because the earths forests are shrinking , they are a major source of CO2 . The goal is to expand the earths tree cover , growing more trees to soak up CO2 . <p> Although banning deforestation may seem farfetched , environmental reasons have pushed three countries--Thailand , the Philippines , and China--to implement complete or partial bans on logging . All three bans were imposed following devastating floods and mudslides resulting from the loss of forest cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Yangtze River basin , Beijing noted that when forest policy was viewed not through the eyes of the individual logger but through those of society as a whole , it simply did not make economic sense to continue deforesting . The flood control service of trees standing , they said , was three times as valuable as the timber from trees cut . With this in mind , Beijing then took the unusual step of paying the loggers to become tree planters--to reforest instead of deforest . <p> Other countries cutting down large areas of trees will also face the environmental effects of deforestation , including flooding . If Brazils Amazon rainforest continues to shrink , it may also continue to dry out , becoming vulnerable to fire . If the Amazon rainforest disappears , it would be replaced largely by desert and scrub forestland .

Deforestation is no longer just a matter of local flooding , but also rising seas worldwide and the many other effects of climate change . Nature has just raised the ante on protecting forests . <p> Reaching a goal of zero net deforestation will require reducing the pressures to deforest that come from population growth , rising affluence , the construction of ethanol distilleries and biodiesel refineries , and the fast-growing use of paper . Protecting the earths forests means halting population growth as soon as possible , and , for the earths affluent residents who are responsible for the growing demand for beef and soybeans that is deforesting the Amazon basin , it means moving down the food chain . A successful deforestation ban may require a ban on the construction of additional biodiesel refineries and ethanol distilleries . <p> Against this backdrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish energy firm , Vattenfall , has examined the large-scale potential for foresting wasteland to sequester carbon dioxide . They begin by noting that there are 1.86 billion hectares of degraded land in the world--land that was once forestland , cropland , or grassland--and that half of this , or 930 million hectares , has a decent chance of being profitably reclaimed . Some 840 million hectares of this total are in the tropical regions , where reclamation would mean much higher rates of carbon sequestration . <p> Vattenfall estimates that the maximum technical potential of these 930 million hectares is to absorb roughly 21.6 billion tons of CO2 per year . If , as part of a global climate stabilization strategy , carbon sequestration were valued at $210 per ton of carbon , the company believes that 18 percent of this technical potential could be realized . If so , this would mean planting 171 million hectares of land to trees . This area--larger than that planted to grain in India--would sequester 3.5 billion tons of CO2 per year , or over 950 million tons of carbon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $200 billion . Spread over a decade , this would mean investing $20 billion a year to give climate stabilization a large and potentially decisive boost . This global forestation plan to remove atmospheric CO2 , most of it put there by industrial countries , would be funded by them . An independent body would be set up to administer , fund , and monitor the vast tree planting .

The U.S. created its agricultural surpluses by following a chemically intensive path that entailed " farming without farmers . " This model is utterly undesirable in countries where most people still rely on farming for their livelihoods . <p> As practiced by Gates and USAID , the " all solutions " approach is an assault on traditional farming that includes , on one end , producing more food through intensive agriculture , and on the other raising the GDPs of African countries through increased global trade .

@@75400423 @4100423/ <p> ( Kampala , April 8 , 2004 ) I arrived in Uganda on September 15 , 2003 to begin my first year as a Mickey Leland International Hunger Fellow , placed with the United States Agency for International Developments Uganda mission . A few months before I arrived I was told that I would be acting as the Humanitarian Response Coordinator for the mission , working on emergency projects in response to the conflict in northern Uganda . I am ashamed to admit that at the time I had almost no idea that this war even existed . Like a lot of the world , when I thought about Uganda at all it was as an African success story , the country that had lowered its HIV/AIDS rate from over 30% to 6% in ten years , the Pearl of Africa . The story of its 18-year war was a revelation to me in more ways than one . <p> Women divide a sack of beans among their households during a distribution in Opit IDP camp in northern Uganda . Food aid provides roughly 50% of the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For almost two decades now , the Lords Resistance Army has waged a campaign of terror on the Acholi people . Rebels murder , maim and abduct thousands of men , women and children each year , forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes for the relative safety of congested displacement camps . I had been in Uganda for a week when I saw a camp for internally displaced people ( IDPs ) for the first time . As a typical child of the American suburbs , my imaginings of what a " refugee camp " looked like owed a lot to television news and media pleas from international relief organizations depicting abject , helpless Africans . <p> What I saw was heartbreaking , but different from what I 'd pictured . I walked around the camp with a column of children tailing me at a safe distance , stepping over the open sewage ditches that crisscrossed the camp and watching moonfaced malnourished children play in rubbish heaps . Women and children stood in endless queues waiting for a single jerrican of water , which my companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from the muddy ponds outside the camp . Men , unable to leave the camp to work in their fields , sat in despondent clusters , staring and drinking waragi . But what I felt most strongly was the settled , inured mood of the place and people . The Acholi have been living in displaced isolation for more than a decade , cut off from the outside world and even the most basic services . In the face of chronic fear and deprivation , they have exercised that most human of traits : they have adapted to their conditions , appalling as they are . <p> I had come to the camp with a World Food Program convoy bringing food aid to its residents . Cut off from their land , the IDPs are almost wholly dependent on their rations of beans , maize , vegetable oil and corn-soya blend ( CSB ) donated by the US and other industrialized nations . The general food distribution sent a thrill through the camp as ( I was to realize later ) does any visit the IDPs receive from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing with basins and sacks on their heads , children ran laughing through the crowd , scooping handfuls of spilt CSB into their mouths , and old men shook my hand and thanked me for " the food from America . " I felt deeply ashamed . I was aware of myself as the walking embodiment of overfed western carelessness , but as I moved through the crowd I was greeted with grateful smiles and blessings from all sides as if I were some magnanimous , selfless benefactor . As if I personally was responsible for the IDPs good fortune that day . Just weeks before , I had had no conception of these people and their lives ; they had not existed to me and now I was being thanked for acknowledging their presence and their plight . It struck me that the sacks of grain being unloaded from the trucks represented millions of Americans just like me , well intentioned and yet mostly ignorant of the consequences of our actions . <p> During the seven months I have lived in Uganda , the number of people displaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million and has spread to cover eight districts . Every week there is news of more deaths and abductions , every few days another bloody scene is splashed across the front pages of the national newspapers . But in my time here Ive realized that the victims of this war are not the helpless Africans of American televised lore , and that while our aid may be of assistance in the short term , we need to avoid confusing people who need help with helpless people . These are people , families , who are trading away part of their households , their culture and themselves in order to survive in a world they had no part in making . This is lifes reality for more than 35 million refugees and IDPs around the world . <p> Due to lack of classrooms and teachers in the camps , many IDP children can not attend school , especially girls . <p> When I think about the world in these terms , I ca n't help but feel overwhelmed by responsibility , and the knowledge that as an American I am complicit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means I have a hand , a choice in the way the future plays out . My time in Uganda so far has showed me that the first step in that choice is to keep my eyes open and next , not to let the things I see make me feel I am helpless to act for change . This is how Ugandas forgotten war has helped me to remember my place in the world . <p> This year Hunger Notes will publish articles and letters from the Congressional Hunger Centers Mickey Leland International Hunger Fellows to give our readers a real-life sense of what hunger looks like around the world . This program , named after former U.S. Representative Mickey Leland , sends fellows to work with the worlds leading anti-hunger organizations so they may know what hungry people experience , and so they may then have better tools to craft policies and practices that serve these individuals .

I was wondering if you would answer a couple of questions for me . What is the definition of hunger ? What percent of the world is a third world country ?

What is the best resource for people who are " living on a dollar a day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dear K.M. , Here are my answers to your questions . 1 . What is the definition of hunger ? Hunger is a term which has three meanings ( Oxford English Dictionary 1971 ) <p> the uneasy or painful sensation caused by want of food ; craving appetite . Also the exhausted condition caused by want of food <p> the want or scarcity of food in a country <p> a strong desire or craving <p> World hunger refers to the second definition , aggregated to the world level . The related technical term ( in this case operationalized in medicine ) is **25;659;TOOLONG is a general term that indicates a lack of some or all nutritional elements necessary for human health . In the context of world hunger , what malnutrition typically refers to is lack of sufficient calories and protein , not lack of one or more vitamins and minerals.2 .

Although you have running water in your house , if you are poor , there typically is no running water nearby . Get some gallon milk jugs or whatever and set out for someplace a half-mile away or more to gather all the water you will need . Of course going to the bathroom is a major problem . Is there some sort of open space nearby ? Or a public toilet ? Also forget about sleeping in a comfortable bed--take a cot and a blanket or two out to the garage--your new living space .

I am doing a research project on world hunger . I have a couple of questions for a professional about world hunger . Please see below and answer as soon as possible.1 . What was the first recognized case of world hunger ? 2 . What are we doing to stop world hunger ? 3 . What are the big organizations that are helping to end world hunger ? 4 . Do you think that world hunger can be ended ? 5 . What do you think is the main cause for world hunger in the world ? 6 . Are there ways people can help in small ways ? 7 .

Is the Federal government doing anything to stop world hunger from spreading ? Please get back to me as soon as possible . Thank you : ) J. M. <p> Dear J.M , Given your time constraints and mine , we have settled on your first four questions . Here are my answers:1 . What was the first recognized case of world hunger ? Hunger in the world , including people starving to death in large numbers , has been around for many thousands of years . Famine is a name for large scale hunger . See an encyclopedia entry for famine , for example the Wikipedia entry http : **30;686;TOOLONG . <p> 2 . What are we doing to stop world hunger ? If we divide the world into developed and less developed countries then I think it can be said that both the developed and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of less developed countries , which almost everybody takes as the main way to reduce hunger , and in fact all nations do take some practical steps in this direction . Basically countries try to adopt economic policies that will make their economies grow , producing more goods and services , with everyone presumably getting some benefit from the increased production , although often , really typically , the benefits are very unequally distributed , with ' them that has , gets ' and the poor get relatively little or really nothing . You might look at Wikipedia 's article ' economic development ' ( LONG ... though it is not very good . Developed countries support this process with some amount of development assistance ( see the Wikipedia article http : **38;718;TOOLONG ) which is typically a very small percentage of what a developed country produces . For example United States official development assistance is .2 of one percent of US national output ( called Gross Domestic Product or GDP ) , a very small amount . ( See Wikipedia ' official development assistance ' LONG ... By comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on military expenditure ( Wikipedia ' List of countries by military expenditures ' LONG ... or 23.5 times as much as the United States spends on development assistance . Some of this development assistance is specifically targeted to assist hungry people . If you added up things it would certainly come to many billions of dollars , and thus sounds like a lot of money , but in the grand scheme of things the amount of money that goes to help hungry people is a drop in the bucket . <p> 3 . What are the big organizations that are helping to end world hunger ? Considering the broad overall picture it is goverments as indicated above and the capitalist system/private enterprise/markets and science/technological advance that are probably considered as the forces that will ( may ? ) end hunger or reduce it substantially . There has certainly been progress in reducing the percentage of people in the world that are hungry . The problem is that hungry people are really at the margins of everyone 's thoughts and actions , which are mainly focused on self interest . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions that do respond to hunger issues and hungry people include the World Food Program , the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( http : //www.cgiar.org/ ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization , private voluntary organizations such as Catholic Relief Services , development assistance agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development , and others . <p> 4 . Do you think that world hunger can be ended ? My short answer is no . It will be reduced in terms of the percentage of the people of the world that are hungry , and there will probably be some reduction in the absolute numbers . The latest estimation by the Food and Agricultural Organization is that there are 925 million hungry people . I doubt very much if the number of hungry people will fall below 500 million in the next 20 years and I would n't be surprised if it was higher than that--between 500 million and 1 billion or more . <p> I hope this response is not too late . Excellent questions ! Editor , Hunger Notes <p> ( April 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ashley . We are in Mrs. Ingelright 's class at Gwin Elementray in Hoover , Alabama . We are working on a very special project called A Light Bulb . We chose to do our research on poverty , and we 're trying to solve the problem of how to educate others about this important topic . You could help us with our research by answering the questions below . 1 . What is the main reason whow poverty and hunger started ? 2 . Would poverty spread throughout the world if we did n't help it ? 3 . How can we help people who are in poverty and are hungry ? 4 . Do kids that experience hunger do as well in school ? 5 . What can I do as an elementary student to help solve hunger in our state or educate other people about our topic ? Sincerely , Ashley and Carter <p> Dear Ashley and Carter , Here are my answers to your very interesting questions . ( I did not respond to question 3 , due to lack of time . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger started ? Poverty and hunger go very far back , really into prehistory . Very early humans were ' hunter-gathers ' . That is to say , they lived by killing wild animals and by looking for and gathering food that grew in the wild . People did n't get very far out of poverty , though they may well have been happy with their way of living . Native Americans , before the arrival of Europeans , had this way of living , for example . A lot of human history is really the invention of ways to produce more food and other useful ( and some not so useful ) objects . For example , various kinds of plants were brought into cultivation , such as corn , seed varieties were improved to produce more , and other steps were taken to increase output , such as the discovery and use of various types of fertilizer . Also there was a vast increase in new ways of producing goods , such as the use of various types of energy including coal and oil , to stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many more goods possible . As this greater production occurred , often referred to as an economic surplus , inequality sprang up , with some people getting a lot , while others had barely enough to live . This was basically due to the fact that smaller groups could conquer others and establish their rule and dominance . This also has been a phenomenon for thousands of years . So the two reasons for poverty and hunger--low levels of production and then , as production gradually rose , inequality have around for quite some time . <p> 2 . Would poverty spread throughout the world if we did n't help it ? Both no , and yes . Take the no part of the answer first . A basic idea of a capitalist economic system , first set out by someone called Adam Smith , is that people do things like save money , invest in new factories , invent improved ways of doing things , and that doing so will not only benefit the people that are doing them , but the rest of the people in society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plenty of room for specific policies to keep hunger and poverty from increasing . In particular , those who are poorest in a society often get very little of the benefits of living in a society where most people are many times richer than they are , and this situation can be helped by specific actions by others , such as voting for government income supplements for the poorest people . <p> 4 . Do kids that experience hunger do as well in school ? No . There are really two aspects to this question . Children that show up to school hungry do not do as well in learning ( as measured say , by a test at the end of the day ) as children who are not hungry . The second part takes a longer-range view of child hungeras something that lasts for years for many children . These children , hungry for many years , grow up to be adults who are shorter , less healthy , and , it appears , with reduced ability to think . <p> 5 . What can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our state or educate other people about my topic ? Preparing and delivering your presentation to others is really quite an accomplishment , and you should be proud of yourselves . Perhaps there is a food bank or food pantry in your community that you and your family could donate to . Keeping an interest in the topic of hunger and poverty and learning more would be very valuable . Maybe writing a short letter to your local newspaper about hunger in Alabama . It would be interesting to see if it would be published.Good luck with your project . If you have time drop me a line and tell me how it went .

@@75400433 @4100433/ <p> ( August 30 , 2009 ) After nearly 30 years with hundreds of thousands of liberals and hundreds of liberal organizations working to end world hunger there are still over a billion hungry people in the world . Over 200 million more people are now hungry than just 3 years ago . Those who believe that increased population growth , faltering food production or global warming are primary factors are simply wrong . More people are hungry today because both liberal and conservative measures to end world hunger failed . <p> There were some bright spots during the 1990s and early this millennium . In the early 1980s approximately 42,000 children under the age of 5 were dying each day from easily preventable malnutrition and infectious diseases . Today that number is only 25,000 a day . But measurable , affordable , achievable and politically agreed upon goals set in 1990 for the year 2000--the World Food Summit goals--were not met .

And finally , those who have no vote , but raise the children without the income , literacy , health care , nutrition , clean water , sanitation or legal status to raise them healthy . <p> Repeatedly presidential commissions , international studies , think tank reports and prestigious scientific academies have documented the fact that we have the capacity to end hunger but only if there is the " political will " to do so . <p> So , one might reasonably ask , why has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 decades ? . Some may blame it on the politicians , but anyone who understands our nations political system knows that politicians do n't  lead . They follow . And essentially , not enough people have demanded this action from our elected leaders . Could it be that the action being asked for saving lives was insufficiently compelling ? <p> The fact is , the movement to " end world hunger " has largely been a liberal cause , driven primarily by humanitarian compassion . As a bleeding heart liberal involved in this movement for most of the last 3 decades it is my view that this primary emphasis has failed us . Conservatives reliance on the invisible hand of an unregulated market to end hunger does n't  really hold much promise either but the fact remains if we continue as we have , without second coming of Christ , the hungry will always be with us . <p> What liberals have failed to adopt are two other means of ending hunger -- both means capable of providing sufficient motivation to do the global doable . One or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 goal to " half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger " and then end all hunger by 2016 . All that 's missing is the political will . <p> The two means are : <p> 1 . Basic Fear ( some may call it enlightened self interest ) . <p> 2 . Political Fear ( some may call it the rule of law ) . <p> Basic fear Any rational look a the costly local/global health , economic , security and environmental consequences of allowing hunger and malnutrition to continue will immediately convince any honest person that ending hunger is vital to our own survival , freedom and prosperity . Ending world hunger should be a U.S. national security priority even surpassing the war on terrorism in resource demands , military focus and political attention . It may surprise most liberals to know that our nations military recently added stability building as a new third core mission . This is the first change to its two original core missions in over 200 years . " Offence " and " defense " are now giving way to assisting failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality that prevention of conflict is far more cost effective than preemptive invasions or intrusive occupations . There is rational debate regarding the effectiveness and long term effects of military people doing the job of development professionalsbut at this time the military has the resources and the political mandate . And , they know as the late James Grant from UNICEF noted in 1990 , " The road to power for many of the worlds extremist movementsis paved with the unmet needs of the poor . " Liberals often refuse on principled ground , to use fear as a motivation for action . Even if its based on reality . Even if it works . <p> Political fear Any legal look at the lethal consequences of hunger should dictate that access to adequate food , like access to breathable air , is a basic human right . And anyone who denies food to the hungry is also depriving them of life , liberty and pursuit of happiness . Allowing people ( especially children , babies and even fetuses ) to suffering or dying from hunger or malnutrition should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering and death to persist should be held accountable . We have an international Criminal Court for those commit mass murder by genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanitybut no court yet to try those responsible for mass deaths ( mostly of children ) on a scale greater than all the genocides and wars combined . <p> Most liberals appear to shun this legal argument because of their own fear . Fear that others wont agree . Fear they might lose their job if they start touting legal ideals ahead of compassion . Fear of reaction from anti government conservatives . Fear of being seen as unrealistic . <p> But how realistic is it to think that real progress will be made doing the same thing liberal humanitarians have been doing for 30 years . Compassion is good . Its just insufficient to end hunger . <p> The near term difficulties of creating a world government willing and capable for holding political leaders accountable for economic crimes against humanity is obvious but not insurmountable . The only realistic option is pushing for reality based policy on the national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistour own security , our freedoms and our future prosperity are catastrophically endangered . <p> For less than 1/6 of what Americans spend gambling each yearworld hunger could be eliminated , and half the worlds infectious diseases could be wiped out . The latter done with the simple provision of clean water and safe sanitation , costing about 1/100 of what our great nation spent liberating Iraq . <p> Ending preventable childhood hunger , disease and disability globally really is n't an issue of money . The amount needed is embarrassingly small compared to current rescue packages . The proven solutions are cheap and available . <p> All that 's lacking is the political will to getr done . Especially now with political control of the White House , the Senate and the House of Representatives liberals will likely continue to believe their humanitarian sentiments are adequate for mobilizing the political will . They are wrong . <p> There are now a billion hungry people in the world hoping this will change . They are not alone . <p> Woolery is a member of the World Hunger Education Service board of directors . 
@@75400435 @4100435/ <p> Those who have seen the renowned photograph of three boys playing " war games " in Bosnia are likely to wonder about the emotional well-being of children exposed to and used in conflict . The image depicts one boy mockingly holding a handgun to his temple while another aims a pistol with a confident smirk on his face . The third boy shows off a perfect salute as he stands in their playground-- a bombed out garage . <p> Children as young as seven years old are participating in armed hostilities in countries all over the world , including the Balkans , Afghanistan , Northern Ireland , Colombia , Sierra Leone , and Burma . Some children volunteer as warriors but many are abducted or sold into service , where they are often abused and indoctrinated into a blind faith in their new mission . With efficiency in mind , government armies as well as opposition and rebel groups recruit impressionable and fearless boys and girls . <p> Photo : USAID/Lueders <p> " These ones , be afraid of them ; they are dangerous . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children . Do n't play with them , theirs is to fight .

Kamajohs are traditional hunters of the Mende tribe , who volunteer their service in defending their villages against rebel forces . After going through an initiation ceremony , Kamajohs believe they possess magical powers that deflect enemy bullets . <p> Children have been recruited into combat for a long time but usually as a supplement to an adult force . Increasingly , however , children are being used in place of adults . Requiring less food and less training , they also accept the poor conditions of war more readily than their adult counterparts . <p> Modern war also makes it easier to involve children than previously . Arms trade on an expanding international scale has allowed a proliferation of inexpensive weapons light enough for children to handle . New and improved anti-personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to wander . In many internal conflicts today , armies use children soldiers to explore extremely dangerous territory for the presence of landmines ahead of adult soldiers . <p> Photo : USAID/Lueders <p> Youths at USAID 's WAYS project in Harper , Liberia are learning trades firsthand as they assist in the renovation of the war-destroyed high school campus that will house the training project during the rainy season . After participating in the looting and destruction of villages and towns during the war , that direct contribution of these former child soldiers in rebuilding their communities is an integral part of the reconciliation and reintegration process . <p> The implication of involving children in war is no longer only about warfare but also about crime . Today 's conflicts are fueled by the need to protect wealth as well as territory . In Colombia , children learn all about drugs . In Sierra Leone , it 's diamonds . These " skills " set them up for a future in crime as they emerge from war remembering no other way of life . <p> Young stone-throwers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more proficient with an AK-47 than with a pencil . They have witnessed brutality and murder , becoming desensitized to suffering . The challenge for post-war societies is to assist these ex-combatants in turning away from gangs and crime and toward productive lifestyles as young adults . <p> It Takes a Coalition <p> Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that mothers and children are entitled to special care and assistance , and that all children have the right to social protection . Latest UN figures , however , estimate that more than 300,000 children under 18 years of age are participating in armed conflicts around the world . <p> Africa accounts for more than 40 percent of the world 's child soldiers . Angola , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Sudan , and Uganda are among the countries with the highest rates of child soldiers . Olara Otunnu , UN Special Representative for Children in Conflict , is dedicated to persuading parties to African conflicts to recognize the needs of children as they draft peace agreements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but universal , and fundamental . <p> According to current international law , children can be recruited into war from the age of 15 . The United Nations ' Convention on the Rights of the Child states that member countries must ensure that persons under 15 do not participate directly in hostilities . No international law or mandate , however , has recognized the existence of child soldiers or made provisions for their rehabilitation and reintegration into society . Furthermore , no peace agreement , to date , ending civil conflict in Africa has included a requirement for the demobilization of child soldiers . <p> The most significant action related to child soldiers is the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , which raises the minimum age for military recruitment and use in combat to 18 years . It awaits ratification . <p> In 1997 , UNICEF drafted the Cape Town Principles and Best Practices on the Recruitment of Children into the Armed Forces and on Demobilization and Social Reintegration of Child Soldiers in Africa . This document recommends actions to be taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protocol and end violations of children 's rights . A Conference on the Use of Child Soldiers held in Maputo , Mozambique in April , 1999 further emphasized these ideas and resulted in the Maputo Declaration on the Use of Child Soldiers . <p> In 1998 , six NGOs formed the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers to end the recruitment and participation of children below the age of 18 years in armed conflict . Key members of the coalition include Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , International Federation Terre des Hommes , International Save the Children Alliance ( represented by Swedish Save the Children ) , Jesuit Refugee Service , and Quaker UN Office . This group advocates for ratification of the Optional Protocol by taking concrete actions such as high-profile lobbying campaigns to protect and assist child victims of war . <p> The Coalition is also responsible for a worldwide campaign to increase awareness about child soldiers . RSdda Barnen ( Swedish Save the Children ) holds the world 's most comprehensive database on this subject and publishes information on the number of child soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Child Soldiers published a detailed report in April , 1999 assessing the extent of military recruitment and use of African children on a country-by-country basis . <p> The U.S. Campaign to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers supports the international effort by advocating for the U.S. government to join the ban on the recruitment and participation of children under 18 in armed conflict . This coalition is headed by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , Center for Defense Information , American Friends Service , and Youth Advocate Program International . These groups are also pressuring the U.S. government to raise its own enlistment age to 18 and to eliminate military aid that facilitates the use of child soldiers by others . As in the case of the land mines campaign , the United States is supportive of ending such atrocities in theory but unwilling to give up its own right to recruit 17-year-olds into the American armed forces . <p> The rapidly increasing level of attention focused on the topic of child soldiers is promising . The United Nations appointed Graca Machel , former Education Minister of Mozambique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Impact of Armed Conflict on Children . " The study , based on research and interviews in Africa , Latin America , Europe , and Asia , has set the tone for a series of international conferences , the most recent of which was held in Montevideo this past July , involving government representatives , the UN , NGOs , and aid workers . <p> A recent development is the unanimous signing by International Labor Organization ( ILO ) country delegates in June of a new ILO treaty . The ILO Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour specifically prohibits forced recruitment of children in armed conflict , as well as child slavery , prostitution and forced labor . <p> " Child " Defined <p> Even if the minimum age for recruitment and deployment in armed conflict is raised to 18 years , how can the law be enforced ? In some regions of the world , national legislation ( not to mention international law ) is n't always respected in practice . Government armies , civil defense groups and rebel forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Often the children used in conflict begin as guards and porters-- roles that seem acceptable . But they are quickly matriculated and able to strip and reassemble an assault weapon in no time . <p> Photo : USAID/Lueders <p> " T.S . " is 12 years old and he started fighting in 1992 after rebels raided his village , killed both his parents and abducted him . At that time the rebels told him that his " new job was to fight for freedom in Sierra Leone . " Typically , they would carry out attacks at daybreak . " The big man " ( unit commander ) would inject the younger boys with cocaine or have them ingest gunpowder , which also acts as a stimulant , before such raids . T.S . admitted that he " killed so many , mostly soldiers and specifically recalls that he raided a total of 29 villages along the Liberian border . After the raids , which often lasted an entire day , they were given " blue boats , " a narcotic that would make them sleep for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , T.S . left his faction and found his way to a safehouse for ex-combatants . However , because he suffered from nightmares and was " urinating the bed , " other non-combatants teased and beat him , so he left and joined rebel forces again . This happened twice before he returned and signed an agreement to never again take up arms . T.S . wants to learn any trade that he can . <p> Another challenge to enforcement is trying to confirm the age of young potential soldiers . In Africa , for example , documentation verifying the age of a child is not always available . Moreover , terminology such as " apparent age of 18 " is used in the national legislation of Kenya , Zambia and other countries regarding recruitment into the military , creating more ambiguities . <p> This issue of enforcement leads to the question " Is age 18 a western definition of a child ? " In many African societies , children perform adult jobs by necessity . They farm the land to help the family survive , dropping out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens are over . Traditional networks of social support make this reality acceptable , not abusive . <p> There is also the old saying " All 's fair in love and war . " By definition , war includes aggression , and atrocities are often a possible consequence . Through efforts to remove land mines and protect children from being recruited , are we trying to make our wars safer ? Yes , say the coalitions , the UN and others who assert that certain things are unacceptable , even in war . <p> The treaty to ban landmines is a clear example of the mobilization of moral outrage into effective action . If we are equally outraged by the fact that deploying children in conflict situations is an abuse of their human rights , then the Optional Protocol may have a chance . <p> Reorienting Lost Children <p> Focusing efforts solely on the level of international policy and law , however , is not enough . Even if a resolution were to be ratified , rogue governments and rebel groups might violate international law and continue to abuse children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise future societies will host traumatized adults unable to function and contribute . <p> UNICEF and others are doing much good work in this area . For example , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , UNICEF is currently running an experimental program that operates transit centers for former child soldiers . In Liberia , UNICEF and USAID operate the War-Affected Youth Support Project that involves demobilized youth in rebuilding their communities as a form of retribution for their actions during the war . <p> Photo : USAID/Lueders <p> Land mine victim begging in traffic , Central Luanda . After achieving independence from Portugal in 1975 , Angola entered a 16-year civil war between FMLA ( the government forces ) and UNITA ( rebel forces ) . Of the total population of 10.5 million , more than 3 million people were either displaced or directly affected by the war .

Churches , local NGOs , village chiefs , and traditional healers are involved in the USAID-supported Angola project , stressing community-based reintegration . Activities focus on reunification with families , returning to school , and acquiring job skills . <p> In Sierra Leone , where children became addicted to narcotics and witnessed some of the worst atrocities known , rehabilitation of child soldiers is desperately needed . Upon his return from a visit to Sierra Leone , Wole Soyinka , the Nigerian-born Nobel laureate , pointed out the options for dealing with child ex-soldiers : either to treat them as criminals or to reorient them to society . Suggesting the latter , he asked of the World Bank/IMF annual meeting participants , " But are African countries equipped to do this reorienting ? " <p> The World Bank has carried out significant research on indigenous healing of war-affected youth in Africa . Children who have survived torture , sexual abuse , and separation from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , suffer symptoms similar to the western label " post-traumatic stress disorder " . These symptoms include avoidance , insomnia , inability to concentrate , nightmares , aggressive behavior , and confusion . The programs of UNICEF , Save the Children , and others offer basic therapeutic techniques for war-affected children . The World Bank research concludes that these programs are more successful when integrated into locally based techniques for recovery and reintegration . <p> Many local techniques focus on the role of ancestral spiritual forces in healing affliction , and all involve the active participation of family and community in the healing process . Indigenous forms of mental health therapy , such as visiting a traditional healer , may be as effective as western psychotherapy in the case of war-affected children . According to the World Bank study , purification rituals in Angola are used in order to rid the ex-combatant of the contamination of war and death-- guilt , sin , and avenging spirits-- so that he may be accepted back into the family and community . <p> These " rites of transition " operate on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that they originate from local African communities makes them culturally acceptable and thus more sustainable . By integrating these techniques into the interventions of foreign NGOs and donors , an effective approach to the recovery of child ex-soldiers may be offered . <p> From advocacy in the United States to enforcement of legislation in Africa , there are several hurdles to overcome in the fight to protect children from being recruited and deployed in the world 's conflicts . The transformation of this idea into a respected norm over time is the only way to ultimately change the behavior of governments and other groups involved in war . In the meantime , African countries , with the assistance of external aid , are equipped to try to reorient their war-affected children . <p> Kellie Anderson is a Senior Research Analyst at the Africa Bureau Information Center , part of the Research and Reference Services Project of USAID , operated by the Academy for Educational Development .

Increasingly , the former disappear due to their neglect in agricultural policies , while globalization and the current IP rights regime strengthen the second at an accelerated pace . " This trend must be reversed : we need both systems for a successful approach to food security and climate change " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions to fulfill , and each corresponds to different needs " . De Schutter noted that improved certified varieties can produce high yields and may present certain desirable traits . But he insisted at the same time that farmers seed systems should be encouraged : " The vast majority of farmers still depend on these systems . Local varieties bred and selected by farmers are often well suited to the local agro-ecological environments . Moreover , no restrictions are imposed to the re-use of seeds , in the absence of intellectual property rights restrictions . " . <p> According to the Special Rapporteur , the strengthening of intellectual property rights at global level could result in improved certified varieties being unaffordable for the poorest farmers . But it creates other problems as well . " Experts I meet everyday in Brazil research institutions for example warn me about the fact that excessive IP rights are becoming an obstacle rather than an incentive for innovation . They say it is becoming harder and harder for public scientists to access and exchange genetic material " . And research is primarily oriented towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small farmers in poor countries . " Local indigenous communities of the Amazon have a hard time to convince research institutions to have significant research partnership on their seeds " . <p> " To have more innovation in the fields of small farmers , we need to ground our vision and our public policies on two fundamental principles . First , we need participation . When you combine the experience of small farmers who know their fields and their needs with the best of what science can offer , tremendous progress can be made . That is what happens with participatory plant breeding . Second , we must look beyond the seed and adopt a systemic approach to agricultural innovation . Improving plants is one thing , designing productive and resilient farming systems is another one . It requires a more holistic approach . Agroecological practices and innovations such as agroforestry , biopesticides or intercropping represent a huge untapped potential " . <p> Betting on farmers as innovators also makes economic sense .

Within two years , he was able to produce virus-free plants , leading to a doubling of productivity . " Thats what 's pro-poor breeding is . That 's where we should put our money . " <p> The Special Rapporteur provided journalists in New York with other examples of existing successful systems , such as farmers seed banks ( local seed exchange systems promoting agrobiodiversity ) , seed fairs , participatory plant breeding , and farmer field schools . " We must scale up these systems if we want to cope with climate change and reduce hunger at the same time " . <p> Olivier De Schutter was appointed the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in May 2008 at the peak of the global food crisis - by the United Nations Human Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@75400447 @4100447/ <p> ( April 18 , 2008 ) The rise in world food prices and its effects on poor people is a major concern . It is certainly one for Hunger Notes . Nonetheless , I , as Hunger Notes editor , have watched the emergence of the hunger crisis with concern , but also bemusement . The concern is for poor people , the bemusement is a response to the international response , including the World Bank , the IMF , and developed country governments . <p> The World Bank , the IMF , and the US and other developed countries have actually played a major role in creating the world food crisis . News storiessee our front page that suggest that they are promptly responding to the world food crisis completely miss this central point . Let me focus on the World Bank and the US governmentthe World Bank because it is ( nominally ) the major international institution focusing on helping developing countries , the United States ( government ) because it is actually the major international institution due to to its military and political power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken specific US government actions worthy of mention . <p> The World Bank and the US government , and the world food crisis : Cluelessness , dishonesty or straightforward responseyou be the judge <p> 1 . Why is either the Bank or the US government surprised about lack of agriculture production ? Both are aware of the statistics , the issues ( some of which are presented below ) , and the foreign assistance record . Considering first foreign assistance to agriculture , both the World Bank and the United States government know assistance to agriculture has fallen dramatically . Both had key roles in this decisionthe Bank as the largest donor and the US as ( more or less the largest developing country donor , and the more or less largest donor to the World Bank ) . Agriculture 's share of Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) , including funding from the World Bank , declined sharply from 1985-86 to 2005-06 , from over 12 to just 3.1 percent . 1 In absolute terms , support for agriculture went from a high of about $8 billion in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wanted to increase their support for agriculture and rural development , these declarations have not resulted in actual funding increases for agriculture , as Figure 1 below shows. 3 <p> In light of these figures , World Bank president Robert Zoellnicks response calling for a new deal was minimal , mainly oriented towards public relationswe are responding to the situation , and dishonest , partly because it called forth a major US response to a crisis in the past , Franklin Delano Roosevelts New Deal , as a fig leaf for a minimal program . <p> 2 . Both the World Bank and the US government know that their specific programs for agriculture have declined substantially . ( Tracking this is very difficult for an outsider . ) In the United States Agency for International Developments program , for example , there used to be what was termed a functional account for agriculture , along with other functional accounts such as health and education . With functional accounts , agriculture spending was easy to measure from year to year . USAID decided to get rid of functional accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation for foreign aid funds . Very possibly in large part as the result of this decision , all of the USAID development assistance account is now no more than the agriculture account was in past years . Evidentially USAID , within the US government budget process , was not able to obtain increased funding ( or even worse , did not want toUSAID is a team player in the US government foreign policy structure ) and thus USAID funding for agriculture has declined substantially . <p> 3 . The World Bank knowsshould know ? that its structural adjustment programs ( continuing from the 1980s to the present day and strongly supported by the IMF and the US and other country donors ) drastically reduced country government funding tor agriculture ( as well as other key sectors such as education and health ) . <p> 4 . The same World Bank structural adjustment programs also reduced fertilizer subsidies to poor farmers ( in the name of end subsidieslet the market provide ) . Unfortunately this approach not only did not increase , but substantially decreased fertilizer use in Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers is nearly non-existent , and increasing fertilizer use is a key part of the new Gates foundation agriculture initiative . It is possible to suggest that foreign aid creates a problem and then tries to solve it ! <p> 5 . The United States provides a large subsidy for ethanol production , diverting land from food production . In addition it and the European Union have major other farm programs negatively affecting farmers in developing countries . I am glad the US government is fearlessly speaking out against these subsidy programs ! <p> 6 . Genetically modified food . The United States government has been a strong supporter of genetically modified food . I believe that the United States government ( in this as other issues ) is in a very substantial degree acting in behalf of corporate interests , rather than for example the large religious community that thinks we should help the poorest people in the world . There are major issues involved in genetically modified food . I mention only one . The seeds are the property of the corporation which has patented and sells them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be purchased every year . This is a major and disastrous change . Seeds in developing countries ( and really everywhere before seed companies and GMOs ) are the result of harvests , kept by individual farmers ( and selected for their qualities ) , and replanted the next year . Now seeds are to be ordered from a corporation ? This is progress ? To set aside 10,000 years of fundamental human procedure , a procedure on which human civilization is based , seems to me to be the height of folly . <p> So for me World Bank and US concern for the world food and hunger crisis is crocodile tears. 
@@75400448 @4100448/ <p> The standard economic model of how things work is that people produce and exchange goods . Governments exist to provide " government goods " things that people can not provide for themselves , such as national defense . Thus the standard economic view is that activities are essentially productive . While this view has made for a thriving profession of economics , it is not a correct view of reality . The principal difficulty is that there is economic activity that is unproductive and harmful ( from the point of view of those being harmed ) , and that this is a key feature of the economic organization of societies . What follows is a brief analytical description of these societies . <p> Many societies are run on this basic set of principals . Take and maintain control of the government . Use powers of the government to obtain income . Key elements of this process are described in five sections : <p> The influence on development of poor nations is profound . For many governments , the government/people in the government , in spite of lip service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the country , but rather in helping themselves . This has had and continues to have a disastrous effect on development and the incomes of poor people . The final section of this article discusses this more fully . This article exists to provide an analytical framework to understand the situation and events in many countries , which , considered separately , may be confusing . <p> The basic idea and activity in productive societies is helping to produce goods things that are useful to someone food , light bulbs , cars and then exchanging the income received for goods that are desirable to you . This fundamental economic mechanism exists in " harmful " economic societies as well . Unfortunately , also existing , and why we describe these societies as harmful , a certain strata usually the top also exists to obtain goods through means which may be described as unproductive or extractive . <p> The principal ways in which income is obtained in a harmful economic system are twofold : 1 ) obtain it through the government , or , 2 ) use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are ( apparently ) obtained in other ways . The first is most typical or at least most evident in developing countries . Armed conflict--typically the fight for control of the government or territory , frequently with natural resources , by groups deserves a separate discussion , because it has been throughout history the principal way in which harmful economic societies have been established and because of its importance in the world today . <p> There are a wide variety of means in which government officials and others obtain revenue from the government . The first thing to recognize is that people at the top of government , or those who have significant control over the government but who are not government officials--often entrepreneurs or corporations ) can and do plunder resources coming into the government . Government revenue is often not devoted to productive services but siphoned off by those in control of the government . A nation expects that its national resources will be used for the benefit of the nation . However very large amounts of such revenue are often used to enrich those in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can plunder resources too , by not providing services which they are paid to provide , by charging for services which they should provide , or by taking goods , such as medical supplies or automobiles/trucks , which should be used for government service . <p> Corruption . One name for a particular type of the unproductive allocation of resources is corruption . <p> Government officials can get extra-official payments ( frequently very large but also often very small ) for carrying out , or not carrying out duties that they are paid for and obliged to perform as their duties as government officials . <p> The education minister has been touring schools to count the teachers . Photo : BBC <p> Pay for little or no work . Another concern is that government officials receive pay without delivering ( often anything near ) an adequate level of services . What they have done is support the current political system , not deliver government services . <p> Allocation of resources . The government frequently allocates resources , such as land and other natural resources such as oil , and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A very large part of this allocation/corruption is diversion of revenues from goods exported from or imported to the country . <p> The big ticket item is natural resource exports , including oil . One would think that discovering oil and being able to export it would enable governments in developing countries to provide sufficient resources for assisting poor people in that country to have education and health services and to provide productive employment . NOT ! In fact what HN has described as harmful economic systems mean that very little---a token amount-- gets to poor people . <p> This malnourished child was brought to a feeding center in Maradi in 2005 . Photo : Edward Parsons/IRIN <p> Elites obtaining resources from ordinary people has gone on throughout history . <p> There is also " private enterprise " harmful economic activity , where individuals , groups , and firms play a key role . Slavery would be an important example from the past . In the present , the term is " forced labor . " An invaluable International Labor Organization report , Forced Labor describes the various types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forced labor worldwide . <p> Crime and looting are examples of harmful economic activity in which poor people can participate . Crime , frequently a terrorist activity--using terror to obtain income ( " your money or your life " ) --happens everywhere . Even legitimate governments such as in the United States typically deal only partially with crime . Many neighborhoods in the United States are subjugated to gangs that sell drugs , kill people , and maintain control of their activities through intimidation and murder . This is frequently even more true in developing countries . Not only neighborhoods , such as Brazilian favelas , but also broad areas of a country can fall under the control of groups that essentially use force and intimidation to maintain control , though they may set forth an ideological justification for their actions . Colombian paramilitaries are an example . Drug cartels are a very important subset of " private enterprise " harmful economic activity where activities such as bribery , intimidation and murder are frequently employed . <p> A high level of " private enterprise " violence can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may restrict personal freedom , but also provides a more orderly society .

The people whose assets and income have been reallocated do n't  like this and thus there is the threat of revolution overturning the minority in benefit of the majority . This is prevented in a number of ways . <p> One way is by killing or imprisoning opponents . Opponents of the government kill or capture people as well . <p> Supporters of Zimbabwe 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change were taken by police from outside the headquarters of the MDC , in Harare , Zimbabwe , on Friday .

Photo : William Fernando Martinez/Associated Press <p> One favorite way of maintaining oppression is to stay in power for a long time , frequently by manipulating or subverting an ostensibly democratic legal framework . Election fraud/rigged elections is a principal way of staying in power . A second way certainly a very clear way of keeping people oppressed and unable to move to a situation that might be characterized as democratic , is terrorizing the subject population , including murder and torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise keeping them from being a source of unrest ( by such means as imprisonment , exile , or bribery ) . <p> The actions of Robert Mugabe and his government in stealing an election is a classic case of subversion of an ostensibly democratic framework . <p> Zimbabwe is a country where its President , Robert Mugabe , has used various means to stay in power for a long time . See Zimbabwe stories <p> There are two powerful ways of changing a harmful economic system--through revolution , or through democracy . Revolution has been the most common way to attempt to do so in the past--though frequently thwarted by successful opposition by the existing government and its allies or by a revolutionary movement evolving into an oppressive government . Currently the most frequently used method is by democratic change . See the further discussion under Reducing harm below . <p> This is very similar to preventing revolution . However , what is emphasized in this section is preventing overthrow by others who would maintain a structure of harm . There are two important issue areas : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structure of harm maintained ? <p> The struggle for control of the government <p> Armed Conflict . There are many examples of armed conflict in the world today . Examined more closely this conflict is typically over control of the government or specific territory--often territory with natural resources . Thus this conflict is over who will establish control over government/territory and subsequently over control over resources , including the power to tax , arrange oil leases , and so on . In conflict , in addition to the struggle for control over resources , there is typically great harm done to ordinary people , such as murder , amputation of limbs , rape , taking of family food and other resources . ( This can be so bad that an end to conflict , even if it then means establishment of an organized system of oppression , is preferable to people . ) <p> Revolution against an unjust government ( see section above ) also causes conflict . It is often difficult to decide if armed conflict is a way to gain resources , or a reasonable reaction against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is viewed as dismemberment of its territory . This in a particular circumstance is usually debatable , however it is possible to form an opinion based on the evidence . Were severe human rights violations in Bosnia , or Rwanda and Burundi justified for example ? Who is correct , the government of Sudan or the people of Darfur ? What is the current conflict in Somalia about ? <p> Armed conflict is ongoing in Sudan , principally in its Darfur region . The conflict has multiple roots and extends to Chad and the Central African Republic . Making sense of Chad by Alex de Waal ( February 7 , 2008 ) does a good job of describing the roots of the regional conflict . Also see Hunger Notes sectionDarfur on this region for further 2008. a and Chad . <p> The conflict in Somalia also has ethnic and multi-country roots . See Hunger Notes section on Somalia . <p> How is a structure of harm maintained ? <p> A key way is by controlling sources of wealth and then distributing the resulting income . Those who are responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively unusual way to maintain a structure of harm is to isolate the seat of the government from access by citizens , as Burma has done . <p> Seat of power : a government building in Naypyidaw , the city that Myanmars junta built from scratch to replace Yangon as the capital . Naypyidaw was built in secret by the ruling generals and announced to the public two and a half years ago , when it was a fait accompli . Photo : International Herald Tribune <p> Another way is " putting people down . " Typically minorities/ordinary people have been disparaged in some way--for their supposed ( lack of ) intelligence , personal appearance or for some other reason . People can be marginalized because of their skin color , ethnic origin , income level or indications of same , such as names This diminishes people 's sense of self-worth , and , combined with actual labor market discrimination based on the same sort of factors , is a major barrier to entry .

" Darryl Fears Washington Post October 19 , 2005 ( You will leave this site and be required to register once with the Post . ) <p> There are major international aspects to harmful economic systems . In fact many would say that international aspects are the most important . In order to focus attention on these international aspects , we mention these aspects in a separate section . However international aspects could as well have been included in specific sections above . <p> " The question as to who and what is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels . Firstly , the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmful economic systems has been enormous . Try to think about some of the consequences of what has been described above .

A recipe for disaster ! And we should not blame the victims--poor people across the world . Rather we should think about how we can help them . <p> War War , caused by armed groups seeking to control the government , or territory or resources , has devastated vast regions of the world , and more importantly , vast numbers of the people of the world . <p> Where is there major armed conflict now ?

Where has there been major conflict in the past which has abated ( in varying degrees ) , but which has still greatly affected the society and its progress ? The Democratic Republic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burundi , Sri Lanka , Peru , El Salvador , Guatemala , Northern Uganda , and Colombia--to name a few . Governments , including tax collection , essential public services , and a fair judiciary , are not easily reestablished after a war ( if they ever were established in the first place ) . <p> How many people live lives of greatly diminished productivity ( and happiness ) due to conflict ! <p> Unruly and often violent youth have set up illegal road blocks on several roads in the Rift Valley and western Kenya . Violence against local minorities including Kikuyus , Luos or Kalenjins , depending on the region of Kenya , has displaced an estimated 600,000 Kenyans to this point . Photo : IRIN <p> The past five centuries or so have seen considerable hardship for the people living in many ( now often past ) societies . Africans may be taken as a key example <p> The people of Africa--Sub-Saharan Africa-- have been injured greatly by the operation of the world economic/political system . This can be divided into three parts , slavery , " classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many slaves were taken from Africa ? What kind of social system--in Africa and in the world--permitted them to be taken ? ( Under what circumstances would you give your daughter or son up to slavery And if the answer is never--what circumstances would make your answer irrelevant ? ) Slavery and the accompanying social system imposed on Africa began in the 1600s and continued until the late 19th century and , to some extent , even today . <p> Imperialism . In addition of course to slavery there was a dividing up of the whole continent by England , France , Belgium , Spain , Portugal and Germany . Why should this be allowed ! Well of course it was , due to superior arms and organization , not to mention control of the relevant international organizations which " sanctioned " such things . So the people of the continent spent 100 plus years benefiting these developed nations through such means as exporting resources--gold , diamonds , and metals . <p> There has been a struggle for thousands of years by human beings in many different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one very important example , the world 's religions have worked to establish a set of principles for human relationships that were very much against oppression , and though the religions were persecuted for doing so , they did manage to establish at the very least a set of guidelines for human behavior . In all countries of the world there has been a struggle against injustice , and attempts , which have met with increasing success , to establish the societal frameworks for a more just and equitable society . This is a long ( and inspiring ) story which we can not recount here . The current efforts in the world to reduce harm include reducing corruption , moving to more democratic governments with established rights and processes ( by means such as reducing the influence of the military and improving the fairness of elections--and having them ! and reducing police brutality ) , and , internationally , reducing the advantages which developed nations have assigned to themselves through their control of international institutions , such as United Nations , the World Bank , and the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been important efforts to have elections that express the will of the people and to implement policies that reflect an electoral mandate .

@@75400456 @4100456/ <p> The basic idea and activity in productive societies is helping to produce goods things that are useful to someone food , light bulbs , cars and then exchanging the income received for goods that are desirable to you . This fundamental economic mechanism exists in " harmful " economic societies as well . Unfortunately , also existing , and why we describe these societies as harmful , a certain strata usually the top also exists to obtain goods through means which may be described as unproductive or extractive . <p> The principal ways in which income is obtained in a harmful economic system are twofold : 1 ) obtain it through the government , or 2 ) use the government to maintain , consolidate and increase sources of income that are ( apparently ) obtained in other ways . The first is most typical or at least most evident in developing countries . <p> Armed conflict--typically the fight by groups for control of the government or territory ( frequently ; possessing natural resources ) , deserves a separate discussion , because it has been throughout history the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its importance in the world today . <p> Obtaining income through the government There are a wide variety of means in which government officials and others obtain revenue from the government . The first thing to recognize is that people at the top of government , or those who have significant control over the government but who are not government officials--often entrepreneurs or corporations ) can and do plunder resources coming into the government . Government revenue is often not devoted to productive services but siphoned off by those in control of the government . A nation expects that its national resources will be used for the benefit of the nation . However very large amounts of such revenue are often used to enrich those in charge of the government . People at lower levels of government can plunder resources too , by not providing services which they are paid to provide , by charging for services which they should provide , or by taking goods , such as medical supplies or automobiles/trucks , which should be used for government service . <p> Corruption . One name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption . Corruption can occur in various ways . <p> Government officials can get extra-official payments ( frequently very large but also often very small ) for carrying out , or not carrying out duties that they are paid for and obliged to perform as their duties as government officials . <p> Pay for little or no work/inefficient delivery of services . Another concern is that government officials receive pay without delivering ( often anything near ) an adequate level of services . What they have done is support the current political system , not deliver government services . <p> Above a busy intersection in Mexico City , a billboard tallies Mexican education funds wasted since the first day of school last month . According to this new " abuse meter " about $2.8 billion annually goes into the pockets of 298,174 no-show teachers and administrators who collect pay without working .

The government frequently allocates resources , such as land and other natural resources such as oil , and and business opportunities , directly to itself and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is diversion of revenues from goods exported from or imported to the country . <p> The big ticket item is natural resource exports , including oil . One would think that discovering oil and being able to export it would enable governments in developing countries to provide sufficient resources for assisting poor people in that country to have education and health services and to provide productive employment . NOT ! In fact what HN has described as harmful economic systems mean that very little---a token amount-- gets to poor people . ( See resource curse Wikipedia especially the corruption section for further information . ) <p> An excellent annual report on this issue is The Resource Governance Index , Access the 2013 report . <p> The Index measures the transparency and accountability in the oil , gas and mining sector of 58 countries worldwide and finds that the vast majority surveyed fail to meet satisfactory standards in how their natural resources are governed .

Revenue Watch Institute <p> Inflation and currency devaluation Though neither inflation nor currency devaluation are necessary a sign of the government obtaining resources to promote its own interests , both can be . Large deficits ( governments spending much more money than they take in typically lead to both inflation and devaluation , and is frequently due to government desire to control resources . <p> Use the government to maintain , consolidate and increase sources of income that are ( apparently ) obtained in other ways . This is more difficult to understand . Slavery would be an important and relatively clear example . The slave-owner is able to obtain an increased income from his slave 's labor .

Production can be for one 's own use , such as subsistence agriculture . In the modern world , most production is for exchange .

Sexual contact is the major means of HIV infection , with mother to child transmission a consequence of sexual contact .

These swarms will invade the Sahel in West Africa during June and July and lay eggs in areas that receive rain in southern Mauritania , Mali , Niger , and Chad . These will be supplemented by adult groups and swarms that form in currently infested areas in northern Mauritania and Niger . Crops planted on the first rains may be threatened .

Why did this change occur ? The most recent estimate , released on October 14 , 2009 by FAO , says that 1.02 billion people are undernourished , a sizable increase from its 2006 estimate of 854 million people . The increase has been due to three factors : 1 ) neglect of agriculture relevant to very poor people by governments and international agencies ; 2 ) the current worldwide economic crisis , and 3 ) the significant increase of food prices in the last several years which has been devastating to those with only a few dollars a day of total income to spend . 1.02 billion people is 15 percent of the estimated world population of 6.8 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Explain all of the things that Hunger Notes does to help stop world hunger . The principal thing that we do is inform people about world hunger .

We also contribute some money , through our hunger quiz LONG ... to organizations that are directly involved in helping poor and hungry people . We also encourage people to contribute to organizations assisting hungry people and to take some action against hunger , such as political action . See our section You can !

We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are taking to reduce hunger we do not know , but our impact consists in helping them understand and take action to reduce hunger . <p> 4 . Do you think that everybody can help stop world hunger ? If so , how could they help ? <p> Everyone can help reduce world hunger . The three basic actions that we suggest are--learn more about hunger--contribute financially to an organization working to reduce hunger--spend some of your time working with an organization that is trying to reduce hunger , such as a local food bank , or an organization such as Bread for the World that tries to get the US government to adopt policies to reduce hunger . <p> In the words of the old poem : Little drops of water Little grains of sand Make the mighty ocean And the beauteous land Little deeds of kindness , Little words of love , Make our earth an Eden , Like the heaven above <p> 5 . Do you think that population is one of the main reasons that world hunger is caused ? Why or why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world is straining the world 's resources . Less population would mean less of a strain . Another major source of the strain is the great inequality in world income and command over resources . The poorest people in the world are much poorer than people in the United States and elsewhere in the world . We estimate that hungry people in the world live on an average of $1.25 per day . The median household income in the United States in 2006-08 is $50,233 and the average household size was 2.61 family members ( see Census Bureau United States Fact Sheet ) . Doing some division , income per person per day in the United States is $54.77 . Thus , , the average person in the United States has 43 times more income than hungry people in the world . So it would not be correct , we believe , to consider only population as a factor . ( Expressed simplistically , something like " if only hungry people would not have so many children , there would be less hungry people . ) How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including number of children , to reduce hunger , is not a question that can be answered in a few sentences , though it is a fundamental question . <p> Editor , Hunger Notes <p> ( November 28 , 2009 ) Dear Hunger Notes , I am doing a paper , and I was wondering how many people in Africa could be fed with $250 million . Your help would be greatly appreciated . Thanks ! LJ <p> Dear LJ , <p> How many people in Africa could be fed with $250 million dollars ? This is a great basic question--thanks very much for asking it . Although this is a simple question , I do n't think the answer is given anywhere . I will give two answers from differing perspectives . <p> The first answer is based on basic calculations . $1.25 a day is the lowest poverty level that is measured ( by the World Bank ) . At this level of income , a high percentage is spent on food , say $1 per day . So , the number of people that could be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person , or 68,493 people . This is feeding at a very basic level , and with no distribution costs--which are typically many times the cost of the actual food . <p> The second answer is based on World Food Program ( WFP ) estimates of expenditures and beneficiaries . WFP says that in 2008 donors contributed $5 billion that went to alleviating hunger for an estimated 102 million people , or $50 per person . ( See WFP 2009 Annual Report , p 4 LONG ... ) So $250 million would feed 50 million people . WFP is clearly not bearing all the food costs for the entire year for the 102 million people that it served . <p> I hope this is helpful and not just confusing ! <p> Editor , Hunger Notes <p> ( November 20 , 2009 ) Dear Hunger Notes , I would like to know the answer to some questions about whether a vegan lifestyle would influence world hunger . <p> If keeping animals for meat and dairy products takes lots of space and raises the price of crops , that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that world hunger would be practically solved if the majority of people became or vegan ? Would n't the promotion of veganism be the ultimate solution for world hunger ? Which method would help eliminate world hunger more , sponsoring a charity or adopting a vegan lifestyle ? <p> Thank you very much for reading ! <p> Sincerely yours , MA <p> Dear MA , Sorry for the delay in replying . Everyone having a vegan lifestyle would certainly reduce world hunger , but it would , in my view , by no means end hunger . Thank you for raising this important issue which does require some thought ! <p> If everyone were vegetarian/vegan , it would certainly free up quite a bit of land and other resources for the production of plants directly for humans rather than for feeding animals which are then used for human food . As a ballpark estimate , it takes 10 pounds or more of grains to produce one pound of meat . So eliminating meat would provide the ability to produce much more grain directly for human consumption . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this as a way to end world hunger ? <p> A major part of the world hunger problem is that those who are hungry are very poor . The poorest people--about 1 billion people-- live on $1.25 a day or less . This lack of income of the poorest people is the major cause of hunger , we believe . ( See World Hunger Facts LONG ... for a longer explanation . ) It would still be a major problem even if everyone in the world was vegan . <p> The poorest people in the world are much poorer than people in the United States and throughout the world . The median income in the United States ( in 2007 , see Wikipedia LONG ... is $50,233 . Making the necessary adjustments to compare these numbers directly , it turns out that the average person in the United States has 37 times more income than hungry people in the world . In light of this , what might happen if everyone in the United States became vegan ? It certainly might be--and I certainly think it would be--that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts completely or even significantly to produce food for hungry people . Farmers would produce other agricultural products for people with more money than the poorest . A clear example would be ethanol for US consumers with cars . Notwithstanding the previous statement , a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle in the entire world would produce a significant decline in agricultural prices , which would benefit the poorest people , though not nearly enough to end hunger , in my assessment . <p> A key value of vegans is compassion for other living things . This value , if we try to apply it through the complexity of the world and its behaviors , will lead to a dramatic reduction in hunger . I do n't think that one action , such as adopting a vegan lifestyle--as important as this would be--is the only answer necessary . Thus I think we have to act to end hunger in various ways , and contributing to a charity would be a second important way to reduce hunger . The ' golden rule ' is " do unto others as you would have others do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " do as you would have others do . " Certainly contributing to charity and being a vegan does provide a valuable example for others . <p> Editor , Hunger Notes <p> ( November 5 , 2009 ) Dear Hunger Notes , <p> I have been reading through the website , and I wanted to know is there any way I can get more information on the fact that starvation/hunger is a problem from not having water , and solutions that could help to support the development of world hunger . Thanks ! VW <p> Dear VW , Thank you for an excellent question . <p> There is a reasonably clear relationship between the supply of water and hunger . The basic fact is very clear . If there is not enough water , plants ( and animals ) die , and the food that humans depend on will not be available . I do n't know that that your question about water and hunger has been summarized in a brief form . <p> A major cause of hunger has always been drought . This of course is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program website to see how it classifies food emergencies . Many are due to drought . The World Food Program is a very large international organization that responds to food emergencies . Go to its website at www.wfp.org and type in drought in the search box in the upper right hand corner of that page . This gives the areas where WFP thinks that drought is important . An important additional fact to add is that there are many areas in the world where food production is very limited due to scarce water resources . There are a lot of arid and semi-arid places in the world where people live and where lack of water limits food production , but where the water shortage is not acute enough and/or widespread enough to involve the World Food Program . <p> Solutions . <p> We are talking about fresh water . There is plenty of salt water , but it ca n't be used as is for crops , land-dwelling animals , or humans . The two principal natural sources of fresh water are the sky , and a river system ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and times where it falls in abundance through the river course to the sea . ( There are other sources of fresh water as well including ground water and desalination . ) <p> There are , to our mind , no easy solutions . Two major problems are deforestation and climate change . <p> Deforestation : Forests ( and , in general , non-agricultural ecosystems ) create their own , much wetter , climate and ecosystem . Much of the rain that falls on cropland will be evaporated by the sun . A significantly larger amount of rain that falls in a forest will not be evaporated but will be retained by the soil or contribute to river flow . Yet in the past 50 years there has been great deforestation in Africa , Asia and Latin America , which has and will reduce available water in these geographical areas . ( Europe and the United States went through their own deforestation much earlier . ) <p> Climate change is leading to a hotter climate which does various things , including reducing available water . <p> Major solutions proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available water , including conservation methods such as storing and rationing water . --Reducing the amount of greenhouse gases , which will slow the worldwide temperature increase . <p> In summary , I think that water scarcity will continue to increase rapidly .
