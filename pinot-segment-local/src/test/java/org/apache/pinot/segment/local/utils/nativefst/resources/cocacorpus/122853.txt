Generally though , talent will prevail and those with the appropriate experience and skills are most likely to succeed . If you have already put in some seriously hard graft for your career and are ready to start out on your own , we 've set out a few tips ... <p> Firstly , the best people to give you advice are those that have been freelance for a few years . If you already know some freelance journalists , consider it an investment to take one or more of them out for lunch ( freelancers are not likely to turn down a free lunch ) and ask them for their insight and experience . <p> Consider joining an online community for freelance journalists . It is a great way of gleaning useful tips , but use them wisely . Posting a question about how to get work or the name of the Independent 's commissioning editor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious journalist , you wo n't have to ask . <p> Generally , groups are friendly and supportive and if you ask intelligent questions , you will be surprised by how much effort and detail people are prepared to put into their replies . One day when you are hammering away in a bedroom office miles from anywhere and anyone , you will really appreciate being part of a chatty , professional network . <p> Journalism.co.uk runs a freelance database with over 400 members and perks such as a branded email address and discounts on our training courses . The NUJ also operates a freelance directory for its freelance members . <p> And of course there are no shortage of websites , including journalism.co.uk , that offer news and information about the practice of freelance journalism . <h> Training courses and resources <p> It is never too late to learn . Journalism.co.uk has a comprehensive list of short training courses on its site , which cover all areas of journalism ( and some others too ) . We also run one day courses in London and evening courses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and essential journalism skills . <p> Check out this collection of podcasts highlighting the skills needed to succeed in the industry today , as well as pitching and finance advice for freelancers and student journalists who want to see their work published . <h> Looking for work <p> Get yourself out there ! Do not wait for the phone to ring . <p> Target some suitable publications , look at the kind of thing they publish and identify what they might need . Many freelancers aim too high to start with , hoping for work on the national papers . But there is much more chance of getting work on specialist titles , especially if you have relevant knowledge and experience , and business-to-business ( B2B ) titles often pay well . <p> Find out the name of the commissioning editor at the organisation you are pitching and do n't be afraid to pick up the phone and give them a call " even if it seems easier to tweet them . <p> " It 's never as bad as you think it 's going to be , " Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " If you do manage to get the commissioning editor 's number then have your pitch ready to hand and be direct with it . <p> " It may be that they then ask you to email your idea , which is fine and just make sure that your email is direct , to the point , business like , " he said . <p> Make sure you double-check the spelling , even if the names look simple at the first glance . " You do n't want to be sloppy in your pitch or you 'd be sloppy in your journalism , " explained Ellie Levenson , freelance writer and journalism trainer . <p> It is an uncomfortable but undeniable truth of the industry that getting work often depends on luck , and on who you know " so when you start out , email everyone you have ever worked for . <p> Finally , you will inevitably receive knock-backs . Take them on the chin ; remember that author JK Rowling was rejected by 16 publishers before Bloomsbury published her Harry Potter novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might also need to discuss more detail like possible libel problems , blasphemy or special insurance for war zones , for example . <p> But usually the basics are the subject , angle , number of words , deadline and interviewees . <p> " It 's about being clear , and firming up anything that 's important to you , " said Sutcliffe . <p> " Making deals is important whatever stage of your career and whatever the medium . " <p> Even if this is your first professional byline , do not be afraid to ask for payment . " This is a really difficult thing to ask when people are starting out , but I think you should include a question about what you will be paid in your pitch , " said Holmes . <h> Making an offer they can not refuse <p> Before negotiating rates , do your research . Find out what the publication pays others , be clear about how much time you will spend and what your expenses will be . <p> The magic phrase is : " What are you offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timorous - be positive and humorous , and open up the topic in whatever way is comfortable to you . " <p> Commissioning editors usually have some amount of flexibility " so whatever rate they suggest can probably be increased . Do not be afraid to point out your own expertise , your unique contacts and how much work is involved . By negotiating confidently , said Sutcliffe , you could up your rate by as much as 150 per cent " and if they like your idea and approach you already have the upper hand . <p> " Do n't think you 're an underdog that should be grateful for the work , " he said . <p> " This is a business relationship and you are providing a service they want . It 's about confidence . And smile " it will help your tone of voice . " <p> You can find out more about the rates certain titles pay " as well as who actually pays in the first place " in online communities such as JournoAnswers . <h> Finances and tax <p> The good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is you do not have a salary either , and you will spend a staggering amount of time chasing unpaid invoices . <p> Variously due to incompetence , inefficiency and occasional downright theft , chasing money from elusive publishers and accounts departments is the bane of a freelancer 's life . <p> It is quite understandable that , as someone with talents in writing , editing and journalism , you may not be a natural accountant but to survive as a freelancer you must be able to manage your money . <p> Aim to set a 30-day limit for both delivering your work and getting paid . Keep in touch with the accounts department and develop a good system for chasing up unpaid invoices " every Monday morning , for example . One useful trick is to state in the contract that copyright for your work does not pass to the publisher until the bill has been paid . <p> Payments are likely to come in spasmodically , but at home your bills will go out regularly so you will need a financial cushion to help bridge any gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sickness cover because , as a freelance , a long stretch of illness would mean no income . <p> And in the distance , you also need to consider setting up your own pension " something else that would usually be provided in a staff job . <p> " You do n't want to be out there still cranking out work because you did n't make any plans for your retirement , " said Sutcliffe . <h> The tax-man cometh <p> Tax need not be as horrendous as you might think . Before you do anything else , tell the tax office that you are now self-employed , and get hold of the ' Thinking of working for yourself ' leaflet ( SE1 ) . Also check out the HMRC website or call the newly self-employed helpline on 0300 200 3504 . <p> As a freelance , you will pay tax on your profits - what is left after expenses have been deducted from your earnings . Expenses include things like the cost of office space , consumables , advertising and travel . <p> It means getting into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and grappling with an annual self-assessment tax form . <p> You will pay your tax in two lumps the following year , so if you have a good year remember to put enough aside . You also need to pay national insurance contributions and , if you earn more than -81,000 annually , you will have to register to pay VAT . <h> Copyright <p> Copyright is what Sutcliffe calls " a bread and butter kind of thing " . Whatever you make or produce " not the idea , but the actual piece of work " belongs to you , so when you create work for someone else , be clear about how they are allowed to use it . <p> It is normal to agree the right to use your work once in one medium and one territory - first British serial rights , for example . Anything beyond that , such as if the publisher wants to use your work online as well as in print , should cost more . <p> Sutcliffe advised the group of a number of sneaky tricks occasionally employed by unscrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheque does not mean that you accept their terms of use , and do not be tempted to agree to ' assign ' your rights for a piece to publishers - hardened freelancers equate that to selling the freehold of your work for the price of a month 's rent . <h> The culture shock <p> If that does not all seem too daunting , there is still a health warning : freelance journalism is extremely tough . Freelancing requires a certain aptitude , and it will not suit everyone . If you like a regular wage and paid holidays " think again ! <p> Working freelance means learning to live with uncertainty , even though a staff job is not necessarily more secure . Freelancing can lead to psychological strain because of the constant deadlines , money worries and the pressure of having to perform consistently at your best when interviewing and writing . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

The topic under discussion may be clandestine but the graft put into researching and uncovering the story rarely is . <p> " Sometimes that may be part of what you do but it 's not really the essence of it , " he said . " People need to be crystal clear that the essence of what you do is hard intellectual work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What you 're doing in this kind of journalism is enquiring , " he said . " It 's trying to establish as close as you can the truth of what has gone on and to do that it 's not just a question of collecting statistical data but also people 's testimony and observed events and , from many people 's experiences and involvement in something , piecing together the whole . " <p> If I had to give any advice for someone who wanted to do investigative work , it would be to just start doing itMarshall Allen , Pro Publica <p> " The real purpose is to up-scale the general public in terms of their knowledge of what goes on in our society and in so doing help people to be more active participants and effective citizens . That is our function . " <p> But where do you start ? <p> Training vs experience <p> Paul Lewis , the Guardian 's Washington correspondent who was the special projects editor in London before his move , began as a trainee at the Guardian after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Marshall Allen , a reporter at investigative site Pro Publica , was working in a Christian ministry before switching to a small paper in Los Angeles when , in his late 20s , he realised that he wanted to pursue journalism . <p> Prior to embarking on their journalism careers , neither had undertaken official training , but instead based their work on initiative and curiosity . They saw stories and looked into them with the time and tools available . <p> " If I had to give any advice for someone starting out who wanted to do investigative work , one bit would be to just start doing it , " said Allen . <p> " Sometimes you think that you have to do a massive , in-depth , year-long investigation that reveals some amazing finding that gets people fired , or gets companies shut down , or gets people thrown in jail . Those stories are really few and far between . I think developing an investigative mindset from the start is really the key to developing investigative skills . " <p> Allen was attending city council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses and writing " two or three stories a day " for a small , twice-weekly paper in a suburb of Los Angeles . The first stories were basic news pieces on a quick turnaround but being at the meetings would open his eyes to potential leads from the community . <p> " Maybe if parents had complaints about something the school district was doing , you can still dig in to a story like that and give it a real punch , " he said . <p> " You can just take what people tell you on face value or you can actually investigate what they tell you and find out whether what they tell you is true or not , whether they 're manipulating you or not and then report it in an accurate , straight-forward way that represents the public . " <p> For Allen , the important thing is to just get started . Attending local meetings can start the ball rolling for small local stories that may be worth pursuing , but social media is also now often a platform for people to air their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists a way to reach communities and stories they may not otherwise . <p> Hird said that gaining a journalism qualification can help to distinguish you from others . But , he said , the determining factor will always be the stories , so he stressed getting experience as early as possible to prove to employers that you are serious and to understand what the job entails . <p> " I think the essential requirements are a lot of curiosity , a lot of skepticism and a capacity to do the three things that are essential , " Hird said , " which are test a hypothesis , analyse all the information and evidence and data , and synthesise that into a story well told . " <p> Some necessary skills <p> The digital revolution and Freedom of Information Act have made information much more freely available , said Hird , while governments and companies are more attuned to the methods by which they could be investigated . <p> So what skills should an investigative journalist have in the 21st century ? Statistical analysis ? Computer wizardry ? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people who have very analytical brains and are good at reading through reports and footnotes and cross-referencing and doing the methodical , forensic stuff , " Lewis told Journalism.co.uk , while still special projects editor . " That can be very important to investigative reporting , like sifting through company accounts or trying to decipher complex documents , but at the same time it can be really useful to be good at understanding people and being persuasive and getting people to trust you . <p> " They 're all useful skills to have and I do n't think there 's any journalist who 's good at all of it . I think it 's important to use what you have to your advantage . " <p> Data analysis can provide you with the skeleton to the story but to really put meat on the bones you need all the on-the ground reportingMarshall Allen , Pro Publica <p> Using and understanding social media is vital , said Lewis , and being able to search the internet with a little more acuity than a standard Google search , but personal skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The recent advent of Wikileaks and big data has drawn attention to that type of journalism , but stories driven by more traditional skills are still common . In 2010 , for example , Lewis began working on a story that saw him and a colleague spend three years painstakingly building the trust of sources and pursuing the truth . <p> " It began with the case of Mark Kennedy " , Lewis explained . As an undercover police officer , Kennedy spent seven years infiltrating environmental activist groups . " One of the first things we did there was not write anything , " Lewis said . <p> He quickly approached Kennedy 's friends in the environmental movement , but they were so shocked by the revelations that they did not want to speak to the press . Two and a half months later the first story about Kennedy was printed and more contacts started to approach Lewis and his colleague at the Guardian , Rob Evans . <p> " Of the number of sources that came forward one of them is Peter Francis , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has helped as a confidential source up until about a week and a half ago when he became an on-the-record named source . And I would imagine that time has helped to establish that trust , " he said . <p> The episode of Dispatches , which carried allegations relating to a number of different undercover police tactics , was based largely on testimony from Francis " himself an undercover officer " and other sources that took time , trust and patience to develop . <p> This cultivation of sources is mirrored in Allen 's work , both in what he did in his early days and in what he now does at ProPublica , but some stories require a solid foundation of evidence backed up by personal statements . <p> " Both data and interviews are very important , " Allen said . " In any story you want to be able to quantify the problem , which does often involve data analysis and statistics and getting very detailed . If there 's no data available then you want to find some way to quantify things but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide you with the skeleton to the story but to really put meat on the bones and flesh it out you need to also do all the on-the-ground reporting that you would more traditionally think of in journalism . " <p> The importance of a team <p> Almost without exception , investigative journalism is a team effortChristopher Hird , the Bureau of Investigative Journalism <p> Allen has a colleague who helps with much of the data analysis and Lewis , despite moving to the US , still runs a Guardian blog with Evans about undercover policing . The " lone wolf " image of some investigative journalists is another misconception , said Hird , and although it is possible to pursue smaller stories alone , as Allen did , bigger stories often require more hands on deck . <p> " I do think that , almost without exception , investigative journalism is a team effort , " Hird said . " A lot of journalism is a team effort . It is certainly my experience that the quality of the work is likely to be higher if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> This is not just about the sharing of skills and specialisms , he said , but about making sure all the possible angles are covered . <p> " It 's also a question of creating an environment where you 're constantly testing what the hypothesis is . Do we need more information ? Have we ignored anything ? Does it make sense ? It 's much easier if there 's more than one of you . " <p> Lewis agreed . <p> " Speaking personally , " he said , " I think there 's a huge amount to gain from other people because you can bounce things off them and you can have a second opinion before you make every decision and I think that 's invaluable . There are people with great judgement but we can all make mistakes and I think that chance is diminished when there are two of you . " <p> Finding a supportive and talented team is easier said than done but if you start from the position that you are in and do what you can with what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are editors who are looking for really good stories , it does n't matter if they know you or not , " he said .

In the UK , however , unlike the US , there is still some confusion around who is responsible for user-generated content on a news site , and some news organisations take this route to try to cover themselves under the EU Commerce Directive hosting exemption . But in practice , legal rulings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an extremely grey legal area . In the main , brands take their duty of care very seriously , and agree that it is important to moderate thoroughly , to protect the brand 's own reputation and , of course , its users . <p> Moderating comments on Twitter <p> Of course , you can not moderate what people say on Twitter " and creating hashtags for particular subjects can be a risk , as there is no way of moderating a live feed . What you can do is to moderate Twitter feeds that are pulled into websites , to avoid being brandjacked ' on your site or Facebook page . <p> Blocking comments completely <p> Blocking comments completely is an option in some cases , for example those stories most likely to incite a strong reaction from the community , or on coverage of a legal case . The Portland Press Herald blocked user comments entirely in late 2010 , in response to ' vile , crude , insensitive and vicious postings ' . ( That policy has since been reversed and comments are enabled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of each comments page . ) <p> But there is a real difference between negative and abusive comments . Inviting commentary on news articles will generate differences of opinion and healthy debate . Views that disagree with those of the news organisation should be accepted ( and actually help to make the site feel authentic , open and honest ) . But there is no need to put up with abuse , personal comments or spam . Equally , libellous comments should be removed . Although in the US publications are not legally responsible for libellous postings on their sites ( unless altered by the organisation " see our legal section , below ) , this is a more grey area in the UK , and it is good practice to remove anything that could drag you or your users into a court of law . <p> The future for social news <p> There is an excellent article in the Economist which claims that news is going back to its traditional roots before mass media : a time when it was spread through word of mouth in coffee houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house conversations are now held on Facebook , and Twitter has replaced the pamphlet . But the basic human behaviour " sharing information and views on current events " has not changed . <p> While of course social media does not cause revolutions , it plays a part in communicating those revolutions to the outside world , faster than we have ever known ( and in doing so facilitates them , provides critical mass to nascent movements ) . A consumer with a mobile phone is as likely to provide that front page story as a journalist in situ . The traditional news model " one way communication of news " has shifted for good . But consumers are still seeking out reliable news sources over these new channels , just as journalists are seeking out reliable sources . <p> Managed properly , the engagement between news media and consumers could benefit both sides immeasurably . <p> About Tamara Littleton <p> Tamara Littleton ( @tlittleton ) is CEO and founder of social media management agency eModeration , which works with some of the biggest brands in the world , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oprah Winfrey Network and BBC Worldwide . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847098 @2047098/ <p> Over the past five months , the BBC has been rolling out a tool called Stitch to World Service bureaux , to enable journalists to easily reversion visual materials in English as well as create their own videos for their audiences on social platforms . <p> Stitch is an in-house project from BBC News Labs , developed by Kirill Skorodelov . It is designed as a web interface with various video and graphics templates available , that can be used to create tailored visuals for platforms such as Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , in a bureau 's own language . <p> All editors or producers have to do to start using Stitch is log in with their BBC credentials and fill in a web form . They can then choose between two options : reversioning an existing video from their bureau or from the central English-language content hub by adding subtitles and graphics using the existing templates ; or creating their own templates using the admin tool , which everyone else can re-use . <p> The tool 's existing templates include : vertical , horizontal and square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact numbers , or photos with key figures written over the image ; and ' vimages ' , which are pictures overlaid with audio . <p> More than 300 journalists from different bureaux have been using Stitch and their feedback so far has been positive . Since the reversioning process requires less specialised skills compared to editing using tools such as Adobe Premiere and Adobe AfterEffects , it has allowed smaller bureaux to " increase their video output by a significant amount " , said Allison Shultes , engagement producer at BBC News Labs , in an email to Journalism.co.uk . <p> Enis Senerdem , social media editor for BBC Turkish , said he and four other people on his team are currently using Stitch after getting started with the tool in December , and the two templates they have been using the most are ' vimages ' and the square , 45-second slideshow videos . <p> " We 'll probably use vimages a bit more now because of the referendum in Turkey on 16 April , and the format will be handy as we 're going to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to make a video with Stitch , Senerdem added , and because the process is faster and more flexible , his team has been able to produce more videos and consequently , increase engagement on social media . For example , he said that in the seven days prior to 17 March , video views on Facebook were around three million , a 20 per cent increase from the previous week . <p> Rafael Chacon , social media editor for BBC Mundo , has also been using Stitch in his team since it became available . At the beginning , the tool was just a way to quickly reversion material from the central hub into Spanish , he said . <p> It also gave him control over the videos , because " if you make a mistake , you can go back and correct it yourself and you are not affecting the work of anyone or wasting anyone 's time " . <p> But he soon discovered the tool 's other useful features , such as the option to add subtitles and the other visual templates available that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the central team offers " . <p> " It keeps the look and feel of the BBC brand across everything , which is very useful . <p> " If I create an image with impact numbers , I 'll post it to Instagram and then from there I will share it to Facebook , where I will add the link to the full story in the description or the comments . <p> " It 's a visual way of attracting more people to a story that could be more complex . For example I did a story about Trump 's tax returns , so this was a different way to promote it and get people 's attention . " <p> Even though he stressed the tool is " not an editing tool " and is not there " to create a more complex package with additional multimedia elements and footage " , there have been instances where he has encouraged the video team to use it too , alongside the rest of the social media producers on his team , which operates on a rota basis . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offering something and he does n't have to do it , so I can just provide the file and he can create the content easily . <p> Chacon said he is enthusiastic about the opportunities Stitch provides for individuals to create their own templates , which other people can then tailor to their specifications .

@@97847100 @2047100/ <h> How to : get started in journalism <p> At Journalism.co.uk we often report on news which may be of more interest to reporters and editors already in the newsroom . In this guide we go back to basics and look at how to become a journalist . <p> Unlike medicine or law where there are clear educational requirements , there are many routes that can lead into journalism . <p> Depending on who you speak to , you might be told to get a foot in the door by doing work experience , to study a journalism degree , or take a postgraduate or short course . <p> We asked journalists who follow @journalismnews on Twitter for their advice . <p> Q. Should I do degree in journalism , a postgraduate course in journalism or a shorter course ? <p> All three of the above options offer a good route in to journalism . <p> " Each option suits different careers and lives , " said Paul Bradshaw , course leader of the MA in online journalism at Birmingham City University and visiting lecturer at City University London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The majority of people who replied when we asked this question suggested doing a degree in something other than journalism , and then taking a postgraduate course to learn key skills , such as media law . This is something Richard Sambrook , the director of the Centre for Journalism at Cardiff University , encourages . <p> If you decide to go with a more general degree , you then have a couple of choices if you want to gain a qualification in journalism . <p> You can do a postgraduate diploma ( PG Dip ) or MA in journalism , which take between nine months and a year , or you can sign up for a shorter course to give you the essential law and shorthand knowledge . These shorter courses are around four months in duration , so a quicker and cheaper option than a PG Dip or MA . <p> Whether you decide to do a short course or a longer course , most experienced journalists we asked advised to go with one that is accredited by the NCTJ ( National Council for the Training of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in journalism or another subject , you should use your spare time at university to blog and start to make connections . <p> Building up a blog and Twitter following can not only prove its worth when you apply for a postgraduate journalism course , but will help you get noticed by potential employers . And getting to grips with online journalism is crucial . <p> " Realise the importance of digital , " said Kelby McNally , online showbiz correspondent at the Daily Express . <p> Jess McAree , head of editorial learning and development at Haymarket Media , said " learn about digital technology and digital publishing " . <p> " Do n't " whatever you do " decide to specialise in print journalism . " <p> Q. How do I know which course or university is best ? <p> There are scores of BA , PG Dip , MA and short journalism courses , but how do you know which is right for you ? <p> As Will Metcalfe , crime reporter at the North West Evening Mail pointed out , " make sure your course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Not having this can be a big obstacle " , he said . <p> Update : Data editor at the Guardian James Ball has pointed out that City University is not NCTJ accredited and " you do n't see its grads struggling to get into print publications " . <p> If you want to go into radio , you should consider a course accredited by the BJTC ( Broadcast Journalism Training Council ) . <p> Beyond that you need to look at the facilities , the quality of the teaching staff , the reputation , course content and where alumni are now working . <p> Journalists who have a wide range of skills may find there are more jobs to apply for after graduating . So consider a course which teaches skills such as video production , data journalism , and includes lessons in financial reporting . <p> You will also need to invest your own time teaching yourself some of the skills that may be absent from the course . You could spend time getting to grips with Photoshop , for example , or blogging platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mobile phone . <p> When we asked on Twitter what you should look for in a course , journalist Helen Robertson suggested that you " look up past graduates and employment levels " . " Check out lecturers and their contacts in industry for work experience " , she added . <p> " I look at how hard they 've worked to get what they want , " said Stuart Rowson , BBC Sport interactive editor . " I want drive and passion , not fancy unis and silver spoons . " <p> " Only out of nosiness , " freelance journalist and editor Isabel Mohan said . She is " far more interested in work experience , evidence of published work and a cracking cover letter " . <p> " I look at the course taken and the grade but work experience and hobbies are key for me " , said freelance journalist and editor Laura Rowe . " Passion for a subject is impressive " . <p> Q. Will I need to learn shorthand ? <p> There are two types of shorthand : Pitman and Teeline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses . It can be learnt fairly quickly , as little as four to six months , although building up speed requires commitment and practice . <p> There are no quick fixes and although in theory it is possible to buy a book and teach yourself , it helps if you have a daily or weekly class . <p> If you plan to work for a local newspaper you are likely to need shorthand , although it is a valuable skill for any journalism job . You will need at least 100 words per minute for it to be useful . <p> While some experienced and senior journalists may not have shorthand , many editors today see it as a key skill , or at least desirable ( such as Steve Herrmann , editor of the BBC News website , who shares his views on shorthand in this article ) . <p> It is helpful to pick a specialisation based on something you are interested in " whether that is knitting , education or your local area " and blog about it . That way you might open up additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a better position to pitch to them based on the contacts and specialist knowledge you build up . <p> Q. How do I get work experience ? <p> You will learn key skills by studying at college but experience is vital , both for learning on the job and making contacts with potential future employers . <p> And work experience may lead to a job , even if you do not have a journalism qualification . <p> Rupert Evelyn , ITV Midlands correspondent , said on Twitter : " Get down your local paper/radio/TV and find bosses who believe in you . " He explained how that approach worked for him , saying he did not have A-levels or a degree but was able to demonstrate a hunger for stories . <p> Many journalism courses help you arrange work experience , but you can also apply directly , which might help you stand out . Think of a publication you feel you could contribute to and email the editor . Refer to him or her by their first name in the email , tell them what experience you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you want to do work experience at that publication , and pitch a story idea . <p> As entertainment journalist Ben Falk says " editors want solutions " , and by pitching a story you are providing such a solution . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

We 've seen chats around news topics , especially when someone is live tweeting or having a live conversation about an event that 's happening right now . So we 've seen political reporters come out of the election with higher Twitter followers because they 're having live chats , they 're doing live fact-checking .

" <p> Chris Hamilton , social media editor at BBC News " which ran its first live Twitter Q&amp;A last year " added that " it 's a good way of encouraging some conversation " . <p> " It allows correspondents to get some feedback , some feel for what your audience are thinking and what they 're asking about big stories , which can be very helpful and of course it exposes their expertise to an audience , one that 's probably going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we just think it 's a good way of expanding what our journalists can do and expanding the exposure they get and the people that they talk to . " <p> And for Ton Standage , digital editor of the Economist , getting involved in such conversations is an important way for journalists to appear " more accountable " . <p> " Across the board journalists are generally engaging with readers in a way they did n't use to in comment threads , on Twitter , in various online fora , and I think we all accept that that 's something that 's worth doing , is a good idea , improves the quality of our journalism , improves the way that we 're seen because we 're seen to be being more accountable . <p> " We 're not just hiding in an ivory tower somewhere and publishing and then just leaving it at that .

Hodge also recommends asking those involved , such as the interviewees , to also help get word out . <p> The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who might not know that we 're there and I think to do that you have to make sure that you are covering all bases and not just expecting people to comeKate Hodge , the Guardian <p> " The key thing for us is we always want to reach new people who might not know that we 're there and I think to do that you have to make sure that you are covering all bases and not just expecting people to come . <p> " So we use LinkedIn quite a lot and we look at different groups ... on Twitter we 'll look for hashtags that are being used in the area quite a lot , and getting our panellists to put it out to their networks as well is also really helpful . " <p> Luckie added that by advertising the chat beforehand , not only will it alert people to the Q&amp;A but it will also help " build up more of an appetite for it " . <p> Hamilton added that even though they run their Q&amp;As on Twitter , they take a multi-platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We obviously will tweet out on our main accounts and get the individuals who are taking part in the Q&amp;A , the correspondents , to tweet about it , but we also try and get promotions on our mainstream output so that could be on our TV output , radio output , on our website " . <p> Sourcing questions <p> Hamilton also highlights how to put that multi-platform approach into practice when sourcing questions also . <p> " People can leave questions on the web page , we post it on Facebook , people can leave questions in the Facebook post comments and also on Google Plus and people can even text in questions . We have an SMS number that we use for listing contributions from the audience on news stories and we use that as well . <p> So the idea being that you get a really broad range of questions across a broad range of platforms , you 're not being exclusiveChris Hamilton , BBC News <p> " So the idea being that you get a really broad range of questions across a broad range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do get questions in advance , this can help to ensure the chat gets going straight away , rather than potentially waiting for questions to come in . <p> Luckie also added that he finds this approach to be helpful to ensure " a baseline of questions that you can start from to get the conversation going " . <p> Another option though , if questions are not sourced in advance , is to have a moderator get the discussion started while questions from outside are being sourced . <p> Where questions have been sought in advance , Luckie recommends news outlets send a message to the person who sent in the question originally , to flag up when their question is being asked . This in turn helps prompt " even more questions " , he said . <p> The Guardian 's career chats open up the comments facility ahead of the discussion , to enable questions to be submitted a few days before , and they are also kept open after the chat " in case anyone wants to continue " , Hodge said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible to enable a rich conversation and for the chat to appeal to as large an audience as possible . <p> " You ca n't run a Q&amp;A that 's really focused in one area because you wo n't get a huge audience for it , you have to keep it quite broad and that just allows you to discuss the key themes throughout the whole discussion and let those be quite easily followed . " <p> Importance of briefing participants before the chat <p> At the Guardian , Hodge highlighted the importance of briefing those taking part sufficiently ahead of the chat . While her advice is based on the Guardian career chats , which feature a panel of people answering questions , the idea can still apply to a Q&amp;A with one interviewee . <p> The briefing might include " explaining that they do n't have to take on trolls and that we will do that " , and just generally " encouraging them to pitch in , where they feel comfortable " . <p> Deciding on the size of a panel <p> Similarly , when dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people you want on board to answer questions . <p> Hodge warned that " overly large panels are very unwieldy and they can really stunt the conversation " . <p> " What you do n't want from a panel is a group of people who are all going to say the same thing . So you have to look at the topic and ensure the topic you pick has got a broad enough appeal that you can a , get the audience you want and also b , get a real variety of panelists . " <p> She advised a maximum of eight to 10 people , and a minimum of four panellists in order " to get a good discussion going " . <p> When to run a chat <p> While deciding when and how long to run the Q&amp;A for , there may be some platform-specific elements to this , as well as geographic factors to consider . <p> Luckie said when it comes to Twitter chats , it is usually considered best to run them in the afternoon , " depending on the timezone which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the afternoon is you 're not getting people during their morning commutes , you 're not getting people who are off and about in their lunch breaks . Usually they 're sitting at their desks or they 're sitting at home . They 've got their mobile phones or they 've got their computers open and they 're able to join in on the chat . " <p> He added : " Of course different things work for different people , some people do Twitter chats in the morning , but what we see with the success is finding a time when there 's a lull in the content on Twitter so that people have something that they can join in for . " <p> Interestingly the Guardian 's career chats are run in the afternoon , from 1pm to 3pm , while a new weekly liveblog Q&amp;A with local experts launched last month by the Daily Post in North Wales runs from 12 to 1pm . <p> For those planning on holding " a global conversation " , it is also important to consider the different timezones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that real sweet spot because you can get people in , they can ask their questions and then if people have more questions you can direct them back to your websiteMark Luckie , Twitter <p> Luckie added that when it comes to the length of a Twitter chat in particular , " you want to consider making sure it does n't go too long because what you end up doing is inundating people 's Twitter timelines " . <p> " What you want to do is strike that balance between ' am I providing enough time to answer questions ? ' versus ' am I going on for too long ? ' <p> " And usually some time between 30 minutes and an hour depending on the subject and depending on the number of questions is a good time . <p> " But 30 minutes is that real sweet spot because you can get people in , they can ask their questions and then if people have more questions you can direct them back to your website and possibly turn that into a future feature . " <p> Managing questions/moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of questions to them is " very much a live thing " , according to Hodge . So management of the conversation is incredibly important , as it is on other platforms also . <p> As well as the ability to submit questions within the commenting facility , the career chat team also allow questions to be sent in via email . <p> " That can be quite difficult to handle at times , especially if they 're particularly popular , making sure everyone gets answered and everyone 's questions have a clear line of questioning as well and something our experts can respond to . And making sure that everyone gets fair exposure . " <p> She said a couple of the members of the team will monitor the chat and are actively involved by " posting in and getting our panelists to expand where we think it 's necessary . " <p> Their role is also to deal with any trolls in the conversation . <p> At BBC News , when they run their Twitter Q&amp;As , questions will be collated collaboratively somewhere , such as using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the chat are not based in the same office . <p> We 've been quite careful to make sure we include questions that people would expect us not to answer , around , for example , bias , so we 're quite careful to make sure we answer a full range of questionsChris Hamilton , BBC News <p> The producers will then select the most interesting and pertinent questions which are moved to the top of the document and then the correspondent or the producer will " go through those and they can put them into their Twitter stream as a cue , as a question , and then compose their answers and get them out " . <p> But the questions chosen are " not necessarily the most comfortable " , Hamilton added . <p> " We 've been quite careful to make sure we include questions that people would expect us not to answer , around , for example , bias , so we 're quite careful to make sure we answer a full range of questions " . <p> He added that having " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very useful , such as to process questions and deal with duplicates . <p> Luckie added , in reference to Twitter chats , that news outlets may find it useful to " get a producer or somebody on hand to use Tweetdeck or use some sort of filter , to look through the tweets and find those nuggets " . <p> " If you try to have the person who is participating in the session , whether that 's the host or the participant , trying to look at the tweets and answer them at the same time , depending on the volume , they may get buried in tweets . <p> " But having that extra person on hand to say ' okay , here 's a good tweet , here 's a good tweet ' , and then passing that along , to the host and the participant , it makes for a smoother flow of the conversation . " <p> Following up after the chat <p> Once the chat/Q&amp;A has taken place , one piece of advice shared by a number of the interviewees was to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own website , or in print . <p> If you ran a Twitter Q&amp;A , this might mean embedding tweets or timelines onto a news site , or creating a Storify of the discussion . <p> As Luckie said , " not everybody will be able to join the chat at a particular time " , so it is important to consider how to make that content available after the event and " actually moving the chat forward " . <p> If you 're faced with a Q&amp;A that 's had 150 comments on it , you might not feel like you want to read them all and so rounding them up and just picking the top bit out of them of what people have said is a really nice way of ensuring that you 've got that as a resourceKate Hodge , the Guardian <p> Hodge added that at the Guardian they also follow up on their career chats with round-ups of the conversation to make the chat more digestible for those coming to it after the event . <p> " If you 're faced with a Q&amp;A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel like you want to read them all and so rounding them up and just picking the top bit out of them of what people have said is a really nice way of ensuring that you 've got that as a resource . " <p> But these do not replace the original web page featuring the chat . <p> " You might find that perhaps in the round-up you 've missed a key point that actually someone might find really handy , so having them always there is really great . " <p> At the Daily Post in North Wales , the liveblog Q&amp;A is also followed up in the print newspaper the next day . <p> Thanking contributors <p> Luckie also flags up the importance of thanking those who asked questions and helped contribute to the discussion . <p> " Acknowledging them and saying ' hey , thank you for your question ' , it really makes the world for the person . It really gives them a time to say ' hey I got a chance to participate with this news organisation ' , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough you 're growing your followers and you 're growing your engagement on your account . " <p> Trying different platforms <p> And with a number of platforms to choose from when it comes to running a Q&amp;A , the Economist 's Standage supports trying out a few different approaches . <p> " We have considered having Q&amp;A-style features on our own website . We have n't done this , we do n't have discussion forums , a lot of sites do and we do have particularly good comments on our site and particularly well-informed readers so we have thought ' well why not have a Q&amp;A feature ' and we kicked that idea around quite a while . <p> " Another reason for using things like Quora and Reddit is that they are different implementations of Q&amp;A-style or forum discussions , and so it 's a way of road testing different approaches to it as well . " Potential platforms for live Q&amp;A chats <p> So what platforms could journalists and news outlets use to run live Q&amp;As ? Here are just a few ideas : <p> Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tips and benefits of using Twitter , comments and Reddit <p> On top of the general guidance given above , below are some more platform-specific benefits and tips for getting the most out of each one . Using Twitter <p> Reach out to a new audience <p> Luckie said one reason news outlets have used Twitter to run live chats is in a bid to widen " the audience that can participate and that will see the live chat " , rather than keeping it within a news outlet 's website . <p> That being said , some news outlets will still use social media platforms like Twitter to spread the word about a Q&amp;A , even if it is not being hosted on Twitter . <p> Twitter 's a great platform for making it live , it means the conversation can flow a bit , you get questions inspired by other questions or by other answersChris Hamilton , BBC News <p> And for BBC News , which does use Twitter to run its live Q&amp;As , they still ensure the experience is " not Twitter-specific " , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , Hamilton said . <p> This is achieved , for example , by directing people to Twitter page running the relevant hashtag , or just reminding the audience that " they do n't even have to have a Twitter account to be able to follow it on that Twitter page " . <p> Another way to achieve this is to adopt the follow-up approach mentioned earlier . <p> " Twitter 's a great platform for making it live , it means the conversation can flow a bit , you get questions inspired by other questions or by other answers . But for us it 's hosted on Twitter but it 's not Twitter-specific , that 's very important for us . " <p> The ability to filter tweets <p> Twitter 's Luckie also highlighted the " greater ability to filter through the incoming tweets " using platforms such as Tweetdeck , or Twitter search , " to find out what are the great tweets that are coming in " . <p> The power of the hashtag <p> Most Twitter Q&amp;As are given a hashtag to help follow the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of a Twitter chat " . <p> " It enables you to thread the conversation , it allows you to track responses . If you have people simply @ mention you then people who are watching the conversation wo n't necessarily have a way to tweet back at you unless they are following you . " <p> In terms of creating the hashtag , he recommends people make them " incredibly descriptive , but also short " . <p> " So people know , without even knowing what 's going on , what the conversation 's about . So #askexpert , or #politics , or #sport or something that 's really descriptive and very particular to that news organisation . " <p> He also highlighted the importance of checking the hashtag is not already in use , to avoid " cross streams " . <p> " Finding that unique hashtag , making it short , and also that , like I said , enables you to track the conversation better . You can find everyone who 's using the hashtag , versus trying to find people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus just having this one clean hashtag that people can use . " Using your own comment facility <p> At the Guardian Hodge said the fact that its career chats take place in the commenting facility of the article page fits in with the Guardian 's approach across the site to encourage commenting on articles . <p> " If it was n't within that environment it might not work quite so well , " she added . <p> And when it comes to particularly sensitive or difficult discussions , the commenting facility enables users to get advice anonymously . <p> " Giving our audience that opportunity to anonymously comment about what 's happening in their lives and get information about it in a very specific way I think is really valuable to them . <p> " For us that retains our audience so that they know that we 're there to help them and it really is their chance to invest in the site " . <p> A recently-added feature to the Guardian 's comment facility is a respond function , which enables users to reply to a comment directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you can see exactly who has responded to what " . <p> " It just helps the discussion move ahead and flow better because everyone can see exactly what everyone has said about that particular strand of the discussion . " <p> In the same way a Q&amp;A run on a liveblog , or just within the body of a normal article web page , by running the Q&amp;A in the comments section it means the news outlet can maintain an archive of the chat , which can then act as a useful resource for audiences in the future . <p> A permanent record and resource <p> Hodge said all of its career chats can be found " at different points appearing right back up in our analysis " of top articles . " That can go back three or four years , " she added . <p> The permanent record nature of a Q&amp;A run within the comment facility is a benefit shared by hosting a chat on a liveblog , for example . <p> In fact , Hodge said she had used liveblogging software CoveritLive once before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good platform " . <p> " It was really interactive , people could comment , you can respond and you can embed tweets and things like that . <p> " So that was a really great platform to use but I think for our advice sessions where it 's more formal and people need to know exactly where they can look for this kind of stuff , the comment section works better . " <p> The Daily Post in North Wales chose to liveblog its new Ask The Expert Q&amp;A , which it is running once a week . <p> Communities editor Antonia Jones said the reason the Post chose the liveblogging platform was " mainly the immediacy of it and connecting with our audience in real time " . <p> " We wanted to continue to engage with our online audience . We found that the breaking news blog , which we started late last year and also uses ScribbleLive , is going really and is appealing to our readers so we decided to do the Q&amp;A to offer our online audience something new . <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people are still able to see it online afterwards and for those not connected with us online , they can see the Q&amp;A the next day in the paper . " <p> Using Reddit <p> Just like using a liveblog or the comment facility of a web page , using Reddit " unlike Twitter " does not place a 140 character restriction on answers , as Standage highlighted . <p> " You can scan lots of questions and you can get a sense of all the things you 're being asked easily . And then of course you are n't limited to 140 character answers , you can write a whole paragraph . " <p> Standage added that with Reddit Ask Me Anything posts , questions are sent in to be replied to at a specific time , which enables the interviewee to prepare their answers in advance . <p> " So you can produce lots of answers quite quickly , whereas with Twitter you really do have to do it all on the fly which can be fun but it 's much more like doing a live radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 140 characters . So you do n't feel quite so under the gun with a Reddit AMA . " <p> Reddit also offers an " up and down voting system " , Standage explains , which he said " allows you to see which answers people appreciated or which questions they think are most important for you to answer " . <p> " So I think in that sense you get a bit more of a sense of feedback , or a different sense of feedback ... than you do from Twitter because people can say ' oh that 's a really good question I 'd really like to hear what you think about that ' . " <p> But he added when it comes to answering questions , if a journalist goes down the route of offering to run an ' Ask Me Anything ' , they should really abide by the name of the Q&amp;A , and be prepared to answer ' anything ' . <p> " If you 're going to say ' Ask Me Anything ' then you really need to be prepared to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847102 @2047102/ <h> How to : get into music journalism <p> Music journalism is a highly competitive field . Gone are the days when , like Lester Bangs , an aspiring journalist could post a review to the offices of Rolling Stone and demand , or even expect , a response . The internet has revolutionised how people consume music and with it how people read about music , to the point where it can feel like everyone is a critic and it is harder than ever to stand out in the crowd . <p> We have spoken to some leading and experienced music journalists to get their take on what makes the difference . <p> Be creative , entertain <p> Frank Zappa once said : " Most rock journalism is people who ca n't write , interviewing people who ca n't talk , for people who ca n't read . " <p> The education of your readership is not your concern ( although Shakespearean homilies on the latest electronica artist are a no-no ) and you do not really have a choice in the matter if the subject of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time you get to them . Your writing , however , is fully in your control . <p> " I think more than any other journalism , music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it , " says Stevie Chick , an author and music journalist who has written for a wealth of national titles and teaches music journalism at City University . <p> " There 's a lot of leeway to write in an imaginative and creative fashion and I want to really embrace that and chase it . " Much like music itself , being original and creative in your writing is what is going to get you noticed . <p> In conversation with Journalism.co.uk , Chick pointed out that people do not just read album reviews because they want some advice on what to buy . It is more than just " that 's good , that 's not " . <p> I always look for people who think a bit differently , who have more lateral ideas and think outside of the box and come up with things that are unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing has to be entertaining , " continued Chick , " it 's got to be vivid and exciting and thoughtful and funny and have all these different qualities . " <p> Lucy Jones , as deputy editor of NME.com , agrees . " I always look for people who think a bit differently , who have more lateral ideas and think outside of the box and come up with things that are unpredictable and weird and leftfield . <p> " For me as a blog or feature commissioning editor it 's about the writing . If the first paragraph has a personality or has a voice or someone is saying something really original or someone has a unique or beautiful way with words , that would get my attention . " <p> When anyone and everyone can set up a blog and waffle on for pages about their favourite band it is the quality of writing that makes the difference . <p> This is especially true in the digital age , as Lulu Le Vay , an experienced journalist , industry insider and tutor at the London Journalism Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of writing is really important at the moment . I do think there has been a bit of a demise in the rise of online independence when it comes to writing and I think we do need a bit of a back to basics approach , particularly with music journalism . " <p> If you treat your writing in the same way as everyone else who can flood the internet with reviews then that is exactly where you will stay . So <p> Be professional <p> All your creative flair and clever wordplay and extended metaphors may be what people notice but it needs to be based on something solid . People will marvel and coo over the window dressing but the hard work is in the building of the house . <p> " I always stress that just because it 's music journalism does n't mean you can wake up in the morning , do loads of drugs , be rock n roll and all that , it requires a lot of professional rigour , " says Chick . <p> " You need to work really , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stuff . You need to be shit hot and not make stupid mistakes as well . It 's not just being massively creative , you need to have pretty serious journalistic chops in there as well I think . " <p> Stevie Chick found this out the hard way when , early in his journalistic career , he went to interview a band and one of his first questions was how the members he was interviewing had met . They were non-identical twins . <p> Luckily , the interviewees took the blunder in good humour but such a mistake could cost you a job , especially if it means the end of an interview before it has barely begun . So , unsurprisingly , Chick always stresses the importance of research to his students . <p> Le Vay emphasised that research needs to go beyond the recent history of the next potential one-hit wonder and deep into the history of modern music . <p> " I think generally it 's about research skills . You become knowledgeable very quickly , " she said . " I encourage my students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reading about people 's stories . Looking at different eras of music . Otherwise why would someone want to commission you to be a music journalist or offer you a job if you 're not thorough enough ? " <p> That also means being open-minded . It is an oft-repeated phrase that all the best music has already been written , but if that is true then how do new genres explode into the collective consciousness every decade ? Music is built out of assimilating old styles and techniques knowing that history is integral to being adaptable as a writer . You may be an avid shoegazer or hardcore fan , but if that is the extent of your knowledge then your options are limited . <p> " You have to be open-minded because what one does n't want is to become pigeon-holed , " said Le Vay . " So ' so and so is an expert on dustup ' , you ca n't just be the go to person on that . It does help to have the expertise but it 's also really important to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Know the industry <p> When Stevie Chick left university he worked a dead-end job to fund a fanzine full of reviews that he would send out to editors . On spotting Everett True , the deputy editor at the now-defunct Melody Maker , at a show one evening the young and reckless Chick pushed a copy into his hands and the next day , in " an act of bravery I probably could n't do now " , Chick phoned him up to ask what he thought . Rather than offer his opinion , True offered to be interviewed for the next issue . <p> You 're not going to get very far if you 're just sitting in your room listening to recordsLulu Le Vay <p> That next issue was a hit with music industry insiders and before long Chick was writing for Melody Maker . Now , 15 years later , he still puts his career down to writing about the industry and having some insider knowledge . <p> " I think it helps if you show that you 're savvy to the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're just writing stuff that 's really passionate and saying this is why I love this band or this is why I love that band , that 's got a lot of function and a certain amount of appeal , but if you can show an editor from the off that you understand how the industry works and you 're not so easily taken in . " <p> Of course not everyone can land an interview with an established editor for their fanzine or blog , although recognising them at a gig is an important first step and knowing how the industry works is a paramount . <p> A possible alternative is to get involved yourself " or at least be an active cog in the machine " as Le Vay argues . <p> " Being out on the scene is really important , " she said , " so making sure you 're going to gigs , you 're networking , becoming visible . Because it 's quite a social thing with music and lifestyle , it 's really important to be out and about . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just sitting in your room listening to records . It 's not just about that . It 's a broader social networking process which is involved . " <p> That does not necessarily mean starting a band yourself ; putting on shows or DJing between bands or getting to know the local promoters are all ways to get on the inside track and find out about the local scene . If you know about developments in your area before the national magazines do or can offer an insight into a new artist 's history then you 're one step ahead of the game . <p> Focus on these key skills and qualities and when you turn up on your first day of work experience , as all aspiring journalists must these days , you will be able to start without missing a beat . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847103 @2047103/ <h> How to : best post news on Twitter and Facebook <p> SMO is the new SEO , according to the US-based Online News Association which held a conference session on that theme . But while " Social Media Optimisation may be as important as Search Engine Optimisation for content distribution ... far different rules apply , " the ONA said . <p> Beyond the jargon and acronyms SMO is about understanding the best time and frequency to post to platforms such as Facebook and Twitter . <p> This guide includes 10 lessons from three experts in social media optimisation , who have all carried out research , analysing tweets and Facebook page updates . <p> " They look at your followers and they look at your past tweets and they look at when your followers tweet the most and that 's kind of an indication as to when they will be online . So when your followers tweet the most , that will be a good time for us to also put out the content . <p> When the most traffic happens and when actually the most tweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweet , which is sometimes counter-intuitiveLeo Widrich , Buffer <p> " When the most traffic happens and when actually the most tweets go out is also the best time for you to tweet , which is sometimes counter-intuitive as people will think tweets will get buried and no one will see them . It 's really during work hours when most tweets will happen that you will also get the most exposure . " <p> Widrich advises WhenToTweet and Tweriod , which both look at when your followers are online . " It takes a little longer to do the analysis but it will be much more thorough . " TweetWhen only looks at your past performance , Widrich explained . <p> That research is based on individual journalists rather than news outlets , which generally auto-tweet as stories go live . But in order to encourage a growing audience , it is necessary to tweet often . <p> The BBC last month switched off its Twitter auto-feed during the day , manually tweeting with hashtags and different headlines . " There 's no point tweeting the same line or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got , " head of social media at the BBC Chris Hamilton told Journalism.co.uk ( see Lessons from Auntie as @BBCNews goes human ) . <p> As Twitter has a scattergun approach to getting the attention of whoever happens to be paying attention in the one or two minutes after the tweet goes out , it can be beneficial to tweet a story more than once , Widrich explained . <p> " The idea , especially with Twitter , is that the frequency is nearly as important as the timing , " he said . <p> He recommends tweeting news stories three to five times : one when the news story goes live , once a couple of hours later and then a third time the next day , for example . <p> " That 's very much a use case of why we built Buffer but this is what we do for our news stories and blog posts . We drop all the stories we have into our buffer and they get well spaced out over the day and get posted so that we always have a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 3 . Post to Facebook at lunchtime <p> " Facebook in its nature is completely different to Twitter , " Widrich said . " The posting frequency is much lower . The optimal time is completely different : between 12.30pm and 1pm is when Facebook posts actually get the most exposure . " <p> Consider the times of the work day and the weekend when your readers are checking Facebook . If you have a majority of UK readers , you may well find the peaks are around 9am , when people arrive at work , at lunchtime and again between 4.30pm and 5.30pm . <p> 4 . Post up to eight news stories on your Facebook page each day <p> Jiri Voves , co-founder of Socialbakers , a Czech start-up that provides social media statistics , advises news outlets to post more frequently than brands . <p> " For brands we recommend posting maximum once or twice per day on a Facebook page because otherwise people think it is spamming . But what we found out in our studies is that for the news media it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top news media in the world they are posting five or even eight times a day and users still accept it , they like it because it 's basically providing them with news coverage . " <p> 5 . Get to grips with EdgeRank , Facebook 's algorithm <p> Jeff Widman , co-founder of PageLever , which provides Facebook advice for YouTube and MTV and manages the analytics for four of the top 10 Facebook pages , advises anyone who posts to Facebook on behalf of a news organisation to get a basic understanding of the algorithm . <p> " When you post to Facebook not all your fans see your status update . There 's something called Facebook newsfeed algorithm , they call it EdgeRank , and it filters to figure out which status updates you the fan is going to be most interested in . <p> " You probably have a bunch of friends and a bunch of fan pages and a couple of those you care a lot about , and a couple of those you were friends with maybe a couple of years ago but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the algorithm tries to work out which status updates you are going to be most interested in , showing you those status updates and hiding all the rest , " so that every time you walk into Facebook you say ' oh , wow , Facebook shows me stuff I want to see , I want to make sure I keep coming back here ' " . <p> " As a marketeer , or as a journalist , or as a news organisation you have to keep that in the back of your head and think ' how do I post status updates that are going to be interesting to my audience ? ' <p> " The way that algorithm works is that it looks at the status updates and it says ' what are the types of things that you have commented on recently , what have you hit " like " on , who sent those ' . So the more you hit ' like ' on a particular friend 's status updates , the more often those status updates are going to appear . " <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and tease new stories to encourage people to comment and like <p> When posting a link to a news story write a tease in a way that tries to get people to comment or like . <p> " The reason you 're doing that is you 're trying to get people to take actions that explicitly show the algorithm that they are interested in your content , " Widman said . " So if I posted something that said ' fill in the blank , I think blank will be the next prime minister of the UK , and then you have a link to your article speculating about that , you are going to get a lot more comments and here you are going to see maybe 10 times the number of comments rather than if you just simply posted your status update in there . " <p> Facebook is watching all the explicit actions that a user takes . They are watching if a user comes and visits your fan page , they are watching if a user clicks on your content , they are watching if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentJeff Widman , PageLever <p> Without a tease or a question there is no invitation for engagement . <p> " People will see your headline , they might click it they might not but they 're not going to leave a comment , " Widman said . <p> And it is linking and commenting that you should be seeking . <p> " A comment is worth more than a like , is worth more than a click . And so if people are clicking your status updates that 's good but you 're going to get a lot more glue , Facebook calls it an affinity , between the user and the publisher , if they leave a comment . " <p> Remember , the big Facebook brother is watching you . <p> " Facebook is watching all the explicit actions that a user takes . They are watching if a user comes and visits your fan page , they are watching if a user clicks on your content , they are watching if a user clicks like or if a user shares your content . " 7 . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook <p> Many news organisations set up an auto-feed to post news stories to Facebook . But that " does n't work " , according to representatives from Facebook during a session at the World Editors Forum , held in Vienna last month . <p> Widman did not go as far to say feeds do not work , but he does discourage them for two reasons . <p> " Another big thing that I see a lot of news organisations mess up is posting via third party application . It 's a little bit controversial but there are some third-party applications that are whitelisted by Facebook and some that are not . <p> " Often what I will see is a news organisation hooks up an RSS feed to just pump status updates right into their Facebook page , or pump their Twitter updates in there . When you pump that in you are just pumping headlines in so you 're not going to craft that content to get more engagement . And second , those third-party applications often do n't rank as high in the algorithm as someone manually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you look at the numbers , when you spend two minutes crafting a status update versus if you just pump it in via rss it 's just like night and day . " <p> 8 . Always have a story in your fans ' Facebook news feed <p> It will take some time to calculate how you achieve always having a story in your fans ' news feed point but it is worth it , Widman said . <p> " The idea is that when you are posting out a status update you may have 100,000 fans and maybe 10,000 of those will see that status update . The EdgeRank algorithm , as your status update gets older , will show your status update to fewer and fewer of your fans . But you can actually figure out ways to measure when your status update drops out of the news feed . If you are a journalist I would say try and always have one status update live in most of your user 's news feeds at once and when it starts to get old and you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's when I would put up the next one . <p> " It really depends on how international your audience is , if you 've got people all around the world then as they wake up they see your status update , they comment or like on it . " <p> Another point to be aware of is that you can annoy your fans if they get too much news from you at any one time . This is a point made by Widman in an article on Mashable . <p> " When your fans see two status updates from you in their news feeds , they 'll likely get annoyed , and will consequently unsubscribe or un-fan . There are few exceptions to this rule . <p> " If you post too infrequently , you 're missing out on opportunities to reach your fans . Over the course of a year , a page with 10,000 fans that posts only half as often as they could misses more than one million chances to get their content in front of a hyper-targeted Facebook audience . The larger your fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without annoying your fans . " <p> 9 . Consider really short posts and photo posts <p> Widman said that research has revealed a post of 60 characters or less are often the most effective . <p> " The Phoenix Suns are a national basketball team that plays here in the US and there 's one thing they discovered when they started using PageLever that I thought was fascinating . They pulled up the posts to see which ones were most engaging and least engaging and they discovered that their three most engaging posts were all under 60 characters . " He advises : " Do n't try cram as many characters in there as possible , just have something short and sweet . " <p> Widman also advises uploading three photos when adding the link to a news story . <p> " The second tip is MTV was using PageLever and they started measuring their status updates that had photos and they found that status with photos that had one photo were half as engaging as posts that had three photos . " <p> He explained the reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up to three right next to each other in a single status update in the news feed . Sometimes when you are posting an article , do n't just post a link to the article as a text status update , actually upload the key photo from the article and then put the link to the rest of the article as a description of the photo and so then you are posting it out as a photo . Those actually tend to do better than text status updates in the EdgeRank algorithm . " <p> 10 . Dig deep into the analytics and measure your fans ' engagement <p> If your news organisation has fewer than 10,000 fans , Widman advises focusing on getting more fans . One way you can do this is to add a like button on your website . <p> He also advises analysing the engagement and using a third party tool , such as PageLever . <p> " I 'd pull up all my posts over the past 30 to 60 days and I 'd start filtering them to see which posts were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then also I 'd look at not just which posts got the most comments and likes but also which posts got the most comments and likes per view . <p> " It takes a little bit of work but that is by far they highest value add thing you could do for figuring out how to measure your fan page and get better results .

Classified and display advertising still brings in more revenue than subscriptions , R+pke said , although the latter is " catching up fast " and he expects reader revenue to overtake advertising in 2018 . <p> " We 're very lucky at Zeit Online that we have a good classifieds market " we are a market leader in print and online for academic positions in Germany . <p> " We 've always been strong in these niches but we 've never taken the approach of going broader , which is what we are trying to do with this jobs board .

Zeit Campus also features reader submissions occasionally , which are curated and edited by the team . <p> All these stories are promoted on social media both on Zeit Campus ' own accounts , but also on the main Zeit Online Facebook and Twitter pages .

Competition is intense and , just like the industry that feeds it , it 's growing day by day . <p> The fact is , gaming journalism , like all journalism , has no place for slackers or quitters . You need to be ambitious , hard-working , dedicated to your craft and tough enough to take the knocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dues . Still interested ? Great , read on <h> A Growing Phenomenon <p> The gaming industry 's recent explosive growth is due in part to a broadening of demographics and a simultaneous expansion of network capacity and enhanced mobility . <p> Games were once considered to be the exclusive domain of young boys in their bedrooms until 1994 's Sony Playstation made gaming grown up . Ten years later the Nintendo DS made games smart and sexy ( with a little help from Nichole Kidman. ) 2006 's Wii , meanwhile , reinvented games as an active , healthy pastime . <p> The following year Apple unveiled the iPhone and , with it , the smart device revolution . Suddenly gaming was for everybody . Meanwhile internet speed and connectivity continued to improve dramatically , helping to make online gaming of all forms fast , reliable and ubiquitous . <p> Nowadays gaming is a recommended hobby to list on your CV and nobody raises an eyebrow when the Prime Minister boasts about his Angry Birds skills . <p> The downside to gaming becoming mainstream , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive with many established journalists looking to jump on the bandwagon . <h> Step One : Get The Knowledge <p> Know your subject well , be passionate about it and make sure your knowledge is deep and broad reaching . <p> It 's not enough to know the games , you need to know the players . So get to know the industry inside and out and learn what makes it tick . <p> Who are the big names ? Who are the up and comers . What are the best-selling titles and franchises ? Follow industry influences to help you get your finger on the pulse so you can namedrop all those exciting new start-ups . <p> Expand on your technical knowledge by getting to know all the major gaming platforms and what their capabilities and technical specifications are . Get familiar with all the jargon and develop your industry vocabulary so you can better describe crucial elements such as sound , graphics and gameplay . <p> Just like a music journalist needs to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of different musical styles so too will you need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online research is always good , but direct experience is better . Play different titles , rate them and do your history lessons . Who wants to read a film critic who 's never seen the Godfather , or a music journalist who never heard Led Zeppelin ? <p> Like any form of entertainment the gaming industry has its popular genres and franchises which all exist in context . Being up on all the latest games is n't enough , you need to be a true gaming expert who can trace the history of computer games from Super Smash Brothers and Call of Duty back to Donkey Kong and Battlezone . <p> With an eye to the past you are better placed to look forward , predict future best-sellers and anticipate important industry trends . This is the difference between being a good gaming journalist and a great one " the person people look to for guidance and inspiration . <p> Finally , as a budding journalist you 'll need to get used to going on assignment , so start attending those big industry events , shake hands and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electronic gaming is a multi-billion pound industry that 's growing every day . Its primary appeal is its interactivity and immersive nature . If this dynamism does n't come through in your writing nobody will want to read it . <p> If you find a game exciting then your words must convey it . You will also need to ensure that your writing still shines when asked to review a poor title " which , incidentally , happens a lot . <p> To have any longevity in this industry your writing must be a beacon of integrity . Humour works well . It 's certainly worked for former gaming journalist Charlie Brooker who went from writing for PC Zone in the 90s to writing for the Guardian . Nowadays he 's a popular screenwriter and television presenter . His secret ? Developing and honing a unique voice and style . <p> According to Brooker 's own origin story he never graduated from third level education because his lengthy dissertation on video games was not accepted as a valid subject . Not what Brooker wanted to year , but welcome news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant qualifications . <p> Sure , having a degree helps but not having one should n't be considered an automatic disqualification . Most editors will agree it 's more important to be a hard worker and a great writer . <h> Step Three : Gain Experience Points <p> If there 's one thing gaming teaches us it 's not to go up against the main boss without first building experience points and getting that killer inventory . <p> Online freelancing , while not glamorous , is a great first step whereby you can build up a body of work quickly , with accompanying testimonials , while grinding for game credits " i.e. money . <p> If you 're lucky you 'll find relevant paid gigs writing video game reviews for sites such as video game blogs , but do n't be too picky starting out .

Even a couple of columns in your local rag 's entertainment section might be just what you need to convince a future editor of your abilities . ( Even better if it also has an online presence where you can include a short bio and your Twitter handle . ) <p> Augment your freelance work with your own blog content . This way you have proof of what you can do , plus examples of what you could do . <p> All the while you should be constantly building your social presence across all top tier social networks and participating in relevant groups , communities and forums . Not only is this a great way to build your fan base , it 's also a valuable learning opportunity . <p> Follow industry influencers , post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post for them . Many bloggers will be delighted to feature quality work that adds true value . Getting your name and content up on an influential site , meanwhile , will go a long way towards convincing an editor to give you a shot . <p> Research your editors carefully and approach them with care and respect . Keep your correspondence short and to the point . Follow up persistently , but politely " and always the focus should be on what you can do for them , not the other way around . <p> Now get yourself out there , portfolio in hand , attending relevant events and expos . Cover the event for your own blog , shake hands and get to know the movers and shakers personally . <h> Step Five : Find Your Niche <p> Ask any journalist how they got started in their particular field and the answer will always be the same , " I started by writing anything I could " . <p> So it 's it 's important to learn all the different types of electronic games that are out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be your desired niche , but it 's still valuable knowledge . <h> Traditional Video Games : <p> These are the games that you play on a computer/laptop or on a standalone gaming consoles such as Playstation or Xbox . They tend to be the most elaborate in terms of sound , graphics and scale . Plus , with the advent of faster internet speeds , also benefit from improved multiplayer capability . <h> Mobile Games : <p> Thanks to the explosion of mobile platform adoption this is gaming 's fastest-growing sector . Games can be either native ( e.g. Android , iOS ) or browser based ( e.g. HTML5 ) allowing them to be played across a broad range of devices . <p> In both instances being able to keep up with all the latest titles and gaming platforms is critical " especially as the line between both traditional and mobile gaming is starting to erode . <h> Online Gaming Or Online Gaming ? <p> The term " online gaming " can refer to two very different sectors . Besides online video games it 's also the preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , which is growing fast , worth billions and highly profitable for writers . <p> So once again know the leading brands , what types of games they offer ( casino games , poker , video slots , bingo , etc. ) and whether those games are via third party supplied on a white label basis or developed in house . Get to know the different demographics for each type of game and how they 're marketed ( online poker is aimed at a very different demographic to online bingo , for example ) . Then study the history of the industry and learn what challenges it faces . <p> Opportunities include new markets and greater mobility and right now the next big thing is online lottery games . Lotteries are already the most popular and socially accepted form of gambling worldwide . They offer the lowest learning curve and the highest payouts . I 've been actively involved in this lucrative yet uncrowded niche for just under a year . It 's refreshing to write about real people rather than just pixelated characters all the time and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a great way to get my work included in several major mainstream publications . <h> Getting To The Next Level <p> Gaming journalism is n't all that different from any other form of journalism . It requires a lot of hard work , research , practice and determination , plus a little bit of luck , to get ahead . If writing and gaming are your true passions , however , and you 're prepared to do the groundwork , then these steps will seem as welcome challenges , rather than insurmountable obstacles . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847120 @2047120/ <h> How to : submit a Freedom of Information request <p> FOI requests , done right , can yield impressive results - but journalists need to spend time thinking about exactly what questions they want answered <p> Credit : by andrewrennie on Flickr . Some rights reserved <p> When journalists are submitting Freedom of Information ( FOI ) requests they will often be keen to get a response as soon as possible , so it is key for the reporter to ensure their request is as good as it can be to avoid any delays . <p> This guide brings together advice from two journalists with extensive experience in requesting data under the FOI Act , as well as an FOI officer who will offer some pointers from the perspective of the person handling the request . <p> First let 's remind ourselves of the legislation . The Freedom of Information Act 2000 has been in force since 2005 , and in a nutshell sets out the " general right of access to information held by public authorities " . <p> The Act goes into detail about the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to the requested disclosure of information , as well as the 23 exemptions which can mean disclosure being refused . There is also a helpful FAQ on the Act on the Information Commissioner 's Office website . <p> So beyond the basics , what advice is there for journalists on how to submit the most effective requests for information they think should be released ? The first step is to do your research . <p> Do your research <p> Paul Francis , political editor of the Kent Messenger Group , who submits one or two requests each week , said before he puts the request together he will ask himself the questions he wants the public authority to answer . <p> Sit down and set out in draft form what is it that you 're trying to get to . What questions do you want answered as a result of the release of this information ? Paul Francis <p> " That 's a very effective way of framing your request , to sit down and set out in draft form what is it that I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the release of this information ? I think that 's a very good way of framing your request so it gets to the information you 're after . " <p> Digital publishing director of Trinity Mirror regionals David Higgerson , who regularly writes about Freedom of Information requests on his blog , added that part of this research would be to check the correct email address of the FOI officer . <p> " Do n't just expect it to be able to go to the council 's main email address , " he said , adding that contact details can usually be found on Whatdotheyknow , the MySociety platform which publishes FOI requests . <p> He also said that getting terminology correct can also be a time-saver . <p> " Do research around the thing that you 're asking for in the first place . That can boil down to something as simple as using the right terminology . I know of a FOI request about bed blocking that was knocked back because the NHS trust said they did n't know what bed blocking was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spend time thinking about the questions you 're going to ask . Bear in mind there 's a cost limit of -450 of officer time that can go into a FOI request . " <p> " Check the authority 's website and make sure the information is not already available , " he said , adding that in some cases the information may have been included in an authority 's publication scheme or in another FOI request response on Whatdotheyknow . <p> Be fairly specific <p> Getting the question pitched right is " absolutely key " , Higgerson said . <p> " Do n't ask a ridiculously broad question , but at the same time do n't be so specific that you effectively box-off different parts of the information you 're requesting . " <p> Journalists need to be cautious about casting their request too widelyPaul Francis <p> Francis similarly said " journalists need to be cautious about casting their request too widely " . <p> " If you 're asking for data which covers a long period think carefully about whether the authority might say , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long to get that information together and so we 're going to turn your request down . <p> " Journalists need to be specific and clear about what it is they 're after , so making your request coherent and intelligible is important . Do n't take for granted the authority will be able to interpret your request or read into your request what you want if you 've not spelt it out clearly enough . <p> " Be as clear as you can and as specific as you can about what you 're after . " <p> Gibbons concurs : " This sounds terrible , but do n't be greedy " . <p> " The temptation is to throw everything into a request and try and get everything out of it in one go . But the likelihood is if you do that it may go over the cost limit and therefore the authority will refuse it on those grounds , so that 's going to cost you time . <p> " The best thing to do is to think of FOI as a long process , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you 're going to get an answer on quickly , but it can be very effective if you 're trying to build a big investigation at getting information about an authority . <p> " Just making an initial request for a reasonable amount of information , and then if you have further questions following up from your original FOI request is a good way to do things . " <p> Take inspiration from others , but give credit where it 's due <p> Higgerson said journalists should not be worried about copying FOI requests made by others in other regions , " because ultimately if it works in one area it should work in another " . <p> " But if you 're using FOI requests that have been on Whatdotheyknow or you 're using the results of someone else 's FOI request , I would say this time and time again , contact the person who put in the FOI request to find out why they put it in , but at the very least attribute the person who put the FOI request in . <p> " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stories , so I guess it 's doubly infuriating if you 're a member of the public seeing the details you 've released under the Freedom of Information Act have suddenly been picked up and claimed as a reporter 's exclusive . " <p> Ask for schedule of documents <p> Francis said in some cases journalists should ask for a schedule of documents to help give them " a more rounded picture " . <p> " One of the misunderstandings about the Act is that there 's a statutory right to documents , when in fact the statutory right is to information ... If you think your request is going to touch on issues , like was there a confidential report into something that went wrong in the town hall , make sure you ask for a list of all the relevant documents . <p> " The same applies to requests where you 're asking for information perhaps contained in correspondence , exchanged in emails or letters or briefing notes . If you have that schedule it helps you get a more rounded picture . Then submit other requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Using FOI requests for ' fishing expeditions ' <p> Francis said public bodies are sometimes concerned about journalists carrying out fishing expeditions , but he is " not convinced by the argument " . <p> " I think there are occasions in which , what are derided as fishing expeditions , can throw up information which is important and in the public interest . <p> " Where public bodies are concerned is over what they regard as the inconsequential nature of requests and the way in which sometimes interpretations are put on the information they choose to disclose . <p> " Sometimes journalists will use these tactics in order to pursue something they 're aware of there being potential interest in , but without trying to alert the authority they 're trying to hone in on one particular aspect . <p> " So I understand why some authorities do baulk at the idea of journalists throwing in what they regard as fishing expeditions , but I think sometimes those trawls can throw out interesting catches . " <p> Round robins <p> Higgerson advises journalists to be careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I 'd suggest is if you work in an area with eight primary care trusts , send the FOI request individually to that officer . You should be trying to build up a relationship with that FOI officer because they do want to work with you but if you start pinging out an FOI request that 's going out to eight different FOI officers in one email that does n't really say you 're particularly interested in building up a good working relationship " . <p> FOI officer Gibbons said " a lot of journalists make round robin requests " and that he can appreciate why . <p> " Just be careful . Make sure you 've done your research and you 're only sending it to authorities that are relevant . There have been a number of occasions when I 've received a round robin request asking for things that clearly are n't for a university . " Remember - the FOI officermay not be the decision maker <p> " Try and be polite " , Gibbons asks , adding that one example of the ways " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can " get the backs up of FOI officers and other public officials is just by being rude and being a bit aggressive in the tone of their FOI request " . <p> Be polite - remember , there 's a human being on the other end when you submit a requestPaul Gibbons <p> " I think being polite goes a long way . Obviously they do n't have to be , we 're still under an obligation to answer an FOI request , but it does make things work much more smoothly if people are polite and remember there 's a human being on the other end when they submit a request . " <p> Francis said that " a lot of FOI officers I come across are genuinely committed to the principles of the Act " . <p> They are " probably more engaged in the idea that public bodies need to be open and transparent and not secretive " , he added , but that they may " come up against opposition by more senior people and sometimes politicians who take a very different view about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journalist it 's important to have a cordial relationship with FOI officers , but it 's also equally important to bear in mind they 're not always the ones taking the final decisions on requests . <p> " They act as a way of sending the request to the right people , perhaps giving advice on the response , but they are themselves often not directly the people bringing together the information or making recommendations on what ought to be disclosed or what ought to be withheld . " Give context to the data <p> Higgerson urged journalists to " resist the temptation to just come up with a really good headline " , when they first receive a response to their FOI request , if extra context needs to be added . <p> You just have to keep questioning the data you 've got back and whether it 's enough for a balanced fair storyDavid Higgerson <p> One " textbook " example he shares on his blog is of the expenditure of the Metropolitan police service on the speaking clock , which when broken down by the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the example of Guardian journalist James Ball 's approach to the story ) , gives readers greater context to the overall figure . <p> " You just have to keep questioning the data you 've got back and say to yourself ' is this data enough to produce a balanced fair story ? ' " <p> " ... When you get your data back , look at it as independently as you can do . Try and put to the back of your mind that that piece of data on its own could make a good splash , and just ask what other context you need to add from other sources . " <p> Appealing a rejection <p> So what should a journalist do in the event their request is refused ? <p> " The first stage of pursuing your request is to go through the authority 's internal appeals process " , Francis explains . <p> " My experience is that by and large most appeals have in my experience failed and if that 's the case , that means you have to take up your appeal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up an appeal with the Information Commissioner . <p> " If the Information Commissioner upholds the original decision of the authority to refuse the request then you have a further right to appeal to a tribunal , who will take another look at the request . <p> " Although it can be time consuming my advice would always be take it as far as you can . If you made a request in the first instance it 's something you feel is important and ought to be released so why not pursue it to the last possible point at which you can ? <p> He added that journalists will have to make a " judgement call " on whether they want to report that the request has been refused or not . <p> " Sometimes journalists will just prefer to keep the fact an authority has refused something under their hat for a while while it goes through the appeals process , sometimes it 's a case of turning the rejection into a story . <p> " It depends on a case-by-case basis . Sometimes journalists will decide rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little while . Another thing to bear in mind is sometimes if you do a ' public body refuses to tell ' story it does alert other journalists to the fact you 're pursuing something they may also take an interest in.

I love it all " everything from the sophisticated and informative This American Life to the unfiltered and laugh-out-loud hilarious 2 Dope Queens . But podcasts ( and any form of audio storytelling , really ) are not just informative or entertaining . There 's something so natural , intimate , and effortless about it " just a couple of voices caught on tape . Right ? <p> Not to burst anyone 's happy audio-filled bubbles , but it 's not . After taking a class on audio storytelling , it has become clear to me that hours upon hours of strategic planning , formatting , and editing are put into these stories to make them sound effortless . It 's a tad ironic . <p> I began the class with a na+ve confidence , which would set the stage for a very steep learning curve . Essentially , I would only truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( immensely , I might add ) to apply them to my own work .

Certain stories lend themselves to audio more than others . Before you begin , it 's important to make sure your story is a good fit . If your story meets the necessary criteria , it 's a green light ; but if it 's not matching up , you may want to think twice before moving forward . <p> Choose a story that : <p> Provides plenty of opportunities to capture natural and ambient sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of place . <p> Appeals to an audience that actually listens to audio . Radio and podcasts tend to attract more educated crowds , and are most popular with older generations . <p> Covers a scope and amount of material that 's conducive to audio storytelling . In other words , is your story too long for one single piece ( exceeding 60 " 80 minutes can deter listeners ) ? If so , is there enough material to divide the story up and create a series ? <p> Will fit into an attractive and appropriate format . Will you use narrators ? Interviews ? Casual round table discussion ? Does the format mesh well with the story itself ? <p> Boasts plenty of interesting sources to speak with . Are there people willing and able to interview with you ?

As a result , poorly gathered audio ca n't be covered up and majorly distracts from the story . <p> Keep the following tips in the back of your mind when you begin the process of capturing audio . <p> Plan out your interview location . If the location has great natural sound that wo n't drown out the interview , it may work to speak with your subject on-site . But if it 's too noisy , or the environment confuses the theme of the story , plan to interview the subject in an office or other quiet space . <p> Be careful of venues with music . It makes for fantastic natural sound ; however , interviewing where this music can be heard limits your editing capabilities later on . It can also mean there are multiple different songs in your piece , which gets kind of crazy at times . <p> Watch out for echo-y rooms .

But more often than not , a solo speaker can get monotonous . That 's why it is important to identify different characters that can add flavour and interest to your audio story . <p> Here are some helpful hints so that you do n't get stuck with one horrendously boring string of lifeless words ( it happens , really ) : <p> Preface the interview with some casual conversation to make the subject comfortable . Do n't whip out the equipment right away or you might freak them out . <p> Ask the interviewee to speak in full sentences . This way , the speaker 's voice can hold its own and requires less narrator intervention to give context . <p> Tell the subject to be as descriptive as possible .

One a print journalist , one a broadcaster , and the third a B2B writer . <p> There is also advice from the boss of GRN , an agency which finds international freelance reporters for major networks . <p> This guide contains advice from those in the field , suggestions of how to follow in their footsteps , and details on how much you can expect to earn . <p> Rob McKee , freelance journalist from Canada , currently living in South Sudan <p> Rob McKee comes from a news family . " It 's all I ever wanted to do " , he said . <p> Rather than studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and worked in radio and TV before taking a role with an NGO . <p> " I took a job with Journalists for Human Rights . They sent me to Sierra Leone and essentially gave me my own radio station and said ' make it work ' . " <p> McKee , who is now 32 , spent the next three three years in Sierra Leone . About eight months into his extended stay , in January 2006 , he heard reports of a news story unravelling in Guinea . A crippling economic strike had led to civilian protests . <p> " At the radio station in Sierra Leone we were getting reports of 16 dead today , 32 dead the next . " <p> He decided to go . He bribed his way to getting a visa and sent an email to the foreign editor of a " major paper " in the UK . <p> " I emailed to say ' just letting you know that I 'm going into Guinea , I 'll contact you however I can ' . The individual emailed me back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening ?

I just assumed , stupidly , that they would definitely want the story of people streaming across the border with bullet wounds , being tracked down by their own army . <p> " I was floored . But I still thought , I 'm going in . I felt as a reporter I could n't be that close to it and not try and go in . " <p> McKee spoke to Journalism.co.uk from South Sudan . Clearly used to painting a picture with words he described what then happened . <p> " I took a small video camera , a little bit of money , half a bag of rice and loaded up a Suzuki Sidekick with a driver I knew who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this time no one was going in , the WFP World Food Programme was n't running flights and the next day was one of the single bloodiest days in Guinea 's history . <p> " It was civilians throwing stones against armies with heavy artillery and automatic weapons . And they cut the crowd in half . " <p> McKee explained how they were driving through makeshift roadblocks when they were ambushed . <p> " A rock came through the window of my driver and broke his collar bone . I was in the front seat with the window down and a guy picked up a huge slab of concrete , ran at the side of the car and tried to hit me over the head . I put my head between my legs . The driver magically punched the gas and we flew down this little alley way . They opened fire . I looked up and saw them spraying the car infront with gunfire as it was trying to get out . " <p> The car was set on fire and everyone in it was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conakry for about a week during which time he was able to file reports to the radio station in Sierra Leone where he was training reporters . <p> When McKee did manage to get back to Sierra Leone he tried to sell the footage . <p> " I contacted a friend , who knew a friend , who knew a friend , who knew someone at Reuters . I filed the footage and they were ecstatic . It was some of the only footage to make it out of Guinea at that time . " <p> He barely broke even but tried for more work . Reuters already has a stringer in Sierra Leone so McKee went to the competition . He got in touch with Associated Press who soon asked him to cover a story in the capital Freetown . He started filming footage from war crime cases and elections and was also sent to Liberia . <p> After three years in West Africa he returned to Canada . <p> " I had n't been home for a long time and I was really sick with malaria and typhoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time he became " disillusioned with local news in North America " . <p> " I started really missing Africa and really missing the work . I started missing doing stories that really had impact . " <p> An American NGO called Internews hired him as resident journalism advisor for South Sudan where he is now living , freelancing for AP and advising and training around 40 reporters at six different radio stations all of which are straddling the disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan . He says he is equipping journalists " with the skills to hopefully cover stories that were not being covered before " . <p> Although he has impressive language skills for West Africa : he can get by in French , is fluent in West African Creole , and has a fair grasp of three dialects spoken in Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea , he is now faced with learning languages appropriate to East Africa . He can greet people in the dialects spoken by the two tribes in South Sudan and is working on his Arabic . <p> He is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he explained . <p> " The conditions are quite harsh . Aside from no running water and rice and beans everyday , it 's not even as though there is an outdated media law here , there really are no media laws , so there 's nothing for reporters to even fall back on in court . Press freedom is just kind of a thought here , it does n't actually exist . " <p> But despite being a tough challenge he said he loves the job . " All of those things that I did n't like about working in a newsroom in Canada : the quality of the journalism and what , editorially , some people thought was a news story , those things I do n't see here . <p> " These are real stories . They do n't want to do stories on squirrels or if it rains tonight is it going to rain tomorrow and are people buying extra umbrellas .

" You have to be able to do everything . If you want to be the future you have to be a versatile writer , reporter , editor , videographer and your own financial manager . " <p> " Even if you can sell the work that you do as a roaming reporter , you have to be able to survive until those stories happen and it requires float money . " <p> A good way for journalists to do this is take a media trainer role or position with an NGO while looking for the big stories . <p> There 's no press release with a phone number at the bottom . People here do n't what to talk . It requires months of networking and sitting in the crappiest bars and drinking warm beer with people you would never associate with in your home country.Rob McKee <p> " There 's no press release with a phone number at the bottom .

It requires getting to know these people and earning their trust just so you can get the odd tip . " <p> There is also another price to pay . " You better be willing to sacrifice pretty much everything that you have in a western life for an extended period of time . You ca n't get the story simply by parachuting in for a couple of weeks . And you 're isolated and probably not going to be in a capital city . <p> " If you want to be able to have kids , be around for your kids and live comfortably , it 's not here . " <p> How much can TV journalists earn ? <p> McKee explained that he is able to earn around $200 - $500 for a couple of minutes of video footage .

Once in the country I approached every publication I could . There was a lot of rejection but I was eventually turned on to an international magazine based out of Nepal called Himal as well as Bhutan-based Drukpa and the Journalist . " In Malawi , where he spoke to Journalism.co.uk from , he started in a daily local newspaper and caught the attention of The Africa Report , an international magazine , and News Africa , which then helped him connect with Al Jazeera , " so it was sort of local to regional to international " . <p> " Now with Al Jazeera 's name behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they would n't until I got here . <p> " Just like I used the magazine 's office in Bhutan I 've been working out of the offices of the Malawi daily newspaper , the Daily Times , to base myself out of and try and sell myself to the international outlets " . <p> This is one model he thinks could work for freelance roaming reporters . <p> " I think you could make the economics work , working for free in a developing country . " <p> The newspaper provides the base between stories , the contacts to provide context and ideas for other articles which can be pitched afterwards . <p> One of the more major news events Lupick covered was was when 19 people were killed in riots . " It sounds terrible to say , but it worked in my favour , " he said . <p> Not only did he cover the story but was able to pitch and sell follow up articles for the Star and Al Jazeera , and as there was suddenly increased in Malawi , he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiring foreign correspondents <p> Asked what advice he would give aspiring foreign correspondents he quipped : " It 's to turn around and not do it " , explaining how tough it is to try and and get by on sporadic freelance work . <p> With fewer and fewer media outlets willing to pay for foreign bureaus or even for correspondents ' long-term placements in specific locations , reporting abroad is , increasingly , a very unstable and quite lonely occupation.Travis Lupick <p> " With fewer and fewer media outlets willing to pay for foreign bureaus or even for correspondents ' long-term placements in specific locations , reporting abroad is , increasingly , a very unstable and quite lonely occupation . " <p> How much can online and print journalists earn ? <p> Asked how you start pitching and discussing money , he said : " You start off willing to take what you can get and work up from there . <p> " Major international online publications usually start in between $300 and $350 for maybe a 1,000 word article , but give you negotiating room as your relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate arrangements for photographs and for photo essays and that sort of thing . <p> " This year I 've sort of taken everything that has been offered the first time around and then once my foot is in the door and I know the editor 's name , come back with a negotiating position . " <p> Like McKee he also explained the toll it can take on your personal life . " It 's backpack journalism , you 're working on your own and I think you have to have a fairly unattached , uncomfortable lifestyle . I do n't think it works for the man or woman with the husband or wife and kids back home any more . " <p> Anita Duffin , freelance journalist and copywriter , based in Bali , Indonesia <p> Anita Duffin 's story is quite different . After a degree in communications , she worked in marketing , plus did some corporate writing and publicity . <p> " I had always wanted to be a journalist , " she said , and only found the opportunity to write news when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Macau . <p> She met the editor of an English-language newspaper on the island during her first fortnight living in the special administrative area of China , close to Hong Kong . <p> It was at the time when gaming/gambling laws were changing and Duffin was able to use this to her advantage . <p> And once she had started writing , the work kept coming . " It absolutely exploded , " she said , and began writing for papers in Macau and Hong Kong , doing some travel writing , trade stories , articles on gaming for business magazines , people profiles , and features for lifestyle magazines . <p> Expat life took its toll and her 17-year marriage came to an end . After seven years in Macau Duffin and her two sons had to leave . <p> " None of us wanted to go back to Australia and I had established myself as a journalist in Asia and had to support two boys . " <p> The three moved to Bali " which made sense as the cost of living is cheaper " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never been so busy . " <p> Duffin is writing for various Indonesian magazines , two in-flight magazines , plus still gets work from her contacts in Hong Kong and Macau and continues to edit the island 's English-language newspaper six nights a week . She also writes for a travel search engine and has a coffee-table book on Macau coming out . <p> Asked about earnings she did not reveal details but said she is able to support herself and two teenage boys , including paying for schooling . <p> It 's hard work but it 's an adventure . You 're constantly challenged and that keeps you creative.Anita Duffin <p> " It 's hard work but it 's an adventure . You 're constantly challenged and that keeps you creative . " <p> How to get established as a freelance foreign correspondent <p> One way of getting paid while out in the field is to work through an agency , such as GRN , which connects international journalists with broadcasters around the world . Based in London GRN takes care of the sales and payments side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRN has been in business for 10 years and has 1,000 freelance correspondents with reporters in 130 countries around the world working for a long list of broadcasters , including CBC , CBS , Fox News and France 24 . <p> Some are locals and others are expatriates , the agency 's CEO Henry Peirse explained . <p> Reporters provide voice or in-vision reports , plus some provide stills and video - not necessarily using high end cameras but to provide an illustration when broadcasters are apprehensive about using both from social media alone . <p> Some of the freelancers are foreign correspondents working for international titles . Peirse gave the example of how an international staff journalist at the LA Times could then give a phone interview with a broadcaster . The newspaper would get a branded name check and the reporter could earn additional money as there is " no conflict " with the newspaper . <p> " It 's the reporter 's intellectual property and they should be paid for it , " Peirse said.How much does GRN pay ? <p> GRN publishes a rate card detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter an amount per interview . <p> " It 's a simple principle so that the reporter gets the same amount whether it is the world 's largest broadcaster or the world 's smallest broadcaster . It is the same level of professionalism required . " <p> GRN 's margins vary but reporters can make " several thousands of pounds a day if they hit the right notes , " Peirse said . <p> This requires being in the right place at the right time , of course , and a large number of interviews . <p> GRN pays -30 for a radio phone interview but may arrange three or four back-to-back , each taking just a few minutes . TV commands double the fee and a Skype interview -125 for a short in-vision call . <p> Peirse said journalists in a " good location " " such as Egypt , Tunisia , Libya , Afghanistan , Syria , Lebanon or Japan , all of which have been in the headlines this year " may earn " an extra -2,000 to -4,000 a month " . <p> Summary <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that becoming a freelance foreign correspondent is not for the faint-hearted and making a living can be hard . <p> McKee and Lupick in particular suggested it would be extremely tough without some support from an NGO in order to get by between news stories . <p> But while you are unlikely to become rich in financial terms the wealth of experience and opportunities to work on stories that need telling are limitless . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Public Data Lab is an interdisciplinary network including researchers , journalists , designers , and civil society groups in different countries . It aims to create new research and formats for the creation and use of public data . <p> The project explores digital procedures and approaches that can be used to " map and respond to fake news beyond identifying these claims " , said Jonathan Gray , fellow at the Institute for Policy Research at University of Bath and one of the researchers who compiled the guide . <p> It is designed as a collection of recipes that can be used as a starting point to experiment with different methods . <p> The document offers four propositions about fake news , illustrated with examples , data and research . <p> The first one is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of Russian information campaigning online , for example , the guide 's contributors identified three types of content : fake news , conspiracy and disinformation . <p> The second focuses on how fake news circulates online and the different publics and platforms involved in its dissemination , starting from the premise that false knowledge claims are not born fake news . " To become that , these items need to mobilise people and generate a lot of engagement , " explained Liliana Bounegru , data journalism advisor for the European Journalism Centre and researcher , who also worked on the guide . <p> The research team analysed how fake news circulates on Facebook , primarily on public pages and groups , as well as how these stories spread on Google , looking at the type of people who were " energised " by misinformation in each of the two instances . <p> Screenshot from A Field Guide to Fake News <p> The third proposition was that " successful fabrications " are not limited to the format of news stories " they also include memes and other types of visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meme pages have different editorial styles .

" <p> This is one of the mistakes newsrooms tend to make when sharing their stories on social media , Joy Mayer , a community engagement strategist and consulting fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute ( RJI ) , told Journalism.co.uk in a recent podcast . <p> Mayer and a group of students spent last year working on the first phase of a research project called Trusting News , in which 14 newsrooms of various sizes tested different formats and approaches for building trust and engagement with their readers on Facebook . <p> It turns out you really can ask people to share on certain kinds of stories , as long as it 's seen as being in the public interest and not just self-serving for the journalistJoy Mayer , Reynolds Journalism Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trust in journalism , but also outside of it , such as in healthcare or brands , before devising some social media strategies the news outlets went on to implement from May until September . The participating organisations included A Plus , Newsy and the Kansas City Star , and varied from regional magazines to regional TV stations , as well as daily and community newspapers . <p> " If you think about the constant stream of information and all the choices people make about what to click on and what to believe , share and engage with , I really wanted to drill down on what factors influenced those decisions , " Mayer said . <p> " The more we know about what encourages people to share and comment , the more intelligently and thoughtfully we can invite those interactions . " <h> Explain your value <p> A number of strategies were outlined for the following three categories : ' tell your story ' , ' engage authentically ' and ' deploy your fans ' . ' Tell your story ' revolved around experimenting with ways to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsrooms had to go beyond just sharing a link to a story to trying to provide a glimpse into the reporting process or to explain what made them stand out over their competitors . <p> " Some outlets really experimented with explaining their credibility , like ' here 's how many years of experience our newsroom has ' , or ' we 're your neighbours , we live here too ' or ' the reason you can trust our dining team is because it 's made up of a former restaurant owner and a former food critic and we really know our stuff ' . " <h> Do n't be absent <p> ' Engage authentically ' encouraged journalists to be " human , genuine and present " , particularly in the comments sections on Facebook . Mayer said she was surprised by how often readers ask the newsroom a question about a story or how they uncovered a piece of information and they do n't receive a reply . <p> " We experimented with the tone and the way we wrote , the way we engaged in comments , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what conversation prompts do people tend to participate in and which ones fall flat and why ? " <p> For example , a post from The Fresno Bee about a hospital in California that was ranked among the best in the US for neonatal care is highlighted as one of the project 's ' ideas worth stealing ' . The outlet shared the article on Facebook with a caption that asked readers if they had a child who had been cared for at that particular facility , but the newsroom furthered the conversation in the comments by asking the community if they had attended an event organised by the hospital . <h> Invite interaction in a natural way <p> The third category , ' deploy your fans ' , consisted of getting the audience to share stories once the organisations had gained their trust and following . <p> Again , participating newsrooms experimented with they way in which they invited people to interact on Facebook .

" Just say ' please share this ' . <p> " You can also ask them to tag their friends , which is another kind of sharing . So when you post a story that says ' here are some unheralded hiking trails in the area ' , say ' tag a friend you want to go on a hike with ' . That totally works , some of our newsrooms found . " <p> Each set of strategies had their own set of metrics , and the research team compared the average rate of engagement for the new types of posts with the average rate of engagement for the newsrooms ' usual posts on Facebook . Aside from likes , comments , sharing and tagging , they also measured the quality of the conversations and the feedback news organisations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies . <p> Mayer is now working on the second phase of Trusting News , in which 30 newsrooms will be gathering face-to-face feedback from their communities about how they decide which stories and publications they trust , to build on the findings from the data gathered during the project 's first phase . <p> The news organisations invited readers to answer a series of questions , such as how inclined they are to trust the news in general , and which three brands they tend to trust and which three they tend to not trust . Based on the questionnaires , each participating outlet will choose four people to speak to in person , and the aim is to get interviewees that are diverse across race , political views , age , and inclination to trust . <p> " What 's been really interesting is that in some cases , more than 1,000 news consumers are replying and many of them are indicating a willingness to be interviewed .

The photographer pursued the papers claiming copyright but publishers were able to argue a public interest defence due to the compelling need to track the woman . <p> Apart from copyright law , there are a number of moral and ethical editorial considerations to take into account too.When is it justified for a journalist use a photo from Facebook ? <p> The BBC Editorial Guidelines and guidance from the Press Complaints Commission both state that journalists should take privacy settings into account when deciding whether to publish a picture . For example , if someone has photos and a profile that anyone can view , it is arguably more acceptable to publish these pictures than if privacy settings limit photos to a closed circle of contacts . <p> The PCC said : " It can be acceptable in some circumstances for the press to publish information taken from social media websites , even if the material was originally intended for a small group of acquaintances rather than a mass audience . <p> " This is normally , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of their own actions , or are otherwise relevant to an incident currently in the news when they may expect to be the subject of some media scrutiny .

Can publishers use a Facebook or Twitter picture if someone has since removed it ? <p> For example , if a journalist copies photos from the profile of someone arrested for murder , can these be used if this person is later convicted but the photos are no longer available online ? <p> According to David Banks , the timing is irrelevant .

They receive benefits such as a print quarterly magazine , an ad-free version of the website , and access to events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for applying for a grant to create a new funding platform was that the team " realised we were jeopardising that model " because they lacked the technology required to manage all aspects of the membership system , S+nchez explained . <p> The first step has been to develop the core of the project , a specialised customer relationship management ( CRM ) software that connects all the dots involved in getting communities to support El Diario 's coverage through donations or subscriptions . <p> For example , most of El Diario 's seven million unique users per month are strongly interested in politics , but some of them also come to the website because they care about environmental issues or LGBTQ rights . The aim of the software is to identify who those people are , why they are reading eldiario.es , and provide them with more choices to fund stories related to the ones they are interested in . <p> " We are using the CRM to do that hidden but very needed job for a system like ours , which is membership and subscription-based . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and information about our users and members in order to know them better , trigger campaigns and offer better stories to fund . <p> " For instance , at the beginning of the project , we lost a lot of money because we did n't know when the credit cards of our members were going to expire or when they lost them . There are a lot of tiny things that are very time consuming and not very journalistic , but very important to fund journalism . " <p> S+nchez said they found there are other CRMs on the market but they are mostly aimed at big companies with businesses based on commercial transactions , as opposed to being media and membership-specific . The data El Diario 's software has about readers is used to understand if an individual is interested in a particular topic , based on how they consume news on the website , the app or through the newsletter . <p> The system wo n't send notifications or messages to readers about each story published on the site , focusing instead on creating communities of interest around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diario by becoming a member . <p> Screenshot of a message for readers on eldiario.es . Courtesy of Juan Luis S+nchez <p> " We only do that with people we 've learned are interested in receiving that message , which can be very specialised to the content they are reading or more general about the independence of El Diario . " <p> Memberships currently make up 40 per cent of the outlet 's revenue , while the rest is derived from advertising and events . While El Diario can not afford to " say no to ads " , S+nchez believes the organisation is in a " good position " to experiment with the membership model going forward . <p> He said people choose to subscribe because El Diario is not affiliated with any of the political powers in Spain , and also because of its commitment to transparency : like other member-supported news outlets , such as De Correspondent , El Diario publishes a breakdown of its revenues twice a year , outlining how much they 've made and how much they 've spent on operating costs and salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The project is scheduled to be completed in September 2017 , and S+nchez said El Diario is hoping to share the technology and findings with other independent media outlets in Spain . <p> " Since the beginning of El Diario , we knew our main message was about independence and not any content in particular . Our priority with the tool is more about understanding the audience and trying to get them to join in with our mission . " 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847153 @2047153/ <h> 3 steps news organisations can take to fight misinformation <p> The internet and social media have given those looking to spread false information the ability to write , publish and disseminate material at the touch of a button . <p> With access to millions of people who interact with these posts , misinformation is able to sway political opinion , push agendas and often make the authors money fast . <p> " The radical decentralisation of who gets to publish has combined in a very dangerous way with this phenomenon of our living in segmented bubbles , following and liking the sources that we trust and being drawn to news that we are already sympathetic or inclined to , " said Sewell Chan , international news editor , London , at The New York Times , speaking at the ' Post truth and alternative facts ' event in London today ( 10 March ) . <p> " The combination of how anyone can produce content , with how we consume and share it , is very volatile right now .

Some rights reserved . <p> A wealth of guidance is available for journalists on reporting death responsibly , from industry bodies as well as charities and other groups that work with the bereaved . <p> And the development of online media means these guidelines are now being applied to new environments , such as social media . <p> This guide will bring together the latest advice from the Press Complaints Commission on how to work within the Editors ' Code of Practice and general ethical guidelines when reporting on a death , as well as specific guidelines from charity Samaritans on the reporting of suicide . <p> Recent research , carried out by Jackie Newton from Liverpool John Moores University and Dr Sallyanne Duncan from the University of Strathclyde , heard from the viewpoint of families and journalists , and offered some interesting findings . <p> As Newton told Journalism.co.uk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that some families " were very open to talking to the media " . <p> Using social media for content and contact <p> She also said that while their research found reporters had " very ethical attitudes " when it came to covering deaths , some families did feel " excluded " in some cases where journalists were using social media as a " short cut " . <p> Newspapers are expected to ask the same ethical questions about material garnered from social media as they are from any sourceStephen Abell <p> Director of the Press Complaints Commission Stephen Abell said " newspapers are expected to ask the same ethical questions about material garnered from social media as they are from any source " . <p> " For example the quality of the information , how private is it ? Just because it appears publicly on someone 's Facebook site does n't mean it can automatically be used by a newspaper . Some people without really knowing make information available that is personal and it still retains the quality of privacy despite the fact it 's publicly available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context . <p> " There are pictures posted on Facebook in a certain context , often a communication between friends , jokes between friends , which if ripped out of that context and used to illustrate a story about a death could well raise a breach of Clause 5 of the code . " <p> He also outlined the use of platforms such as Facebook for contacting family members , which he said the Commission would treat " in the same way as a journalist knocking on the door or picking up the phone " . <p> " If they were asked to desist they should n't return there , " he said . <p> " In lots of ways it raises a whole new raft of ethical issues in practical terms , but I think the ethical underpinning of all this is the same , " he said , adding that " no matter what the medium " there is a need to consider " the feelings of other people " . <p> I think it 's quite common now for newspapers to take innocuous information from Facebook sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite common now for newspapers to take innocuous information from Facebook sites that are publicly accessible and I do n't think generally speaking there is a code problem with that . " <p> But he said " concerns will be raised " if actions go against privacy settings , if the context is taken away or " if it retains some quality of personal information " . <p> Sal Lalji , press and PR manager at Samaritans added , in reference to cases relating to suicide , that " when a person sets up their security parameters they do n't set them up with the idea that they 're going to be the centre of a story later on " . <p> " When a person dies if they 're at the centre of a news story it can actually be quite upsetting to see images from social networking sites that the media have taken , as these are not images that necessarily a bereaved family would like this individual to be remembered by . <p> " What we 'd always say is please check with the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if these images can be used . " Carrying out a ' death knock ' sensitively <p> Abell shared some advice for journalists who have been asked to carry out a ' death knock ' , as it is commonly referred to in the industry . <p> " A key point in terms of code is to make sure you 're not breaking the news of the death to the family , its always worth finding out from police the extent to which the family have been informed of the death . <p> " Be open straight away about who you are , why you 're there and giving the person a chance to say I do n't want to speak to you . If people are honest and open about their intentions , some people will wish to speak to them and some people wo n't , and if they do n't then there 's a great need to respect that and inform the newsdesk that they do n't wish to speak . " <p> Industry guidelines <p> As Abell mentioned earlier , Clause 5 of the Editors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to " intrusion into grief or shock " which he explains is the " central part of the code when dealing with bereavement " . <p> " It 's an area the PCC has deliberately worked very hard on over the years because one of the things we face continually is people coming to us who have suffered terrible traumatic experiences and feel to some extent the press and media have made that experience worse . <p> " So Clause 5 talks specifically about handling publication sensitively . That 's a relatively subjective point but the idea is newspapers would be expected to be able to justify why they have behaved in a certain way and how they have taken steps to handle publication and enquiries sensitively . <p> " That can lead to various specifics . For example the PCC takes handling publication sensitively to mean that a newspaper should not report a death in a light-hearted fashion , or to include gratuitous or gory details . <p> " In terms of enquiries , it does n't expect journalists to break the news of a death to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed and take steps to find out if the family has been informed before either undertaking inquiries or publishing something . " <p> He added this is an " area of the code that actually places considerable burdens on the journalist and editor to think about matters before proceeding . " <p> PCC circulations of family requests <p> When it comes to cases where families do not wish to speak to the press , they may use the PCC to circulate this to the media . The body also issues guidance to Family Liaison Officers about " media attention following a death " . <p> Abell said that " it 's absolutely legitimate and right to report on the death of someone in the community " and " absolutely in the public interest that people know how members of the community have died " . <p> We certainly do n't start from the premise that it 's wrong for journalists to make enquiries or report about death , when quite the contrary is the caseStephen Abell <p> " We certainly do n't start from the premise that it 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when quite the contrary is the case . <p> " This guidance we issue goes to all the Coroners Courts , all the police forces in country . It says you may well wish to speak to the press , in which case here are things you might wish to know . <p> " If you do n't you can use the PCC to say you do not wish to speak to the press and the PCC has the ability to disseminate your request across the whole of the newspaper and magazine industry and to broadcasters . " <p> Reporting on suicide <p> A specific area within the issue of reporting a death is when a journalist is following up on a case of suicide . <p> " When a person is bereaved by suicide it 's quite an intense form of mourning . They may be experiencing additional emotions because of the fact it 's a suicide . Another thing journalists must consider is a coroner 's report may not have come out yet , we may not know if the death was a suicide or not . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of shock , of guilt , of not being able to understand why this particular death has occurred and that can add to the vulnerability of the bereaved person . <p> " So journalists need to understand that when they 're asking questions there are things people might say at the moment of grief and shock because they 're trying to understand the situation at that point , rather than months later on down the line . " <p> She added that " when there 's media interest " in a death it " becomes quite public " and that this could " encourage negative feelings from the members of the family to the media " . <p> There may also be " suicidal feelings " being experiences by family members themselves , she said . <p> It 's really important journalists are aware how vulnerable these bereaved families are and make sure they 're supported at the same timeSal Lalji <p> " It 's really important journalists are aware how vulnerable these bereaved families are and make sure they 're supported at the same time . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no visible signs of distress it may be that they 're dealing with their grief in different ways , it manifests in different forms in different people , so journalists must be aware of that and not interpret it as a lack of emotional response or caring . " <p> Interviewing technique <p> She also outlines the sorts of questions or comments journalists should avoid when interviewing family members who have lost someone through suicide . <p> " Try to avoid saying you know how they feel or you 've been in a similar situation as each individual family or person 's grief is their own , so it 's not particularly helpful to the family . <p> " Do n't assume you know what they 're going through as it 's individual to each family . <p> " Avoid making any suggestions about the behaviour of the relatives or friends . if the families decide they do n't want to comment , avoid talking to neighbours or members of the local community who may be speculating about the situation . " <p> Copycat suicides <p> Another issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the risk of ' copycat suicides ' . <p> " What copycat suicides are is when a vulnerable person is exposed to a method of suicide or an issue of suicide that then becomes something they recall when they themselves feel suicidal . " <p> She added that they find vulnerable people " will either latch on to a characteristic or identify with the individual or they will latch on to the methods of the suicide .

LBC also reached a combined audience of 126 million on Facebook and Twitter and gathered 18 million video views on social media . <h> Have a limited time for experimentation and use data to guide you <p> LBC 's audience research , with both light and heavy listeners , and those who only engage with its content on social media , has shown that people come to LBC to hear a variety of opinions , and because they experience a personal connection with its various presenters . <p> " We wanted to invest a bit more time to create more opportunities with our presenters in the green screen studios , and we also looked at the top trending videos by other organisations , " Wilson-Beales said . <p> " We learned a lot " it was really interesting to have a fixed period for a team to experiment and then use real-time data to make quick decisions on whether a particular format works , on whether we should change the script or maybe move on from that format altogether . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any experiment project . " <h> Keep things simple and consider a video 's ending , as well as its beginning <p> Before trying out new formats , LBC 's videos were often " quite complex " in the way they presented an argument , which meant viewers were less likely to watch until the end , so the team " stripped everything back and kept things down to their simplest form " . <p> They also started paying more attention to how a video on social ended , not just how it began , as that can have influence whether people decided to share it after watching it . <p> " Quite often when we 're looking at why someone would share a video , we look at what the end point was - why would you not share that video ? That was more our line . <p> " If we take a two minute clip from a presenter in a studio , we do n't want it to fade out after a few minutes . We want it to end on a bang , not a whimper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> Highlight your content across platforms and engage people in conversation <p> One of the reasons people go to LBC is because it provides a variety of opinions from different presenters in an accessible format , explained Wilson-Beales . LBC audiences may only interact with the content on one platform , or listen only to their favourite presenter , so the team is constantly pointing out what conversations are happening on its website and on other channels to get people to experience more , and to actively participate . <p> " At LBC we like to say that our callers are our hit records . We really rely on those callers jumping on board , being part of the argument and quite often , as a consequence of that , apart from creating a great radio experience , we can create these viral moments . <p> " Audiences may have seenclips of James O'Brien holding his hands up almost in despair , responding to a caller phoning in about which EU laws they would like to veto . On social , a clip like that , served up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something like 600,000 streams . " <p> LBC is also careful not to overwhelm people on Facebook , as it can become repetitive to see multiple videos of the same presenter , or different presenters sat in the same studio , showing up in your newsfeed . <p> Out of the roughly 168 hours of content LBC produces each week , the team clips around 0.5 per cent for the website and social , so from a three-hour radio show , between one and three minutes of audio will be shared on Facebook or Twitter . <p> Often , the soundbites are clipped and turned into videos in real-time , while other times they can be saved and shared after the radio show has ended . <p> " During a show , a producer will also have a screen to look at the comments coming in on Facebook and Twitter and they will be feeding that back to the presenter . <p> " Our digital team is constantly in connection with the radio show producers , picking the top comments , which are most likely to be featured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be afraid of reviewing and changing your approach <p> LBC has now gone back into a period of audience research and user experience testing to find out how it can improve its digital offering in the run up to the UK general election on 8 June . <p> " If you do n't constantly review what you 're doing , you can end up being trapped in a cycle of creating video which is fairly similar to your competitors ' so you need to be brave enough to hit the stop button and review . <p> " It was useful to go through that journey of experimentation to learn what to do and not to do and how we can optimise our videos going forward , as we approach the election . <p> " How are we going to be there in your feeds , with you , to talk about the topics you really feel are important ? That 's our aim in the months ahead , " Wilson-Beales said . <p> Want to find out more about LBC and Global 's strategy for audio on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Global , will be speaking on a panel at our upcoming newsrewired event on 19 July .

He pointed out that it had been a highly discussed issue in Krakow many years before , since the city has a high rate of pollution . <p> The group then started looking into how they could provide a bigger perspective on what 's happening in other cities where air pollution is high , and they began building a team of correspondents to tackle the issue in different locations . <p> The correspondents working on #DeepBreath .

And this experience would happen seamlessly , without much effort on your part . <p> In 2016 , German organisation OpenDataCity received funding from Google 's Digital News Initiative to explore sensor journalism and how data about a person 's movements , or information such as whether they are scrolling through their smartphone using mobile data or a known Wi-Fi network , can provide context-aware news . <p> XMinutes imports content from publishers using RSS , JSON or an API , and presents readers with a feed of between five and 25 articles that " should fit the needs of your news consumption " , Maas told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " We estimate that you do n't have a lot of time given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start off by only giving you short articles to give you an overview of the news , and after that we try to give you longer reads from other publishers throughout the day . <p> " We need the user to read about 100 news items throughout the day to estimate what their typical day is like : do they like to read long stories after waking up or do they prefer to do that on their commute to work ? " <p> The app analyses content in a semantic and structural way to establish whether it 's a written piece , an audio snippet or a video . It also looks at how long a piece is , how long it would take an average person to read it and how long it would take someone who is not fluent in German to finish . <p> XMinutes is then able to determine the best match by analysing a user 's behaviour and data from movement and internet sensors .

" <p> Some aspects of the development process have proven challenging , such as repeating content if publishers repackage stories obtained from news wires , and the participating outlets ' ability to geotag their material . <p> Screenshots courtesy of Marco Maas <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Press Agency ) , whose content was originally included , because of repetition .

" <p> Geolocated content has been an issue , as the team has to estimate where a story is taking place . For example , Maas said , all of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 's ( FAZ ) articles are geotagged as Frankfurt , and in some cases there could be more than one town with the same name in the country . <p> " We are thinking about a model where we try to understand the region better , so for example we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities for every single city there . <p> " We would try to create a model that is extremely specific for every single place that we are covering , so you can check it against an article and be able to determine which Hamburg is now the topic of news .

The company is hoping to implement a subscription model similar to Spotify in the future . <p> " My spin here would be to talk to the big telecom or electricity providers to charge users on a monthly basis .

@@97847158 @2047158/ <p> Numbers are often the source of a story and the majority of reporters will , at some stage , be tasked with making sense of statistics , whether relating to hospital waiting times , crime figures or financial reports . <p> This guide is intended to point out some of the pitfalls and help overcome some of the problems in reporting numbers . <p> The statistics-shy can not simply say " I do n't do numbers " , James Ball , data reporter at the Guardian says . " We would never regard it as okay for a reporter to say ' I never take notes ' or to laugh and say ' I am always leaving details of my off the record sources around the office ' and we have to , I think , move to making it a bit less okay to be bad at numbers , " he warns . <p> Indeed Andy Trotter , chief constable of the British Transport Police " who is " constantly frustrated " by the misreporting of crime and police-related statistics " believes number skills should be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a compulsory part of a trainee journalist 's education because people mislead all the time with numbers , or mislead themselves with numbersAndy Trotter <p> " It should be a compulsory part of a trainee journalist 's education because people mislead all the time with numbers , or mislead themselves with numbers . I think a healthy scepticism , a healthy doubt , an inquiring mind and some modicum of technical ability is a basic requirement . <p> And these lean times call for careful calculations , Ball believes . " There 's a huge amount of talk at the moment about saving public money and public sector waste and how we can cut the deficit . If we give the impression , rightly or wrongly , that money is wasted , we should be trying to make sure it 's at least fair and in context . " <p> Misunderstand the numbers and it can not only lead to an erroneous story and unbalanced reporting , but the Twittersphere will be quick to flag up the mistakes and embarrass the journalist . What start out as a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story can lead to to bad journalism . <p> He remembers a case from a few years ago . " A journalist was going on about how dangerous and violent certain tube stations were in London until we pointed out they had picked on Russell Square , Edgeware Road and Aldgate and of course these were the ones that featured in the 7/7 bombings and the crime stats for that year were obviously inflated by that incident . " <p> Another example he remembers relates to the reporting of crime versus incidents of crime . <p> " A local paper in outer London named a very minor railway station in a leafy suburb as the most dangerous one we had . And then we found out that the local guy who runs the station reported every single type of scratch or mark as criminal damage . It was outflanking some of our major London stations and all that took was a little bit of research to point out that this place is n't dangerous . " <p> Trotter also takes issue with the headline " drugs offences soar " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you ca n't get a drug offence unless the police find it , " he reminds reporters . <p> What we have to learn to do , and the best way of stopping ourselves from getting embarrassed , is to stop and check that something makes senseJames Ball <p> Ball explains why looking at the figures more closely and using some common sense , an enquiring mind and asking a few questions shed new light and show this figure equates to each officer using the 31 pence-a-minute service a couple of times a year . <p> Ball also illustrates the pitfalls using an example from a front-page story Telegraph story from some time ago . <p> " The paper was trying to report that public sector pensions , in 10 years ' time if nothing was reformed , would cost each of us -400-a-year . Unfortunately someone doing the reporting missed a number and said -4,000-a-year . <p> " Obviously people make mistakes with their maths but the problem with this is that -4,000-a-year is more than most of us pay in income tax " so that 's suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially blown on pensions , which makes no sense . <p> " What we have to learn to do , and the best way of stopping ourselves from getting embarrassed , is to stop and check that something makes sense , " he advises . <p> Advice <p> James Ball 's advice to journalists is to " stop and try to engage your common sense brain " . <p> He also urges journalists to look out for numeracy pitfalls such as percentage change . " If something triples it 's actually only gone up by 200 per cent not 300 per cent , " he reminds us . <p> Michael Blastland says the " simplest error is just to fail to ask yourself whether the number you are looking at really tells you what you think it tells you " . <p> " The most basic of these is to look at a number with a load of zeros on the end and assume that it 's a big number . Asking yourself if it is that big a number is usually enough to start thinking about the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the population or the problem that you are discussing . <p> " Big numbers are only big if you understand the context . " <p> 2 . Take the long view <p> Blastland advises to " look at runs of data " and be aware of " sudden changes in the data , some recent change , often linked to a political intervention . <p> " Look at the longer run of data which could tell you that these kind of changes , up or down , are pretty common every couple of years . " <p> 3 . Compare like with like <p> Another pitfall for journalists is to " fail to enquire about whether the comparisons between , say , two countries or two groups of people are really the way that they seem because maybe those groups are different " , Blastland says , warning that " invariably they are different " . <p> " If you are comparing universities in the United Kingdom with universities in the United States then one of the salient factors is that the US is six times bigger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income on tertiary education . <p> " There are endless things that go on in the background and failing to enquire about what sort of things those might be is n't really going to get you very far . " <p> 4 . Take the wider view <p> Blastland warns against reporting a calculation that suggests a story when there is not any great change . " A 100 per cent increase in risk can be a change in one in a million to two in a million . If you portray it as 100 per cent change then you can frighten lots of people very easily . " <p> 5 . What is the source of the data ? <p> Blastland advises journalists to understand the methodology . He encourages journalists to ask " how did we get this data in the first place ? " <p> " There are very easy ways of coming up with rubbish if you ask the right people the right selective questions . <p> " You need to be aware of how data is gathered , always be aware that it is people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often collecting it from other people and those people may be in particular groups and the samples might be biased . " <p> Reporting hospital waiting times <p> Blastland uses couple of examples to illustrate his advice . The first example is a potential health story . <p> He warns that it is easy to be selective about the kind of hospital waiting time data . " Some measures are more reliable than others , some of them give a better account of how long people have actually waited when their wait has finished . It 's also important to get a sense of what the typical wait is like rather than the average wait . " <p> He explains that an average wait is not the same as typical wait using an easy to follow example . <p> " I can illustrate that by saying that almost everybody has more than the average number of human feet . <p> " It only takes a few people to have less than the average number of feet and the average is below two . <p> " So almost everyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , everyone can wait longer than average or shorter than average and this can be distorted by the effects of a few numbers , the experience of a few people . <p> " The best thing to do is take the median of completed waits . That data does exist but be very careful with it and make sure that 's the one you are looking at . There are other measures and some of them have their advocates but that 's the one I prefer . " <p> Blastland 's second illustration involves police statistics . This example shows the importance of understanding the source of the data . <p> " The effect of targets can encourage the police to pursue particular kinds of crime . Target culture has relaxed a good deal but there can still be incentives to collect data in particular ways . " <p> He says that there has been " a great deal of emphasis on bringing down the number of road accidents " . <p> " It looked as if these were falling dramatically but they were n't falling dramatically for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's because the police had a lot of discretion about reporting the minor accidents and those were the accidents that went down much faster . " <p> Listen to the numbers <p> Blastland warns against making the data fit an agenda and uses a recession story to illustrate his point . <p> " If I tell you that drinking has gone up during the recession you might tell me because everyone is depressed . If I tell you that drinking is down , you might well tell me that 's obviously because everyone is broke . <p> If you believe in data , try to let it speak before you slap on your own mood or your beliefs or your own expectationMichael Blastland <p> " In other words , what the data says makes no difference to the interpretation that you 're determined to put on it . You want to tell me that things are terrible one way or the other : if it goes up it 's bad , if it goes down it 's bad . And the point here is if you believe in data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own mood or your beliefs or your own expectation . <p> James Ball encourages caution in correlation . He uses an example of how the number of mobile phone masts and the fertility rate could be seen to be closely linked . <p> " The more mobile phone masts you have in any given area , the more babies you have . Does that mean mobile phone masts improve fertility ? Does it mean that babies cause mobile phone masts to be built ? Neither . Obviously what happens is that the more people that live in an area , the more mobile phone masts it needs and the more people live in an area , the more babies that are born there . " <p> Blastland has one further piece of advice around the mental approach that journalists bring to dealing with data . <p> " It is important to enjoy yourself , " he says . " Data can appear forbidding but if you allow it to intimidate , you will get nowhere . If you treat it as something to play with and explore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An important part of this is to be imaginative and creative by thinking of the alternative stories that might be consistent with the data you are looking at and explain it better and then test those alternatives against more evidence . " <p> He suggest asking " what other story could explain this ? " <p> " It is a very handy prompt and I would insist that this is not an aspect of maths or science or anything but an imagination for alternative stories that might explain the numbers . " <p> Ball says it is a journalist 's duty to explain the numbers . <p> " We do n't all have to turn into maths professors , that would be awful , but we need to understand the things that are a bit more complicated so we can make them understandable and clear to our audience , whether we work on a tabloid or a broadsheet or the Economist . Just because we have to be a bit bored looking at the numbers now and then does n't mean we should inflict it on the readers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They survey findings can be accessed by creating a free account on the EBU website . <p> Radio is the most trusted medium , relied on by 59 per cent of citizens in the European Union , followed by TV , which 50 per cent of EU news consumers said they tend to trust . <p> Roberto Suarez Candel , head of EBU 's Media Intelligence Service , who led the Trust in Media survey , said the purpose of the report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection between how people consume public media news and their level of trust in it . <p> The survey did not ask people about their trust in specific news brands , focusing instead on the type of media channels used by audiences . <p> " If you look at the relationship people have had with radio and TV throughout time , it 's a longer and stronger , so they are more able to recognise news brands they trusted before online . We think it 's very much about the perception people have of the platform . " <p> Screenshot from EBU 's ' Trust in Media 2017 ' <p> Using the Net Trust Index as a benchmark , the report also highlighted that trust in broadcast has increased across Europe in the last five years . The Net Trust Index , developed by the EBU Media Intelligence Service , is the difference between the percentage of the population who answered ' tend to trust ' and those who answered ' tend not to trust ' in the survey , not counting people who answered ' do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new media ( online and social networks ) has diminished " social platforms were the least trusted source in 17 out of 33 countries , mostly in Western Europe . The written press only benefits from readers ' trust in 13 countries of the total , and people are mostly weary of this medium in Eastern European countries . <p> News consumers in the UK also said they tend not to trust print publications . Suarez Candel pointed out the level of UK trust in the written press , measuring -51 on the Net Trust Index , has actually improved compared to previous years . However , its consistently low score can be owed to events such as the phone hacking scandal and the fact that tabloid journalism still has a relatively strong presence in the country . <p> " Our explanation is social networks and the internet are very good platforms to activate the news , to say that something has happened . <p> " But the more time passes , the quality of the information on those platforms becomes worse , news gets distorted ... so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . " <p> EBU 's report also breaks down trust in media by geographical area . For example , audiences in the Nordics tend to trust TV , radio and newspapers . The written press is also trusted by news consumers in Portugal and the Benelux area ( Belgium , The Netherlands and Luxembourg ) , while Eastern Europeans showed a higher level of trust in online media and social platforms . <p> Those in Southeast Europe who participated in the survey tend not to trust broadcast reporting and newspapers , while Northwestern Europeans are skeptical of social media and the internet. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

If you are squashed into the corner of a bedroom , your desk is cluttered , or your lighting is insufficient , you will respond physically - by hunching up or leaning forward to peer at your screen . <p> Make sure : <p> - - - Your chair is comfortable and at a height where you can rest both feet flat on the floor.- - - Your keyboard is far enough forward on your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow to wrist , on the desk . This relaxes the shoulders , helping to prevent tension and possible nerve irritation . - - - Your chair , desk and monitor are all at the correct height to work comfortably and you have adequate light.- - - You use a separate keyboard if you work on a laptop . <p> Sit up <p> Many of us , when we imagine we are sitting up straight , can in fact over-compensate for our normal postural problems . If , for example , we usually have rounded shoulders , when told to sit up straight we may pull them too far back . In many cases this will throw the lower spine out of alignment too . Here are a few tips to help you to find a straight spine . ( If you start to tense up during the following steps , take a few moments to breathe into the tense area and relax - the spine should feel able to move , not set in concrete . ) <p> - - - Sitting with both feet flat on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttocks taking equal weight . - - - Now start to feel the back of your skull becoming buoyant and gently pulling up away from your ' sitting bones ' .

( If you find this hard to feel , use an out-breath to pull in. ) - - - Finally , let your shoulders slide down away from your ears . To help broaden the shoulders imagine someone gently pulling them away from each other .

Here are some gentle stretches on this premise that can be done either at or by your desk . Repeat each a few times . Sit up straight and : <p> - - - Circle the shoulders up , back , down then forward . There are three shoulder circles - one with the arms hanging down , one circling the elbows with each hand on its own shoulder , and the third circling the whole extended arm - that work every muscle in and around the shoulder joint.- - - Sitting with your hands in your lap , pull your shoulders up to your ears and hold for a few seconds before letting them relax down . - - - Gently move your head , making sure you return to upright between each stretch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look left and right , and up and down - when looking up be careful not to ' crunch ' into the vertebrae , but to extend , keeping some length in the back of the neck . <p> Move it <p> Walking is , after lying horizontal , the activity that puts the least pressure on the spine , ( with standing coming third and sitting the worst of the four ) , but any gentle movement is good if it 's raining or your flat/office is too small for a good walk . <p> Try every hour or 90 minutes to get up from your desk and move around - even if it 's only for a few minutes . Here are some suggestions : <p> - - - Go round the block/ to the park/ for a paper if it 's a nice day . As you walk let your shoulders drop away from your ears and your arms swing naturally by your side - this will relax the shoulders , helping prevent possible nerve irritation , and naturally stimulate lymph drainage - a process that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work in an office , go to talk to a colleague rather than emailing them or picking up the phone - and try to leave the office for some fresh air daily.- - - If you work at home there is a lot you can do . Wander round the garden , or put on your favourite song and dance and sing/shout-along . It may sound silly , but singing engages the diaphragm and this in turn encourages deeper breathing , naturally dispelling tension . <p> Relax <p> Neck and shoulders - lie on the floor with your arms out to the side , palms facing up , feet propped on the floor , hip width apart with knees pointing up to the ceiling . Breathe naturally into your belly , feeling your whole body relax into the floor . <p> As you breathe allow the shoulders to relax , feeling the front of the armpit opening up . Then feel the weight of the head sinking down into the floor . Gently roll the head from side to side over the back of the skull , ( keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head were full of sand , and you were pouring it from each ear .

Let your head relax forward and rest here for as long as you need , breathing deeply and , again , allowing the whole body to relax toward the floor . Tip - let the ' crease ' in the front of the hip deepen and get softer as you relax . <p> Treatment <p> Physiotherapy , osteopathy , chiropractics , massage and acupuncture can all provide relief , and should be viewed as a business expense .

For every story he covers , Garnett now aims to produce both a video and a radio piece , and the equipment he works with has changed . The new role has required a lot of learning on the job and familiarising himself with new equipment , and there are still challenges coming up in his day-to-day work . <p> Journalism.co.uk caught up with Garnett at RTE 's Mojocon event in Galway , Ireland at the beginning of May , to find out more about his current role and his experience transitioning from a radio journalist to a digital reporter . <p> How did this change come about ? <p> " Rozina Breen , the news editor at 5 Live , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing our social media content and our social media message .

Working there , we were able to turn those films around , and we had fabulous video that we were able to turn into fabulous radio as well . The key is making sure that the sound is recorded well . So often video content has terrible sound , but you have an idea , you 've got some signpost to tell you what 's happening . <p> " In radio , you do n't have that signpost , it 's got to be on the words . So it means that you 're having to do a lot more work . You 're having to film an awful lot of stuff in the hope that your audio is good and that 's a struggle . The big successes I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . " <p> " I am digital innovations reporter . It is innovating , mostly in ways that wo n't be apparent to people who are watching or seeing it , because it 's the way that we 're putting that together . So I am filming on fairly big cameras now , Sony a6300 , and then I am putting it into an iPad and editing with an iPad . <p> " The majority of people gather their video and then put it into a laptop and edit it there . I am trying to do away with that completely and there 's good reason for that . I was in South Sudan two weeks ago and we were without mains power for four days , and so you could n't do that with a MacBook because you 'd run out of battery in two and a half or three hours of video editing . But with an iPad , using the Luma Fusion app , we were able to keep charging it up off USB battery packs and it meant that I could work right the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I used to have an iPhone in my back pocket . All you needed to do was take a sock and put that over the end of your phone and it will cut out the wind noise and you 're fine . <p> " Now I carry a tripod with a video head on it , a Sony a6300 with about three different lenses , an iPad Pro , a couple of iPhones , an Osmo mobile , an Osmo with a camera on as well , and so many microphones . I have got maybe four or five microphones that I carry around with me because each one does different things . <p> " And yes , you are getting away from the ethos of the mobile reporter being able to use the mobile phone as , to use Glen Mulcahy 's phrase , ' the Swiss Army knife ' . The iPhone is still useful as a product because you can edit video well on it , but a lot of the time you 're now using the device merely as a sending tool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly from the idea that everything 's got to be on an iPhone , and it 's got to be an iPhone .

" <p> Are you still a mobile journalist ? <p> " That 's a really good question and I am struggling with the answer . Yes , I think I am , because I think that mobile journalism is a way of operating , it 's the workflows . What I 've taken from this is the need to have absolutely solid workflows that you can follow through . <p> " So how do you get the material off the device that you 've gathered it on , how do you get that onto one machine that you can then work and play around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , how do you get it off that , and how do you get it back into your own content management system ?

@@97847190 @2047190/ <h> How to : Get paid on time <p> For anyone who is freelance these days , it 's a depressingly familiar scenario . You pitch the idea , win the commission , write the piece , get it published , submit the invoice , wait 30 days and then - nothing . <p> Unless you are a particularly successful freelancer , it is likely that you do not have a sufficiently large cash flow to get by without getting paid on time . After all , you have bills to pay and mouths to feed ; all of your creditors expect to get paid on time , so why should n't you ? <p> The good news is that with just a few simple steps , you can help speed up delivery of payment of your invoices , and avoid acromonious run-ins with your clients . <p> Define your terms <p> It is important to define your terms and conditions for payment on your invoice and , ideally , in any written contract you have with your client - such as a commission form . Confirmation of commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the allowed usage of your material , to assert your copyright , and to clarify the details of your commission such as rates . Although they are more commonly used by professional press photographers ( the smart ones at least ) , there is no reason why freelance journalists should not be designing their own commission forms and supplying them to publishers ( rather than having terms imposed upon them by publishers ' own documentation ) . <p> The wording on your invoice should state your payment terms and also define a deadline by which your client has to put , in writing , any queries they have about your invoice . The latter will put you in good stead if your client later decides to dispute the invoice . The terms should also include the rate of interest you will charge for overdue payments ; legally you are entitled to eight per cent per annum above the Bank of England base rate ( ie if the base rate is four per cent you can charge 12 per cent PA ) . <p> Make your terms the boldest item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the actual due date . <p> For example : <p> Terms : Strictly net 30 days from date of invoice - payment due XX/XX/XX . Any queries with this invoice must be made in writing within seven days from date of invoice . Under the terms of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts ( Interest ) Act 1998 , interest will be payable at 12 per cent PA from date payment is due ( 30 days from invoice date ) . <p> Credit control <p> Having taken all the necessary steps to ensure your terms of business have been clearly stated to your client , your first step after 30 days have lapsed from the date of your invoice should be to issue a statement . Statements are a bit like invoices , but less specific . They should list all outstanding invoices by your invoice number and amount , and indicate the amount of interest accrued . They should also be addressed to the accounts department of your client , rather than the individual who commissioned you . Hopefully this will highlight any problems such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to avoid it being personal . <p> Most accounts packages , such as MYOB for example , make it quick and easy for you to issue statements . If you make a point of setting a regular date in your diary to print them off , it need take only a few minutes to print off a few sheets , stick them in envelopes and put them in the post . Or , better still , fax them to your client 's accounts department . <p> It 's up to you how long you wait before the next step but if , say , you have sent a statement every fortnight for another 30 days and still have not received payment , then it may be time to get on the telephone . Generally speaking , it 's probably best to start with the accounts department . There are a few commissioning editors around who will be diligent and professional enough to do your money chasing for you if you ask them , but most will probably have enough on their plate with their own workloads . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ring accounts first . Make sure you get the name and position of the person you talk to , and log the time , date and essence of the conversation you have with them . There are a number of responses you might get : <p> 1 . Your invoice has not been received . Offer to fax them a copy or personally address one to them in the post by recorded delivery , on condition that they agree to pay immediately . <p> 2 . Your invoice has not been received and it needs to be authorised by the person or department who commissioned you first . In this case , you may have to go back to your main contact and find out why the invoice has not been authorised and passed on . But it 's worth pointing out to your accounts contact first that perhaps it should be encumbent on them to do the chasing , otherwise their organisation is likely to incur additional costs ( more about that later ) . <p> 3 . Your invoice has been processed and will be paid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but you could press them for the interest to be added to this amount , but they might ask you for a separate invoice for it . If it 's just a matter of a few pence , it 's probably best to write it off . Assure them that they will be held to their promise , diarise the date and call again if the obligation is not met . You can also suggest they pay by BACS ( electronic bank transfer ) , if they do n't do already . <p> 4 . It 's company policy not to pay invoices for 60 etc days . Politely point out that the law says 30 days and you will be abiding by the law . If they do not settle within ( you choose ) number of days , your solicitor will be issuing a seven-day notice , followed by a county court summons ( more on this later ) . <p> 5 . " The cheque is in the post . " Ask for the cheque number , when it was dated and when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , in case it has been sent to the wrong address . If they can not tell you the cheque number , something is probably amiss . <p> 6 . " The person who signs the cheques is away . " Ask them in that case what provision has been made to sign salary cheques and other important bills such as utilities . If these payments can be authorised , why not yours ? <p> If the above steps still result in a failure to pay , it 's time to get serious . <p> Legal action <p> The ultimate sanction for a bad debt is the small claims court . This need not be as daunting as it sounds . A good solution for initiating a legal process in the UK is an online solicitor such as Thomas Higgins . It 's cheap , easy and very effective . <p> There are three stages : <p> 1 . Letter before action . For a fee of 2.00 GBP , Thomas Higgins will issue a letter on their headed notepaper requesting payment from the debtor within seven days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the debtor , for the amount of the debt , the interest and the court costs . At this stage , neither party needs to actually attend court . If no defence is made by the debtor , then the case automatically goes to stage three . <p> 3 . Judgment and execution . A county court judgment is made , and if the debt is less than 600 , the local county court baillif will be instructed to recover the debt . If the debt is more than 600 , the judgment is transferred to the High Court Sheriff for enforcement . <p> In practice , if you follow all the procedures outlined in this article , you will rarely get beyond stage one , if indeed you get that far . A solicitor 's letter is usually enough to prompt most accounts departments to get their act together . One thing to bear in mind , though , is that Thomas Higgins does not send letters before action by recorded delivery . Make sure you definitely have the right address for your client , perhaps by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have problems further down the line . You can also do a free search on the companies house website to check address details ( " Tools to help you " &gt; " Find information on a company " ) . <p> If it does go to court action , it 's almost certain to be settled once judgment has been made , providing your client is still trading and solvent , and as far as you can determine , running a legitimate business . You will have nothing extra to pay if it is settled , but if a defence is entered by the debtor and you have to go on to a court hearing , there is the potential that you might have to bear the court costs if you lose . You will also have to pay the costs of the initial court action if you choose not to proceed with a hearing - usually less than 100 . <p> If it goes to a hearing , both parties will be given the chance to make their cases in a fairly informal way in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a claim for reasonable expenses for attending court and , if you win , the judge will include these with all court costs and interest accrued in his judgment against the debtor . If you lose , you will have to bear the court costs plus the expenses of your debtor . In your address to the judge , you should make your case as simply as possible , restricting your speech to a simple retelling of chronological events , supporting your case with written evidence such as invoices etc . If you have kept a log of all your dealings with your client as suggested earlier , this will be a simple matter . Avoid hearsay evidence , such as the relating of telephone conversations etc , and stick to the hard facts relating to your sale to the client and the key events of your attempts to get paid . <p> A defence is rare and usually only happens either because the client is unaware of the debt , or disputes it . The former should be unlikely if you have followed normal invoicing and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if a client has not made his complaints clear to you , in writing , within the timescale you defined on your invoice , they will be on less firm ground . And it will certainly not look good to a judge if the debtor only disputes the debt in writing at , say , the stage where judgment has been issued after the initial court hearing . <p> Finally , the worst case scenario is if your client has gone into liquidation . Make sure the liquidator or administrator has the full details of your debt and that they acknowledge your claim as valid . As a freelancer , you will be low down on the list of priority debts and unlikely to be paid in full , if at all , but some recompense will be better than none . <p> Top ten tips <p> 1 . Do n't get personal . Money is an emotive issue but try to stay calm , while still being assertive.2 . Focus on accounts departments rather than your original commissioning contact.3 . Employ a simple credit control procedure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; it 's there for you so do n't be afraid of it.5 . Make it easy for companies to pay you . Supply your bank details so you can be paid by BACS ( electronic bank transfer ) wherever possible.6 . State your terms clearly on your invoice and , ideally , issue a confirmation of commission form detailing exactly what you were commissioned to do , the rate agreed , any additional terms such as kill fees etc . And get your client to sign it and return a copy to you.7 . Create a financial buffer . Try to put aside roughly 25 per cent of your income each month . This will both cover your tax bill at the end of the year and also give you some emergency cash while awaiting for invoices to be paid . Registering for VAT will also help your cash flow as you only have to pay the VAT back you have collected ( 17.5 per cent on all your invoices ) every three months.8 . Do n't be afraid to telephone - a regular , diarised campaign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm but polite at all times.9 . For larger projects spread over weeks or months , try to agree beforehand that payments be broken down into regular amounts . This will minimise your risk and help your cash flow.10 . When quoting for work , build in a hidden late payment penalty element , and offer to discount by that amount if an invoice is paid on time . If you are feeling really canny , issue the discount as a credit against future work . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Individuals with a driven mindset will ensure they have good habits that positively impact their life . If a person has regular good habits , they are giving themselves the best possible chance to be successful . And the same philosophy can be applied to breaking bad habits because negative patterns of behaviour can easily disrupt a person from their routine and diminish their chances of success . <p> Kicking a bad habit is difficult , but if a person puts in the time , effort and dedication , they can get themselves back on track . Firstly , if a person lacks focus , they should stop multitasking to help re-train the brain to rebuild their attention span . Also , a lack of delegation will result in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daily , weekly and monthly administrative tasks should be delegated out to trusted employees . Another bad habit that can be easily fixed is when a person is reactive rather than proactive . Reactive people do n't maximise their potential because they carry out tasks when it is too late . Being proactive is a good habit that will give an entrepreneur a competitive advantage . <p> Breaking bad habits is just as important as developing good habits . All the benefits of sticking to good habits can easily be undone by one or two bad habits that creep into a person 's routine .

@@97847211 @2047211/ <h> How to : write headlines that work for SEO <p> The ' Gotcha ' headline was first used by the Sun in 1982 to report the sinking of the Belgrano <p> Credit : The Lakelander on Flickr . Some rights reserved <p> Great newspaper headlines " like " Gotcha " or " Swedes 2 , Turnips 1 " " do not work online , it is said . <p> And there is a school of SEO thought that has reduced the art of headline writing to a mechanical process of stuffing in as many keywords as possible . <p> Good news : you do not need to do this . But to avoid it , while still attracting search-engine traffic , you need to understand that online articles can have FIVE headlines . <p> Once you understand how each one works , you can tailor your headlines accordingly . So you can write brilliant ones at the top of the page while the alternative versions are written to do well in search engines.Headline 1 : on-page <p> This is the obvious one " it is whatever is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to find your content via search engines , it is usually seen as a good idea to use likely search terms ( keywords ) in your article and heading . <p> As a result , news sites often follow a " keywords : headline " format to get searched-for terms at the front of their headlines . Look at these pages from the Telegraph . Many follow the format " Wimbledon 2011 : the rest of the headline " because they know so many people were searching for the words Wimbledon 2011 ( this is nothing new ) . <p> If you were thinking about SEO , you might decide to include the words Royal Wedding 2011 in the headline , to spell out Princess Beatrice in full ( as people are more likely to search for her that way ) , and to remove the initial question as it does not have any popular keywords in . <p> So why has n't the Daily Mail done that ? Why has it written an interesting headline and not an SEOed one ? <p> Headline 2 : the HTML title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google does not actually show the on-page headline in its web results . It shows something called the HTML title , instead . <p> The HTML title is some information that 's hidden in the HTML code that makes up a web page . <p> Most websites that use any sort of content management system ( even free ones like WordPress ) automate the creation of the HTML title . Typical rules to follow are " On-page headline " site name " or " On-page headline " section " site name " . <p> So if we take one of those Telegraph headlines , such as this one , its headline is " Wimbledon 2011 : Serena Williams accuses All England Club of predjudice over ' exile ' from Centre Court " while its HTML title is " Wimbledon 2011 : Serena Williams accuses All England Club of predjudice over ' exile ' from Centre Court - Telegraph " . ( Do not blame me for the spelling . ) <p> There is no reason , however , for the words in the HTML title to exactly match the on-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Bea 's hat example , the HTML title is actually " Royal Wedding 2011 : Princess Beatrice and Eugenie top the fashion flops yet again " ( note how that ticks all the boxes from earlier of front loaded Royal Wedding term , Beatrice spelt out in full etc ) . <p> Google pays a lot of attention to words that appear in the HTML title , so by using keywords in full there , but writing a great on-page headline with personality , abbreviations and nicknames , you can cater for search engines , searchers and regular readers . <p> This principle does not just apply to news articles . Most blogs or news sites have tag pages that automatically aggregate stories on a specific subject . You can use the HTML title to help sell your tag page to searchers . Take this page about Celebrity Big Brother on Holy Moly . Its on-page heading is just " Celebrity Big Brother " but its HTML title is " Celebrity Big Brother 2011 , Channel 5 : news , gossip , photos , videos Holy Moly ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears in Google 's search results than if it just said " Celebrity Big Brother Holy Moly ! " . <p> ( I will not go into it here , but as an exercise , why not think about how you could benefit from changing the headline after a story has been published ) <p> Headline 3 : how you appear in Google 's news results <p> Google has several different types of web results " videos , web , news etc . And although you can access specific searches ( just image searches , for example ) , Google will often blend its results together . So if you search for something topical , Google will mix a news box in with its web results . <p> The headline that Google shows in its news results is usually the on-page headline " and NOT the HTML title . <p> So this seems like another pressure to make your headlines " SEO " y " with keywords at the front etc " because this is how it will appear in Google News results . <p> Google occasionally gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locates the correct words ( as well as finds your stories quickly ) is to submit a Google News sitemap . This is just a file that you upload to tell Google News about new news stories . <p> You can include in the sitemap the heading you want Google to use in its news results in what is called the " title " tag ( not to be confused with the HTML title ) . <p> Google says that " article title tags should only include the title of the article as it appears on your site " . <p> But it does not seem to penalise some sites if they do not . So here is an example of a news story about Pippa Middleton 's arse . <p> It is a search phrase that was massively popular after the Royal Wedding . The Mail Online had used the word " bum " in its on-page headline but used the word " arse " in its news sitemap headline ( and HTML title ) . So if you had searched for Pippa 's arse in Google , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results using the word " arse " . <p> If you were a site reader , however , you would only come across the " bum " version and your sensibilities would n't be offended . <p> So this is another way that you can get keywords into Google 's results without having to use them in your on-page headlines " something news sites might consider if they want to use tabloidy headlines but still be found in Google News . <p> You need to be careful how you use this ability . Using the HTML title in your news sitemap instead of the on-page headline is n't strictly using " the title of the article as it appears on your site " as Google says . But it does n't seem to mind . If , however , you used a completely different headline in your news sitemap to both the on-page one and HTML title , you might end up in trouble with Google ( plus it would annoy your readers ) . <p> And remember news sitemaps are only relevant for Google News results . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your content do not trigger a news box , it is usually not an issue . <p> Headline 4 : link to your story on other pages <p> There are lots of ways to reach a news story once you 're on someone 's website . It will usually be listed on the home page , channel pages ( " news " or " sport " , as well as " UK news " and " football " , say ) , and tag pages . <p> Many sites get their journalists to write short versions of their headlines for their navigation pages . So this story by the Guardian has a headline of " Arsenal suffer fresh blow with Jack Wilshere injury relapse " . But its headline on the sport and football pages is " Arsenal 's Wilshere blow as Nasri exits " . <p> Google takes account of the words that are used to link to a page , so this is another way you can target a page for certain keywords . <p> I said earlier that Google shows the HTML title in its web results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with text used to link to a page if it thinks it is more relevant to what someone searches for . So in that Guardian article , if someone searched for Nasri then Google might have used the linking text ( Arsenal 's Wilshere blow as Nasri exits ) in its web results and not the HTML title . <p> Sometimes Google has even shown in its results the linking text from a different website in place of the HTML title . ( If you were an evil SEO , you might think about how you could use this to harm a competitor ) <p> This also applies to how you link to your article from within articles " as I have done liberally on this page . So if I want the first piece of this series I wrote to appear when people search for SEO for journalists , I should link to it with those words ( as opposed to " click here " or " last time " or whatever ) . <p> Although not really a headline , linking text is another way that you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without even having to visit it . And as links are usually a different colour , they stand out when somebody scans a page . <p> Headline 5 : social media <p> The final " headline " for an article is the one you use on social media . When you launch your article onto Facebook or Twitter , you do not have to use the on-page headline . Obviously if you 've automated this process , you will generally use that headline . <p> And when you put a retweet or like button on your pages , you can also control what text will appear in the tweet or status update when someone clicks it . Again , this is usually coded to be the on-page headline but for really important posts you could ( with the right development work ) make authors write a " social media optimized headline " just for this purpose . <p> You can still write great on-page headlines while benefitting from search engine traffic <p> Conclusion <p> The best approach depends on what sort of site you are writing for and what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be appropriate for small new hyperlocal sites . What works for celebrity gossip may not work for B2B content that is rarely searched for . And people will get fed up with you if you try to deceive them via different headlines . <p> But used carefully , the different options mean you can still write great on-page headlines while benefitting from search engine traffic . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

For some , it 's a chance to live in a warmer climate or a place with a more affordable cost of living " particularly if they 're paid in US dollars , euros , or pounds sterling and are based somewhere with a favourable exchange rate . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City to Singapore in 2010 for her partner 's job , it 's a way of getting the work/life balance right . <p> " I have a young child and freelancing allows me the best of both worlds , " she said . <p> Of course , as with any job , freelancing in another country has its downsides too . <p> There can be language and cultural barriers to overcome , not to mention visas and often complex tax systems to navigate . <p> So if you 're considering working as a freelancer abroad , here are the things you need to know before you pack your bags . <p> Image by Ben Husmann on Flickr . Some rights reserved . <h> Where to go ? <p> There are three important factors to consider when picking a place to freelance abroad : <p> cost of living <p> lifestyle <p> opportunities <p> Are you seeking adventure ? Do you like the hustle , or do you prefer a more laid-back pace of life ? Does the location you have in mind generate globally relevant news ? And can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> New York might have lots of opportunities , for example , but it 's also an expensive place to live " and it 's chock-full of other foreign freelancers chasing the same stories . On the other hand , somewhere off the beaten path might offer more opportunity to carve out your own niche . <p> It 's also important , of course , to consider whether you will need a visa to live in the country you choose , and how easy it is to get . Gov.uk has information on visas UK nationals require to travel abroad , but some countries , such as the USA , require journalists to get a special visa if they want to work during their stay .

Weber , an American journalist also based in Cape Town . <p> " We had rolling blackouts in 2008 , and again in 2015 . A long-life laptop battery became a need rather than a want . " <p> Beth McLoughlin moved from London to Brazil in 2010 and did n't speak a word of Portuguese , which she describes as " a baptism of fire " . <p> " I had lessons but also spent many hours studying , and talking to Brazilians , who thankfully are very sociable , " she said . <p> McLoughlin also notes that Rio de Janeiro , where she 's based , is " quite a sexist place to live " and a tough city " she said she has been robbed at gunpoint , ripped off , and thrown suddenly out of her apartment for no reason . <p> " Having a mix of native and expat friends really helps , but it is also important to go back home to visit as often as you can , and not put too much pressure on yourself to stick out long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Working across different time zones can also make life tricky . Use an app such as timeanddate.com for scheduling interviews , and watch out for Daylight Savings : the clocks change on three different weekends in the US , Europe , and Australia . <h> Pitching and building contacts <p> If you already have a network of editors in your home country , Weber recommends letting them know ahead of time that you 'll be moving and asking if they have any stories or special projects coming up that may be relevant to your new location . <p> " Update all your social media profiles with your new location and , when you arrive , network with local journalists as well as foreign correspondents , " she added . <p> If you do n't take pictures yourself , McLoughlin recommends teaming up with a photographer in your new home city as original photos will help to sell your stories . <p> " You can find correspondents ' associations in most big cities , " she added , " which you may want to join in order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make friends . " <p> Barbara Diggs , an American freelancer in Paris , points out it 's a good idea to get familiar with the publications you want to pitch to before you leave , especially if they 're print magazines . <p> " Even though virtually every magazine has a strong web presence now , in my mind , it still does n't beat knowing the print edition well ... and you may not have access to it abroad , " she said . <p> By Phil Roeder on Flickr .

Some companies charge a wire transfer fee or even mail paper cheques if they 're sending money to a freelancer overseas .

This guide explains the legalities , what type of stories sell , what you can expect to earn and the first steps to take . <p> That 's the perk of being a freelancer and if you own the rights to your material , it 's something you should doPeter Veenhoven , IFA <p> For example , if you have written a feature and sold it to the Mail on Sunday you could potentially syndicate your work and sell the same interview to magazines in several countries for little or no extra work . <p> Peter Veenhoven , owner and managing director of the Amsterdam-based International Features Agency , said it is something that journalists should be doing . <p> " That 's the perk of being a freelancer and if you own the rights to your material , it 's something you should do . <p> " If you write a book you would try to get it published in as many countries as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the type of features you write , it can be very lucrative . " <p> Know your rights <p> The first step is to understand what your contract ( if you have one ) with the UK publication allows you to do . <p> Veenhoven advises to check you are selling " first UK rights " . <p> " If you freelance and you sell your features in the UK , only sell first UK rights so that you have the freedom to syndicate your material abroad . <p> " Otherwise it is that publication 's copyright for a long period of time . <p> " And if the UK magazine wants the worldwide rights they should be paying more . " <p> Know what content sells <p> Overseas magazines , news sites and newspapers will only be interested in buying content that they can not get for themselves . <p> Access is what it 's all about and freelancers in countries like the UK , Germany and America , have a lot of accessPeter Veenhoven , IFA <p> Indeed , 80 per cent of the articles sold internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and musicians . <p> " It is a good idea to focus on things of interest to a large group of readers , " Veenhoven explained . <p> " So trying to syndicate an interview with a UK soap star or a judge on X Factor is not such a good idea . But to interview Ewan McGregor , for instance , is a much better idea , " he said . <p> There are lots of British names who are good to interview and offer international appeal , he said , meaning resulting interviews would be of interest to magazines in countries as wide ranging as Russia , Japan , Australia or even Chile . " Access is what it 's all about and freelancers in countries like the UK , Germany and America , have a lot of access , " Veenhoven said . <p> Veenhoven cited Lady Gaga as an example of a celebrity who would prefer speaking to journalists in one of those countries first.There is a demand for such interviews in " smaller countries such as Belgium or Denmark , or countries that are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on buying stories written by journalists in the UK or countries with access to stars . <p> The interviews Veenhoven and his colleagues find sell abroad most readily are those where the celebrity gives a limited number of interviews . The more exclusive the content , the more easily it can be sold . Press conferences and " round tables " are less likely to sell than a one-to-one where the celebrity has granted only a handful of interviews . <p> Veenhoven gave the example of Noel Gallagher discussing his new album . " He may have given 10 interviews and on a worldwide scale that 's not a lot . " <p> " If Richard Branson does interviews , he will only do a few , so someone like Branson is always interesting to us . <p> " Most successful syndicating freelancers have relationships with PR people or someone who they have interviewed in the past and will interview again and again , and that 's really valuable . " <p> It seems like when the recession deepened , the demand for big names grew and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IFA previously syndicated more news and reportage , Veenhoven explained , but there is an increasing demand for interviews with film stars and pop artists . <p> " It seems like when the recession deepened , the demand for big names grew and there was a lesser interest in other features . " <p> Asked if real life stories sell abroad , such as those published in women 's magazines , Veenhoven said : " People always tell me there 's a market for that but it 's not something I 've had a lot of luck with . " <p> Understand what you can earn <p> The International Features Agency has a simple formula : the journalist and agency get a 50-50 split of the revenue generated . <p> If the IFA commissions a writer , the split is 80-20 in the favour if the journalist . <p> Veenhoven gave the example of a Japanese magazine looking for an interview with Lily Allen . The IFA will commission a journalist it knows has the contacts and can get the interview . The journalist gets 80 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent of any additional sales of that article , for example if the IFA then sold it on to Hong Kong and Germany . <p> " We represent writers and publications . The journalist or the publication is our client . It 's in our interest to have a good relationship with our clients as that 's where we get our material , " Veenhoven said . <p> Asked for figures , Veenhoven said what you can expect to earn varies a lot between countries . Smaller countries pay less than larger countries with stronger economies , he said , " especially now in these difficult times " . <p> For example , an interview may be sold to a publication in Portugal for G250 ( -220 ) whereas the same article could fetch G1,000 ( -881 ) from a German news outlet , Veenhoven said . <p> The fact that the Euro and Sterling have become much closer than they were a few years ago works in favour of UK-based journalists . <p> And the more exclusive it gets , and if the timing is right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few writers who have a feel for what to offer when . They file their features on a regular basis and some are sold twice for not too much money but others , which are pretty similar but filed when that person is more in demand , can sell 10 times . <p> " On an average of G350 ( -308 ) to G400 ( -352 ) , if you sell a feature 10 times it becomes really interesting . I 'm not saying it will make you incredibly rich , but it does help . " <p> What about bylines ? International publications will give you a byline followed by an IFA credit . For example , Joe Blogs/IFA . <p> Photographs <p> Generally you do not need to worry about getting photos - although you could earn considerably more if you do . <p> " Of course it 's nice to have photos , but generally text and pictures are sold separately . Ideally we have the package , but mostly we only sell text , " Veenhoven said . <p> The first steps <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Explain how it was done , give a short synopsis with a highlighted quote , then the full text . <p> " A lot of my day is spent selecting what we offer on a particular day " , Veenhoven said .

@@97847229 @2047229/ <p> It will come as no surprise to anyone reading to be told that we are living through a period of intense change transforming the media landscape . My two decades in journalism have witnessed the industry turned inside out and upside down , cajoled this way and that by external forces well beyond the control of any publishing executives in Fleet Street , Wapping or Peterborough . <p> When I joined Cardiff Journalism School in the newspaper course intake of 1996 , we were launching our media careers in the calm before the storm . The Daily Telegraph 's first website , the Electronic Telegraph , had launched quietly in November 1994 . We still used manual typewriters and a waxing machine took pride of place in course tutor John Foscolo 's production cupboard . But there were ranks of beige Apple Macs too , sporting early desktop publishing software such as the bafflingly basic Talbot Newswrite . Though we did n't know it , we were about to witness the changing of the media guard . <p> Come graduation day , every one of us landed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional newspapers , a couple joined national magazines and the lucky few waltzed straight onto Fleet Street . Nineteen years later and at least a fifth are no longer employed in journalism , the lure of PR dollar , less stressful , more dependable careers outside the media or family duties bringing journalistic roles to an end . Many blame the uncertainty of the media revolution for their exit . We have truly lived through " and continue to experience " significant structural change . <p> But one hack 's change is another 's opportunity . There is reason to be optimistic : successful journalists with chameleon-like tendencies have a knack of reinventing themselves . I heartily believe there is space in the new media landscape for old-fashioned journalistic graft and editorial nous ; for scintillating subbing and headline writing skills to lure in casual browsers ; and for publishers adept at building communities of readers and communicating with them regularly " just online , rather on paper . Where there 's audience , there 's commercial opportunity . <p> That 's my experience working at Bauer Media for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are building successful digital publishing businesses around highly targeted , niche audiences , designed with longevity to weather the storms gripping our industry . Here 's what I 've learned . <h> 1 . Know your mission statement <p> It sounds obvious , but so many publishing enterprises either lose sight of their original mission statement or never had one in the first place . Any successful web publishing business should be able to write on a beer mat their raison d ' +tre . Ours at Parkers.co.uk is dead simple . We want to help Britain 's car buyers find the best possible vehicle for their needs and budgets . It really is that simple . <p> This focus is instilled across the team and underpins everything we do . We even plastered the mantra across a giant 65in screen above the editorial desks . A motivated , focused team is a much easier one to pull in the right direction , after all . <p> At Parkers that mission statement is used to sense-check everything we do : from daily editorial conferences , where every story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps . If any plan does n't feel like it is helping the great British public buy their next car , the chances are it 's not going to improve our business . <h> 2 . Understand your digital audience <p> This is as fundamental as understanding your mission statement . Knowing your reader has long been a staple of print publishing " and it 's even more important in digital publishing . But there 's one crucial difference : we have all the data in the world to deepen our understanding of how real people actually behave . <p> Anyone who has worked in print publishing will be familiar with the beard-stroking and black art of interpreting magazine or newspaper ABC sales data . Guesswork is another way of describing some of what I have witnessed in print . Why did one issue sell , when another flopped ? The honest answer is , you often have no idea . Yet senior publishers concoct elaborate theories , blaming rival cover stories or promotions , unseasonal heatwaves or the competitive landscape to support gut instinct and/or political back stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw stats are available for all to see . <p> At Bauer Media we open up analytics to the entire team " everyone from junior staff writers to the board has access to data . It 's unforgivingly transparent . We all see which stories sizzle , and which sink . The popular content with huge dwell times and long scroll depths , as well as the pages which disappear without trace , sparking a woefully high bounce rate . Knowing your readers inside out is much easier when you can see what floats their boat . <p> One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is this : digital publishing is devilishly simple : see what works " and then do more of it . Ditch what is n't popular and learn from your mistakes . Research every decision with analytics , train your team in data interpretation and surround yourself with team members who see data as their friend , not their enemy . Too many journalists are suspicious of analytics , although that is slowly changing . <h> 3 . Hire creative advertising geniuses <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are uniquely placed to answer . You are convinced you stand a good chance of building a strong community whose needs you can service brilliantly , repeatedly and " hopefully " uniquely . Now the hard part . How on earth do you monetise this audience ? Especially in an age when ad rates are collapsing through the floor , as agencies become more sophisticated with micro-targeting , programmatic ad networks depress the prices commanded by once-valued audiences and technology such as ad-blocking creates new headaches with every passing month . <p> Who would want to be in digital sales with that cursed backdrop ? Fortunately for us , Bauer Media " and other publishers " are slowly building an army of salespeople who have taken the leap alongside their editorial counterparts into this new data-driven world . The risks are huge online , but rewards can be significant too , especially if you come up with a compelling content proposition that rivals can not match . <p> It 's true to say that the rules of online advertising are even more fluid than in print . The days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and truly past , complicated by the addition of multiple ad placements , sticky display units , Google ads , third-party sponsored content networks , takeovers , MPU2s , retargeting on- and off-site plus all manner of disruptive methods designed to give advertisers stand-out in a crowded marketplace . <p> It takes skilful teams to tiptoe the line between helping users with useful , carefully targeted advertising and the aesthetic mess that 'll result if you overload the page with too many commercial interruptions . The best digital ad sales people understand this tension and can think laterally around the problem " using data at the heart of their arguments . Unlike in print , you really can micro-target exactly the audience a client wants online and we are getting better and better at doing that . <p> Bauer has invested heavily in new ad platforms on both Parkers.co.uk and Carmagazine.co.uk , where we can serve adverts not just against a given manufacturer 's models , but also against its rivals ' . Right down to the level of detail where it can promote against competition 's hybrid petrol-electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have added new services so we are less dependent on advertising money : vehicle valuations , used-car classified adverts , leasing deals and insurance quotes all help diversify our revenue streams . <h> 4 . Go social : Thinking outside your own walled garden <p> Gone are the days of relying solely on people coming to our websites to consume content . We have to market the hell out of it " and the journalists themselves are the brand 's marketers-in-chief and social media warriors . Understanding your user and how to talk to them on social media is a crucial skill nowadays , and we are constantly striving to spark the conversation online across social platforms to drown out our competition 's buzz and get our own stories noticed . <p> We have had great success in this area , growing CAR 's Facebook audience from 350,000 in 2014 to 1.2m in 2016 . And that 's 100 per cent organically , with no paid-for followers , just from publishing compelling picture galleries , posting irresistible links and engaging heavily with our users ( not something many traditional print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Twitter ( we have doubled in the same period to 122,000 followers ) , it means we are speaking to more people than ever before . At its peak , we were driving nearly 10 per cent of the website 's entire traffic from social media . <p> But it 's not just about on-trend social platforms . We have also engaged with our own in-house audiences , accessed from across the Bauer Media portfolio . Parkers ' audience development strategy saw it partner with our female-focused sister titles , producing motoring content in association with Grazia , Closer , the Debrief and Mother &amp; Baby . It 's a move that other publishers will struggle to replicate and taps into a female audience that car makers are eager to speak to . Publishers who can drive audience around their own portfolio successfully will stand a better chance of winning . <h> 5 . Scale is important <p> Big is beautiful in the web world . The biggest advertising wins are reserved for the select few at the top of the ratings lists , with slim pickings for smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoovering up ever more ad money , it 's hard work keeping the revenues rolling in . <p> Parkers.co.uk is consistently one of the UK 's biggest motoring editorial websites , drawing 2.5m users a month , consuming some 20m page views ( August 2016 ) . At that scale , we are generating revenues well into seven figures annually , making this Bauer 's biggest and most profitable website in the UK . <p> This is the classic business conundrum : the larger , most successful websites attract the lion 's share of investment . But there 's a need to invest equally in the smaller , more niche brands we publish too . You ca n't have all your eggs in one basket . The internet has a habit of building up successful brands only to knock ' em down again in remarkably short order . Anyone remember Friends Reunited ? <h> 6 . Know that the only certainty is uncertainty <p> The pace of change in digital publishing is mind-boggling . Online specialists have to adapt continuously to new working practices , ensuring we meet new demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies such as Accelerated Mobile Pages ( AMP ) and the rise of ad blockers . By the time you read this , there will doubtless be even more developments rewriting the rulebook all over again . <p> Let 's drill into one example in more detail . The battle to be at the top of search engine results pages means that digital publishers worship at the altar of Google more than any other service . Around 80 per cent of our traffic arrives at our sites from the search giant and we spend an inordinate amount of time to ensure our stories rank higher on Google than rivals ' pages . <p> But search engine optimisation ( SEO ) moves at a frightening pace . Best practice evolves weekly and our editorial teams have to adapt constantly to remain relevant . Back in 2014 , we realised that we could play Google 's results by ensuring writers built Google+ profiles with a picture byline . Result ? Any search results page plugged our story with a photograph of the journalist , lending extra authority , stand-out attention and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once everyone cottoned on to this , Google unsurprisingly stopped placing author bylines on its results pages . A cynic might suggest it had encouraged hordes of reporters to sign up for profiles on its struggling social network , Google+ . But it was certainly another example of how the competitive landscape is forever changing . There are myriad other tricks we now pursue instead , such as researching keywords with sophisticated tools , improving our domain authority and honing every article 's metadescriptions to ensure our content wins the all-important click from Google. <h> 7 . Be prepared to fail <p> You have to be prepared to push the boundaries in this brave new world of digital publishing " and that can mean occasionally getting things wrong . Contrary to recognised publishing best practice , we are trying to accept that this is fine . The digital mindset should embrace failure as a route to improvement . <p> It 's all to do with risk and reward , and making the most of our agility as digital-first operators . We can conceive ideas , implement , publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data points to guide us whether the development has worked or not . We A/B test often , by concurrently publishing two variants of the same feature to see which one responds best , meaning we can test in real-time different headlines , or colours of tint boxes or navigational signposting around the website . Beta testing is a great way of making informed business decisions . <p> The important thing is to recognise when failure has occurred , learn from it and remember this when you are planning your next development . In the fast-moving world of web publishing it 's all about new ideas . Come up with 20 , launch the best 10 and maybe half will work . One might even be a game-changer . But unless you try all of them , and see some flop , you 'll never know . <p> So be prepared to fail . Just make sure you do it quickly , and smartly , using all the tools at your disposal . You 'll emerge stronger , and wiser , if you do . <h> 8 . Focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you retain focus in a world in which you are continually expected to launch new ideas , develop your website and publish a steady flow of compelling written , video and audio content " as well as produce a printed magazine or newspaper , curate all your brand 's social media channels and maybe even build a few apps and iPad tablet editions for good measure ? No wonder journalists have little time to frequent the pub nowadays . <p> It 's hard to keep all those plates spinning at the desired quality levels in a typically busy modern newsroom . But having the team resolutely focused on the overarching mission statement " it 's back to point one above again " is crucial for the best chance of success . <p> Bauer Media came up with a simple way of ensuring there is 100 per cent focus on its digital objectives : it hived off the web publishing team into a new division , named Bauer Xcel . This means that the editorial staff running the websites do not report into the magazine editors , but into a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has accelerated the pace of change in our websites . And it means that online is not held back by any lingering print-first mentality . <h> 9 . Employ the smartest journalists <p> For all the strategic thinking and digital black arts we have discussed , there is one exciting truth at the heart of modern web publishing : brilliant journalism still sells . <p> The best stories and scoops will generate more clicks than any Facebook quiz or Google page-rank . I am always heartened to see a genuine scoop fly to the top of the analytics feed , proof that good , old-fashioned journalistic graft and storytelling is at the heart of what we do . <p> So invest in your journalism . Online publishing should not be about churnalism " unique content , brilliantly researched and written is the best single marketing tool any website can have . I firmly believe there will continue to be a demand for fabulous editorial that speaks to real readers ' needs , whether it 's in print , on a laptop screen or a smartphone . It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at its most exciting when it mixes old-school journalistic insight with the new-tech tools which tell us how people research their next car purchase , what they are searching for and the exact phrase they put into Google . Marrying up the two skillsets , ancient and modern , that 's where the magic lies . <p> Tim Pollard is the digital editor-in-chief of Bauer Media 's motoring titles , leading the 14-strong web team on Carmagazine.co.uk and Parkers.co.uk , the publisher 's flagship automotive titles .

This includes design points such as using the right contrast for legibility but also sub 's additions of image alt text on pictures that will be read out the visually impaired or dyslexic , for example .

Newsrooms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as including running accounts of some stories , so the many layers of checking that existed previously are being stripped away . Verification is not always possible , especially for breaking news , so attribute where possible for transparency . Readers can then weigh up the value of the information without the story being delayed . Not sure how this works for images . Creative Commons licences are increasingly common , though . <p> Audience Online metrics and social networking services such as Twitter now make it even easier to research and define your audience . Build up an audience profile for your site and those of your competitors , it will help you to serve your audience better . Also , be prepared to engage and communicate with your users , journalism should not be one way traffic . Listening to what your users will have to say will help you to build a community around your content . <h> B <h> C <p> Checks Here 's an online starter kit for subs needing to check spellings , facts and stats , and includes links to online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy that links to another , related piece of copy . Also , copy that has been broken up into shorter pieces , for example , under a series of subheads . Useful for breaking up and re-purposing print copy . <p> Comment At the end of any article , the reader should be left with the option of taking some form of action , whether it be leaving their opinion in a comments box , responding to a poll or following a link for further information . <p> Content Differentiate between print and online by offering content that will not be available in print media . Encourage participation by offering readers the chance to provide feedback . <p> Content Management System ( CMS ) The platform used to upload and lay out content for a website .

But you can also use the wisdom of crowds in checking - useful when it is not easy to track down a name . Try Googling different spelling options and the numbers will often tell you which is correct , for example 22 million for McDonald 's , 2 million for MacDonald 's . Use with care . Also , if you have a social network built up on the likes of Twitter or Rypple , you can throw out the occasional crowdsourcing request for help with a headline , ideas for approaching content or posting a link and asking for feedback . Further reading : A journalist 's guide to crowdsourcing . <h> D <p> Dates Content is archived on the internet so think of content as being always available rather than something that will be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date their stories and any corrections . But for feature content , it may be better to avoid relative dates in copy . Ask : will this content still work in six month 's time ? <h> E <h> F <h> G <p> Global Readers can arrive from anywhere not just the UK . Watch for idioms , UK slang and think about including international alternatives when uploading more universal content . For example , sub-editors are known as copy editors in the US , laptops may be called notebooks , and let 's not get started on mobile phones . <p> Google Trends A useful tool for checking the popularity of your keywords . <h> H <p> Headlines Online headlines and page titles inform search engines , which then reward you with search traffic . Search engine bots do not rank for wit and wordplay so , until then , the SEO style is to be straightforward , factual and short . Include keywords , specific names or product models , full names , and concrete wording rather than abstract wordplay , then repeat them in the copy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes RSS feeds , especially on mobile web devices , easier to read . Some sites include a more ' human ' headline on opening pages then an SEO headline deeper in . For more on online headlines : <p> Notice the search-friendly keywords of ' how to ' , ' headlines ' and a superlative selling ' em in the first two links but the more human title of the NY Times story . The first three promise a tutorial , the last one an analysis - so you know what you are going to get just from the header . <p> House style Consistency and clarity is no less important online than in print , and editorial standards should be just as high . Familiarise yourself with your organisation 's style guide and make sure it is applied . There are certain practices which apply only online , such as when and how you use outbound links and whether these links open in a new window or the same window . Make sure to know these rules off by heart and be as consistent in applying them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language ( HTML ) The programming code at the heart of most website pages . As a sub using a CMS platform , you probably wo n't need to know much about it . Most likely to be encountered when forced to create links manually . <h> I <h> J <h> K <p> Keywords Simply the words that people would search for when looking for your content . Find out which are the most popular by inputting several options into Google Trends . The breakdown shows you which terms people are searching for , and where the terms are popular . Try inputting ' lose weight ' and ' diet ' - and you will see quite a difference . Get them into headlines and page titles to boost your search engine ranking and to make your content more visible online . Search superlatives , such as best , funniest , greatest , latest , etc , are popular search keywords . As is ' review ' for when people want product information . Also , do n't just think keywords but key phrases too , as described in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repeat specific names or products in full rather than referring to ' it ' or ' the generic noun ' . <h> L <p> Links Linking out is sometimes frowned upon as sending traffic away but statistics suggest that there is a strong relationship between external links and receiving a boost to your incoming links . Publish only internal links and risk readers seeing your site as a dead end . Read some more thoughts on linking out . Be consistent in your linking policy and be sure to check where your outbound links go . Even if web pages that you link to look fine , the site they are part of may contain inappropriate or libellous material which could offend your audience or be illegal . <h> M <h> N <p> Navigation Check that the reader 's journey through the content makes sense - sometimes sites are designed without much thought for the content . Check the links work . And that slow downloads are n't frustrating the reader . <h> O <h> P <p> Page titles Check the page title or URL is optimised for search engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site manager to adapt your CMS for this , advises Patrick Beeson . <p> Plagiarism Is on the increase thanks to the copy and paste button and the ease of finding information online . Lazywebs ! If you suspect a writer has plagiarised copy , just post a suspect line into Google - and all will be revealed . <h> Q <h> R <p> Repurposing Unless online content is commissioned specifically , repurposing copy used in print is a common task , especially as print deadlines occur much earlier . The good news is the copy will probably have been checked . The bad news is it wo n't be web-friendly and will need styling for keywords and SEO , scan-reading and chunking , and possibly pointing out to the commissioning editor that it does n't work and needs additional content . As of January 2009 , this probably applies more to magazine or client subbing than news , which is increasingly being filed direct to web . <p> Rhymezone This site is great for rhymes , synonyms , similar sounding words , consonant matching words and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEO or search engine optimisation Writing copy that is easily found and indexed by search engines boosts content higher up the search engine pages . Keywords help with this . Sites that are built in HTML are also more SEO-friendly and accessible than Flash sites , which turn copy into images that search engine bots can not read . But the Google algorithm , for example , also ranks content according to other factors ; for example , it ranks sites with a large number of incoming links more highly , and also increasingly sites that link out . SEO is not an exact science and shifts as the search engine algorithms shift . <p> Spamglish Reuse of the same keyword in the hope of raising the Google ranking of a website page . This practice is not effective and considered to be bad web etiquette . <h> T <p> Tags Most CMS platforms provide an option to add tags to any story published on the system . Tags can aid users in browsing through your content by using words that link to an index of stories associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as part of a site 's internal reference system . Useful , if you have a large content archive that reader 's might otherwise have to spend a lot of time searching for related or relevant information . <p> Technorati A blog indexing and search service . Useful for searching the blogosphere for interesting links . Can set up watch lists for your content area . <p> Threads A ' thread ' is the specific conversation that follows from an initial topic , question or discussion starter being posted on a discussion board or other online multi-user forum . In most websites , a thread is displayed as a series of replies to the original posting , although more technologically sophisticated discussion platforms and content management systems like Drupal ( and blog commenting systems like Disqus and coComment ) also allow specific **26;28;TOOLONG , which gives the discussion a more understandable human shape in the online setting . In a thread with many contributors , it 's an improvement to be able to reply to subsequent contributors , rather then just the original post . <p> Tone The web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to escape print styles when first moving over to online feature content . Sentences are shorter , paragraphs too . The second person narrative is common , addressing readers directly . Think about rewriting for tone when repurposing content for web . Further reading : Re-styling print copy into web conversation . <p> Wikipedia A free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . A useful first port of call for information but the editable nature of a wiki means that its pages are open to spammers and vandals . Check back to the source - there is usually a reference section at the bottom of the page that will lead to more trustworthy sites for verifying . That said , some outlets are attributing quoted sources to Wikipedia so readers can understand where the informations has come from . Paul Bradshaw of the Online Journalism Blog suggests Googling ' mistake + name of person ' as a sub 's check . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847231 @2047231/ <p> The Marshall Project , a non-profit news organisation that covers the criminal justice system in the United States , has developed a free and open-source tool that allows reporters and editors to track websites of interest and receive notifications via Slack or email when newsworthy changes happen . <p> The news organisation has been using the tool , called Klaxon , internally for more than two years , and the latest public version was made available last month , after The Marshall Project had already received some feedback from early adopters . <p> The installation instructions are available on GitHub and Klaxon is hosted on a platform called Heroku , although it can also be set up on a different server according to each newsroom 's preferences . <p> Once installed , Klaxon will show up as a bookmarklet in the web browser 's bookmarks bar . When a reporter is accessing a website they would like to monitor , all they have to do is click the Klaxon icon , hover over the section of the website they want to track and click to select it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Klaxon dashboard , and the tool goes back and visits each one of them roughly every 10 minutes , explained Tom Meagher , deputy managing editor at The Marshall Project . <p> Image courtesy of Tom Meagher <p> " We realised there 's a lot of noise happening and websites change all the time , especially on government websites . But you do n't necessarily care about 90 per cent of a government website , so we wanted to be able to track just this particular data set or this one column of information . " <p> When the tool notices any changes on a website , it sends an alert to the reporter who set it up via email or Slack " other people in the newsroom can also subscribe to receive the same alerts . <p> The alerts contain a link to the update in Klaxon as well as a visual representation of what has changed , with snapshots of the website or page outlining in red the information that has been removed and in green the new data that has been added . <p> Image courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a variety of data-driven reporting , for example to track data about a programme from the US Department of Defense that shares military service equipment with police departments , or to watch some of the executive orders put out by President Trump in his first weeks in office . <p> " We noticed that occasionally they were going back and rewording things , massaging slight misinformation . And that did n't lead to a story but we put it on social media and shared it with our network and our readers to tell them we are paying attention to this , " Meagher said . <p> " Ultimately what we 're doing is monitoring public websites , so you 're not necessarily going to find an investigative bombshell , but we found it 's really useful for getting quick tips , as well as monitoring multiple websites at once . <p> " You could put 50 different websites on a particular beat on it and everything comes to you , and particularly in a small newsroom where reporters are trying to cover a lot of ground , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go every day and check yourself if something has changed . " <p> The Marshall Project started building Klaxon in 2014 , shortly after the organisation launched , when the team was looking to develop a calendar or interactive graphic to help visualise executions in the US . <p> They came across the Death Penalty Information Center , a non-profit group based in Washington that focuses on studies and reports related to the death penalty . While their database seemed like a suitable data source for the project , reporters also needed to find out quickly when the website was updated and what had changed . <p> Meagher originally thought of creating a custom scraper to track changes , but since this issue could arise again in the future , he worked with the organisation 's director of technology to build a tool to track website updates . <p> The initial version ended up being used to monitor " dozens of websites of government agencies in a bunch of different states " , but even though it was a good proof of concept , it was too complicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . <p> A new version was developed a few months later , with an interface that allowed individual reporters to add the websites they wanted to track . It was used for over a year in the newsroom , including to develop the project ' The next to die ' , which monitors executions to help provide more comprehensive coverage of capital punishment in the US . <p> " We realised it could be really useful for other newsrooms and , as a non-profit , we wanted to be able to share our knowledge and to share tools we thought would make this investigative reporting job easier for other journalists . " <p> Klaxon was rebuilt from scratch last spring during an OpenNews code convening . In autumn 2016 , The Marshall Project made a beta version available to newsroom developers . <p> Since then , journalists from The New York Times , The Texas Tribune and The Washington Post as well as reporters in Europe and Australia have used Klaxon and contributed to the code on GitHub , which " has been useful to get it robust enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " One thing we 'd like to think more about is how it works in larger news organisations , because we designed for a smaller team like ours , so we need to think about the user interface and how people interact with the tool if there are dozens using it . <p> " We 're excited about the possibility of other journalists contributing to the project so if people are interested in using it , we 'd love to hear from them .

While many media reports have cited this generation as lazy , self-entitled and lacking a strong work ethic , Glasgow-based Lammas Incrementum believes that attracting a millennial workforce is , in fact , crucial to building a bright business future . <p> Working predominantly with millennials themselves , the firm is adamant that workers in this age bracket bring with them highly desirable skills and a more positive and open mindset .

Stop being condescending <p> As previously mentioned , millennials have got a bad reputation for being work shy . However , it was recently reported that millennials work on average 45 hours a week .

Involve everyone <p> Millennials do n't want to be treated as a number , and when working for a business , they want to participate in as many processes as possible and break down the corporate hierarchy . Working with millennials has taught us that hierarchy causes tension , and everyone deserves the chance to prove themselves no matter how long they 've been with the company .

A number of other outlets , academic institutions and civil-rights groups have also come on board . <p> Throughout the year , these organisations will be collating , verifying and presenting data from social media and existing databases .

" <p> Klein explained some civil-rights groups , such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and The Anti-Defamation League ( both partners on Documenting Hate ) had collected some anecdotal evidence that suggested these incidents were happening more often , but there was " no data locked up by state and city in a law enforcement database , if even there " . <p> " There have been some really terrific local efforts to take a picture of this , but we felt in order for us as a nation to tackle this question and ask good questions about bias incidents and hate crimes , we needed a lot more data to support any kind of good decision-making , so that is what we set out to do . " <p> Journalism students will help authenticate people 's contributions on the website and those coming in through social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately empowering local reporters to use the database to cover hate crimes in their communities . <p> Reporters can express their interest by filling out a form on the website , and as soon as enough data becomes available , they will receive access to the database , as well as reporting materials and invitations to regular calls with the other partners . <p> " If we can provide local reporters with a little bit of data , three or four really good examples , stories of witnesses and victims they have n't heard before , they can do an impactful and powerful story about hate crimes and bias incidents in any city in the country , that are far more powerful than any national news organisation of any size ever could . <p> " We 've got expertise in data journalism , social media newsgathering and large collaborations ( ... ) and if we can create datasets that help generate the kind of journalism that has an impact , that is very much a fulfilment of our mission .

@@97847253 @2047253/ <h> How to : create data visualisations using Tableau 's Story Points <p> Data visualisations are a compelling way to present data-driven stories , but often they only show ' what ' is happening in a story , rather than ' why ' it is happening . <p> Tableau 's Story Points launched last year , allowing users to create a narrative or to offer analysis as they walk readers through sequential presentations from a specific dataset . <p> Story Points has been used by outlets such as CNBC in this interactive data timeline of the companies that have entered and left the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past 87 years . <p> The following guide was put together using Tableau Public 8.3 for Mac following instruction from Sophie Sparkes , data analyst at Tableau . <p> 1 . To create a story , download Tableau Public and create an account , if you have n't already . The software is free and the download should not take longer than a couple of minutes . While it 's downloading , you could check out Tableau 's Viz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only connect to text files such as Microsoft Excel , Microsoft Access or CSV files . The limit for a single text file is 1,000,000 rows of data . <p> Your data source should be laid out in the standard format where each row is a data point and each column is a description of that data point . If necessary , you can clean up your dataset in Tableau or in Excel " here 's a post from Paul Bradshaw 's Online Journalism Blog on how to clean data using Google Refine . <p> 3 . Launch Tableau Public and load your data by dragging and dropping the file over the orange ' open data ' button . The larger your dataset , the longer it will take to load . Once the file has loaded , Tableau will automatically open a new workbook . <p> If you 're using an Excel spreadsheet which has multiple worksheets , they will appear as a list in your workbook . CSV files are obviously just one sheet . Add the data sheets you want to work on by dragging and dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your data sheets . As you do this you 'll see a preview of your sheets , which is useful to check if everything appears as you would expect . <p> At this point you can also do a basic clean of your data in the preview area by clicking the dropdown arrow that appears when you hover over a column , and choosing to either hide or rename that column . <p> When you are ready , click the orange ' go to worksheet ' button . <p> Adding data sheets to the workbook ( screenshot from Tableau Public ) <p> 4 . Tableau automatically creates categories from your data , so anything with a little blue ' ABC ' symbol next to it has been recognised as a text string , while the green hashtags are used for numerical data , a globe would denote a geographic location and a calendar symbol is used for dates . <p> If Tableau has categorised something incorrectly , you can change it by control-clicking on the symbol next to the data point and selecting either ' change data type ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points into ' dimensions ' and ' measures ' . A dimension is a discreet data point " things like text fields , dates and countries " while measures are continuous and numeric , so in this case , Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , birth rate , population ages etc . Tableau also generates a couple of things automatically , such as the latitude and longitude of any geographical locations . <p> 5 . Now we need to create the worksheets that will make up our Story . For demonstration purposes I 'm going to create three worksheets but you can create as many as you like . I 'm going to whizz through the steps to create a Tableau visualisation fairly quickly , but if you 'd like more details on how to do this there are training tutorials on the Tableau website . <p> Select a data point , for example , country name . The ' show me ' toolbar to the right of your screen will then highlight the types of visualisations you can do with that data point , such as create maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To add more information when you hover over the datapoints on your visualisation , you can add a ' tooltip ' . To do that , drag a datapoint onto the ' tooltip ' button in the ' marks ' section . You can also use these markers to determine the colours , labels and , in my example , the size of the bubbles that appear as markers on my map . <p> For my first datasheet showing the number of mobile phone subscribers by country I chose the ' packed bubbles ' visualisation , where the size of the bubbles is determined by the number of subscribers . To do this , I dragged that datapoint over the ' size ' button in the ' marks ' menu , then dragged ' country name ' over colour to distinguish the bubbles and create a visually engaging effect . <p> I added further detail by dragging both ' country name ' and ' number of mobile phone subscribers ' over the ' label ' button , and added information about total population and urban population to the tooltip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Data visualisation in progress in the worksheet ( screenshot from Tableau Public ) <p> 7 . You may have some points in your dataset which are null values and classified as ' unknown ' . This means there is something in there that Tableau does n't understand . In this case you can have a look to see if it is something obvious , like a misspelling , that 's causing the problem , or something else . There are a couple of different ways to handle null values , outlined in this article here . <p> You can create more visualisations by adding more sheets to your dashboard . Just click the icon with the tiny plus sign and bar chart next to ' sheet one ' towards the bottom of your screen . <p> 8 . When you 're happy with your visualisations , go to ' story ' in the top navigation bar , and select ' new story ' . Then drag the sheet you want to appear as your first story point onto the canvas . <p> Give your story a title and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . You can also add more context to your visualisation by dragging the ' description ' box from the left sidebar onto your canvas . The description box accepts text formatting and hyperlinks . <p> The default size for Story Points is 1016 x 965 pixels , although if you wish you can adjust the size of your canvas using the dimensions toolbox at the bottom of the left sidebar . <p> Story Points allows you to save different stages of your visualisation , in case you want to refer back to them later , simply by clicking the orange ' update ' text above the canvas . <p> Adjusting the dimensions of a visualisation in Story Points ( screenshot from Tableau Public ) <p> You can add another sheet to your story by clicking the ' new blank point ' button above the canvas , or click ' duplicate ' to copy the story point you already have . <p> Continue adding points to your story until you have added all the worksheets you want to use . <p> 9 . Once you 're ready to save your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to web as ' in the top navigation bar . Your Story Points will then be published to the Tableau Public site . With Tableau Public , users can only save their work publicly online " it is not possible to save it privately or download it to your computer ( to do that , you need Tableau Desktop , which is a paid-for service ) . <p> Bear in mind too that anything saved to Tableau Public is accessible to everyone " other users can not only view your visualisations and Story Points but also download a copy of your workbook and underlying data . Although this makes Tableau Public great for collaboration , as other users can work with your data to extend your original visualisations , it is important not to use Tableau Public for working with data which may be sensitive or should otherwise be kept private . <p> 10 .

The features editor responded , saying she liked the idea and would put it forward at the next features meeting . <p> Then nothing . <p> Expecting a commission , I waited to hear back , but did n't . I sent an email chasing it up , but no reply . Breaking one of my golden rules , I sent another , only to pick up the mag in question and see my feature in all its glory crowned with someone else 's byline . <p> It annoyed me so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which made me feel better , but probably ensured I would never write for them again . <p> Still smarting , I talked to the National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) and other intellectual property experts to see what rights I had , if any , to find out how common idea-stealing was and what freelancers could do to avoid it . <p> John Toner , the union 's freelance organiser , reports that it happens with annoying regularity : " My sympathies are with freelancers who are ripped off and get nothing for it . Some writers get understandably angry about having their ideas pinched . Others just acknowledge it 's part of freelance life , put it behind them and move on to the next pitch . " <p> So is there anything we can do to keep those precious ideas from being taken and given to another writer ? <p> " You could pitch the idea without giving away specifics , " says Toner . <p> " If you can keep back details like who you would interview until they 've agreed to commission you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea stolen . <p> " Some freelances will only pitch if the other party agrees to commission under strict commercial confidence . But that 's usually only writers with a track record of coming up with exclusives " the kind of stories commissioning editors would do anything to get . " <p> Given that most freelancers are n't pitching bite-your-hand-off exclusives , what legal protection do more mainstream ideas have ? <p> In order to understand that , you have to know a little about intellectual property . This is broken down into separate categories : patents apply to the scientific or mechanical workings of an invention ; while trademarks apply to logos and brands , like the Coca Cola or McDonald 's logo . <p> As creatives , what we 're interested in is copyright , which applies to any written medium , including dramatic works , broadcasts or musical recordings and literary works , like novels , newspaper articles , song lyrics " even computer programs and instruction manuals . <p> " Unfortunately , copyright does n't protect ideas for a piece of work , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the UK government body responsible for granting intellectual property rights . <p> " It 's only when the work is in writing that copyright automatically protects it . " <p> Thomson echoes Toner 's suggestion about requesting a confidentiality agreement : " If you pitch an idea to a paper , it might be worth protecting your intellectual property with a confidential disclosure agreement , which you can download from our site . " <p> If you do think your copyright has been infringed , the IPO is a good place to start , as it offers a mediation service between you and the publisher and can direct you to the appropriate body if you need to take further action . <p> This may be a legal advisor or specific organisations representing different types of artist , like the Writers ' Guild , which looks after writers in TV , radio , theatre , books , poetry , film and video games ; or the Authors ' Licensing and Collecting Society , which ensures that authors are compensated for works that are copied , broadcast or recorded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate for us creative types . Although she believes we should protect our copyright by whatever means necessary , she also advises caution . <p> " With creative people , because their ideas represent that creativity , they can get very emotional if they feel those ideas are taken away . But it 's good to get someone independent to say whether anything awry has occurred or you may lose potential clients , " she says . <p> " You need to make an astute business decision about the value of pursuing something and what you 'll get in return . " <p> Cumber points out that , in addition to the risk of biting the hand that feeds us , just two lawyers ' letters can cost more than the fee we 'd get for the piece . <p> One final " and somewhat surprising " comment from Toner : though he is a staunch defender of freelance rights , he thinks it crucial that finished work should be copyrighted , but ideas not . <p> " There is actually a very good reason for ideas not being protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prevent two people writing or broadcasting about the same subject . For example , if you wanted to write about Paul Gascoigne 's former England footballer alcohol problems , you could write a piece with a totally different focus than the recent Channel 4 documentary . <p> " It 's essential for journalism that ideas can not be protected , but equally essential that the finished piece can . " <p> Somewhat grudgingly , I have to agree , though I 'm still fuming about my idea being ' borrowed ' . <p> Never fear " next time I pitch something juicy there will be a confidentiality agreement attached . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847258 @2047258/ <h> How to : have a digital ' edge ' as a new journalist <p> When it comes to getting your first job in journalism , there are a number of qualities all potential employers will be looking for . <p> You need to be able to write with accuracy and clarity , for example , and at times at speed ( without " importantly " losing either of the first two staples of good reporting ) . It is also generally important to be well-versed in media law . Shorthand ? Well , we will come to that later . <p> But assuming you possess all the important underlying abilities , having some digital sensibilities on top could help to set you out from the crowd , and where you are applying for an online or otherwise-digital position in particular , having key digital skills and tools under your belt could be vital . <p> For a podcast on this subject last month I spoke to Alison Gow , editor of the digital content innovation team at Trinity Mirror Regionals ; Cate Sevilla , homepage editor for BuzzFeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology at Incisive Media ; Anna Doble , head of online at Channel 4 News and Jon di Paolo , executive producer of SkyNews.com . <p> Their comments covered skills within the following areas : social media , multimedia , newsgathering and fact-checking , digital innovation , interactivity and specialisms . They also shared some advice on qualifications and other non-digital skills which can help to put your application in strong standing . <p> Social media <p> Being on social media is not just a chance to show you are up to speed with the different networks being used today , but it is important to use these platforms to engage with others , particularly around your subjects of interest . <p> So make sure your accounts reflect your stated interests . And if you are going for a social media-focused role , make sure your social media activities demonstrate your ability to communicate well with others and share interesting content effectively . <p> If somebody comes along to us and says I 'm really switched on , I 've got the potential to be a great journalist and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , no followers , nothing , it is highly suspiciousJohn Barnes , Incisive Media <p> " You might have a Twitter account and a Facebook account , but you actually need to use them because you need to have that deep level of understanding , " Alison Gow explained . <p> " If somebody comes along to us and says I 'm really switched on , I 've got the potential to be a great journalist and they do n't have any form of social media interaction at all , no followers , nothing , it is highly suspicious , " John Barnes added . <p> " Simple things like do they have a picture on their account ? Do they actually describe what they 're doing ? Do they have a consistent level of tweeting or commenting ? Is it in and around a subject that they 're developing an interest in or an expertise on ? We will look at those things to get a more general picture of what a person is like . <p> " Obviously , in my day , it was ' had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now blogs are slightly like that . But any experience that has been gained along the way , whether it 's more formal experience through publications at college , whether it 's work experience through courses that have taken place at college or holiday jobs , or whether it is actually just things like a really keen interest in a subject and therefore the go-getting nature of writing a blog or having a good social media profile , they 're all things that definitely help . " <p> And if you aspire to write for viral content sites such as BuzzFeed , being social media-savvy is obviously vital . <p> " If you 're applying for a community management role and your Twitter feed is only updated once a week or has been left to rot , that 's a bad sign " , Cate Sevilla said . <p> " So having all of the usual profiles you expect people to have , having a blog where you talk about this stuff you claim to be interested in or be a specialist in , is really important . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you want a job , when we look at what you 've done in the past we should be able to find you on the internet and find that you are talking about the stuff you claim to want a job in . " <p> Given the rise , and continuing growth , of social media as a traffic referral for many news sites today , being able to share content effectively is also a valuable skill to be able to demonstrate . And again , your potential employer may look to your existing online activity to see how well you are already doing this , Sevilla said . <p> For sites like BuzzFeed , which also include platforms where anyone can submit articles , such as BuzzFeed Community , they are also impressed to see you have already been getting yourself published on their own site . <p> " That 's the best way for us to see if people get it and can create BuzzFeed-style content that we enjoy , " she added . " We 've actually published some of it to our homepage because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic video , image and audio skills in capturing , editing and publishing are all useful additions to your toolbox . Late last month we published some best practice tips on mobile multimedia creation from documentary maker and photographer Christian Payne , @Documentally , and Sevilla added that Photoshop skills in particular are important for those coming to work at BuzzFeed . <p> Meanwhile Alison Gow said being able to exercise some multimedia talent would impress her as an editor . <p> It 's lovely when somebody comes in for an interview and they 've brought along a tablet or something they can show me some multimedia they 've doneAlison Gow , Trinity Mirror Regionals <p> " It 's lovely when somebody comes in for an interview and they 've brought along a tablet or something they can show me some multimedia they 've done , " she said , " for example , video around a story or a podcast they 've made " . <p> " I really think people who do that show that they have thought more deeply about what the journalist 's role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't want to detract from text ; 350 words of news story is sometimes all that a news story needs to be . But to have that added ability to do video - and I 'm not talking about Spielberg level video here - but just to have thought to take a video , and add to the way that that story is told and to embed it in that article , says to me that 's somebody who really has a skill that you 'd want to bring into your newsroom . " <p> If you are hoping to work at a broadcaster one day , video skills are of course incredibly important , and when also working online there are a number of different platforms at your disposal to share video in different ways , from a 6-second Vine , to a longer YouTube clip . <p> And being someone who is able to use their smartphone to gather video on the go , as well as fulfil their other responsibilities , is something that will serve journalists well , as Doble highlights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can have Instagrammed a great shot and sent it to my newsdesk , I can have done a quick interview and done something fun with Vine , all in the space of about 20 minutes , and then get back to digging for the news itselfAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " If I set myself up well on a smartphone , I can have Instagrammed a great shot and sent it to my newsdesk , I can have done a quick interview and done something fun with Vine , all in the space of about 20 minutes , and then get back to digging for the news itself . <p> " It 's a balance . We do n't want to waste producers ' time messing about with Instagram when they could be getting a killer line from an interviewee . I think it 's understanding that if you set yourself up and you understand the tools , you can use them really swiftly and then crack on . So you can have that digital presence while keeping to your journalistic roots . " <p> Fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also referred to the value of having a " visual awareness " as a journalist , adding that so long as this is in addition to " the core " journalistic skills of having a good understanding of what makes a news story , and the ability to write well , " that is going to give you a big advantage somewhere like this " . Newsgathering and fact-checking <p> One skill highlighted by Anna Doble as being particularly valuable , was having the initiative to be proactive in how social media is used to gather original news stories , rather than solely responding to what is being said on the platform . <p> For example , she explained , a journalist could make a Twitter list of local politicians from a specific party and put a question to them relating to a hot topic of the moment . <p> Within a relatively short space of time , purely by looking on social media from your desk , you could have a storyAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " Within a relatively short space of time , purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have a story , " she said . <p> " Using the power of the crowd to actually create a line , create a statistic , it might not be utterly scientific , but rather than just going ' something 's happened , someone 's said this ' , I think it 's turning it round , it 's inverting the root to the story and using it as a starting point . " <p> New journalists should expect to be asked in interview how they would find a story , Alison Gow added , and including both digital and non-digital techniques would show a diverse skillset . " Somebody who would include in that conversation , ' well I would have made a Twitter list from local councillors and I 'd be tweeting that I was new to the area and hashtagging it with #Liverpool and I would have already joined the Flickr group for the Liverpool city area , so I was talking to people on there ' " that says to me that is somebody who has really thought beyond ' I would go and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because all these people are on social now . <p> " You can make the lists , you can use Tweetdesk columns , so you can actually have those story sources coming in . Similarly , someone who had put in some FOI requests before they came , so as they were starting those FOIs were coming to fruition " fair play , that would be a good thing as far as I was concerned . " <p> Increasingly , in a world where people do n't answer telephones , double checking facts is very much onlineJohn Barnes , Incisive Media <p> As well as social media , journalists should also know how to use other online tools and platforms to contact and check facts with people , particularly if more traditional methods are not proving effective , as John Barnes explains . <p> " Increasingly , in a world where people do n't answer telephones , double checking facts is very much online , " he said . " So whether that 's using online resources , other websites , whether it 's using LinkedIn primarily as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tools like Skype . <p> " It does n't really much matter but the fact that people are able to use a range of tools to double check those facts , to make sure we 've actually got correct information , that we 're not misrepresenting anybody and we 're actually producing accurate , reliable high quality journalism , that 's very important . " Digital innovation <p> On a simple level , understanding " how to write for the web " is vital when going for a digital reporting role , Sevilla said . <p> And while potential employers are not going to expect all journalists in their first job to be digital innovation thought-leaders , they will certainly be impressed by those who can also think creatively about new storytelling formats , and the flexibility of digital platforms to deliver content in a variety of ways . <p> Doble said this is one of the key attributes she would look for in someone joining the newsroom " the ability to identify opportunities to do storytelling beyond standard structures . <p> It 's having the confidence to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ink , it 's not beamed out on a television set , it can be so many different thingsAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " It 's having the confidence to say online news can be anything , " she added . " It 's not printed in ink , it 's not beamed out on a television set , it can be so many different things . " <p> While having technical skills is a wonderful addition , it is " more important " to be able to demonstrate that " online journalism is a thing in its own right and not just a dumping ground for the newspaper , TV newsrooms of old " . <p> It is also important to have an understanding of the different ways to approach various digital reporting platforms , particularly in the social web , rather than trying to run with a one-size-fits-all model . <p> " We 're all guilty of just whacking out a link across social media , " Doble said , but added that " the key skill for somebody new now is to show they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own environment and distinguishing features , as well as the " user journey " and the impact that may have on the context experience expected on arrival . <p> " You 've got to think about where they 're coming from , what they are probably looking for when they arrive at your piece . And therefore one story could have 4 or 5 different looks to it , or different emphasis , depending on where you place it . " <p> The added strength of a specialism <p> Technical specialism <p> Having some form of specialism , such as an affinity for working with data , or even some coding skills , can give you that extra selling point to a potential employer , but the underlying reporting skills come first . Having a specialism is not necessary to secure a journalism job , but the point is that like many of the digital skills included in this article , they can help you stand out from the crowd . <p> For example , Alison Gow said just having spreadsheet skills and the ability to build visualisations gives applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " broad skills " of being a good journalist . <p> She also highlighted how specialisms can emerge once someone is working in a newsroom , pointing to former Wales Online journalist Claire Miller , who now works as part of the Data Journalism Unit at Trinity Mirror Regionals after her data skills got her noticed . <p> " She demonstrated absolute capability and expertise with data and as a result a job was created to make the most of her skills in that area , " Gow explained . <p> Such skills are certainly valued in digital newsrooms . Doble , for example , said " in a dream world I 'd absolutely have a specialist who 's purely looking at graphics and data all the time " . <p> Coding is also admired , but while some basic HTML will help you along as a new journalist , more advanced skills are certainly not expected in general . <p> " I do n't think new recruits should be panicking about learning to be code-heads , " Doble said , " because it 's a huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But a basic understanding and a confidence around interactive graphics and how to make basic things like Q&amp;As or polls , is a great skill , " she added , or at least , " knowing which tools to go to to make that kind of content " . <p> At Sky News , one recent recruit shone above the rest due to his abilities in data and coding , so having these skills is " a big string to your bow " , Jon di Paolo said , but stressed that this is only the case if the " core " abilities as a journalist are there . <p> " I do n't think you have to be familiar with coding and the back-end of things , but it does n't do you any harm , " he said . <p> " People like that are very few and far between because to be really good in all those disciplines takes a tremendous amount of work , and you have to be really disciplined to get to that point . " <p> But , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence together would n't get very far . " <p> On the subject of coding skills , Sevilla said that those looking to work in a start-up may find such skills are not required anyway because newer content-management systems will do " everything for you " . <p> At BuzzFeed for example , " we have developers already " , she said , " so if you are a journalist , you can just write rather than worrying about formatting your posts in a certain way " . <p> Barnes added that specialisms in " video , data journalism , audio " can be big positives in the eyes of employers , but for him the key is " being rounded and very practical " , along with a " keenness to learn " . <p> " Nobody 's going to be the finished article when they start , " he added . <p> Subject specialism <p> While for some people , their journalistic career lies in general news reporting , others may be interested in working towards a specialism , and becoming experienced in covering a particular subject or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new political reporter , and you claim to have a grasp on viral content , we 're going to want to see that when we look for you online and go through your Twitter feed and see the things you 've shared publicly on Facebook as wellCate Sevilla , BuzzFeed <p> And for those keen to zero in on a specific patch or niche , Sevilla highlights the importance of demonstrating that interest , and specialism , in your online personality . <p> " If you want a job being our new political reporter , and you claim to have a grasp on viral content , we 're going to want to see that when we look for you online and go through your Twitter feed and see the things you 've shared publicly on Facebook as well . " <p> Non-digital skills <p> While we have so far focused on the key digital skills that may help to give journalists that extra leg up as a journalism job applicant , there are obviously a number of other ' analogue ' skills , which are vital in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shorthand is a vital skill for any journalist planning on getting a job in the regionals , particularly " if you 're going for a traditional journalist job " . <p> The shorthand debate remains fiercely debated , but as Gow highlights , if you are likely to wind up doing court reporting , shorthand will be important . <p> " It is a discussion that 's being had more and more , " Gow added , " but if you have n't got your shorthand , a lot of newspapers will put your CV straight to the reject pile " . <p> She added that journalism-related qualifications that include key areas such as media law can also help get you onto the career ladder , even at a higher level than someone else . <p> " People who do the NCTJ , or people who do the BCTJ , or who do journalism degrees , come into newsrooms and they generally come in at a higher pay level , " she said . <p> Doble added that journalism qualifications help to provide " a very clear bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , understands the rules around journalism " . <p> " It 's more to just be able to tick that box and say this person 's clearly learnt the ropes and has proven themselves and presumably done some practical training that was part of their course as well . " <p> Once you are in the newsroom , being proactive , and brave enough to stand up and share your ideas or new approaches to something , is also something Doble admires . <p> It 's coming in with a fresh idea , a fresh way of working as well as the idea itself , and then just pushing and having the confidence to convince others it 's worth doingAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " To arrive in a newsroom like this with lots of big names , big reporters who 've done loads of amazing stuff ... it could be an intimidating environment , however it 's not , it 's a friendly environment and I think the great thing you can do as a young journalist is come in and go ' look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories to be had , give me a day , and I 'll build you an excellent story about something that 's never been covered before by this team or is not generally part of the political agenda ' . <p> " It 's coming in with a fresh idea , a fresh way of working as well as the idea itself , and then just pushing and having the confidence to convince others it 's worth doing . " <p> Before even starting a job , Gow also encouraged new journalists to think about how they present themselves in an interview . <p> " If somebody can engage me and chat to me and make me enjoy talking to them in interview , which is a horrible situation for anybody to be in , they 're going to do it out on the streets as well , " Gow said . <p> Part of your interview skill is about how you sell yourself as a candidate , and Barnes said harnessing your inner salesperson is key for journalists in their everyday work as well , not just in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to convince somebody that you 're the person to share the information with , to actually get the story out of them , that ability to engage with people , to be a good communicator , to be very fluent when you 're talking , that ability to talk naturally and get on with people and be convincing and true to yourself , that 's what we look for because that 's not something we can teach you . " <p> I 'm very much of the school of thought that says if somebody 's got very good , core skills , you can train them up on almost anythingJon di Paolo , Sky News <p> And of course , writing and communication skills in general are a must . <p> " Obviously you 've got to be able to read and write , spell , good punctuation , " Barnes listed , adding that other abilities in the field of subbing and gathering images for stories are also now often falling to the journalist , so being able to demonstrate skills in those areas can also stand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the " core basics " beat any digital expertise . Journalists must have " a good news nose " , he said , as well as " brilliant written English " . <p> " I 'm very much of the school of thought that says if somebody 's got very good , core skills , you can train them up on almost anything , but the peripheral stuff , their familiarity with interrogating Tweetdeck for example , they can pick up here .

@@97847263 @2047263/ <p> But the mobile journalism landscape has changed slightly since last year , not only due to the development of new apps ( and more Android apps ) , but also because of the advent of livestreaming within social networks . <p> Periscope and Facebook Live could become , for many journalists , the gateway to mobile journalism , as those who want to livestream to Facebook generally have to do so from within the app " although workarounds are available for professionals . <p> To help those who want to get started with mobile journalism and livestreaming , Journalism.co.uk has compiled a list of basic tips to help you start on the right foot and make the most of the camera you already have in your pocket . <h> Before you start <p> Mobile video expert and former BBC video journalist Mark Egan covered the basic checks you need to make before tapping ' record ' on your phone , speaking at a MoJoCon workshop in 2015 . <p> Start by putting your phone in airplane mode " this stops calls and app notifications coming through and interfering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Clean your lens . It 's not necessarily something smartphone users tend to do very often , but even a small speck of dust on your lens can compromise your shot . <p> Hold your phone horizontally so your phone 's home button is on the right hand-side . This prevents you from accidentally shooting upside down , which while a correctable error , it does mean you will have to spend additional time fixing it with editing software . And always film horizontally unless you 're using an app that makes it impossible to do so , or filming specifically for an app designed for vertical video such as Snapchat . <p> " Take a second each time to lock focus and exposure , " advised Egan , adding that shifting focus mid-shot " which your phone is likely to do automatically " means your shot will look " a bit unsettled " . <p> Finally , make sure your shot is stable . If there 's no tripod on hand , here 's a way to hold your phone that will help : <h> Before you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach a large number of people who would not otherwise interact with your news organisation . <p> Facebook offers prime real estate in the news feed for live video , prompting publishers to incorporate livestreaming into their social video strategy and encourage their reporters to do more and more lives . <p> But before you start livestreaming , there are certain considerations that journalists need to be aware of , especially in breaking news situations . As with any live video , once it 's out there you ca n't take it back , so journalists need to be prepared for every scenario that might happen in front of their lens . <p> If you 're recording in a loud environment and have no external microphone , reach for a pair of standard headphones " they usually come with a microphone that can make a huge difference . <p> And if you 're using an external microphone , plug it in before launching any apps to make sure it 's detected and used , said Egan . <h> Filming on location <p> He also advised mojo reporters to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only give you " a look that you ca n't often get with a big camera " , but will also result in better audio if using the phone 's internal microphone . <p> Film a variety of shots and different angles , advised O'Callaghan . <p> " You can also never have enough close-ups , " she said . " And you should film in sequences , which really help you to tell the story .

@@97847266 @2047266/ <h> Survey : Journalists can now have their say on access to UK Government data <p> The Government Statistical Service ( GSS ) opened a survey yesterday ( 10 January ) to find out how journalists and others are using the data released by different government departments online and how it could improve access to the data . <p> The survey is one of the first phases of an initiative to make government data more easily discoverable , John Lewis , user researcher on the project , told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " Most of that data is available on gov.uk or data.gov.uk " there 's then also additional information and data that each of the government departments publish maybe on their own websites or their own portal as well .

An article in the Independent in November claimed that : ' from cyberstalkers to identity thieves , all kinds of people can find out all about you , and potentially wreak havoc with the results . ' <p> While there are certainly valid concerns about privacy , and identity theft is a serious risk when companies and individuals are not careful with personal data , it is misleading to imply that simple searches can unearth sensitive data about anyone . <p> When journalists are trying to trace people they are usually looking for contacts , case studies or trying to get background on key people . Sometimes , we may be looking for someone behind a company or product who does n't want any publicity . A 15-minute Google session often gives us enough , but if your search strategy starts and ends with Google you 're missing out . <p> We all know about expert finders ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often these are n't focused enough and they do n't help if you 're target is n't a registered ' expert ' . There are a range of other ethically sound and legal tools you can use to trace people online and find out more about them . <p> Identifying key contacts <p> You 've done your background for a report . Your desk is littered with cuttings and you 've talked to the obvious people - but you do n't have enough . Where else can you turn ? <p> Search blogs : those who blog on your subject may be , or may lead to , key people or case studies . Search for blogs or in blog posts using directories such as Blogger.com , Feedster , Technorati and for a UK focus Britblog . <p> Once you 've found relevant blogs and other relevant sites use Google 's " info : " operator . Type " info : " before the main url ( for example : " info:journalism.co.uk " ) and you can access the sites that link to it . Use that tool and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites . <p> Are the organisations or the people behind the sites not obvious ? Find them using a domain search tool such as Domain Dossier . Because all sites have to be registered this tool may give you vital contact details ; but remember that web developers often register sites on behalf of clients.Search Usenet : simply put , Usenet is the system that allows online newsgroups to exist and these archives can be accessed via the web . You can search hundreds of millions of posts to Usenet using Google Groups , which is the global archive of Usenet dating back to 1981 . <p> Access Google Groups ; find a group using your search term , find relevant discussions and authors . Google Groups also allows you to view all posts by one particular author . You can also search Google Groups for specific names using the " author : " operator . <p> Find and search mailing lists or listservs : Mailing lists can be goldmines of information if you have the patience to search for the right ones and then search their archives properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible . Use directories of lists such as Topica , Cata-List and the UK-focused JISCmail . Identify relevant lists using these directories and check to find out if the archive is open . If it is , you 'll probably be able to search it . <p> Use Companies House : This site let 's you search for details on two million UK companies and buy their accounts and annual returns . You can use this site to access a database listing every disqualified company director in the UK and , for a tiny fee ; you can use this site to ' monitor ' specific companies . <p> Identifying key information <p> You may have a name , or an e-mail address , or just a phone number . How can you access more information about someone online ? <p> Use ' people finder ' sites . There are dozens of sites that make a range of claims about their ability to track down people and information about people . Some are extremely useful while others are clearly less reliable . Those with some of the best free services include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK 's electoral roll . This means that with just a name and part of a postcode you can obtain the full address , phone number and the names of other occupants . It also has one of the best map services I 've seen . Type in a street name or a postcode and you can zoom in to the exact location . The satellite images are so precise the current image of my house shows the boot of my car is open . This site also allows you to search for a business by type ( in a specified location ) or name . <p> Anywho.com - is AT&amp;T 's people finder and without doubt one of the best for US searches . Again , it let 's you search for people or businesses and can link those searches directly to maps . AnyWho also includes yellow and white page information for dozens of other countries . When you find the person you 're trying to trace you can pay for extra services including the names of relatives , roommates and neighbours . Searches for ' nearby businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A useful option available on several US sites , including AnyWho , is reverse phone searching . This allows you to trace a name or address using just a phone number . Reverse searching in the UK contravenes the Data Protection Act so be wary of wasting time with sites that claim to offer this service for UK numbers - some do , but confine their search to a narrow range of businesses such as theatres . Even so , if you type the number you have directly into a good search engine such as Google or AlltheWeb then you may get lucky if that number is included on web pages or online documents . <p> Teldir - is a collection of telephone directories from across the world and InfoSpace combines an international phone search service with maps ; reverse phone options and a tool that let 's you search for businesses to within one mile of an address . This site also includes an e-mail and reverse e-mail searching . There is no single registry of e-mail addresses so e-mail searching is not reliable but , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you a lot of grief . Another site that offers e-mail and reverse e-mail searching is Addresses.com . <p> Search the ' invisible web ' : Books are written about this research strategy , it can be tricky but there are simple tools you can use . Search engines ca n't access entries in most databases but you can find database homepages or search forms . A simple way to do this is add the word ' database ' or ' register ' to the search terms you are using . For example , adding ' register ' to the search term ' UK Doctors ' in Google returns the UK 's GMC website that includes the medical register database of doctors . <p> The best way to search for databases is through content directories such as the www.invisible-web.net ( which is being revamped ) , Searchsystems.net and Buscopio . <p> Other good sources of information about specific people include : <p> The Land Registry , where for a small fee you can download information about title plans , owners and the price of the property if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly detailed local information including statistics on services , healthcare , income crime and deprivation . You can search this using full postcodes and access data on a local ward level . Obviously , you ca n't access information about individuals but the information paints a remarkable picture about where they live or work . <p> UK Planning allows you to search current and decided planning applications for free . <p> Combining tools <p> Combine search tools for the best results . For example , if you 're looking for the people behind a specific company look on Companies House and search using their names using Google or people finders before you talk to them . You can unearth surprising connections between contacts . <p> Do n't spend too long using one tool . Use simple search terms in a couple of search engines before you embark on a convoluted search . Recently it took me about two hours to track down contact details for a case study in Bermuda . I later found a simple two-word search in AllTheWeb returned those details as the second hit . AllTheWeb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google . <p> Finally , part of the key to online searching is knowing when to stop and pick up the phone . Before you rely on online search results , be sure they are correct . Map services can identify the wrong house using postcodes for example . Online searching ca n't replace source building and fact checking . A well worded question to an inexperienced receptionist or a quick call trawl through your contacts book can save hours online.

@@97847268 @2047268/ <h> How to : create a Facebook page as a journalist <p> " Facebook is a rolodex of more than 750 million potential sources , " journalist programme manager at Facebook Vadim Lavrusik told Journalism.co.uk . <p> This guide explains why journalists should consider having a professional presence on Facebook by creating a fan page to connect with sources and readers , make contacts , build a brand as a journalist and promote articles . There are also examples of successful journalist fan pages and tips on using your page . <p> According to Lavrusik , a professor teaching social media at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and a journalist who has worked for Mashable and the New York Times , Facebook pages are used by journalists for " reporting , storytelling and engagement " . Reasons to create a Facebook page <p> 1 . To separate personal from professional <p> Creating a professional fan page allows journalists to keep a personal profile for friends and family . <p> " There can be an ethical challenge where a source wants to be friends with a journalist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can simply ' like ' can avoid journalists feeling either they must make friends with a source or to reject a friend request and therefore lose an opportunity to cement a relationship with a contact . <p> 2 . Engagement <p> " One of the things that Facebook has done is it 's given a face to journalists , " Lavrusik said , explaining that as a former newspaper reporter he was " used to hiding behind a byline " . <p> By creating a Facebook page a journalist pops up in a reader 's news feed and they become more than a black and white name on the top of a story . <p> " A lot of journalists have started to adapt a personalised form of writing so when they are posting or sharing one of their articles on Facebook , they are giving a more personalised take , they are giving a more behind the scenes look into their reporting , " Lavrusik explained . <p> " For some journalists this might feel unfamiliar as they 're used to writing in a very objective voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is something that journalists have always strived for . " <p> 4 . To showcase your work <p> News finds the reader on Facebook rather than the reader searching for news . A face and a name of a journalist becomes a credible , trusted brand and helps the Facebook user to filter the noise of news.5 . To increase social traffic to a news site <p> The average media organisation has seen a greater than 300 per cent increase in referral traffic from Facebook since the beginning of 2010 , Lavrusik explained , and Facebook is now a crucial traffic driver for news sites . <p> A Facebook page can help a journalist hunt for sources and information . News organisation NPR uses its Facebook page to find potential interviewees on a topic . The news team frequently finds a source in a matter of minutes . <p> 7 . To make thousands of connections <p> There is no limit on the number of connections a Facebook page can have . Profiles have a limit of 5,000 friends . <p> Although you are able to include an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan page , one problem with Facebook pages is that readers can not contact a journalist by his or her fan page and in turn journalists can not directly contact readers or sources . <p> " That 's something that we are trying to figure out how to resolve , " Lavrusik told Journalism.co.uk when asked about the problem of not being able to contact a journalist through a Facebook page . <p> Another limitation highlighted by Bradshaw is that Facebook pages only allow status updates or posts of up to 420 characters . <p> Examples of successful pages <p> 1 . Nicholas D Kristof <p> The Facebook page of New York Times journalist Nicholas D Kristof is one of the best examples . <p> Lavrusik has spoken to him about its success . " He put it really simply and said a good story is a good story on Facebook . " <p> Kristof has notched up over 220,000 likes . " What he does great is he really leverages the different things you can do with a page . He links to articles and teases them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 'll also post photo albums of his reporting abroad , giving people an insight and visual view . And photos are very popular on Facebook , people really like to interact with photos . " <p> " What 's also interesting , aside from just pointing people to articles , is the amount of times he 'll report a status update while he is reporting from abroad . This might be real time updates on his reporting : people that he has interviewed , first hand accounts or what he has seen , and essentially they are these micro stories he posts in 420 characters and they add this view and idea of doing great storytelling . " <p> And if you follow a journalist 's fan page and later see a link to a story in a news feed you a more likely to click on it , research by Facebook has proved . <p> " The thing Kristof does really well is conversation . He really listens to his audience and if he is going abroad he will enlist his readers by asking them what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was going to Haiti after the earthquake , he posted a status update and actually one of the responses he got ended up being his column just because it was such a great news tip . " <p> " He has nailed down that this is a conversation and that conversation is a big part of news itself . " <p> Consider the personal touch added by this link he posted recently : " My latest Spotify playlist , some of the tracks that kept me company in Libya " <p> He has posted behind the scenes pictures from his recent time in Libya . And when it comes to a voice and willingness to be part of the conversation , consider the following post : " Thanks for all the comments during my time in Libya , if you have any questions on how how we covered the story just ask . " <p> 3 . Robert Fisk <p> Middle East correspondent for the Independent Robert Fisk has a page but it differs in the way it works from the above examples . It takes feeds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the news feeds of Fisk 's more than 10,000 fans . <p> What the Independent has done is it " has turned his index page on the website into an open graph object , which is set up so it can publish updates via RSS into people 's news feeds if they have ' liked ' and essentially committed themselves to a social subscription to that section " , Jack Riley , head of digital audience and content development at the Independent told Journalism.co.uk . <p> Technology correspondent for Channel 4 News Benjamin Cohen is another journalist who uses Facebook , Twitter and Google+ effectively . His posts of links to Channel 4 News content and his blog posts are teased in a personal voice . <p> Here is just one example : " Catch me explain the iCloud buy heaving a wheelbarrow full of my stuff including a photo of my mum to the top of Primrose Hill ! " <p> 5 . Ian Burrell <p> Media editor at the Independent Ian Burrell teases and posts links on his page . Burrell has added a few photos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Desmond . <p> Ten tips on using a Facebook page <p> 1 . Remember it is a two-way conversation . Spark debate , ask questions and listen to people by responding to questions and comments ; 2 . Tease links using a personal , engaging voice ; 3 . Post photos ; 4 . Crowdsource ; 5 . Consider doing live chats with followers ; 6 . Unless you are opting for a page set up to auto-post stories like the one set up for Robert Fisk , do n't just automate posts to your Facebook wall . Readers are savvy and less likely to engage ; 7 . You do n't need to post as often as you might think . Anywhere from one post a day to one post a week seems to be effective ; 8 . Set up your page so that you can post from your mobile phone and post when you are out reporting ; 9 . Promote your page by including a link in your email signature , tweet about it and use it to connect with other journalists ' pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 10 . Monitor success . You can check on click-throughs to a news site using the site 's analytics and as a journalist with a page you will have access to Facebook Insights . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

The " design is a little slicker than it had been " , he explained . <p> It has also teamed up with Mapbox to help users of both platforms carry over existing formats , and introduced an alternative tool called Gigapixel , which let 's journalists take readers on a journey through an image , rather than a map . <p> In this how-to guide , however , we are going to focus on how to create a map-focused StoryMap , to deliver a location-themed story and bring together images , links and video to create an immersive experience . <p> For the purposes of this guide , I have created a StoryMap from scratch , which looks at just some of the journalism conferences Journalism.co.uk plans on attending and covering across Europe in the coming months . <p> So , how can you build your own ?

You will then need to give the interactive a name . <p> You will now be presented with the StoryMap dashboard , as shown below , on the first page of your interactive . <p> The first ' slide ' , or page of your StoryMap interactive , is like a front page . <p> The map that will show in your end product will be based on the points of interest you indicate as you create your final piece . <p> So , for example , if I was creating a StoryMap which only focused on locations within the UK , the final front page map would focus in on the UK . <p> However , if the map , as I have in this case , also included references to parts of Europe , then the front page map with scale out accordingly . <p> So for now , you do not need to worry that it is showing multiple copies of the world map , this will change as you build your StoryMap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headline for the entire piece , and you can also add more detail in the box underneath .

Click ' Add Slide ' on the left hand side menu , and once again you can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or video . <p> On these pages , vitally , you add the relevant locations to your map , one per slide . You can type in the location , whether it is a building , street name , city , country , and you can toggle the zoom bar in the top left-hand-side to enable you to drill down into your area of interest . <p> It is also worth noting at this point there are further customisation options available . For example , you can change the map style , background colour behind your text and the font itself via the ' Options ' and ' Slide Options ' buttons . <p> And then it is simply a case of adding a new slide for each new location , until you have your completed story . <p> Once it is finished , click ' Share ' where you can access a link to a StoryMap hosted version of the interactive , to share that link on social media networks , or the embed code to publish it on your own site . <p> The embed code is responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size and layout of the interactive based on the space into which it is placed . <p> For example , I have pasted the embed code for my sample StoryMap into this article below , which is in a space 460 pixels wide , causing the interactive layout to alter so that the map is placed above the text , rather than to its side . <p> Each slide is represented by a pin , which also carries a logo to identify whether there is an image , video or just text attached .

There is a big community of people that are obsessed by rail travel " and just as large a community who are enthralled by Russia . But it was n't just a travel piece .

There is no use in spending time to put technology or ideas into a piece if we have no clue if they like or hate it . If we can not tell the difference , we will not use it .

" Konstantinos Antonopoulos , senior interactive producer , Al Jazeera English <p> " There 's no ending to a story when the credits roll .

What does the future hold for them ? ) ; <p> the audience 's reaction to the story ( Were they connected with their adventures ? Did the readers follow their path to the end ? Are they moved by their actions ? Are they reacting on social media , are they curious to find out more ? ) . <p> " There are cases where we see value in following a story after it 's published " either on social level , on another interactive project or on another format , like TV , programmes or documentaries.

" <p> Rhizome has previously visited newsrooms and done research into how Webrecorder could help journalists , who are one of the target audiences for the software , and this work will continue as part of the new round of funding . <p> " We always think about how the first draft of an article that 's put online could often be just embedded tweets , before text is eventually added in . <p> " The stability of this kind of easy archiving for document storage , review and revision is a great possibility , but the workflow for journalists is very specific , so the grant will allow us to figure out how it could function . " <p> Another feature of Webrecorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software 's core purposes , is to preserve material that might be deleted or become unavailable in time . <p> However , the tool is currently operated under a Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) Takedown policy . This means any individual can ask for a record of their web presence or materials to be removed , so Rhizome will be working to " answer the more complicated questions and figure out policies " around privacy and copyright with the latest round of funding . <p> Also under development is the ability to embed the interactive recordings and export them in other formats apart from WARC . At the moment , users are able to get a link to their archive collections and share it , even though Rhizome has experimented with embedding options before . <p> Earlier this year , the organisation collaborated with the National Football Museum in Manchester to help them embed Vine videos they had archived in Webrecorder . <p> " We 've always had an affection for individuals who are using the web in the most intuitive and often most interesting way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interesting in preserving conversations , comments , but also artwork that is created on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram , " Kaplan said . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <h> Tell more diverse stories <p> " I want to connect people and explain things to them , and to me , you can not always do that with a big camera crew , " she said , noting that she is often allowed to film in places where more traditional cameras are not allowed . <p> For example , Algera was able to gain entry into a recent university event which discussed Islamophobia , when three large camera crews from network television were refused . <p> Although the organisers were still wary of her as a journalist , she was able to produce a news package on the event , which later went viral online . <p> As well as gaining exclusive access to stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories that are n't covered in mainstream news . <p> " I 'm all for normal people on TV instead of just extremists or experts " there seems to be a huge gap between the media and the audience nowadays , " Algera explained . <p> " Over the past few years , I 've noticed many people have turned away from traditional media , feeling that the world on TV and the content in newspapers is n't theirs " they feel like they do n't relate to the people being interviewed in the news . <p> " Instead , everyone stays in their ' Facebook bubble ' of news on their street " but mobile journalism can help to create a connection between the journalist and the general public , making smaller , personal stories with normal people that are more representative of the audience .

@@97847330 @2047330/ <p> What is it ? AutoEdit is a text-based video editing tool , developed as an open-source project by Pietro Passarelli with the product team at Vox Media , where he is a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow . <p> How is it of use to journalists ? The purpose of the tool is to speed up the process of how journalists use transcriptions to produce and edit videos , and to make it easier to add captions . <p> Both these tasks currently involve journalists producing the transcriptions and captions manually or by using third-party services that can automate the process . Reporters who want to produce shorter videos or sound-bites from a longer interview have to spend time watching or listening to the entire file to find the quote or sequence they are looking for . <p> From the user research he conducted with video staff at Vox Media , Passarelli identified a few common scenarios in which autoEdit can help reporters save time . <p> For example , the tool can help video producers who are looking to create shorter videos from longer pieces by generating an edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into software such as Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro to generate a video sequence . <p> It can also be used by journalists to quickly double-check a quote 's accuracy using the transcription generated , or to save time on manually transcribing entire video and audio interviews for articles such as Q&amp;As . <p> Cost : AutoEdit is free , but it needs to be integrated with a transcription service . There are free options available , but depending on the option chosen by the publisher , a one-off or monthly cost may be incurred . <p> AutoEdit has been configured to provide two options for the automated transcriptions , the IBM Watson Speech to Text system and Gentle . Users can pick which one they want to use , or tweak the code to incorporate their preferred transcription service . <p> It 's worth noting there are a few differences between the two systems available . IBM Watson is a pay-as-you-go service , offering customers 1,000 free minutes of transcription per month , before charging $0.02 for each additional minute thereafter . It is also available in multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files of any length in approximately five minutes . <p> Gentle on the other hand , is an open-source , free system which works offline on any computer . This could come in handy for journalists transcribing sensitive files , Passarelli said , such as interviews with whistleblowers , where they might not want the material to be accessed by a third-party . The downside is that it produces less accurate transcriptions than IBM Watson , which will require heavier manual editing , particularly if you are planning to use the text for the purposes of captioning . This option is also slower " it took Journalism.co.uk about 10 minutes to generate a transcription for a 10-minute audio file . <p> After you decide which option you 'd like to use , choose an audio or video file from your computer , add a title and an optional description , and wait for the transcription to be generated . <p> The time-coded transcription will appear , and the corresponding audio or video material will be shown on the top left . Clicking on a word in the text will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hit the ' edit ' button to correct the text . There is also a search bar to look for specific keywords in the transcription . <p> The ' highlight ' option in the menu allows you to select an unlimited number of quotes or phrases that you would like to include in a video sequence . Once selected , they will be underlined in blue and you can click ' export ' on the top right , where you will be given several options . <p> If you 've selected two consecutive quotes for example , you can export your selections in a chronological order as they appear in the video , or in the order you have made them . Whichever option you choose , autoEdit will produce an EDL file , that you can then open in a video or audio editing software of your choice together with the original file , which will automatically produce the video or audio sequence selected earlier . <p> If you 're using the tool to generate captions for a video , you will be able to export the transcription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate open-source tool available on GitHub , Captions Burner , where you can overlay the subtitle on a video file and create a short captioned video or GIF for social media . And if all you 're after is the transcription , the tool can provide it in a plain text or timecoded plain text file . <p> AutoEdit is still under development , so if you encounter any bugs or would like to provide further feedback , get in touch with Passarelli and the team by emailing info@autoEdit.io. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> He explained how the limitations of email , such as technical production , space availability , spam filters and rendering images or videos , has prompted publishers to experiment with the format by placing more emphasis on aspects such as : curation , by " weaving a narrative " between stories and present it in a conversational style ; serendipity , as some articles featured in the newsletter might be on unexpected subjects ; and ' finishability ' , leading people to feel less overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small number of articles in a newsletter or indicating the reading time for each story . <p> Newsletters are a " halfway house between print and digital " , the author stated .

But the self-contained attribute of email also makes newsletters more easily accessible regardless of the type of data connection or poor bandwith . <p> The paper also looks at how news organisations , both legacy outlets such as Washington Post , NYT and The Economist and newer digital players including Quartz and BuzzFeed , have embraced newsletters as part of their distribution strategies , and how the format of email briefings differs according to publishers ' overall goals and business models . <p> Jack found seven differences in the format and structure of newsletters , including : automated or manual story selection , the inclusion or exclusion of links to additional content , and sourcing content only from the publisher 's own archive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today for email " like so many other aspects of the digital newsroom " is monetisation , " Jack pointed out in the report , which also plays into the extent to which news outlets have embraced newsletters and how many resources they choose to invest in this medium . <p> Some titles , such as The Economist and The Financial Times , have made the newsletter a standalone paid-for product or an add-on to existing subscription models , while others are using the format to generate web traffic and ultimately convert people into paying readers or monetise the experience in other ways . <p> Measuring the impact or success of newsletters can also be a challenge , as it differs according to the main aim of the product and the business models of the organisation . <p> For example , if the goal of a paywalled publication is to convert recipients into subscribers , newsletters provide data for click-through rates and how many people have opened the email . <p> But even this may not show the full picture , as a reader 's decision to subscribe or register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , so additional metrics such as scroll depth , dwell time and number of times an email has been forwarded should also be taken into account . <p> " New distribution mechanisms may well ultimately replace email .

" <p> As an example of how the software is put into practice , he highlighted the attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi in September last year , where armed men stormed the shopping centre , throwing grenades , shooting shoppers and taking hostages . <p> " Heatmap lit up with the word attack , Westgate and Nairobi , " Browne explained . " It was a Saturday morning around 10 and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The tech picked it up and we went straight to our Kenya list .

The next step is to take the keywords that people are using to describe the event and use that local knowledge to go and find images and bring that story to visual for our news clients . " <p> Utilising social networks <p> Although social media can be vital in getting the first word on breaking news stories it can also be a source for more investigative journalism . <p> Much of his work revolves around finding , verifying and analysing YouTube videos from Syria to tell stories of the evolving conflict . <p> " It really started with an event called the Houla massacre in May 2012 , " Higgins told Journalism.co.uk . " A village was attacked by reportedly pro-government forces and a large number of people were killed . Until then I had been looking at videos and thinking about how they were uploaded , then I started thinking there must be other accounts . " <p> He started to collect YouTube channels into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also sought out related Facebook groups and Twitter accounts to directly contact the individuals on the ground who were uploading the videos . <p> " Videos do n't just appear as a singular thing , " Higgins said . " There may be a related Facebook post or a Tweet or you could Skype the person who did it and find more information . <p> " After the 21 August chemical weapons attacks I had some people in Damascus contact me and say they 'd read my work and invite me to speak with one of the doctors who treated some of the patients . " <p> Higgins ' work on the 21 August attacks in Damascus is ongoing " news organisations and official observers are still not 100 per cent sure who the perpetrators were or where the chemical weapons came from " but his contact with groups on social media means he can access sources and information otherwise difficult to reach . <p> " I was checking videos every single day and started to notice that there were new weapons appearing in certain areas , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the videos on the channels where these weapons were appearing and add it all to a big spreadsheet as I was gathering the information . <p> " Then I looked at the videos from the same region and looked at the list from all the different regions to see if there were other groups using these weapons . " <p> There are whole networks of information that you can explore and discover worthwhile stories fromEliot Higgins , Brown Moses <p> In a painstaking process of analysing videos and cross-referencing channels he deduced the new weapons were left over from the conflict in Yugoslavia two decades earlier , being brought in from southern Syria and spreading out across the country from there . He passed the information to the New York Times who consulted their sources and were able to " develop the story further " . <p> " I do n't think its unique to Syria , " he said . " I 've been approached by people who want to do it in other conflicts . In Nigeria , for example , they 're using the same techniques to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups using YouTube , Facebook and Twitter to get their message out . " <p> Beyond arms groups , video is an important resource for other news stories . YouTube has become an important platform for recent events in Ukraine , with Mashable reporting that more than 90,000 videos relating to the crisis have been uploaded since 1 February , an 82 per cent increase on the number of uploads in the previous two months . <p> " As mobile technology becomes more widespread and phones become more advanced and spread further into other countries this will play an important role , " said Higgins . " Syria has produced a massive amount of video footage , millions of Facebook and Twitter posts . Not all of it is useful , but it 's about being able to sort through that and turn it into useful information , like the Croatian weapons story and my work on 21 August . <p> " There 's a lot of information there that is very relevant to news stories , not just ' here 's the latest picture of a bomb going off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are whole networks of information that you can explore and discover worthwhile stories from . " <p> " This all really started off the back of the London riots in 2011 when our team was slightly taken on the back foot when we realised that a lot of intelligence of what was going on on the ground , the pictures and videos , were being shared on BlackBerry messenger rather than Twitter , Facebook and YouTube , which were the normal go to sites for a lot of this content , " Barot told Journalism.co.uk . <p> BlackBerry messenger was a " closed ecosystem " , he said , in that unless a user had an account and was directly connected to individuals sharing the information " there is no way to tap into it " . <p> Having a WhatsApp account and giving people the opportunity to communicate in that app actually opened up access to people they would n't have reached in any other wayTrushar Barot , BBC <p> Since then , Barot has been monitoring chat apps like WhatsApp and WeChat in the Asia Pacific area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are becoming increasingly prevalent around the world . <p> " One of our programs on BBC World Service used WhatsApp quite effectively during Typhoon Haiyan at the back end of last year , " he said . " Because so many people in that region in the Philippines were already on WhatsApp as a natural place where they would share information and their content , just for having an account within WhatsApp and giving people the opportunity to communicate with that program inside that app actually opened up access to people that they would n't have reached in any other way . " <p> In this case , the production team on the ground in the Philippines set up an account on the team phone and prompted listeners to contact the program via WhatsApp alongside the more traditional channels . <p> " The people in the Philippines who have WhatsApp still have very small data subscriptions , " he said , " but because it 's free or very low cost it became a much simpler and easier way for them to actually send out their content to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often difficult , because they had to be at a computer . Or by sending it through text message which would cost them a lot more . " <p> In some poorer parts of the world mobile is leapfrogging desktop as the first choice technology for online communication , so being able to access those networks , even if they are closed , is important for journalists to be able to reach all the relevant sources for news . <p> Geolocating social media <p> As more apps and mobile software include GPS locations in the metadata of images or video , the ability to quickly find information relevant to a story , or verify multimedia after the event , becomes easier for journalists . Facebook 's Graph Search is a quick option for finding sources in registered to particular locations , but more detailed geolocation software is emerging for finding content or individuals . <p> Browne said a lot of Instagram content is geolocated " " a lot more than than Facebook , YouTube or other platforms " " which can give journalists a head start on verification as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are topographical reference points " . <p> Storyful searched for GPS tags around the Westgate mall as the crisis was unfolding and found a number of different sources . <p> " We found images being posted from one of the upper floors of victims on the ground outside in the car park , " Browne said , " of emergency services when they arrived , treating those people ; of someone being lead out with their arms over their head by a member of security ; other people hiding on a rooftop . <p> Is it going to become easier to potentially do a quick geolocation search around a big news event ? Trushar barot , BBC <p> " So we were really getting a sense of what was happening there and this happened to be the wife of a Kuwaiti diplomat posting the photos . You could see from this person 's social media profile that they looked like they were Kuwaiti living in Nairobi , describing all this in Arabic . <p> " You would n't really think to search social media for search terms in Arabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geolocation and the tools to pick that up we were able to get these images . " <p> Higgins is particularly interested in InformaCam , an app launched in December which includes important metadata in images and video by default , as it will make the verification process of using UGC simpler . <p> " What 's useful about this is it records the angle the camera is facing and the GPS data , " he said , " stuff that is incredibly useful when you 're trying to verify videos . That is encrypted so it can be difficult to fake and it can be sent securely so if they the users get arrested by security services they can protect themselves .

@@97847349 @2047349/ <p> Before the internet , most beats in journalism embodied the phrase " it 's not what you know , it 's who you know " . The best reporters were the best connected , picking up tips and stories from insider sources before anyone else . <p> This is still true . But there are also a lot of online tools and resources which can help reporters keep on top of their beat , especially when the range of stories and information available around the world is so much more accessible . Finding them is the key . <p> Here we present a list of platforms that journalists can use to keep an eye on their specific area of interest more effectively and efficiently . It is by no means definitive or exhaustive so if you have any recommendations please feel free to add them in the comments section below . <p> " My general principle is that the more things you go to to monitor , the less useful they start to become , " he said , " so I would always argue to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're hopping from one website to the next , to the next , to the next , then you 're really starting to lose what you set out to achieve in the first place " of just speed and efficiency . I generally keep it to five or six platforms or sites , keep it focussed . Find out what works for you . " <p> If all of these tools and more are relevant and effective then great , but Galvin 's advice is worth remembering in terms of finding the most useful tools for your needs . Now , let 's get started . <p> We all know Twitter has become one of the most important tools for journalists , in picking up on important issues and finding sources close to breaking news events . <p> But what shortcuts exist to keep an eye on the 500 million plus tweets that are sent each day ? <p> Twitter lists should be the first stop , allowing you to group chosen accounts and follow their updates , even if you do n't follow the accounts themselves . Picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subscribing to their lists is highly recommended as well . <p> Once you know what lists you want to follow , grouping them in Tweetdeck is a must , organising Twitter feeds into columns . As well as the lists , you can keep an eye on your own accounts , mentions and messages , and more importantly , search for keywords around your beat . <p> Screenshot from Tweetdeck showing different columns <p> As we discussed in a recent screencast , there are a number of more advanced search tips to help narrow the scope of your keyword searches and get more accurate results . <p> So if you were covering the recent Labour annual party conference you could search for ' #lab14 OR Labour ' . If you wanted tweets with questions , including a question mark would do the trick : ' #lab14 OR Labour AND ? ' . <p> If you want to look for positive or negative attitudes you can add : ) or : ( symbols to the search , in the same place as the question mark . <p> Looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Manchester OR ( near : " Manchester , England " within:10mi ) ' . Adding other words to the chain will work up to a degree , as long as the search is n't overloaded . <p> So just in case life imitates art , as in the disastrous Labour conference from satirical TV show ' The Thick Of It ' , it may be worth searching for : <p> While Facebook might not hold as much sway among journalists for breaking news as Twitter , it boasts over one billion users so is still a worthwhile source of information . <p> Facebook 's ' interest lists ' function in much the same way as Twitter lists , allowing users to organise accounts into a customised news feed . <p> Click the " add interests ... " tab at the bottom of the left-hand side bar and choose from a selection of lists made by others or build your own . <p> You do n't need to ' like ' a page to add it to a list but individual people need to have enabled the ' follow ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't find a page but you know it exists you may have to search for its unique Facebook I 'd , usually found at the end of the page 's web address in the URL bar in your browser . <p> Screenshot of a search in Facebook 's Graph Search <p> ' Graph search ' is another handy function from Facebook for finding people or images . Technically more of a search tool than a monitoring tool , we 'll include it here anyway because it 's so useful . <p> Facebook has a full blog post introducing graph search but some key searches to remember are " recent photos taken in location " or " people who work at business " , both of which could help you quickly turn up pictures or sources in breaking news situations . <p> RSS <p> Introduced back in 1999 , RSS feeds are the great-grandaddy of newsfeeds in internet terms , but are still vital in keeping up to date with the variety of sources out there . <p> Information overload is always something you have to avoidRobin Wauters , Tech.eu <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for feeds and blogs by URL , title or topic and then organise them into categories around certain subjects . <p> Look for the small orange RSS symbol on any web page , like a wifi symbol on its side , and get the code to add to your preferred RSS reader . <p> Robin Wauters , founding editor of Tech.eu , advised journalists using RSS to categorise the different feeds properly to make the most of them . <p> " It 's our job to monitor that stuff on a daily basis or even an hourly basis , " he said . " If you mix in a lot of different sources that tend to post very frequently and some personal stuff then it can quickly get very overwhelming . <p> " Information overload is always something you have to avoid and RSS is ideal for that as it makes it easy to get overwhelmed . " <p> Organising around post frequency , geography or type of source will often help here , he said , such as bloggers or official channels and agencies . <p> Most national agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer an RSS feed for different sections for when new datasets are published . <p> Since 2010 , social newswire Storyful has been offering journalists and newsrooms access to their thousands of lists , sources and verified multimedia . <p> As a paid-for service it is more for newsrooms than individual journalists , but the new interface launched at the start of September allows users to pick out different beats , regions or stories and monitor the social media activity around that . <p> Screengrab from Storyful 's newswire service <p> The Storyful editorial team populates the lists from verified and trusted accounts , and has its own array of back-end software to find out when news stories break , who the most reliable sources are and whether a post is accurate or not . <p> While we 're on the subject , Storyful has a free browser plug-in called Multisearch for finding social media posts , pictures , and videos around specific keywords . <p> The free iOS and Android app Banjo and powerful paid-for platform Geofeedia both offer journalists the ability to monitor social media by location rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent to may networks . <p> As well as monitoring specific areas to show what is trending or looking for spikes in activity ( in a similar way to Storyful ) , these tools can help you find images or video around stories that may be useful . <p> At Trinity Mirror Regionals , head of social media Gayle Tomlinson has been encouraging newsrooms to use Geofeedia for breaking news . <p> " Manchester Evening News use it if there 's been a fire , " she told Journalism.co.uk , " going in and seeing what people are saying to verify it is happening but also to get comment as well . <p> " It 's a fantastic tool and there 's probably lots of other ways to use it as well which we might not have thought of yet , " she said . <p> Reddit <p> Although Reddit can occasionally harbour some of the darker citizens of the internet , as a community and source of stories it is rich in information . <p> Subreddits , areas of the site around specific topics , can range from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very useful to find out what 's trending in a specific area , " he said , " what videos are making people talk . <p> " So Reddit is something we use quite regularly . A lot of the content thrown up by Reddit is more viral-related rather than news-related but some of the groups have been very effective in alerting us to specific content related to specific stories , particularly the Syrian and Ukraine groups .

@@97847352 @2047352/ <p> In traditional broadcasting , before a video was put on air and before the journalist was even sent to cover a story , there would be a risk assessment procedure in place . <p> Social media trainer and former BBC journalist Sue Llewellyn pointed out that a similar process should be observed before journalists start livestreaming on Periscope or Facebook Live . <p> Speaking at MoJoCon in Ireland today ( 29 April ) , she highlighted the " spectre " of livestreaming " a " s.p.e.c.t.r.e " which also serves as a mnemonic device to help broadcasters calculate the risks . <p> " The raw and visceral is really very frightening , " she said . <h> Safety <p> " Safety should be rule number one in whatever you 're doing . " Llewellyn highlighted a case where the livestreamer was broadcasting from the street where they had found an abandoned suitcase , asking viewers what to do about it . <p> Your livestreams should not endanger those around you and yourself . It is easy to become distracted while streaming and engaging with the comments . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's backs , Llewellyn highlighted that livestreamers often work alone , and focusing on a broadcast could mean they are missing dangerous developments in their vicinity . <p> Livestreaming with the location turned on can also be a safety issue , especially when broadcasting from your home . <h> Privacy <p> Livestreamers could become the new paparazzi , she said , as users now have a new tool to film and share pictures of celebrities when they see them in the street . <p> " Privacy is a massive issue , we all have a right to a private life and be private if we so wish . " <p> Filming and broadcasting minors also requires a written consent form , which usually would not be present when someone is doing a quick livestream of their favourite celebrity who is out with their family . <h> Ethics <p> Thinking about the situations when it is appropriate to livestream is one of the challenges facing the media industry today . <p> There are many risks associated with broadcasting live from situations when reporters will not be able to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream just because we can when we have something potentially really shocking ? " The first instinct might be to stream from breaking news events , but journalists should be thinking about what could appear on the screen next , and if they are willing to show that to their audience . <h> Copyright <p> But copyright can become an issue in situations that would otherwise seem uncomplicated " even doing a quick Q&amp;A or behind the scenes video from your office can cause trouble if you are accidentally playing music in the background . <h> Trolling <p> Trolling on social media has long been an issue for online journalists , and it comes as no surprise that the trolls have also adopted these new platforms . <p> While some trolls might be harmless , and simply tell users the audio on a Periscope is not working when it actually is , some female journalists have reported unmanageable levels of abuse on livestreaming platforms . <p> " That kind of trolling is an issue that needs to be stopped , " said Llewellyn . " Platforms are n't doing enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that puts people off . " <h> Reputational risk <p> While giving up the ability to control what the audience is about to see next in a livestream , broadcasters risk damaging their reputation when things go wrong . <p> This does not necessarily need to be connected to illegal or unethical streams " low quality broadcasts can also send the wrong signal . <p> Llewellyn advised journalists to work out what could happen during a livestream and incorporate these scenarios in their crisis planning . <p> " At the very best you could bore your followers or your friends . At worst ... you could lose trust . " <h> Emotional trauma <p> Causing distress to viewers by streaming graphic imagery is another consideration for journalists who are thinking about going live in breaking news situations . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847353 @2047353/ <h> How to : get to grips with numbers as a journalist <p> Anyone who has observed a journalist feverishly working on their expenses claim , calculator in hand , swamped by coffee-stained receipts , will scoff at suggestions that members of the news media are **25;128;TOOLONG . <p> The level of maths skills - not to mention fantasy - involved in filling out an expenses form puts most rocket scientists to shame . <p> But still the myth endures that journalists and numbers are an explosive mixture best kept apart . <p> Now this is n't a myth to which I subscribe . Not only do I find that the journalism students with whom I work are generally comfortable and confident with figures , but no working journalist can afford to be numerically illiterate , any more than he or she can afford to write sloppy , grammatically incorrect prose . <p> That 's because journalists have to be able to challenge the information presented to them and to present it in a way that readers can readily understand . <p> Often , that information involves or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election , a budget , the economy or an MP 's claim for their second home . <p> It does n't require a higher degree in calculus to work with numbers , but it does require applying common sense and the same critical thinking that goes into any other news story . <p> Example 1You receive a press release from a local action group . It tells you that a village in your patch has the highest number of hit-and-runs in the county at 52 , so you rush to write about the region 's most dangerous drivers ... until you 're brought short by the newsdesk . <p> How many people live in the village ? Erm , 5,500 . Did you notice that the press release mentions a neighbouring village ( pop . 1,250 ) which had 44 hit-and-runs in the same period ? So although the number was higher in your village , the rate was nearly four times higher in the neighbouring village - 0.035 as opposed to 0.01 . Which is the more dangerous now ? <p> Ok , so that 's an artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a common one . In order to compare the likelihood of events in different localities , you should always look at the number of times that event has happened ( the quantity ) divided by the number of people the event could have happened to ( the population ) . <p> But when we write up the story , we want to present the numbers in a more intuitive way . Not only is the rate of 0.01 quite inelegant , it 's also only an approximation to the true figure of 0.009-and-a-bit . A better way of expressing the rate would be as ' about nine people in a thousand ' . The rate for Village 2 is about 35 people in a thousand . This way of expressing the numbers also makes it easier for readers to compare them . <p> Of course , such a story about rates should also give some context - has the rate for Village 2 changed much over the past 10 years ? What appeared a drop in the 1990s to 22 hit-and-runs merely reflected the smaller population in that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . <p> Example 2In addition to rates and percentages , the other common pitfall for reporters is averages . Most journalists do seem aware that there is more than one sort of average , although they can be a little fuzzy on what exactly these are . <p> The important point is to be wary of any report or press release quoting ' average ' figures - as well as ' average ' having at least three distinct definitions , the cunning selection of timeframes and of what to compare can completely distort the true picture . <p> ' Average house prices fall 15 per cent ' - not only do I want to know which average you 're using , but also what time periods you are using , which parts of the country and what housing stock , as well as the source for the underlying figures . <p> By choosing a different average and varying the timeframe , it 's quite possible to show average house prices have actually risen 15 per cent . <p> Do n't be suckered by the lazy option - always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes , and ( just as importantly ) what it excludes . <p> Now nothing above is exactly mentally challenging . It is a question of deciding what questions to ask of the numbers , and how to report the answers . Fundamentally , it is no different from any other type of story . <p> There can be no excuses for reporters failing to get to grips with figures .

" <p> So what does a day in the life of the engagement team look like ? <p> Rockey said she and her colleagues start their morning by looking at the news agenda , discussing with section editors the stories that are in the pipeline , the timing around them and whether there are any bigger features or videos coming up . <p> They also check the calendar for any " important moments that people will be experiencing " in the near future , such as anniversaries or protests . <p> " We often ask our editors ' what are some of the questions that people have on this topic , what 's the content that we can provide for them ' ? " <p> The team regularly monitors conversation on social to resurface coverage of certain issues a number of times , stories " that are relevant in people 's lives beyond just the day we hit publish " . This is also highlighted through Vox 's collection of card stacks , said Rockey . <p> " People might start hearing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's going to be relevant when it hits their lives , either when something 's happened in their community or a story 's bubbled up , " she added . <p> The latest addition to Vox 's social presence is Snapchat Discover , a platform they joined two months ago . A considerable amount of the team 's effort goes into producing the daily edition for Snapchat , which is published early in the morning , Eastern Time . <p> Rockey said when the team set out to define what Vox should look like on the Discover channel , they aimed to focus more in the platform 's opportunity for showcasing short videos and the interaction provided through swiping , while making sure they delivered the news in a way that was consistent with Vox 's storytelling on the website . <p> " We find that millennials have a lot of in common with other Vox readers , they are really curious and interested in issues of fairness , justice , human stories and learning about the world . <p> " We hope that , with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can turn to someone and explain it to them " that 's how we know we 've been successful .

Some news outlets decide to close comments on articles for legal reasons , but there are other reasons why enabling commentary might not be appropriate . <p> At the Guardian , community manager Laura Oliver identified a list of points taken into consideration before comments are enabled . They will question whether it is an appropriate subject to carry discussion underneath and the right article , or whether a different piece on the same issue would be a more suitable home for the discussion . <p> News outlets also need to look to their resources and whether they are in a position to stay on top of the moderation necessary to ensure the best experience for their community . <p> The best kind of conversation and best kind of interaction both for us and for readers of our site , comes from where there is some kind of management or involvementLaura Oliver , the Guardian <p> " We 're very much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of interaction both for us and for readers of our site , comes from where there is some kind of management or involvement , " Oliver explained . <p> " Whether that 's staff getting involved , or the writer of a piece , or whether it 's strong moderation to make sure a tricky topic gets off on the right foot . " <p> Certain subjects or people who appear within an article might be known for usually provoking a strong response , and so spotting those and considering the likely response can also play an important role in deciding the best way forward , she said . <p> Similarly , at the New York Times , the fact an article features comments is the result of a considered decision . <p> " We have always been selective on which stories we open up comments on , " deputy editor for interactive news Marc Lavallee told Journalism.co.uk . And the inclusion of a commenting facility should therefore highlight to their audience that " there 's some purpose behind it from our perspective " , he added . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time to bring on the discussion . But for those with less established commenting communities , there are some tips for how to encourage activity early on . <p> First , take a look at the registration process , Tom Miller , former community manager for Digital Spy , and now product strategist for owner Hearst Magazines UK , advises . <p> Often when you do start with a new site or a relaunch , the problem and the biggest barrier to entry is usually the registration processTom Miller , Hearst Magazines UK <p> " Often when you do start with a new site or a relaunch , the problem and the biggest barrier to entry is usually the registration process , " he said . <p> There is also the question of whether to allow anonymous commenting , or perhaps limit comments to a social login requiring people to comment with their social web persona . <p> Trinity Mirror Regionals , for example , took the decision to move to Facebook login for its comments earlier this year . Digital publishing director David Higgerson , who blogged about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only expedite the launch of its new websites , but also enhance the quality of conversation on those sites , although the quantity has dropped " quite significantly " . <p> " What we do tend to find is that people are leaving more considered comments , are more respectful of each other when they 're engaging with each other , and we feel that we do have nicer , more welcoming websites as a result . " <p> This approach suggests that by using their social identities , commenters are more inclined to be civil and leave more respectful comments . But not everyone believes this will always have the desired effect . <p> " If you look at some of the things people say on Facebook groups or pages where they are commenting under their own name or certainly an identity linked to their personal life , I do n't think that 's always true , " Oliver said . She also highlighted that some people adopt online identities which can be just as important to them as their real-life name , and so will act with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning anonymous commenting could " close and quieten down debate and conversation " , such as where people may not feel comfortable commenting about a personal issue , for example , in their name . <p> Giving some direction <p> For some would-be-commenters , knowing how they can best contribute to a comment section can be difficult . If there is a steady flow of comments already they may not know how best they can add to the discussion , or if things are looking quiet they might not feel confident to take that first step . <p> One way to help with this is for the journalist to offer direction ahead of the discussion , clearly signposting to readers at the end of their article what the main purpose of the comment thread is , and the best way they can make a useful contribution . <p> Where comments appear ' under the line ' at the end of an article , for example , the Guardian likes to sometimes " frame " the discussion , such as by specifically stating what the comment thread is for , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . <p> " A little bit of direction can work really well , " Oliver said . " I think particularly for those people who maybe are n't sure that they 've got something to say . <p> " When you prompt someone and say ' we 're not just looking for your opinion , we 're looking for your knowledge or your expertise or your experience ' , it can really help give someone the courage to say ' actually I do have a lot to say on this particular subject ' . " <p> She added that not only does this help the commenter , but it can also prove fruitful for the journalist working on the story , who might find more thoughtful contributions offer up new leads for them . <p> At Quartz , its new approach to offering ' annotations ' next to article paragraphs is another way of offering a clear direction for commenters , by giving them the ability to have conversations around particular points in the story . <p> " The paragraph acts as the discussion prompt , " Seward explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , add to , and otherwise annotate something very specific in that paragraph . <p> A comment section can mean many different things to different people and without an organising principle or discussion prompt , it 's hard to really even know what to use it forZach Seward , Quartz <p> " A comment section can mean many different things to different people and without an organising principle or discussion prompt , it 's hard to really even know what to use it for . " <p> The value of journalist involvement <p> Whether it is to encourage activity in the first place , or to be involved once discussion is underway , being active in comment threads as a journalist , is hugely important . It is advised , for example , to respond to questions about your work , or just to show an interest in the conversation . <p> Not only does this help demonstrate to communities that they are being heard , it has also been found to help focus the discussion early on and keep a higher quality of conversation . <p> " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for moderation , " Oliver said , and Bassey Etim from the New York Times added that this is another way to " show respect " as a news outlet to those who are contributing to your product , and it " really does improve the quality of the conversation " . <p> Just the idea that there 's a ' adult in the room ' watching everything keeps everybody , trolls and reasonable commenters alike , on their toesBassey Etim , New York Times <p> " Just the idea that there 's an ' adult in the room ' watching everything keeps everybody , trolls and reasonable commenters alike , on their toes . " <p> " They do n't want to be exposed as just another mindless commenter when there 's a journalist around , " he added . <p> Interestingly , the growing use of social media by journalists has meant the practice of getting involved in the comments is on the increase , at least at Trinity Mirror regional titles , according to Higgerson . <p> And when journalists are in the threads , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty space " , he said . <p> Offering ways to sort the chaos <p> The quality of the comments is not the only factor which can help determine the end user experience " quantity can play a part too . And if your news site often has hundreds of comments underneath an article , it might be worth considering if there is any way to make this more manageable , or useful , for readers . <p> News outlets take different approaches to how they sort comments , some simply offer chronological ordering , while others offer the ability to push ' better ' comments higher up the thread . <p> When it was using Facebook comments , Digital Spy , for example , used to be able to " boost " what it considered the best comments . This is not possible on its new system at the moment , but it is looking at similar strategies for the future . <p> " There are ways around it which we need to spend a lot more time on , " Miller said , " particularly now people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just by no means ideal . " <p> Lavallee said for the New York Times , ensuring a good user experience for readers is vital , with efforts to avoid giving them an " inbox problem " with hundreds of comments to get through . <p> To tackle this , under articles on the New York Times , for example , comments are sometimes sorted into collections of ' Readers ' Picks ' , and/or ' NYT Picks ' . <p> Another tactic is to organise comment threads into different groups of conversations . The Guardian 's platform let 's commenters reply to specific comments . The resulting conversations , which may be lengthy discussions , and which may occur within a thread containing others too , can now be collapsed into ' nests ' so that others arriving to the story can choose whether to dive into those ' nests ' in more detail , or just sample a snapshot of them . <p> " They 'll be able to more quickly look at what 's been said already , look at the different nests of conversation that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without getting distracted or thinking that the first conversation is the whole discussion , " Oliver explained . <p> Recognising and rewarding key commenters above the line <p> Partly in a continuation of the above strategies for bringing some order and added value to the world of comments , the New York Times has also started experimenting with bringing certain comments above the line . <p> This serves to not only give greater status to comments and reward those who offer those contributions , but helps present the wider conversation and alternative viewpoints to readers in conjunction with the narrative . <p> The selection of comments is made based on a number of factors . The team look for a collection of perspectives which offer varying viewpoints , for example , the more succinct arguments putting across clear points , or even " extreme opinions that really catch the essence of a wide range of feeling " . <p> The aim is " to create a clip notes version of the comment thread so you do n't have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> News outlets have also found other ways of recognising the best voices in its threads , and are also bringing those comments ' above the line ' . <p> At the Guardian , for example , Comment is Free run a Comment of the Week , and also give the world of comments " a more human face " by getting to know certain commenters better in Below The Line . <p> Some comments may also find their ways into liveblogs , or play a part in editorial decisions or follow-ups . " It shows people that you 're taking it seriously and that we 're actually reading the comments that go under our articles , " Oliver said . <p> Quartz 's new annotations feature also works to " reward a really thoughtful contribution " , Seward said , while Miller added that making sure thoughtful comments are able to inform future editorial is very important for Digital Spy . And this in turn can serve to welcome more commenters to join in , Higgerson said . <p> " You do n't need many comments to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repackaging comments on a particular story into an article in its own right . <p> " You write the article , you get the comments , turn those comments into an article . That then brings on more comments . " <p> As well as bringing comments above the line , The New York Times also sometimes takes them out of article pages and onto the homepage , where the Times wants to highlight both the article and " the best of that conversation " . <p> Etim added that these strategies show the community respect , and this delivers quality in return . <p> " When you show respect for people , whether it be through creating these really cool interactive commenting formats , or whether it be through trying to get a reporter in the thread talking on the same level as the readers , it really does improve the quality of the conversation . " <p> Innovating for the future <p> The recent experiments in how comments are integrated into online articles at the New York Times , Quartz and elsewhere " such as by Medium which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " come at a time when the industry is excitedly experimenting with new digital publishing formats , and the comment thread is being required to evolve alongside it . <p> Long-form multimedia features , for example , which do not conform to traditional article layouts , have caused news outlets to think about where the community 's conversation can exist alongside that . <p> The New York Times 's much-discussed Snowfall feature , for example , was " a bit of a wake-up call for comments in general " , Lavallee said . In the case of Snowfall , there was a separate page where comments were gathered . <p> " It garnered great conversation , " Lavellee said , " but I think the vast majority of people who read Snowfall did n't see it . " <p> " I think that influenced a lot of our thinking going into this year , particularly with these major enterprise stories that we as an organisation put a lot of effort behind , to find , in the right situations , the right ways to treat the reader voice as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , video , etc . " <p> Miller argued that with this style of digital storytelling , annotation is the way forward . <p> Anything that gives comments a more prominent slot in an article can only be a good thing if the publisher has a serious commitment to valuing those commentsDavid Higgerson , Trinity Mirror Regionals <p> " When you look at things like Medium and SoundCloud , where you can essentially annotate as you read or as you listen , in the same way that you might on a Kindle , I think that 's the right direction to head in . <p> " Apps are doing this so much faster than publishers for the most part , so it 's good to look at them I think for inspiration where we can . " <p> This presents many questions " such as where to deliver those annotation opportunities , or ' reader perspective ' boxes , a point raised by Higgerson . <p> " But anything that gives comments a more prominent slot in an article can only be a good thing if the publisher has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " And that 's a very good way of showing that you value what people are saying by giving them such prime real estate in the article " . <p> This guide acts as a follow-up to this how-to from 2011 by eModeration 's Tamara Littleton on managing comments across platforms , and moderation advice <p> Update : Please use the comment section below to share any strategies you have which have helped boost the quality of comments or the experience for readers in general . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847358 @2047358/ <h> How to : have a digital ' edge ' as a new journalist <p> When it comes to getting your first job in journalism , there are a number of qualities all potential employers will be looking for . <p> You need to be able to write with accuracy and clarity , for example , and at times at speed ( without " importantly " losing either of the first two staples of good reporting ) . It is also generally important to be well-versed in media law . Shorthand ? Well , we will come to that later . <p> But assuming you possess all the important underlying abilities , having some digital sensibilities on top could help to set you out from the crowd , and where you are applying for an online or otherwise-digital position in particular , having key digital skills and tools under your belt could be vital . <p> For a podcast on this subject last month I spoke to Alison Gow , editor of the digital content innovation team at Trinity Mirror Regionals ; Cate Sevilla , homepage editor for BuzzFeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology at Incisive Media ; Anna Doble , head of online at Channel 4 News and Jon di Paolo , executive producer of SkyNews.com . <p> Their comments covered skills within the following areas : social media , multimedia , newsgathering and fact-checking , digital innovation , interactivity and specialisms . They also shared some advice on qualifications and other non-digital skills which can help to put your application in strong standing . <p> Social media <p> Being on social media is not just a chance to show you are up to speed with the different networks being used today , but it is important to use these platforms to engage with others , particularly around your subjects of interest . <p> So make sure your accounts reflect your stated interests . And if you are going for a social media-focused role , make sure your social media activities demonstrate your ability to communicate well with others and share interesting content effectively . <p> If somebody comes along to us and says I 'm really switched on , I 've got the potential to be a great journalist and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , no followers , nothing , it is highly suspiciousJohn Barnes , Incisive Media <p> " You might have a Twitter account and a Facebook account , but you actually need to use them because you need to have that deep level of understanding , " Alison Gow explained . <p> " If somebody comes along to us and says I 'm really switched on , I 've got the potential to be a great journalist and they do n't have any form of social media interaction at all , no followers , nothing , it is highly suspicious , " John Barnes added . <p> " Simple things like do they have a picture on their account ? Do they actually describe what they 're doing ? Do they have a consistent level of tweeting or commenting ? Is it in and around a subject that they 're developing an interest in or an expertise on ? We will look at those things to get a more general picture of what a person is like . <p> " Obviously , in my day , it was ' had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now blogs are slightly like that . But any experience that has been gained along the way , whether it 's more formal experience through publications at college , whether it 's work experience through courses that have taken place at college or holiday jobs , or whether it is actually just things like a really keen interest in a subject and therefore the go-getting nature of writing a blog or having a good social media profile , they 're all things that definitely help . " <p> And if you aspire to write for viral content sites such as BuzzFeed , being social media-savvy is obviously vital . <p> " If you 're applying for a community management role and your Twitter feed is only updated once a week or has been left to rot , that 's a bad sign " , Cate Sevilla said . <p> " So having all of the usual profiles you expect people to have , having a blog where you talk about this stuff you claim to be interested in or be a specialist in , is really important . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you want a job , when we look at what you 've done in the past we should be able to find you on the internet and find that you are talking about the stuff you claim to want a job in . " <p> Given the rise , and continuing growth , of social media as a traffic referral for many news sites today , being able to share content effectively is also a valuable skill to be able to demonstrate . And again , your potential employer may look to your existing online activity to see how well you are already doing this , Sevilla said . <p> For sites like BuzzFeed , which also include platforms where anyone can submit articles , such as BuzzFeed Community , they are also impressed to see you have already been getting yourself published on their own site . <p> " That 's the best way for us to see if people get it and can create BuzzFeed-style content that we enjoy , " she added . " We 've actually published some of it to our homepage because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic video , image and audio skills in capturing , editing and publishing are all useful additions to your toolbox . Late last month we published some best practice tips on mobile multimedia creation from documentary maker and photographer Christian Payne , @Documentally , and Sevilla added that Photoshop skills in particular are important for those coming to work at BuzzFeed . <p> Meanwhile Alison Gow said being able to exercise some multimedia talent would impress her as an editor . <p> It 's lovely when somebody comes in for an interview and they 've brought along a tablet or something they can show me some multimedia they 've doneAlison Gow , Trinity Mirror Regionals <p> " It 's lovely when somebody comes in for an interview and they 've brought along a tablet or something they can show me some multimedia they 've done , " she said , " for example , video around a story or a podcast they 've made " . <p> " I really think people who do that show that they have thought more deeply about what the journalist 's role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't want to detract from text ; 350 words of news story is sometimes all that a news story needs to be . But to have that added ability to do video - and I 'm not talking about Spielberg level video here - but just to have thought to take a video , and add to the way that that story is told and to embed it in that article , says to me that 's somebody who really has a skill that you 'd want to bring into your newsroom . " <p> If you are hoping to work at a broadcaster one day , video skills are of course incredibly important , and when also working online there are a number of different platforms at your disposal to share video in different ways , from a 6-second Vine , to a longer YouTube clip . <p> And being someone who is able to use their smartphone to gather video on the go , as well as fulfil their other responsibilities , is something that will serve journalists well , as Doble highlights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can have Instagrammed a great shot and sent it to my newsdesk , I can have done a quick interview and done something fun with Vine , all in the space of about 20 minutes , and then get back to digging for the news itselfAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " If I set myself up well on a smartphone , I can have Instagrammed a great shot and sent it to my newsdesk , I can have done a quick interview and done something fun with Vine , all in the space of about 20 minutes , and then get back to digging for the news itself . <p> " It 's a balance . We do n't want to waste producers ' time messing about with Instagram when they could be getting a killer line from an interviewee . I think it 's understanding that if you set yourself up and you understand the tools , you can use them really swiftly and then crack on . So you can have that digital presence while keeping to your journalistic roots . " <p> Fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also referred to the value of having a " visual awareness " as a journalist , adding that so long as this is in addition to " the core " journalistic skills of having a good understanding of what makes a news story , and the ability to write well , " that is going to give you a big advantage somewhere like this " . Newsgathering and fact-checking <p> One skill highlighted by Anna Doble as being particularly valuable , was having the initiative to be proactive in how social media is used to gather original news stories , rather than solely responding to what is being said on the platform . <p> For example , she explained , a journalist could make a Twitter list of local politicians from a specific party and put a question to them relating to a hot topic of the moment . <p> Within a relatively short space of time , purely by looking on social media from your desk , you could have a storyAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " Within a relatively short space of time , purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have a story , " she said . <p> " Using the power of the crowd to actually create a line , create a statistic , it might not be utterly scientific , but rather than just going ' something 's happened , someone 's said this ' , I think it 's turning it round , it 's inverting the root to the story and using it as a starting point . " <p> New journalists should expect to be asked in interview how they would find a story , Alison Gow added , and including both digital and non-digital techniques would show a diverse skillset . " Somebody who would include in that conversation , ' well I would have made a Twitter list from local councillors and I 'd be tweeting that I was new to the area and hashtagging it with #Liverpool and I would have already joined the Flickr group for the Liverpool city area , so I was talking to people on there ' " that says to me that is somebody who has really thought beyond ' I would go and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because all these people are on social now . <p> " You can make the lists , you can use Tweetdesk columns , so you can actually have those story sources coming in . Similarly , someone who had put in some FOI requests before they came , so as they were starting those FOIs were coming to fruition " fair play , that would be a good thing as far as I was concerned . " <p> Increasingly , in a world where people do n't answer telephones , double checking facts is very much onlineJohn Barnes , Incisive Media <p> As well as social media , journalists should also know how to use other online tools and platforms to contact and check facts with people , particularly if more traditional methods are not proving effective , as John Barnes explains . <p> " Increasingly , in a world where people do n't answer telephones , double checking facts is very much online , " he said . " So whether that 's using online resources , other websites , whether it 's using LinkedIn primarily as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tools like Skype . <p> " It does n't really much matter but the fact that people are able to use a range of tools to double check those facts , to make sure we 've actually got correct information , that we 're not misrepresenting anybody and we 're actually producing accurate , reliable high quality journalism , that 's very important . " Digital innovation <p> On a simple level , understanding " how to write for the web " is vital when going for a digital reporting role , Sevilla said . <p> And while potential employers are not going to expect all journalists in their first job to be digital innovation thought-leaders , they will certainly be impressed by those who can also think creatively about new storytelling formats , and the flexibility of digital platforms to deliver content in a variety of ways . <p> Doble said this is one of the key attributes she would look for in someone joining the newsroom " the ability to identify opportunities to do storytelling beyond standard structures . <p> It 's having the confidence to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ink , it 's not beamed out on a television set , it can be so many different thingsAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " It 's having the confidence to say online news can be anything , " she added . " It 's not printed in ink , it 's not beamed out on a television set , it can be so many different things . " <p> While having technical skills is a wonderful addition , it is " more important " to be able to demonstrate that " online journalism is a thing in its own right and not just a dumping ground for the newspaper , TV newsrooms of old " . <p> It is also important to have an understanding of the different ways to approach various digital reporting platforms , particularly in the social web , rather than trying to run with a one-size-fits-all model . <p> " We 're all guilty of just whacking out a link across social media , " Doble said , but added that " the key skill for somebody new now is to show they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own environment and distinguishing features , as well as the " user journey " and the impact that may have on the context experience expected on arrival . <p> " You 've got to think about where they 're coming from , what they are probably looking for when they arrive at your piece . And therefore one story could have 4 or 5 different looks to it , or different emphasis , depending on where you place it . " <p> The added strength of a specialism <p> Technical specialism <p> Having some form of specialism , such as an affinity for working with data , or even some coding skills , can give you that extra selling point to a potential employer , but the underlying reporting skills come first . Having a specialism is not necessary to secure a journalism job , but the point is that like many of the digital skills included in this article , they can help you stand out from the crowd . <p> For example , Alison Gow said just having spreadsheet skills and the ability to build visualisations gives applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " broad skills " of being a good journalist . <p> She also highlighted how specialisms can emerge once someone is working in a newsroom , pointing to former Wales Online journalist Claire Miller , who now works as part of the Data Journalism Unit at Trinity Mirror Regionals after her data skills got her noticed . <p> " She demonstrated absolute capability and expertise with data and as a result a job was created to make the most of her skills in that area , " Gow explained . <p> Such skills are certainly valued in digital newsrooms . Doble , for example , said " in a dream world I 'd absolutely have a specialist who 's purely looking at graphics and data all the time " . <p> Coding is also admired , but while some basic HTML will help you along as a new journalist , more advanced skills are certainly not expected in general . <p> " I do n't think new recruits should be panicking about learning to be code-heads , " Doble said , " because it 's a huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But a basic understanding and a confidence around interactive graphics and how to make basic things like Q&amp;As or polls , is a great skill , " she added , or at least , " knowing which tools to go to to make that kind of content " . <p> At Sky News , one recent recruit shone above the rest due to his abilities in data and coding , so having these skills is " a big string to your bow " , Jon di Paolo said , but stressed that this is only the case if the " core " abilities as a journalist are there . <p> " I do n't think you have to be familiar with coding and the back-end of things , but it does n't do you any harm , " he said . <p> " People like that are very few and far between because to be really good in all those disciplines takes a tremendous amount of work , and you have to be really disciplined to get to that point . " <p> But , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence together would n't get very far . " <p> On the subject of coding skills , Sevilla said that those looking to work in a start-up may find such skills are not required anyway because newer content-management systems will do " everything for you " . <p> At BuzzFeed for example , " we have developers already " , she said , " so if you are a journalist , you can just write rather than worrying about formatting your posts in a certain way " . <p> Barnes added that specialisms in " video , data journalism , audio " can be big positives in the eyes of employers , but for him the key is " being rounded and very practical " , along with a " keenness to learn " . <p> " Nobody 's going to be the finished article when they start , " he added . <p> Subject specialism <p> While for some people , their journalistic career lies in general news reporting , others may be interested in working towards a specialism , and becoming experienced in covering a particular subject or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new political reporter , and you claim to have a grasp on viral content , we 're going to want to see that when we look for you online and go through your Twitter feed and see the things you 've shared publicly on Facebook as wellCate Sevilla , BuzzFeed <p> And for those keen to zero in on a specific patch or niche , Sevilla highlights the importance of demonstrating that interest , and specialism , in your online personality . <p> " If you want a job being our new political reporter , and you claim to have a grasp on viral content , we 're going to want to see that when we look for you online and go through your Twitter feed and see the things you 've shared publicly on Facebook as well . " <p> Non-digital skills <p> While we have so far focused on the key digital skills that may help to give journalists that extra leg up as a journalism job applicant , there are obviously a number of other ' analogue ' skills , which are vital in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shorthand is a vital skill for any journalist planning on getting a job in the regionals , particularly " if you 're going for a traditional journalist job " . <p> The shorthand debate remains fiercely debated , but as Gow highlights , if you are likely to wind up doing court reporting , shorthand will be important . <p> " It is a discussion that 's being had more and more , " Gow added , " but if you have n't got your shorthand , a lot of newspapers will put your CV straight to the reject pile " . <p> She added that journalism-related qualifications that include key areas such as media law can also help get you onto the career ladder , even at a higher level than someone else . <p> " People who do the NCTJ , or people who do the BCTJ , or who do journalism degrees , come into newsrooms and they generally come in at a higher pay level , " she said . <p> Doble added that journalism qualifications help to provide " a very clear bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , understands the rules around journalism " . <p> " It 's more to just be able to tick that box and say this person 's clearly learnt the ropes and has proven themselves and presumably done some practical training that was part of their course as well . " <p> Once you are in the newsroom , being proactive , and brave enough to stand up and share your ideas or new approaches to something , is also something Doble admires . <p> It 's coming in with a fresh idea , a fresh way of working as well as the idea itself , and then just pushing and having the confidence to convince others it 's worth doingAnna Doble , Channel 4 News <p> " To arrive in a newsroom like this with lots of big names , big reporters who 've done loads of amazing stuff ... it could be an intimidating environment , however it 's not , it 's a friendly environment and I think the great thing you can do as a young journalist is come in and go ' look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories to be had , give me a day , and I 'll build you an excellent story about something that 's never been covered before by this team or is not generally part of the political agenda ' . <p> " It 's coming in with a fresh idea , a fresh way of working as well as the idea itself , and then just pushing and having the confidence to convince others it 's worth doing . " <p> Before even starting a job , Gow also encouraged new journalists to think about how they present themselves in an interview . <p> " If somebody can engage me and chat to me and make me enjoy talking to them in interview , which is a horrible situation for anybody to be in , they 're going to do it out on the streets as well , " Gow said . <p> Part of your interview skill is about how you sell yourself as a candidate , and Barnes said harnessing your inner salesperson is key for journalists in their everyday work as well , not just in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to convince somebody that you 're the person to share the information with , to actually get the story out of them , that ability to engage with people , to be a good communicator , to be very fluent when you 're talking , that ability to talk naturally and get on with people and be convincing and true to yourself , that 's what we look for because that 's not something we can teach you . " <p> I 'm very much of the school of thought that says if somebody 's got very good , core skills , you can train them up on almost anythingJon di Paolo , Sky News <p> And of course , writing and communication skills in general are a must . <p> " Obviously you 've got to be able to read and write , spell , good punctuation , " Barnes listed , adding that other abilities in the field of subbing and gathering images for stories are also now often falling to the journalist , so being able to demonstrate skills in those areas can also stand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the " core basics " beat any digital expertise . Journalists must have " a good news nose " , he said , as well as " brilliant written English " . <p> " I 'm very much of the school of thought that says if somebody 's got very good , core skills , you can train them up on almost anything , but the peripheral stuff , their familiarity with interrogating Tweetdeck for example , they can pick up here .

@@97847360 @2047360/ <h> A Snapchat news channel from ARD and ZDF aims to engage young audiences in current affairs <p> The German national broadcasters , ARD and ZDF , have developed a news channel on Snapchat to reach younger audiences with their coverage of news and current affairs . <p> Hochkant , meaning ' vertical ' , is part of a bigger initiative called Funk , which sees the country 's TV and radio stations use new formats to approach audiences under the age of 30 , who have been switching off from linear news bulletins . <p> " The stations decided to go where the audience already is , " explained Eva Schulz , a reporter at Hochkant . <p> " Teenagers do n't watch news on TV , and if they did , it would be some strange , old , anchorman in a suit , who broadcasts the news in a way that is not appealing to them . But news through Snapchat is exciting . " <p> The project , which started on 1 October , is primarily co-ordinated and funded by regional Berlin broadcaster RBB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial team in Berlin and three journalists abroad who work together to develop the format of the channel and the topics covered . <p> " We use a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate plans , discuss what is the most relevant topic for our target group for the day , and how we should cover it , " she said . <p> " We do n't have a fixed schedule , as we all cover different topics such as politics , entertainment and lifestyle , so we try to get the right person to cover the story in their patch , but of course that is not always possible . " <p> Between 6am and 9am , the journalists use pictures to produce a morning news summary of the five most important news events in the last 24 hours , but the rest of the day is played off the cuff , depending on what the headlines of the day are . <p> If nothing happens , we are not going to post nonsense . It 's not linear , so we do n't have a fixed schedule , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If nothing happens , we are not going to post nonsense .

" <p> Schulz found that when travelling around America , audiences were following her journey as she attending election events and interviewed members of the electorate . <p> " We do n't have the statistics as to where people are watching , how old they are , or whether they are male or female . But we get a lot of teenagers that snap us back and say they think it is cool that this is for their age group " they seem to really appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a ton of questions to us . After the election , I had many asking about their concerns and worries from the result , so I spent the entire day answering them all . <p> " It was exactly our intention to be approachable and close to youngsters who need the story to be explained in a different way . " <p> Among some of the challenges the team has faced over the last eight weeks is the fact that only one person can be logged into the account at any one time . <p> " When I was in the US and we had a six-hour time difference , my team had to call to tell me to sign out of the channel so they could do the news . Otherwise they would have had to kick me out without any warning , " Schulz said . <p> " You really have to deal with the Snapchat limitations , but in some ways , that makes you really creative and organised " we are all just intrinsically motivated and we are making it work .

You need to get them . " <p> Those are the words of Marianne Bouchart , a web producer for EMEA and data journalism project co-ordinator at Bloomberg News , which neatly sum up the importance , and opportunity , for journalists to get to grips with data . <p> In the 21st century , almost everything is logged electronically in some way or other . Making sense of the data is a growing necessity among journalists but , for some , that first step from the safe world of words to an alien landscape of numbers can be intimidating . <p> " I think it 's easy to get scared by data journalism , " continues Bouchart , " thinking , ' oh my god I do n't know anything about numbers and I do n't know anything about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start ? ' <p> " That 's usually the first impression you get when working on a data journalism project and the advice I would give is to forget about fear and just be bold and take this as a great opportunity to learn new things . " <p> So where do you start ? <p> Start with a question <p> If you 're curious , then that will lead you to the tools and techniques that will help you solve that problem and answer that questionPaul Bradshaw , Help Me Investigate <p> Paul Bradshaw , founder of Help Me Investigate and a lecturer in online journalism , says the first thing you need to arm yourself with is not programming skills or advanced knowledge of scraping , but a sense of curiosity . Approaching a set of data in search of a story is the same as approaching any situation , in fact it may precede acquiring a data set in the first place , and that is more important in making progress . <p> " If you start with a story or if you start with a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to the tools and techniques that will help you solve that problem and answer that question , " Bradshaw told Journalism.co.uk , " and then you 'll get a new question and you 'll learn new skills to solve that one . " <p> " In this case someone pointed out to us that bunting was very , very expensive and in fact we found one local authority which spent -50,000 on bunting alone , just on these flags , " he said . " This was a lead that led us off on the track to find out how much authorities have spent and how they spent it . " <p> So in this case , it was following the scent of a story that got the investigation started . Analytical tools and techniques were a secondary factor . <p> Teach yourself <p> " I think it 's essential if you want to get into data journalism that you have the initiative to learn things yourself because to me that 's the best way I 've learned things , " Bouchart added . <p> " To give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get new skills out of that and go on and do new projects . " <p> Because data journalism is a relatively new field , most of the leading lights on the subject are self-taught . The same is true for each of the experts we spoke to . <p> Bouchart had " picked up " a few basic HTML and CSS skills and had done some graphic design work before studying journalism at City University London , but when it came to JavaScript and more advanced coding techniques she taught herself , largely through scouring the web for sources of information . <p> Bradshaw worked in magazine editing and website management before moving into data and investigative journalism and , again , taught himself the skills he needed to find the answers he was after . <p> " It 's really not about learning scraping or learning JavaScript or learning spreadsheets , " he says , " it 's about ' right , I want to ask a question about council spending and in order to answer that question I might need some spreadsheet skills ' , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who recently joined the Times as a data journalist but prior to this was a Knight Fellow at the Guardian after a year at Scraperwiki , created her own role at CNN in her first job after graduating from Cardiff . <p> Having been given the " usual starting job " running errands around the newsroom , she started the DataMinerUK twitter account and began researching new projects and data investigations and finding out how they were made . Eventually someone higher up spotted her work and gave her the role of digital media producer . <p> " I realised there were all these online resources that were n't necessarily set up by news organisations , " she said , " but were just tools with which I could analyse and understand information coming out in a stream and in data format . <p> " So I started with Delicious and all these online resources for tagging things , finding tutorials , finding other bloggers that wrote about tutorials . " <p> Find a community <p> Just as Hughes picked up most of her skills and knowledge from bloggers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ultimately you learn from other people , " says Bradshaw . " Most of the things I 've learnt about freedom of information are either from other people who know more about it than me or because people have asked me questions and I 've gone off to find out the answers for them . So just helping other people helps you learn and builds relationships which lead to better stories and that 's really what we do with help me investigate . " <p> This may seem obvious as a journalist should be able to turn their skills to new topics as is appropriate , but the subjects you may cover as a data journalist can vary to cover a wide range of what would normally be considered journalist beats . <p> " We aimed to trace every single purchase of US food aid from the vendor , from the actual factory , the plant it came from , to the port outside of the US in it 's destination country , " she said . " What food type it was , how much it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split between the shipping records and the procurement records . We had to go and find all of these and match them up . <p> " I like it because it required a lot of journalism , it was grunt work in terms of programming but also some stuff had to be done by hand . " <p> Within a matter of weeks of the US food aid story being published Hughes was working on a different story around the Olympics , moving from a large , in-depth data project on global development to an analysis of biometric and sporting data in less than a month . <p> At Bloomberg , Marianne Bouchart regularly has to deal with a varied range of projects on multiple subjects " the WikiLeaks diplomatic cables , the Clearstream case , an analysis of trends among medal winners at the 2012 Olympics , co-ordinating with 40 media organisations in analysing data on offshore accounts " sometimes running more than one at a time . <p> To specialise or not to specialise ? <p> There is a huge overlap between the science and the artNicola Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say data journalism they think that 's one speciality in itself , " says Hughes , " but it 's like saying in school ' I want to do mathematics ' . They offer mathematics as a course but mathematics consists of geometry , algebra , topology , probability and those are very different areas . Data journalism is split almost like that as well but there is a huge overlap between the science and the art . " <p> There is no denying that Hughes is a specialist when it comes to the programming side - she teaches advanced data journalism " but she sees her experience working with lots of people and programming languages as a foundation to draw upon when the need to specialise in one particular area arises . <p> " Every time you do a data journalism project the turn around can be from 6 weeks to 6 months , " she says . " Each journalism project does n't use every spectrum of abilities , it does n't use all the JavaScript visualisation libraries that you can think of . It uses only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain extent when you 're scraping it uses a subset of libraries which you know , therefore you are very knowledgeable in those subsets of your own skills for those six months and the next six months when you get another project you have to use a completely new set . <p> " No person can keep up with all the developments in all the different fields . When I say specialise , you are relearning all the different fields . " <p> That is not to say , however , that coding and programming is the main area of expertise involved in data journalism . Paul Bradshaw believes that , although it is possible to work on a simple story by yourself , bigger and better stories are the result of working in a team and therefore anyone can be involved in some respect . <p> " There are all sorts of different elements to it which require different types of skills : some of it is about design skills ; some of it is hardcore programming , if you 're creating a tool for example ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Data Protection Act and the Environmental Information Regulations . So it does n't have to be all technical . " <p> If you arrive in the newsroom with journalism skills on top of all of these other small skills in statistics or an understanding of programming and how to use a spreadsheet " that is something really , really valuable I thinkMarianne Bouchart , Bloomberg <p> In the UK , FOI requests are often central to data stories , so being able to get the data in the first place is a very important skill , he says . Then there 's cleaning up the data , mixing it together in spreadsheets , creating tools for analysis , using visualisation and design skills , finding sources , finding case studies . These are the elements that build the story and being able to play a role ensures your value to the project and the newsroom on the whole . <p> Finally , Bouchart believes that dabbling in various areas is a must , so that journalists are able to adapt to each new project and what it requires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new skills , " she says . " You have to pick up some knowledge along the way and learn what you need when you need it to get to the next step in your project , get to something real as soon as you can . <p> " Then if you arrive in the newsroom with journalism skills on top of all of these other small skills in statistics or an understanding of programming and how to use a spreadsheet " that is something really , really valuable I think .

@@97847363 @2047363/ <h> How to : engage diverse communities <p> As a journalist you no doubt spend your day monitoring Twitter . " But if the only bit of journalism that you do on social is to go to Twitter , it 's just such a mistake , " says Ramaa Sharma , who is BBC Delhi digital editor . <p> " Twitter is great for beginners as it is open and everything is accessible to you " , says Yasmine El Rafie , who is development editor for social media at Swedish Public Radio . " Whatever you are looking for you can just do a Twitter search and it 's there . " But her view is that you should also look to other networks such as Facebook " where " you can reach the masses " . <p> In this feature we look at how can journalists reach out to people beyond their normal networks , for example using forums , SMS and other social networks such as Weibo , to find news stories and sources from different communities . <p> It focuses on gathering news and finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities in the UK , and also at newsgathering in different parts of the world . <p> There is also advice on thinking about the social networks and online spaces where you push out stories . Reaching diverse sources and audiences in the UK <p> The good news is that diverse communities are often active online , as Sharma says . " Ethnic minorities the world over seldom feel heard in mainstream discourse , so over the years minority and persecuted communities have taken to the web to feel visible , heard , and to take part in the conversation , " she told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " If their view of the world is not represented in the country they live in , it is not unusual for these communities to go where they can get information that is relevant to them and to connect with people who are speaking the same kind of language or have the same kind of issues as they do . And I do n't mean just issues to do with race , but also perception . Of course , it 's very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online . " <p> So what are the online spaces where people from diverse communities in the UK often communicate ? <p> Forums <p> El Rafie from Swedish Public Radio recently carried out a month-long research project at Polis at LSE in London during which she spoke to a researcher at LSE who told her conversations were taking place on a forum called Muslim Youth Net that journalists were rarely aware of . <p> " For example , postcode wars , how there would be a conflict between one neighbourhood and another neighbourhood solely based on the address , not race , not religion . " <p> The researcher also told El Rafie about " discussions on homophobia and gay Muslims " , threats which could be interesting for journalists to follow whether as a source of stories or to better understand the community . <p> Twitter hashtags <p> While El Rafie was in the UK there were several hashtags trending on Twitter . " The beauty of Twitter is you can follow whoever you want , or you can make Twitter lists , " she said . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trending " like #YouKnowYoureAsianWhen or #MosqueDayMemories or #AsianBoysLike " here are participants who are in some way related to the subject . <p> " Why not just go to the hashtag and add as many of them as possible to a Twitter list ? Then you have your own news agency that you can just follow . Mostly there will not be much difference in that list to other conversations on Twitter , but now and then you might get a discussion that you do n't have elsewhere . " <p> BBM <p> Another place where people communicate is BBM , an instant messaging service for BlackBerry phones . It was a means of communication during the 2011 England riots , where Paul Lewis from the Guardian and some other journalists working on the story followed the conversations taking place . BBM was also used in Egypt at the time of the 2011 revolution . <p> BBM was also highlighted by the web editor of Nigerian Watch , a newspaper for the UK Nigerian community , El Rafie said , when she spoke to him about how he monitored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook network and also listens to the " chatter " from BBM , such as conversations about DJ club nights and religious gatherings , El Rafie explained . <p> " I got the sense that the messages that move around in this group do not really distinguish necessarily between the diaspora and the community in Nigeria . " <p> Facebook groups <p> El Rafie also recommends joining Facebook groups , explaining some could be particularly useful to investigative reporters . One of the interns at LSE , who was helping out with her research , had worked with young asylum seekers in Denmark . " She was able to find Facebook groups where refugees from Afghanistan , for example , communicate . " <p> And when El Rafie was working on a story about growing up in a mixed-race household , she found a small Facebook group of people who " have a Finnish mother and a non-Finnish father " . " All of a sudden I had group of people I could contact for my story . " Newsgathering from afar <p> Journalists can gather stories and voices by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be thousands of miles away . <p> Initial contact could be via social or other online platforms , but what about areas without a strong internet connection and where smartphone penetration is low ? <p> Esra Dogramaci , who is now in London completing an MA in politics and communication at LSE , was involved in projects for Al Jazeera which gathered news from Libya , Uganda and Gaza via SMS and simple voice calls . <p> She said it is important to bear in mind that " Al Jazeera has a reputation for covering the voices of people who are naturally not included in the mainstream media narrative . " <p> So how do you access these harder-to-reach communities ? <p> Phone and SMS <p> In response to the Kony2012 campaign by the group Invisible Children , to bring Joseph Kony and the Lords Resistance Army ( LRA ) to justice , the Al Jazeera team decided to see what Ugandans in the north of the country , an area where the LRA and Kony had operated , thought of the campaign . <p> Working with the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to people in northern Uganda . <p> They set up local phone numbers and asked local radio stations to broadcast the number . The team also set up a number in Doha so Ugandans who were living overseas were able to share opinions too . <p> " We went through all the messages , filtering them for spam or abuse , and then plotted them on a map , " Dogramaci explained . <p> I think it 's increasingly important that we do use the web to get all of those diverse voices and stories out and then think of ways of presenting them in a meaningful wayRamaa Sharma <p> In November 2012 attention was on the assault on Gaza , and again Al Jazeera used simple phone technology to gather opinion . <p> " What we always try to do at Al Jazeera is get both sides of the argument , " Dogramaci said . " We wanted to have a look at how the bombardment was affecting ordinary people 's lives , both Palestinians and Israelis . <p> " So we looked at who were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find people on the ground and how this was really affecting their lives . " <p> She said the aim was to find out " if the narrative being broadcast by ' wider media ' was accurate " . <p> The team recorded the phone interviews , uploading them to SoundCloud . <p> Similarly Al Jazeera used phone and SMS services in the run up to last year 's elections in Libya , the first since the fall of Gaddafi , adding the voices to an Ushahidi open-source map . <p> Sending sources cameras <p> Al Jazeera also tried something that was done for the 2009 Iraq elections and with the Iranian uprising , sending Flip cameras , video recoding devices with a USB connection for simple upload . <p> The web and social teams sent 15 cameras to three major cities : Benghazi , Tripoli and Misrata . <p> " We identified people online ; bloggers , activists , people who were talking about Libya , and asked them to find ordinary Libyan citizens and ask them two very simple questions : would they be voting and what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the internet connectivity was poor so results were limited . <p> UGC <p> Newsgathering from afar is a necessity at BBC Persian , the Farsi-language website which is blocked in Iran , and at BBC Arabic . <p> Dmitry Shishkin , who is now digital development editor at BBC Global News and used to be at the World Service , told us the " two newsrooms are using social media to the best of their advantage when it comes to collecting and harnessing user-generated content " . <p> " With all of the events that have been happening in Iran in the last few years , BBC Persian has been riding the wave , " both using social media to gather news and to push it out . <p> As Sharma described it , for BBC Persian " social is not a luxury " , with core newsgathering taking place by finding out then verifying information from social networks . <p> Beyond the main social networks <p> UK newsrooms may focus their efforts on pushing stories out and driving traffic through Facebook and Twitter , but there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orkut was a key focus for BBC Brasil , as the platform , which is now owned by Google , was particularly popular there . <p> In Russia and the Ukraine VK is popular . " There the domestic social media network is much bigger than Facebook or Twitter , " Shishkin said , " And so the audience you get on VK differs from the audience on Facebook and Twitter and you are able to reach the audience which otherwise would not get onto the BBC News website . " <p> And China has one of the largest social media networks in the world , called Weibo . <p> " BBC Chinese is a good example of how you try to navigate and get to the users in a market which is pretty difficult to penetrate , " Shishkin said . " The key thing about BBC Chinese is the main news website is blocked in China . The BBC runs another BBC Chinese website which talks more about learning English and about culture and sport , and that site is permitted in China . So the team is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand . " <p> Ramaa Sharma , who has been in Delhi since February , said that it is worth considering communication methods beyond popular social networks . She mentioned that Yahoo Groups are regularly used there and that it is worth joining communities around topics . <p> Multiple voices <p> Sharma works with both the BBC Hindi service and the India index of the English-language site BBC.com , and said how the team finds stories that resonate with both Indian communities around the world and in India . <p> Sharma gave the example of how they gathered feedback on a story on planning in India , pushing it out to the BBC Hindi Facebook page and the @BBCIndia Twitter account . <p> " We found that both of those communities were saying very different things , had very different concerns , " she said . " The English-speaking community is global and was interested in India 's place in the world , while the Hindi community , with some people based in rural heartlands and small metro cities , was interested in 4G connection in rural areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had these two very different communities talking about two very different things , bigger picture and smaller picture , but by weaving that into a story together we can offer richer journalism , more inclusive of a variety of voices inside and outside of India and provide a better product .

@@97847364 @2047364/ <h> How to : impress commissioning editors <p> It 's difficult to gauge the preferences , interests and pet hates of individual editors . <p> So , in order to get that all-important commission , Anastasia Moloney asked Natalie Bennett , assistant editor at The Guardian Weekly , David Jobbins , assistant and foreign editor at The Times Higher Educational Supplement and Roland Flamini , former world section editor for TIME magazine - what they were really looking for ? <p> 1 ) What do editors want to see in a pitch ? <p> All our editors mentioned the importance of original , well thought-out ideas and a journalist 's proven track record to write well and meet deadlines as determining factors . <p> If a pitch is rejected once , however , do not assume that other competing publications will not be interested. - <p> Ms Bennett said key points were : " Originality of ideas and topic , signs that the pitcher can write , and that they have access to the necessary sources . " <p> Mr Flamini stressed the importance of including a catchy headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In these days of sound bytes it 's good to have a catch-phrase or a title that will stick in the editor 's mind . Something the editor can use to explain the story quickly to his boss ... and at the same time sounding as though he or she had thought of it , " he said. - Mr Jobbins emphasised the importance of making pitches newsworthy : " News value - is this something that our target readership is unlikely to know and would want to know , would benefit from knowing , or should know ? Currency also - a news pitch that hangs on events that took place some time in the past would be likely to be rejected unless a new angle is proposed . " <p> 2 ) What factors do you take into account when commissioning a piece ? <p> " The writer 's credentials and whether he or she is in a position to deliver on a promise and on deadline ; whether the story is actually there ; and if it is there whether it 's a good fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aspiring contributor to answer the question : " Why should I publish this story ? " said Mr Flamini . <p> Mr Jobbins explained that commissioning involves considering : " the broader news agenda at the likely time of publication - will the story work well with other proposed stories ? " <p> Commissioning an article also depends on : " whether a competing publication is likely to run a similar story before I can , " said Ms Bennett . <p> 3 ) What are some of the worst mistakes freelancers/journalists make when pitching ? <p> Editors cited arrogance , long pitches and failing to deliver what was promised in the original pitch as common mistakes . <p> " Over-selling - stretching the information known at the time to try to sell the story , then having to ' fess up ' when asked when aspects of the promised story are absent from the filed version . Arrogance - threatening to take a story elsewhere if the commissioning editor is n't immediately persuaded , " added Mr Jobbins . <p> 4 ) What are some of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start ? " said Ms Bennett . " Basic spelling errors , errors in names , bad writing such as using the same word twice in one sentence . " <p> She added : " Not giving the editor a clear sense of what the headline idea is going to be . " <p> A general consensus was also made about articles that do not answer the questions as outlined in the pitch and/or fail to deliver what the pitch originally promised. - <p> 5 ) So what 's a news piece - good or bad ? <p> " A good piece gives you the basic facts clearly and succinctly in one or two top paragraphs at most , so that even someone entirely new to the story understands what it is about , and then expands on those without being repetitive , " said Ms Bennett . <p> " The traditionalists will say a good news story gives you the fullest and most accurate picture in the shortest possible length , " said Mr Flamini . <p> He added : " A bad piece of news writing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject than you were before reading it . " <p> Debatable , depends on the style of a publication . According to Mr Jobbins , the difference between feature and news writing is becoming increasingly blurred . <p> " The old definition would be that news writing conveys factual information , hopefully of a more or less dramatic nature , of which the reader is not aware . <p> " Features on the other hand seek to convey context and meaning against which information can be viewed . <p> " The definitions are breaking down , news writing for print media has to change if people are getting their news from the internet . So today 's definition would edge the news piece closer to feature writing - the provision of the context for facts . <p> " While features now reposition themselves closer to analysis , " he said . <p> Ms Bennett offered this distinction : " Badly written news can be rescued by an editor as long as all of the facts are there ( and correct ) . You ca n't create a feature out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth sending an article on spec ? <p> " Only if you have an exclusive interview with Osama bin Laden ... " said Mr Flamini. - <p> " Hardly ever , " advises Mr Jobbins . " But a quick phone call or email might lead to an adjusted pitch that turns a rejection into a sale . " <p> However , Ms Bennett concluded : " If it 's good , and appropriate for the publication , no harm in trying . " <p> 8 ) How many words that exceed an agreed word count , if any , are acceptable ? <p> Most agreed that around a 10 per cent word overrun of the total word limit is generally acceptable . <p> " In my view , a bit of editing room is always useful , but without prior agreement not more than 100 or so words , " said Mr Flamini . <p> " More than 20 per cent , patience wears thin , " advised Mr Jobbins . " First off , you will likely only be paid for the agreed words , not for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk editor . " <p> " Editors ( the ones I work for excepted , naturally ) are very insecure . Anyone who can reassure them means that it 's one problem less to worry about , " said Mr Flamini . <p> 9 ) Anything else ? <p> Some publications have useful information for contributors about house style and pitching - essential reading before filing copy . <p> The Guardian 's style guide is also worth referring to : click here. - A must-read tutorial in how to construct news and features pieces , including useful vocabulary lists , is Essential English for Journalists , Editors and Writers by Harold Evans - a former editor of the Sunday Times and The Times . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> The Guardian , the New York Times and the Washington Post , for example , are doing so , but he added " by no means is that a wide standard " . <p> " What I hope happens is that other news organisations see how there is sort of an emerging standard and start to move towards that .

It is also worth noting that in the UK , the Press Complaints Commission does also sometimes deal with complaints relating to newspapers , magazines and their websites , although complainants are told by the PCC that they may also go direct to news outlets . <p> Setting clear workflows for handling error reports <p> To help secure a clear and prompt correction at the end , Silverman highlights the need for newsrooms to have already established a workflow for the processing of error reports . <p> " So where do those error reports go , who 's responsible for handling them and who makes a call on a correction ? <p> " If I was to pinpoint one place where news organisations are often falling down , it 's on that workflow because sometimes no one has responsibility so these correction requests may pile up and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at them . <p> " So if there 's one thing that I think folks overlook it 's that workflow . So create a workflow of where these requests come in , how they 're handled , and how a correction ends up being created and then pushed out there and publicised . " <p> At the New York Times senior editor for standards Greg Brock oversees the process , working along with his assistant and editors . <p> " We get so many queries and complaints , I could n't do it all myself , plus those departments are the ones that are experts on the story that 's being questioned , " he told Journalism.co.uk . <p> The process at the New York Times starts with the error report being assessed by Brock and his assistant to " decide if there 's merit to it " , before they are then sent on for the attention of the relevant department . " Sometimes we have to turn it over to the research department , because we do n't know the answer , " he added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the first step is to correct it online , he said , with a note at the bottom of the article outlining the error and correction . <p> " We never change a factual error online without telling readers that we 've done it , " he said . <p> It is then up to the department editor to write the correction for the newspaper " which is a little more elaborate of course than the online version " , which is then sent to Brock before being published on page two of the newspaper the next day . The page two corrections column is also posted on the website . <p> When to post correction note <p> Errors can vary from a typo or grammatical mistake to errors of fact . So at what point should news outlets be adding a correction note to the article ? <p> Steve Buttry , digital transformation editor at Digital First Media thinks this should be whenever it constitutes " a significant factual error " . <p> If it changes the meaning I think it needs to be acknowledged . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being fixed , I think you can just fix thatSteve Buttry , Digital First Media <p> " If it changes the meaning I think it needs to be acknowledged . If it was just an obvious typo that did n't make sense without being fixed , I think you can just fix that , I do n't think you need to acknowledge every single typo but anything that changes meaning or facts , I would err on the side of acknowledging . <p> He added that " it 's not enough to fix the mistake so the next person who sees it sees the correct version " . <p> " We need to acknowledge that there was a mistake in earlier versions . That does n't mean everybody 's going to see the correction who saw the first error but that 's always been the case . " <p> Silverman also stands by the same standard . " If it is any kind of factual error , even if it 's considered to be minor , you absolutely are going to add a correction to that article as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it is a typo and that typo could potentially create confusion for the reader or that typo introduces a factual error then again I think you need to fix it and add a correction . <p> " Where I do n't think you need to add a correction is if there is a small typo that does n't really change the meaning of the sentence , that does n't create a factual error , that does n't create confusion for the reader , then I think it 's okay to go in and just correct that typo . " <p> He added that when the typo is a name of a person , or company , for example , he would add a correction " because there 's a party that 's been affected by that " . <p> Overall Silverman recommends " erring on the side of adding a correction " . <p> Studies have found that people actually , they do n't lose confidence when they see corrections it actually helps build confidence because people know we screw up so we 'd better be acknowledging itCraig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for that is that 's just good practice , just good disclosure , it 's what people expect from us . But also , studies have found that people actually do n't lose confidence when they see corrections ; it actually helps build confidence because people know we screw up so we 'd better be acknowledging it . " <p> Echoing Silverman and Buttry 's approaches , the New York Times would also not " acknowledge or post a correction for a typo " , or grammatical error , Brock said . <p> " We reserve the corrections purely for errors of fact . " He added that " the policy is you never change a fact in the article without appending the note " . <p> When it comes to placement of the correction , Buttry and Silverman say that where possible it should be put at the top of the article , although Silverman notes that some news sites " append them to the bottom " , such as the New York Times . <p> The correction itself , and repeating the error <p> Update : As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is worth again highlighting that UK publishers would need to consider their approach in light of UK libel laws . <p> Digital First Media 's Buttry said that in a number of newsrooms he has worked in there has been " a spoken rule ... that we do n't repeat the error " . <p> But he said he believes that newsrooms should be " acknowledging the correction , acknowledging the error and that the acknowledgement needs to say what the error was . " <p> " I believe you should say what you originally said that was wrong , and say what 's right " . <p> He added that he also does not believe corrections should refer to " incorrect information provided by a source " . <p> " We 're responsible for the accuracy of our information . When sources give us information we should verify that information or if we just attribute it to them . " <p> But he added that when it comes to errors made to the article during editing , and not due to the reporter with the byline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think if the error occurred in editing I think we should protect the reputation of the reporter , the person whose byline is on there , by saying this was an editing errorSteve Buttry , Digital First Media <p> " I think if the error occurred in editing I think we should protect the reputation of the reporter , the person whose byline is on there , by saying this was an editing error , because credibility comes at multiple levels . " <p> Silverman also stressed the importance of clarity within corrections . " Too many of them are often really confusing or they 're written in a way where they kind of try to dance around the mistake . Just be clear about it . And that 's a better way to get that trust-enhancing value of a correction . " <p> Brock added that he has also experienced the philosophy of " you do n't want to repeat the error " in the past , but not at the New York Times . <p> Some of the errors are quite serious so it 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brock , New York Times <p> " Some of the errors are quite serious so it 's important to repeat the error and emphasise that that was not correct . " <p> Even in the case of potentially libelous content , as well as removing the content from the article , the Times " would still have the correction " , he said . <p> " Let 's just say we said someone was convicted of murder , and they had not been , I think the correction would say ' it is not the case that they were convicted of murder ' or something . We would still re-state it in some way . But those you have to be very careful about . " <p> As highlighted in the update at the start of this section , UK publishers considering their approach to this , such as when dealing with a potentially libellous error , would need to do so in light of UK libel law and may wish to seek legal advice first on the best approach . <p> Dealing with errors in quotes <p> Brock added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of online errors and corrections . One example was an error reported to him just before we spoke to him , which related to an incorrect year given in a quotation . <p> As well as running a correction , the question was how to amend the text in the article . <p> " Do you change the direct quotation from the person ? We have a strict policy that we do n't change quotations and the person did give the wrong year in this instance . So what we 're going to do in that case is we 're going to re-write the sentence and make it a paraphrased quotation , so that we do n't have to use the part of the quotation where the person misspeaks and uses the wrong year . " <p> Monitoring corrections and using accuracy checklists <p> In an effort to learn from mistakes , and try to avoid errors as much as possible in the future , Silverman recommends news outlets set up systems to record details of errors and corrections to flag up recurring themes . <p> " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada and the New York Times in the US , who actually maintain a database of the corrections that they issue so they can actually see ' oh , we really do have a problem with misspelling names and it 's actually got worse over the last three months ' . I think having the data is one way to start thinking about prevention . " <p> The model at the New York Times was introduced in September 2007 . Brock explains how it works . <p> Everyday when a correction goes into the paper the computer sweeps through the archives and pulls out every correction of the day and it goes into a database and then all these editors who write the corrections daily fill out the form and explain what type of error it wasGreg Brock , New York Times <p> " Everyday when a correction goes into the paper the computer sweeps through the archives and pulls out every correction of the day and it goes into a database and then all these editors who write the corrections daily fill out the form and explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation box of how the error came to be , what we 're doing to avoid it and then I am able to look across the newsroom . I know how many corrections we 've run , I know how many misspelled names we have . <p> " I know if we 're having problems with maths issues or percentages , if we 're having issues with historical facts , if we 're having issues with simply taking information offline without verifying it , because in the form it will ask you the source of the error and many times it will just be ' Googled ' , or ' checked a source ' . So that 's very helpful because the reason it exists is to see if we can pinpoint the types of errors . " <p> This information can then be used to flag up any problems relating to a specific individual , he said . <p> " It 's not to beat up on them , it 's to help them to try to determine what 's going on . And if they 're young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to better fact check . " <p> Silverman also calls for " a culture where the attitude is ' let 's figure out a way to reduce these mistakes ' , rather than ' let 's figure out a way to start punishing people and scaring people about making mistakes ' " . <p> One way to tackle common errors is to encourage journalists and editors to " create and use an accuracy checklist in their work " , Silverman added . <p> Buttry added that " most newsrooms that I 've been in have some sort of policy for documenting corrections and those sort of things " . <p> " So if over time we find out ' okay , we 're making lots of errors on names ' , we can address that either with training or with requirements of how you document that you spell the name and double check the name " . <p> Errors in live reporting : The importance of restraint <p> Silverman identified the issue of live reporting , and tackling the possible reporting of misinformation in breaking news situations . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right balance in terms of being able to share and acknowledge the information that may be passing around , but also at the same time to sort of maintain some standard and some restraint about it so they 're not in effect just helping spread misinformation " . <p> While it remains " an emerging area " , he had some advice for trying to avoid making errors in live reporting scenarios . <p> Look at the information itself and ask , first of all , is there potential harm or danger , or are we potentially helping really spread misinformation if we put this out there yet ? Craig Silverman , Regret the Error <p> " Look at the information itself and ask , first of all , ' is there potential harm or danger , or are we potentially helping really spread misinformation if we put this out there yet ? ' <p> " And I think a lot of the times if you actually just say ' you know what , we 're going to wait five or 10 minutes , and maybe we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contact these three people in other ways ' . If you put that little bit of restraint or extra bit of checking in , that can often help . <p> " In terms of when you decide to put something out there and say ' listen , we 're hearing reports about this , it is unconfirmed but we want a note for people who 've heard it that it is unconfirmed ' , the key thing about that is to understand that you have a real responsibility to make it as clear as possible about what you do n't know about this information and what the problems are , or the potential problems are with this information . " <p> The issue that remains , however , is the lack of control you can then have on how this will be passed on by a third party , such as on Twitter . <p> " You can put unconfirmed in all caps in a tweet but somebody else could re-tweet that and decide to remove the word unconfirmed because it does n't fit . And so you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put information out and you try to do the hedging and the flagging and all of these important things , understand that people may actually strip that out . And so in that sense I think a little bit of extra restraint is usually a good idea . " <p> Remembering a cross-platform approach <p> For news outlets publishing across multiple platforms , it is key for them to remember to ensure that corrections also reach those platforms and audiences . <p> Silverman said this a part of the process " where people often fall down " . <p> " If the error report comes in and it 's focused saying ' hey , I read this in yesterday 's paper and it 's incorrect ' , there 's often not this piece of workflow or the reminder there for people internally to say ' okay , we also have to get this online ' , and depending on the structure of the content management systems they may also have to go in and get a mobile version somewhere . <p> If you 're publishing in a multi-platform way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also need to be thought about and implemented for a multi-platform worldCraig Silverman , Regret the Error <p> " So I think that 's a very key piece of the workflow which is if you 're publishing in a multiplatform way , then your workflow and your corrections policies and procedures also need to be thought about and implemented for a multiplatform world . " <p> At the New York Times the placement of a correction online for an article which also appeared in the newspaper " sets in motion automatically a print correction " , Brock said . <p> And if reports of errors are made by readers on social media platforms or in the article comments , these are also passed to Brock . <p> " A lot of readers send in comments that cite an error in the story , but we do n't post those comments because the moderators do n't know if it 's an error or not and you 'd be surprised , many readers think there 's an error and then there is n't . " <p> Those comments are also flagged up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same process . <p> At the time Silverman outlined his recommended approach to issuing " networked " corrections , and the role of the journalist to not just put the correction out on all platforms the error was sent to , but to also actively encourage those who may have tweeted the original article to help circulate the correction also . <p> Buttry also recommended this approach , adding that while it is " impossible to un-ring the bell " journalists can " identify who else has re-rung the bell " and try and get their help in spreading the correction . <p> " If I make an error in a tweet and realise that , I can go back and delete the tweet so nobody sees the original one . I can send out another tweet with the correct information and a tweet acknowledging that I had it incorrect and saying what the error was , but we have an ability to track some of the people who have seen things . <p> " So I encourage , where you ca n't un-ring the bell you can identify who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's retweeted you and I think you should direct message them or tweet at them saying ' hey , I hope you saw the correction , please , since you retweeted the original , send this along ' . <p> " And there will be some people who saw the original retweet but wo n't see the correction , I get that , but I think credibility is so important that corrections have to be one of the things we take most seriously . I think we want to be diligent about it and transparent about it . " <p> ' Report the error ' buttons and forms <p> One approach taken by news outlets to try and aid the process for the audience when it comes to reporting errors is to provide ' report the error ' buttons on articles , or online correction forms , so they can easily raise awareness of a possible mistake . <p> The Washington Post , for example , offers a corrections button which then links through to a general contact page online . Interestingly , the Post last week sought to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post by Silverman . <p> A number of news sites within Digital First Media 's Journal Register Company also offer such a button , including the Register Citizen and the Morning Sun . <p> Buttry said while he did not think this was company-wide , " I know we 've highlighted what they do and encouraged it " . <p> " I think it 's probably pretty widespread but we try to give our newsrooms some local autonomy and have local editors ... so there probably are some who 've decided to handle things differently . " <p> Silverman said that providing " ways on your website where you actually encourage people to report mistakes " is a " really important " feature . <p> He also recommended " creating a place on your site " where corrections can be collected , " so if people are interested they can see all the corrections to recent articles " . <p> " One reason why I recommend that is the chances that people go back and read a piece of content again are pretty slim . <p> " So if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who already read that mistake to know about the correction ? <p> " And I think one way is on your site , to have a place where corrections are collected so that if somebody happens upon that page they maybe will see that ' oh , I read that article and there was a mistake in it ' . <p> On a final note , I asked Silverman about his feelings on the unpublishing of articles . <p> " Unpublishing is really important because I think there are times , particularly when it 's an egregious error or when something includes plagiarised or fabricated content , the first instinct is ' oh my god , let 's get this off our site ' . " <p> But he said this can risk sending a message to the reader that " oh , we 're trying to hide this , we 're trying to remove it and pretend like nothing ever happened " . <p> " So what I advocate instead of just killing the URL itself is to go in and update that piece of content " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe " a detailed editor 's note " explaining what the article was which previously appeared at that link and why it was removed . <p> But overall he said he would " really lean and recommend against unpublishing " . <p> " Most of the times it 's done it just creates this aura of ' oh , we 're trying to hide something ' or ' nothing to see here , please just move along ' " . <p> Update : As highlighted earlier , when it comes to potentially libellous content UK publishers would need to consider their approach in light of UK libel laws . <p> Note : This feature contains updates at several points in order to highlight the fact that the three interviewees included in this feature are based in the US , and therefore the need for UK publishers to consider any potential legal issues in light of UK law . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847366 @2047366/ <h> How to : verify content from social media <p> There are a wealth of questions , tools and techniques journalists can use to verify content from social media <p> The mass of information now available and being shared online offers a fantastic arena for journalists to engage with online communities and pick up on breaking news at the same time . This means journalists are also having to sharpen their verification and fact-checking skills in a digital environment . <p> This how-to features advice from a panel of experts on the key considerations , questions and tools journalists should have in mind when carrying out verification of content that surfaces via social media , be it a news tip , an image , a piece of audio or video . <p> The process covers three main stages : monitoring of social networks and the online community before news breaks , checking the content when it comes into play and subsequently reporting that content once verified . The comprehensive advice outlined in this how-to guide offers practical steps , specific questions and cross-checks journalists can make at each stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Storyful 's Claire Wardle outlined the different social media platforms on which content can be found , from Twitter and Facebook , where she recommends ' liking pages ' of certain organisations to gain access to a stream of related information , to YouTube , SoundCloud and AudioBoo for multimedia content . <p> " People think , ' how do you do this ? ' . There is a level of automation but a lot of it is knowing good people and knowing the people who are uploading the best content . <p> " That takes you half way through the process of verification , because you already know who this person is , you trust them , you 've spoken to them . So when they upload the latest video you obviously have to do the same checks but you 're halfway there . " <p> She also said Bambuser , which enables users to stream live video has " really come to the forefront , particularly around Syria " . She added that having built a network of users on the platform you can get " incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where they are " . <p> " The biggest thing is how do you stop your eyes from glazing over ? It comes back to old fashioned journalism and knowing who the right people are beforehand on a number of different stories . The next phase is to know those people who at the moment we do n't know . " <p> Spot and understand trends <p> Fergus Bell of AP added that a key part of the monitoring process is to identify trends which can be followed up . <p> " I use Twitter and Hootsuite , which helps me to interpret Twitter in a way that 's most useful to me . I can be monitoring what 's going on on social media on a specific story just by having a page up on my screen and I can take that away and use that on a mobile device . People might use Tweetdeck because they find that more user friendly , it is much of a muchness , it just depends on what your preference is . <p> " I like to use Trendsmap , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real world , so when I 'm looking at something I get some context about what I am seeing , e.g. why is this word trending in Paris and also in Newcastle ? It helps me understand where I should be looking and have I identified a story that 's worth us chasing . <p> He also emphasises the importance of effective searching on these platforms , such as Twitter advanced search , YouTube filtering , Hootsuite search or Facebook search . The platform he uses depends on the story in hand . <p> " I do n't use each tool for every situation , the tool I use depends on the news event , what kind of people are sharing information . If it 's a news event where there are likely to be teenagers there I 'll look in one place , if it 's likely that there were slightly older people or people with slightly older phone technology I will look in another place . " <p> Build a network of contacts before the story breaks <p> One way to reduce the stress when a news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted network of sources around the story or location . As Craig Silverman says , you have to " lay the groundwork " . <p> If there are particular geographic areas which you as a reporter are really focused on it makes a lot of sense to try and identify credible sources in these areas before the news breaksCraig Silverman , Regret the Error <p> " What I mean by that is if there are particular geographic areas which you as a reporter are really focused on it makes a lot of sense to try to identify credible sources in these areas before the news breaks . This goes to a larger point in terms of decision making in these moments , when the stress is there and the time pressures are there , we do n't function as well as we do when those pressures are n't in place . <p> " When stress is at a high level and time pressures are really urgent we usually go into fight or flight mode , and that 's not when we make our best decisions . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what really matters to a huge extent is what you do before the moment arises . Find those sources , reach out to them , build Twitter lists , build virtual Rolodexes , so you can go in and contact these people and see if they can help . " <p> 2 ) CHECKING <p> Apply the Too Good To Be True test <p> Paul Bradshaw says the ' too good to be true ' test is " the main one " for journalists to bear in mind when they are starting to verify material online . <p> If you 're about to leap out to start writing this up , just hold yourself back for a minute and ask yourself , is this as wonderfully news worthy as you think it is , or is there something else at work here ? Paul Bradshaw , journalism academic <p> " It 's just that gut feeling . If you 're about to leap out to start writing this up , just hold yourself back for a minute and ask yourself , is this as wonderfully newsworthy as you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? <p> " Beyond that it 's treating it as you 'd treat any source " where is this information coming from ? Does it sound like that person ? does it ring true ? And that 's before you get into any of the technical kinds of checks , it 's just that gut feeling . " <p> Silverman added that journalists " need to be wary of the one great video , or one great photo that seems to encapsulate an event " . <p> " News organisations have to be extra cautious because that 's when the hoaxers and fraudsters tend to come out . Be aware and beware of the amazing shot in a breaking news situation " . <p> Verify the source ( part 1 ) " speak to them and cross reference answers with social data <p> According to Wardle ( and the other experts ) " the gold standard we would always say is to try to talk to someone if you have n't spoken to them before " . <p> Before you do so , there are checks journalists can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct , such as by looking at location history which may be available on Twitter , or data about the photo and equipment used to take it on Flickr . <p> " When you speak to them you can check it reflects the information you got from the picture . On any type of information you want to do as much as you possibly can , the simplest things are just cross referencing . Does it match what they 've been tweeting about before around location or subject matter , on Twitter who are they following , who is following them , have they been listed by other people as somebody who knows something ? " <p> Location can also be cross-checked using Google Street view , she added . " Then when you get them on the phone , it 's about saying , ' what can you see out the window right now ? ' It 's about using tools up until the point , then can we go to the next level . You ca n't phone everybody , that 's why as the networks grow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you trust or you know they are there . " <p> Verify the source ( part 2 ) " look at social media history across platforms <p> Look for the history of that person , have they been on those platforms for some time , if so they are more likely to be that person . If they 're trying to hoax you the account is likely to be more recentPaul Bradshaw , journalism academic <p> " The obvious things to do is to look at that name on other social media platforms , " Bradshaw says . " Look for the history of that person , have they been on those platforms for some time ? If so they are more likely to be that person . If they 're trying to hoax you the account is likely to be more recent . <p> " Look to see whether the information on that account correlates " do they talk in the same way , do they have the same details ? Remember there may be more than one person with the same name , even working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses and phone numbers to search for users , " which are specific to that person " . <p> " On Facebook if you enter an email address in the search box that will take you direct to that person rather than using their name . It 's a much better way of tracking a person on Facebook . There 's also a Firefox extension called Identify which will very quickly bring up related social network accounts when you 're on a particular page , and Polaris does the same on Chrome for companies . " <p> Wardle also advises making use of the network . " When you 're dealing with a network you need to evaluate the network as part of your verification process " , she added . <p> " It 's not just about that photo or video , it 's about the person who provided it to you , who are they connected to and how have they been using the network to deliver information to you and prior to them sending this to you . " <p> Bell added that " social history " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone that we interact with in the process of news gathering have a social history whether they realise it or notFergus Bell , Associated Press <p> " I have a social history which shows I am a journalist , I tweet stories the AP report , it shows I am interacting with people who are sharing information , it shows I am exchanging information with people who are interested in journalism and social media and verification . That 's my social history and everyone that we interact with in the process of news gathering has a social history whether they realise it or not . <p> " So I am able to look at someone and say ' OK , this is where they have been in the past , these are the interactions they have had , this is who they are talking to ' . If they are showing some information from this specific location , I can see they have been there for a year , or lived there for a year , or been talking to other people in the same place about that story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd never just go on information shared in a tweet " . <p> " We 'd use it to direct our coverage but we 'd always seeks the AP verification before we were able to run with it . " <p> Use Whois tools to verify websites <p> It is not just users you can work to verify , you can also look into websites and online companies . Bradshaw recommends using a " number of tools called Whois tools " , which he said " will tell you who registered a web address , what physical address that person/company has " . <p> " These all paint a picture , they come together to give you an indication as to how likely it is that website is owned by the company or individual that it 's supposed to be . If the registration information is private then it 's likely to be an individual and not a company . <p> " If a server hosting a website is shared with a number of other websites then it 's less likely to be a big corporation " , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own servers " . <p> Use online tools to examine images <p> Wardle recommends sites such as TinEye , which journalists can use to perform a reverse image search to identify different versions of an image that may exist , a process which can also now do through Google Images . <p> You can also use the WolframAlpha search engine , she said , to ask certain questions such as the weather in a certain place at a certain time , to verify images or video . <p> Check for photoshopping or repetition in images <p> Another thing for journalists to look out for when verifying images in particular is " things like airbrushing and cloning " , Bradshaw adds . <p> " Spend a bit of time looking at the image and asking yourself , ' ' is the person actually in that place ' , ' is the light coming in at the same direction on all of the people/objects in that photo ' , does the weather match up to what it was supposed to be like ? ' , ' does the equipment match up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's badge ?

" <p> Harness online discussion boards and experts <p> And of course the internet provides journalists with a host of resources when it comes to others who may have experienced the same issues , Bradshaw says . <p> Journalists need to not just access technical tools but also the human resources available online and speak to people about the expertise they have that they can bring to bear on pieces of informationPaul Bradshaw , journalism academic <p> " Any problem that comes about online , it 's very likely that someone else has encountered that problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many tools and individuals online who will be much more accessible than they would ever have been before the internet , who can help you check the background of images or a piece of information . <p> " Sites like Snopes debunk hoaxes or urban myths . If you 're coming across a rumour , it 's quite often a different version of an old one . " <p> He added that discussion boards can be useful places to find others talking about the same issue , while specialists in particular fields or geographic areas can be found online . <p> " Journalists need to not just access technical tools but also the human resources available online and speak to people about the expertise they have that they can bring to bear on pieces of information . " <p> How urgent is it " could more steps be taken to verify before you publish ? <p> Silverman encourages journalists to take a step back when they find themselves getting caught up in the ' need for speed ' when news is breaking , and ask themselves ' is this photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so essential or urgent that we ca n't wait and investigate other avenues with it ? ' <p> Social media means information is out there so quickly and it gets passed around and passed around . There is a pressure to try and confirm that or to maybe miss out a step when you 're confirming it , but we do n't believe that 's the way it should be doneFergus Bell , Associated Press <p> " I would caution journalists in that moment to sit back and ask whether it 's essential you go without taking an extra step here or there . I think a lot of the time it 's probably not . There are definitely times I 'm sure when news organisations have to make a call , e.g. everything we 've looked at tells us this is accurate even though we have a barrier to getting hold of a person . Take a distance and evaluate " do we need to put this out now , or can we take hour or two and figure out what more we can provide to confirm or deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk to that person . Have you exhausted all avenues ? " <p> Bell agrees that accuracy is vital . " Social media means information is out there so quickly and it gets passed around and passed around . There is a pressure to try to confirm that or to maybe miss out a step when you 're confirming it , but we do n't believe that 's the way it should be done . We 'd rather be a couple of seconds slower but know that we 're right , than to rush something out because we 're caught up in the social media wave . " <p> One form of verification which has been used effectively by a number of journalists is crowdsourcing , asking the online audience to come forward with any information they have which can help to verify a claim or content . <p> Wardle said Storyful crowdsources privately but has not " done anything public yet " . " We are thinking about how can we do more of that , in a way that makes sense and is helpful , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> Silverman added that it is a " valid method " and offers " lots of wonderful opportunities " but " it is all about what you 're trying to confirm and what training you 've had to do it in an ethical and responsible way " . It can be " fraught with some serious potential pitfalls and danger " , he warned . <p> " You do n't just start throwing things out there and saying ' is this true ? ' , that 's not the responsible way to do it " . <p> He spoke about having discussed the issue with Andy Carvin of National Public Radio , who is known for using crowdsourcing in an effective way . <p> " What you 're seeing on Twitter is only one part of the process that he put together , " Silverman explains . " A really significant part is that he is on Skype with lots of sources checking things out in other areas , using the phone and Skype while also doing it on Twitter . <p> The old school device of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowdsourced verificationCraig Silverman , Regret the Error <p> " The old-school device of the phone is still incredibly essential when trying to do crowdsourced verification . " <p> And " things you do n't share are just as important as the things you do , " he added . <p> " When you decide to retweet somebody and ask whether what they 're reporting is confirmed " you 're making a big decision there . " <p> He outlined " two concerns to keep in mind " . <p> " Do n't just repeat what somebody said , find a way to rebroadcast what they 've said but place it in context of adding some kind of hedging to it " you want to add text to say ' this is unconfirmed , does anybody have any news ? ' A really core question in any verification is how did you get this information ? " <p> " Be aware that when you 're retweeting something , you need to make sure it 's not something so sensational , and so unconfirmed it could actually cause problems . Be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting this ? ' , realise that sometimes when people rewteet you , even if you 've been responsible in adding that context and questioning , they may strip that away just because of limitations of characters . " <p> This is " another argument to be judicious in the ways you put unconfirmed information out there " , he added . <p> 3 ) REPORTING <p> Consider any permissions and crediting which may be necessary <p> Bell said that when it comes to reporting material obtained from sources on social media asking permission is essential . <p> " Because part of our verification process means we have to talk to the individuals , we always ask for permission to be able to run that content . Apart from in extreme or very exceptional circumstances we only run something if we have permission from the person who has copyright for that content or that video , the person that has filmed that video , the person who has taken that photograph . <p> " When it comes to crediting we will ask them how they want to be credited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter handle . Some people want to be credited with their real name . We do n't guess on that , we ask them . " <p> Clearly communicate the level of verification this story has been given <p> Wardle said that an important part of the reporting process is being transparent about the level of verification which has been achieved . <p> " When we put out content you get the video but underneath we put about the levels of verification we 've gone to and then its up to the news organisation to take that information and warnings and then decide how it fits with their own standards . " <p> Made a mistake or new information come to light ? Issue a clear and networked correction <p> Twitter is forcing more news organisations to be honest and offer corrections when things go wrongClaire Wardle , Storyful <p> And the standard of being transparent at the time of reporting should continue when mistakes are made or material turns out to not be as it first seemed , Wardle added , with the Twitter environment " forcing more news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong " . <p> Silverman , who runs the Regret the Error blog in the US , has some detailed advice for news outlets on how to handle such corrections in " a networked environment " . <p> " It 's not enough to just put the correction out once in one place . If you put the error out on Facebook , on Google Plus and on Twitter then the correction needs to flow into all those places . <p> " But even more than that your job now is to promote that correction . Just putting out one tweet of a correction , some people might retweet that but Twitter is a stream and not everyone who saw the incorrect information is going to see that one tweet . <p> That 's the fundamental thing news organisations need to understand about corrections in the networked world , is it 's your job to promote it and to reach out and get it to spread out just as far as the incorrect informationCraig Silverman , Regret the Error <p> " So I strongly encourage news organisations to push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that once is not enough . They need to actively work to promote that correction . <p> " If you can identify people who saw the incorrect information either by retweets , or by likes , or by re-shares , then it 's your job to reach out to these people individually and make sure they see the correct information . <p> " The reason to do that is you activate the correction network , " he said . News outlets need to work to contact those who retweeted the incorrect information and ask them to retweet the correction also , he added . <p> " You 're now starting to engage the same network effect that pushed the incorrect information out there . That 's the fundamental thing news organisations need to understand about corrections in the networked world , is it 's your job to promote it and to reach out and get it to spread out just as far as the incorrect information . <p> " What really upsets the public is not when we make mistakes , that certainly gets on peoples ' nerves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tolerate is if we wilfully make mistakes or if we cover them up and do n't work hard to correct them .

An article in the Independent in November claimed that : ' from cyberstalkers to identity thieves , all kinds of people can find out all about you , and potentially wreak havoc with the results . ' <p> While there are certainly valid concerns about privacy , and identity theft is a serious risk when companies and individuals are not careful with personal data , it is misleading to imply that simple searches can unearth sensitive data about anyone . <p> When journalists are trying to trace people they are usually looking for contacts , case studies or trying to get background on key people . Sometimes , we may be looking for someone behind a company or product who does n't want any publicity . A 15-minute Google session often gives us enough , but if your search strategy starts and ends with Google you 're missing out . <p> We all know about expert finders ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often these are n't focused enough and they do n't help if you 're target is n't a registered ' expert ' . There are a range of other ethically sound and legal tools you can use to trace people online and find out more about them . <p> Identifying key contacts <p> You 've done your background for a report . Your desk is littered with cuttings and you 've talked to the obvious people - but you do n't have enough . Where else can you turn ? <p> Search blogs : those who blog on your subject may be , or may lead to , key people or case studies . Search for blogs or in blog posts using directories such as Blogger.com , Feedster , Technorati and for a UK focus Britblog . <p> Once you 've found relevant blogs and other relevant sites use Google 's " info : " operator . Type " info : " before the main url ( for example : " info:journalism.co.uk " ) and you can access the sites that link to it . Use that tool and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites . <p> Are the organisations or the people behind the sites not obvious ? Find them using a domain search tool such as Domain Dossier . Because all sites have to be registered this tool may give you vital contact details ; but remember that web developers often register sites on behalf of clients.Search Usenet : simply put , Usenet is the system that allows online newsgroups to exist and these archives can be accessed via the web . You can search hundreds of millions of posts to Usenet using Google Groups , which is the global archive of Usenet dating back to 1981 . <p> Access Google Groups ; find a group using your search term , find relevant discussions and authors . Google Groups also allows you to view all posts by one particular author . You can also search Google Groups for specific names using the " author : " operator . <p> Find and search mailing lists or listservs : Mailing lists can be goldmines of information if you have the patience to search for the right ones and then search their archives properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible . Use directories of lists such as Topica , Cata-List and the UK-focused JISCmail . Identify relevant lists using these directories and check to find out if the archive is open . If it is , you 'll probably be able to search it . <p> Use Companies House : This site let 's you search for details on two million UK companies and buy their accounts and annual returns . You can use this site to access a database listing every disqualified company director in the UK and , for a tiny fee ; you can use this site to ' monitor ' specific companies . <p> Identifying key information <p> You may have a name , or an e-mail address , or just a phone number . How can you access more information about someone online ? <p> Use ' people finder ' sites . There are dozens of sites that make a range of claims about their ability to track down people and information about people . Some are extremely useful while others are clearly less reliable . Those with some of the best free services include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK 's electoral roll . This means that with just a name and part of a postcode you can obtain the full address , phone number and the names of other occupants . It also has one of the best map services I 've seen . Type in a street name or a postcode and you can zoom in to the exact location . The satellite images are so precise the current image of my house shows the boot of my car is open . This site also allows you to search for a business by type ( in a specified location ) or name . <p> Anywho.com - is AT&amp;T 's people finder and without doubt one of the best for US searches . Again , it let 's you search for people or businesses and can link those searches directly to maps . AnyWho also includes yellow and white page information for dozens of other countries . When you find the person you 're trying to trace you can pay for extra services including the names of relatives , roommates and neighbours . Searches for ' nearby businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A useful option available on several US sites , including AnyWho , is reverse phone searching . This allows you to trace a name or address using just a phone number . Reverse searching in the UK contravenes the Data Protection Act so be wary of wasting time with sites that claim to offer this service for UK numbers - some do , but confine their search to a narrow range of businesses such as theatres . Even so , if you type the number you have directly into a good search engine such as Google or AlltheWeb then you may get lucky if that number is included on web pages or online documents . <p> Teldir - is a collection of telephone directories from across the world and InfoSpace combines an international phone search service with maps ; reverse phone options and a tool that let 's you search for businesses to within one mile of an address . This site also includes an e-mail and reverse e-mail searching . There is no single registry of e-mail addresses so e-mail searching is not reliable but , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you a lot of grief . Another site that offers e-mail and reverse e-mail searching is Addresses.com . <p> Search the ' invisible web ' : Books are written about this research strategy , it can be tricky but there are simple tools you can use . Search engines ca n't access entries in most databases but you can find database homepages or search forms . A simple way to do this is add the word ' database ' or ' register ' to the search terms you are using . For example , adding ' register ' to the search term ' UK Doctors ' in Google returns the UK 's GMC website that includes the medical register database of doctors . <p> The best way to search for databases is through content directories such as the www.invisible-web.net ( which is being revamped ) , Searchsystems.net and Buscopio . <p> Other good sources of information about specific people include : <p> The Land Registry , where for a small fee you can download information about title plans , owners and the price of the property if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly detailed local information including statistics on services , healthcare , income crime and deprivation . You can search this using full postcodes and access data on a local ward level . Obviously , you ca n't access information about individuals but the information paints a remarkable picture about where they live or work . <p> UK Planning allows you to search current and decided planning applications for free . <p> Combining tools <p> Combine search tools for the best results . For example , if you 're looking for the people behind a specific company look on Companies House and search using their names using Google or people finders before you talk to them . You can unearth surprising connections between contacts . <p> Do n't spend too long using one tool . Use simple search terms in a couple of search engines before you embark on a convoluted search . Recently it took me about two hours to track down contact details for a case study in Bermuda . I later found a simple two-word search in AllTheWeb returned those details as the second hit . AllTheWeb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google . <p> Finally , part of the key to online searching is knowing when to stop and pick up the phone . Before you rely on online search results , be sure they are correct . Map services can identify the wrong house using postcodes for example . Online searching ca n't replace source building and fact checking . A well worded question to an inexperienced receptionist or a quick call trawl through your contacts book can save hours online.

The short , and perhaps obvious answer to this is , treat online words differently from words going to print .

So I see news organisations moving towards the role of the analyst , " he said . <p> " It 's this progression towards ' slow news ' and long form which I think will make content such as virtual reality a compelling way to provide extra value that users could n't get anywhere else . <p> " Watching Hong Kong Unrest in a virtual reality headset gives the user a sense of what it was like to have been at the protests alongside police clashes , capturing small details that simply would have been missed with traditional fixed perspective cameras . " <p> Creating a 360-degree video comes with its own challenges , but get the fundamentals right and you will avoid making any newbie mistakes . <p> Choose a suitable topic Not every story suits the format of 360-degree video ; viewers must be able to benefit from the increased interactivity that virtual reality offers . <p> " I believe that the most powerful scenes that you can show in virtual reality are the ones which are recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once a 360 degree camera operator places themselves within the social or personal space of the story 's subjects , it 's hard for the viewer not to empathise with what they are seeing " he added , noting this makes 360-degree format work best with either intimate and chaotic scenes . <p> Get the right equipment <p> Camera <p> To create video for the virtual reality platform , you will need a compatible camera which is capable of filming 360-degree video . <p> Although Hong Kong Unrest was filmed on six GoPro cameras , there are more compact options available on the market , such as the Ricoh Theta M15 ( available for -199 ) or the Kodak SP360 ( -375 ) " both of which are compatible with YouTube . <p> However , Miller believes filmmakers will soon be looking for new technology to move away from action cameras , capturing scenes in higher resolution , with 3D ' stereoscopic ' depth " so watch this space . <p> Tripods/Boom poles <p> Whether you want to remove yourself from the frame , get up high to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need a sturdy tripod or boom pole . <p> Think about where you will be filming and the look you are trying to achieve in your footage . For example , Miller used a boom pole to support the cameras in Hong Kong Unrest in order to get them elevated above the crowd . <p> If you want to get adventurous , tripods such as the Joby Gorillapod Tripod ( -13.50 ) are durable and allow you to wrap their legs around a variety of objects " perfect for shots in awkward positions or out of reach . <p> For a stand-alone tripod which is easy to set up yet strong enough to hold itself upright against the elements , check out styles such as the Manfrotto Compact Action Tripod ( -59.95 ) " perfect for capturing the action in an instant without having to take too much time to assemble . <p> Boom poles are used for capturing footage up high and out of reach , and were used by Miller for Hong Kong Unrest .

" I have seen a great documentary that interviewed a survivor of the 7/7 bombs , " Miller said . <p> " The interview worked in that case because it was an incredibly emotional scene and it felt like you were confronted with the survivors pain . If it were just an interview at a conference for example , I do n't think it would have the same effect . " <p> Interviews within 360-degree videos will ultimately encourage the viewer to be intimately engaged with the people involved . " I guess it always relates back to who you are interviewing and what the emotion of the scene is , " Miller said . <p> Editing your video <p> There are a variety of 360-degree editing tools on the market ( known as ' video stitching software ' ) which vary in price and differ in the files they support .

Helen Kaut finds out . <p> " Children wo n't stop you freelancing , but they will make you poorer ! However , having less money for stuff is less likely to kill you than working all hours for an employer who cares nothing for you , " says Julian Rollins . <p> Mr Rollins did not plan to become a freelance when he was made redundant by the BBC in 1998 .

It 's not possible for other family members to help raise the children but over time they have made good friends with other parents and they help each other out . <p> For Mr Rollins , freelancing turned out to be a blessing in financial terms : " It has taken me five years to get where I am now . In purely financial terms I 'm better off than if I 'd stayed with the BBC and progressed to the next step up the career ladder . On top of that I do n't spend money on commuting and we can live in a part of the country ( Wales ) where property is much cheaper .

It allows me to take my girls to school and pick them up , to be able to take them to doctors when necessary or to see their school play without having to explain or make excuses to a boss , " says Linda Jones , owner of PR company Passionate Media . <p> Ms Jones left full-time employment as a news editor at the Express and Star to begin her freelance career when her six-year-old twin daughters Emily and Melissa were just eight months old .

We have made it a priority to be happy and recognise that does not come from material wealth . As work has grown , so has my turnover .

For example , if you have been on a journalism course , then it will be useful to list law , shorthand and any other vocational skills that you were taught . <p> Do not volunteer negative information - so no details on courses that you started but did not finish and do not list failed exams ( believe me , people do ! ) . <p> Hobbies &amp; Interests <p> The perpetual " reading and swimming " on so many CVs , made listing hobbies unpopular .

If you do want to state them , then include two named individuals , their job titles and companies . <p> If you are recently out of school or college , include one non-academic referee . Make sure you have asked if they are happy to comment on you . It is a good idea to send them a copy of your CV.The Covering Letter <p> Tell them why you are writing - is it in response to an advertisement ? Say where you saw the advert and quote any reference number as well as the job title . Why are you interested ? What can you do for the organisation ? What are your strengths ? Match the terminology used in the advert and job description . <p> Elaborate on your most relevant skills and experiences that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the job - do some research by checking out their website and finding out as much as you can about them ( see How to Prepare for that Crucial Interview ) . Demonstrate knowledge of their product , programme or publication . Keep your letter to about one A4 page . <p> Never , never , never come across as mass mailing . If you are writing speculatively , find an appropriate contact to address the letter to - check their website for contact details or just phone them and ask . I have received emailed CVs with dozens of names in the ' To ' box , and I have also received cut-and-paste letters where they have forgotten to change my name after " Dear " - it looks sloppy and unfocused.Finally <p> Here are some essentials to get the best out of your CV : <p> Print it off and make sure it looks good . <p> Spell check it . <p> Gets lots of feedback - show it to friends , family , trusted colleagues and people you network with . Ask recruitment consultants at employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , they will all have different ideas , so getting a good mix will help you decide on what is most relevant and what works best for you . <p> Focus on achievement and success but never be tempted to bend the truth - everything should be accurate , honest and factual . Double-check dates and details . Anything on your CV might be raised at interview , and some companies use agencies that verify qualifications and other details . <p> Keep your CV alive . Most people update it only when they are seeking a new job , they add a few details , update a few others . Tinker with it all the time . It should be about the future and where you see yourself going . <p> An excellent CV requires effort , time , is focused on the future and is adapted through getting lots of feedback . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847384 @2047384/ <h> How solutions-based headlines can encourage more people to click on stories <p> Solutions headlines are more likely to be clicked on by readers than non-solutions headlines , according to a new report released yesterday ( June 2 ) by the Engaging News Project . <p> The research was conducted in partnership with The Huffington Post and tested readers ' reaction to 50 pairs of headlines . The publisher randomly chose whether visitors to its homepage were shown a headline that emphasised a problem , or one which emphasised a solution " with both linking to the same article . <p> Doctor Talia Stroud , one of the report 's authors , explained that across the 50 Huffington Post tests , the solutions-oriented headlines gathered were clicked 56 per cent of the time , the non-solutions headlines attracted clicks 40 per cent of the time , and the two only tied four per cent of the time . <p> " For a journalist , this does n't mean that you are guaranteed to get clicks , but we do see that over many trials , it seems as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stroud told Journalism.co.uk . <p> Solutions journalism , which focuses on responses to entrenched social problems by detailing what is working and why , is also thought by many to help news organisations improve their reporting , by helping readers to see the whole story rather than just the problem . <p> An additional experiment also found that other factors affected the number of clicks received by each headline , such as including the word ' simple ' in it , or a mysterious unnamed location . <p> The research team conducted a survey-based experiment with over 1,000 adults in the US , analysing what attributes of solutions headlines heighten or diminish readers ' interest . <p> " We gave people a set of four headlines , with only one of them solutions-based , which was manipulated for what it contained , " said Stroud . <p> She explained that survey respondents would be shown a solutions-oriented headline , but half of them were given a headline containing the word ' simple ' for example , which was removed for everyone else remaining . <p> Participants were asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The survey revealed that adding the word ' simple ' actually depressed clicks , with more participants choosing the headlines excluding the word , but from a closer look at the Huffington Post research , they saw that six solutions headlines containing the world ' simple ' outperformed the problem headlines . <p> " We think that perhaps the word ' simple ' matters differently depending on the subject " so it might be fine to say something like : ' one simple way to help reduce your water bill ' . <p> " But to say a solution is ' simple ' for a problem like domestic violence for instance , may lead people to think that the word was inappropriately used . " <p> Additionally , they found that adding the word ' you ' in headlines did not have a significant influence on the click-through rate and the same results were found from adding a call to action , such as ' This is a problem . Here 's how to help . ' <p> The team found that including a mysterious location increased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious plan to restore wildlife in the wetlands ' , which encouraged the reader to find out the location . <p> " I think that if you are in a situation where you have a solutions story that is confined to a certain geographic location , there is some utility to making it more ambiguous so people have to click through to uncover the information , " Stroud said . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Now those benighted days are way behind us and extracting stories out of data is part of every journalist 's toolkit of skills . <p> Some people say the answer is to become a sort of super hacker , write code and immerse yourself in SQL . If you decide to take that approach , you can find a load of resources here . But a lot of the work we do is just in excel and that 's what I 'll deal with here . <p> Of course , you could just ignore the whole thing , hope it 'll go away and you can get back to longing to write colour pieces . But if you 're interested in generating great news stories from the " tsunami of data " being released by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 1 ) Sourcing the data <p> This is a much undervalued skill - with many journalists simply outsourcing it to research departments and work experience students . You ca n't imagine doing that with key interviews for a crucial piece , yet key facts are often treated appallingly . You can do worse than start with http : **25;182;TOOLONG - we 've already done the work of identifying and cleaning up hundreds of datasets from carbon emissions , via crime rates to Bafta winners . Alternatively , I have a Delicious feed where I link to datasets - you can find that at http : **29;209;TOOLONG <p> But broadly , the general approach is to look for the most authoritative place for your data . Here are a few very specific examples : <p> GDP - from the Office for National Statistics . There are loads of different definitions of GDP . You probably want inflation-adjusted , which has the label : ABMI . You can find that at this link . It should be pointed out that the ONS has incredible info on this site - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get GDP refined into an easier form on the Guardian datablog here . <p> Adobe PDF files are the enemy of open data . Often files are published as PDFs to make them as inaccesible as humanly possible . Tables on pages can sometimes be extracted using Adobe Professional ( which has an option if you highlight the table and control-click it ) . Often it 's simpler to use a basic programme like Text Wrangler to access the data . <p> If a table 's published on a web page , one thing worth trying is saving the web page as html " and then opening it in Excel , which then opens its as a table . <p> And even when data is published in spreadsheet ( or CSV ) form , it often comes in from respected sources in a right-old state . The Office for National Statistics , for instance , is fond of inserting hidden columns and blank lines into excel that serve no purpose but to make the data harder to analyse . The answer is to copy the data out , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data into it as ' values ' " then you an work out where those troublesome lines are . <p> 3 ) Keep the codes <p> Often official data comes with the official codes added in " for instance , each school , hospital , constituency and local authority has a unique identifier code . Countries have them too ( the UK 's code is GB , for instance ) " you can get them directly from the ISO at this link . They 're useful because you may want to start mashing datasets together and it 's amazing how many different spellings and word arrangements can get in the way of that . There 's Burma and Mayanmar , for instance , or Durham , City of compared to City of Durham . Codes allow compare like with like . <p> There 's a useful function that will help you with this " VLOOKUP in excel allows you to bring datasets together " it looks for the value in one sheet and brings in the results from another.4 ) Other useful functions and formulas <p> PIVOT TALE REPORTS " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times something comes up , aggregate data or work out averages .

@@97847387 @2047387/ <h> 9 ways to hone a headline to perfection <p> Headline writing has always been an elusive art and the nature of the web and social media in particular " in that the headline is not necessarily contextualised by surrounding stories or images , as in print " has changed the game . Choose around ten words from over a million to accurately , succinctly and attractively portray a story . Go . <p> Here are some guidelines for headline writing " both on the web and in print " but if you have more tips and pointers to share then feel free to do so in the comments . <p> 1 . Remember the basics <p> Grammar can take a bit of a back seat in headlines ; the aim here is to quickly convey the key information in the article while giving the reader a reason to read on . <p> With that in mind , auxiliary verbs and articles can often be cut out and many words can be replaced with punctuation " a comma instead of ' and ' , a colon instead of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active . <p> Also : single quote marks for quotes in a headline and only capitalise the first word or after a colon . Here at Journalism.co.uk ( and elsewhere ) we write numbers as figures , not words . Numbers are important , as we will discuss later , but a figure is quicker to read than a word in a headline . <p> The BBC is often credited with having consistently tight headlines , as Jakob Nielsen , co-founder of the user-experience research company the Nielsen Norman Group , explains in this blog post . <p> Nielsen puts the BBC 's experience in radio and Ceefax as the main cause for their journalists ' consistently accurate brevity . Headlines across the news section of the website average out at six words each , seeing through the finer details of a story to deliver its core to the reader . <p> Nielsen recommends visiting " the site daily for a week and try to apply some of the BBC editors ' discipline to your own headlines " . <p> There is a little more leeway online than the stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to keep things short . This online thesaurus offers up shorter synonyms for headlines , should the need arise . <p> 3 . Verbs <p> Copywriters everywhere will recognise the mantra to " let the verbs do the work " ; a good verb can transform the meaning of a sentence and bring it to life . This can be particularly true for sports stories but are equally applicable to any field where a bit of descriptive variation can elevate a headline . <p> Sorry Arsenal fans , but the following are increasingly vivid examples of a headline after a recent English Premier League match : <p> Other words that apparently drew a lot of interaction were ' fear ' , ' dark ' , ' bleeding ' and ' war ' , and while taking such a darker tone in a headline will not always be relevant to a story , a more negative angle can be more effective when it comes to shares , she said . <p> " ' Why Facebook is not a social company ' or ' Why Facebook is an enterprise company ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one . The words ' no ' , ' without ' and ' stop ' lead to many more shares . " <p> And in the age of social media dominance , shares are just as important as clicks . So ... <p> 4 . Social media optimisation <p> Finding effective patterns or strategies in social media is the subject of entire conferences but the basic aim is to make it noticeable and shareable . <p> The first factor should be the physical length of a tweet , leaving enough space for comments , retweets or shares . Around 100 characters should be a maximum in that respect , although Zarella 's research suggests that slightly longer tweets may be better in terms of click-through rate , with links placed earlier . <p> " Whenever we encounter new information , our brains immediately try to make sense of it , " wrote Maria Konnikova in The New Yorker last year , giving one of a number of reasons " why our brains love lists " . <p> The phenomenon of ' listicles ' may be infuriating to some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and understand new information . Headlines work in a similar way . <p> 6 . Make it surprising <p> The basic human traits of surprise and curiosity rule our behaviour in more ways than we are aware of and despite the wonders of modern technology we are still essentially monkeys looking for the next banana . <p> In a 2001 study , scientists squirted either fruit juice or water into the mouths of willing participants in a predictable or unpredictable pattern , finding that the surprise factor lit up more " pleasure centres " in the brain than the participants preference for juice . <p> News organisations should refrain from over gilding the lily , such as ending headlines with " YOU 'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT " , when the reader could easily do so . This sort of ' build up ' should probably be avoided altogether for serious news reports , but the ' curiosity gap ' theory is a useful idea to bear in mind for lighter content . <p> Pique the reader 's interest and give them a ( real ) reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEO ) <p> Headlines in print have a visual context , either in their placement near other relevant stories or by a picture . Search engines have no idea about context , so you need to spell it out for them , making the keywords glaringly obvious . <p> Susan Steade , online news producer for San Francisco 's Bay Area News Group , likes to go by the " mullet model " of headline writing for SEO : " business up front , party in the back " . <p> " It can be broken down to three best practices , " she told Steve Buttry , digital transformation editor at Digital First Media , for a post on his blog in November . " Know what people are searching for , get those search terms up front , play up the hot angle . " <p> Steade 's final point , to " play up the hot angle " , is specific to each publication so it is important to ... <p> 8 . Tailor it to your audience <p> When a large story breaks , all major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment pieces and op-eds specifically suited to what their audience like and expect . The same should apply for every story " the tone , angle and content should all be targeted at your readers . <p> The cherry on top of your deliciously-moulded , audience-specific story cake is the headline , not just for SEO , but for social media and general browsing . Know what tickles your audience 's tastebuds and give them what they want , how they want it . <p> 9 . Test , test , test <p> At Upworthy , the editorial strategy dictates that a writer must come up with 25 headlines for every article . <p> Not everyone has the time or desire to write so many but a process of trial and error should be built in to finding out what kind of headlines work for your audience . <p> That may mean writing a number of different headlines for one story and seeing which gets the most reaction online . Tweeting a story at the same time on different days with different headlines may give you an idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

One is to use the ' Write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you 've logged in . The other is to use the homepage editor and start typing into the space at the top of the page . <p> Neither way is better than the other , but the second is a recently introduced feature to encourage shorter stories and faster publishing , with stripped-down formatting options and the ability to publish a story in just one click . <p> This guide will focus on the full-screen editor accessible via the button in the top-right corner . <p> Your story will auto-save every few seconds as you write , leaving you to get on with the most important part " getting those words down . <p> All formatting and alignment options are available when you select text , and you can add a bulleted list by typing a dash or asterisk , writing your first point and hitting return . To create a numbered list , use a " 1 " followed by a full-stop instead of a dash . <p> To see previously saved versions of your piece , there 's an ' Edit ' and ' History ' option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you write , you 'll notice a plus sign appear whenever you hit the return key . Hover over it and four multimedia options will appear : add a photo ; add a video ; add an embed code ; add a new chapter or ' part ' . <p> As well as cover photos , Medium supports six different image styles for inline images , from a small inset to the left of your text to full width . <p> Full-width images have the same dimensions as a cover image ( 1400 x 1120 pixels ) , and Medium recommends a 900 pixels width on inline images to make sure they display across devices , but they can be whatever length you like . Experiment to see which image styles work best with your story and vary them to hold the reader 's interest . <p> You can add a caption to your image by clicking it so that a green border appears . To remove an image , simply select it and hit the delete key on your keyboard . You can also add a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' K ' on Mac or ' Control ' and ' K ' on PC . <p> You can also add a grid of images to your story by selecting multiple images using the picture upload tool . Bear in mind that the last image you select will be the first to appear within the grid . <p> To add a video to your story , simply copy and paste a link from YouTube , Vimeo or Vine into Medium . Click the player to choose alignment or add a caption . <p> Note that embedded video will not play until your story is published . <p> The embed code option " &lt;&gt; " also allows you to add media from other sites such as Twitter and Instagram . <p> You can also divide up longer sections of text by inserting a break using the ' add a part ' option ( which looks like this " -- " ) , sometimes used to make paragraphs stand out or signpost a change of subject . <p> Sharing drafts <p> Medium is designed for collaborative writing , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before publishing . <p> People can leave you feedback notes by selecting the section of text they wish to comment on and clicking the plus button " + " that appears . Notes can be public or private , and you can reply to them if you wish . <p> You can also use notes to leave yourself reminders about a story you are in the process of working on . <p> So you 've written your story and are ready to share it with the world , or maybe just a few select people . <p> Once you hit ' Publish ' you 'll get the listing editor which affects how your story will appear across Medium streams for top stories , staff picks and tag pages ( more on those later ) . <p> Editing your title and/or subtitle in this section will not affect your actual story , so consider experimenting with different wording from your original piece to really make your story stand out . <p> Note : Although you do not need to include a title in your actual story , you do need one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listing editor you can also add up to three tags to your story to make it more discoverable . Your story will then appear in the ' Latest ' tab on the relevant tag page , and if it gets a lot of ' Recommendations ' from other readers it will be upgraded to the ' Top ' tab . <p> If you want to publish your story but do n't want it to be discoverable across Medium , you can use unlisted publishing . <p> These stories will only be viewable to anyone who has the direct link , and your followers will not be notified that you 've published something . <p> Simply select ' unlisted ' in the listing editor right before the point of publishing . <p> A couple of weeks ago Medium announced a major update to its iOS app , allowing users to write and publish stories from their iPhone or iPad . However , some features , such as sharing and editing drafts , are not yet available for mobile . <p> Sharing your story <p> You can share your story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon at the bottom of the screen . Alternatively , highlight a section of text and click the Twitter icon to generate a text screenshot which is automatically attached to a tweet . <p> You can also embed your Medium story into an existing website using the down arrow which appears next to the ' Share ' button . <p> Another option is to add your story to a Publication , essentially a collection of stories around a particular topic of theme which have custom layout options . Some news outlets , such as Reported.ly , are using Publications as a home for their reporting . <p> You must be an invited writer to submit a story to a Publication , or you can create your own by clicking your avatar in the top right of the screen and clicking ' Publications ' , then ' New Publication ' . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> So if you 'd like to get in on the action and take your news organisation onto Snapchat , what do you need to be aware of ? Take note of Lee 's five-point checklist below before you get started . <h> 1 . Define your strategy <p> " First establish why you are on Snapchat and what you specifically want to use the app for , " he said . <p> " You ca n't take a video from YouTube that you 've spent months crafting , or your carefully picked Instagram pictures and expect them to work on Snapchat . The content has to be completely different , so have a purpose for it . " <h> 2 . Make your content fun <p> " Users of Snapchat expect to see content that looks like something a friend would send them , such as material with a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a connection with your audience , " he said . <p> Lee explained that as Snapchat is an informal platform that let 's users tell stories in a raw , creative way , news organisations should utilise the ability to draw on pictures , take selfies and add emojis to their material in order to build a relationship with their audience and give them something a little different from what they are used to seeing from publishers . <p> BBC Business has been using Snapchat to hook audience 's attention with guessing games <h> 3 . Find your superstars <p> " If you are running the account yourself , and do n't feel comfortable on camera , find other people in your organisation that can take it over or run it with you , " he said . <p> With the rise in popularity of mobile journalism , reporters are now more likely to be expected to produce pieces to camera , and coverage of an event as it is taking place . <p> As users can re-record video before they publish it , Snapchat may be an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they start livestreaming on Facebook Live or apps such as Periscope . <p> However , Lee explained it is important for those presenting any coverage to be authentic , and to show that they love the platform as much as the audience does . <p> For publishers just starting out , he suggested using " superstars , " people that are great on camera and comfortable with the tool , to connect with the audience . <h> 4 . Use your other platforms <p> " Snapchat is very much a closed system " you ca n't find brands within the app so you have to do a lot of work to get your account noticed , " he said . <p> Publishers should use their account 's Snapcode " that 's the profile image people can use to add each other " on their other social media accounts , even for a short period , to grow their audience quickly and let people know they are on the social platform . <p> By using Snapchat Memories , journalists can download their stories and then repost them elsewhere , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of their material and save themselves having to produce multiple packages for different platforms . <p> Hindustan Times use the platform in a variety of ways <h> 5 . Use all the tools available <p> " Snapchat also let 's you message your contacts , so why not send a personal greeting to the first 50 people who follow you ? <p> " It 's not time-consuming , it takes five-ten seconds to thank them for following you , but from a user perspective , you are making an effort to connect with them and value their attention , " said Lee . <p> Additionally , news organisations along with individual users can easily purchase on-demand geofilters for a news story or event that they are covering , to be used by themselves or those near them . <p> Lee explains geofilters make content much more personalised and make it easier for audiences to engage with your material , as well as offer them the opportunity to tell the stories from their own perspective , using the graphics personalised to your publication . <p> " Do n't use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gain more attention for your work , " he said . <p> " You need to think what the added value of your geofilters would be , and how they could persuade users to take their content off Snapchat and put them onto their own social media .

@@97847396 @2047396/ <h> 10 simple steps to being a more organised freelancer <p> If you work for yourself then being well organised is essential , but it does n't come naturally to everyone . If you 're one of the world 's less efficient or orderly individuals , fear not " it 's easy enough to learn a few simple strategies . <p> 1 . Organise your emails <p> It 's virtually impossible to keep track of the dozens - if not hundreds - of messages you probably receive in a week unless you are careful to separate them out . Create folders for the different subjects you write about : one for ideas , another for commissions , pitches , submitted copy , images and so on . Sort emails as you go along " at least once a day " and delete those that are no longer needed so as to avoid clutter . <p> 2 . Classify your contacts <p> You may love your paper address book but online contacts systems allow for easy searching , multiple categorisation and all sorts of other useful things . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you could choose an online version such as FullContact . You can even get apps that scan business cards and import data automatically . <p> Add everyone and anyone you meet or talk to , whether expert , case study , PR or celeb . The important thing is to include as many relevant key words as possible to make searching easier - use the notes ' section and be as detailed as you can . 3 . Set up Google alerts <p> Keeping up-to-date with your specialist subject area , not to mention the news in general , is vital for a freelancer . <p> Save time by setting up Google alerts , which will send stories straight to your inbox based on selected keywords e.g. new study health ' or percentage women UK ' . <p> You can narrow your search by region or category ( e.g. news sources , blogs , discussions , videos ) , and choose how many results you receive and how often . <p> 4 . Aggregate RSS feeds <p> RSS feeds from important online sources ( anyone who produces research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news gathering . <p> These can be organised through a feed aggregator such as Feedly , NewsBlur or Netvibes , each of which offer different options for organising and displaying your feeds . Some also have an offline reader mode , which is handy if you spend any time in WiFi blackspots . <p> 5 . Set reminders <p> Your diary is most likely packed with meetings , interviews , deadlines and so on , which makes it hard to juggle everything and not let an appointment slip through the net . <p> Using an electronic diary " ideally on your phone , which you can keep close by whenever you 're working " means you can set reminders ( more than one if necessary ) at relevant moments to jog your memory and ensure you get everything done on time . <p> 6 . Track your pitches <p> You do n't need to be an IT whizz to create a simple spreadsheet to help you track your pitches . Just create columns for date sent , publication targeted and idea pitched , as well as a couple of columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a final one for whether you got the commission or not . <p> Use the colour fill ' option to code each line - red for no , green for yes and no fill ' if you 've not heard back yet . If you really ca n't face a spreadsheet , create something similar in a dedicated notebook . <p> 7 . Keep tabs on commissions <p> Once you 've got a commission , transfer it to a separate list of commissions so that you never miss a deadline . Arranging your list with the most urgent piece first , include publication name , story and word count along with the deadline date , and again use colour to show whether a piece is upcoming , in progress or finished . <p> You can also include a column for the agreed fee so that each time you finish a piece you can invoice without having to go back and check your commissioning email for details . <p> 8 . Log your income and outgoing <p> This is vital for freelancers , and you 'll be glad of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your self-assessment return . <p> There are many options available , from simple spreadsheets to full-on accounting systems . Make sure you keep a note of invoice number , date , amount , the nature of the work as well as when it was paid . <p> Likewise , keep track of your monthly expenses , filing each month 's receipts in a marked-up envelope - you could also log these on a spreadsheet or in a notebook , categorising them as you go e.g. travel , catering , supplies and so on , which will save time when doing that tax return . <p> 9 . Keep a tax account <p> This is worth a point of its very own , as there 's nothing worse than getting a tax bill and not having the money to pay it . <p> Whatever system you choose for monitoring your invoices , as soon as a payment is made try to set aside at least 20 per cent in a dedicated high-interest account or ISA " 30 per cent is even better , especially if you have student loans to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when it comes time to pay the taxman , you might even find that you have some left over . <p> 10 . Schedule in me time ' <p> This may not sound like a vital part of a freelancer 's life but burnout is common among journalists , especially freelancers , who are constantly pushing themselves to get more work and do n't have the benefits of a team around them . <p> Keep a firm grip on your diary and make sure there are times for you to sit back and reflect , relax , see other people and generally keep your well-being in check . <p> After all , you wo n't be very efficient if you 're signed off with stress , will you ? 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Therefore he recommends using FilmicPro , Videon , VideoPro Camera ( which is called @VideoProApp on Twitter ) and Voddio to enhance its capabilities . <p> Independent digital producer and publisher Adam Westbrook , also spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step up in terms of what is available for journalists . <p> " It has a lot more manual controls " for example , exposure and audio monitoring " which until now others have been missing . " Choosing the right lengthof video <p> One of the key distinguishing features between video apps is length . Vine only lets you create six-second clips , but if you 're live streaming on Bambuser you can keep going until your battery dies . <p> Gabbatt , who thinks three minutes should be the maximum length for a mobile video , said that while " video can definitely be too long " , he does not believe they " can be too short " . <p> For those who disagree however , and feel six seconds is too short for their purposes , mobile video publishing platform Tout , an adapted version of which is used by the Wall Street Journal , let 's users publish longer videos of 15 to 45 seconds long , while Vizibee , a video network designed for journalists , let 's you shoot videos up to 75 seconds long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a smartphone , then 45 to 90 seconds feels about right , " BBC trainer Marc Settle said . " But there are no hard and fast rules . The suitable length of a piece can be determined to an extent by the content of the story , how engaging it is , how visually interesting it is etc . <p> " People will watch for longer on TV than on a tablet , and longer on a tablet than on a smartphone . " <p> Streaming content live <p> Livestream apps like Qik and Bambuser are a great option for journalists in the heart of the action to get their stories out . Hans Eriksson , Bambuser 's executive chairman , told Journalism.co.uk that connectivity is key when broadcasting live from your mobile . <p> " Try to move to an area where you have the best possible 3G or 4G connection and try to do some test broadcast , " he said . " If you have a very good connection you could go for a higher resolution , if your connection is less good go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweaks here or there you can make to improve things , just moving three , four metres can change the quality dramatically in terms of what kind of connectivity you get . <p> In order to find out the speed you are working with , journalists can use an app like Speedtest.net , as recommended to Journalism.co.uk by BBC 5 Live 's Nick Garnett and a previous app of the week . Shooting techniques <p> Preparation and planning <p> Where possible , planning is key . Before you start shooting you should think about what you want the end product to look like , rather than waiting until you get to the editing process . <p> Settle advises that journalists film more footage than they will need . " You can never have too much , but you often regret having too little , " he said . <p> In terms of preparation , he also highlighted the importance of turning on airplane mode before filming . " If not , and you receive a phone call , it will interrupt what you 're recording and you might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained . <p> Andy Dickinson , who teaches digital and online journalism at the University of Central Lancashire , also said that journalists should not be afraid to use traditional techniques to get off the starting blocks with mobile video . <p> " The online medium is driving some of the old tropes of video away , like the standard idea that a contributor should not be framed in the middle of the screen looking in to the camera , " he said . " But the shots you see in TV news are there for a reason " they make the process of gathering what you need for a story quick and error free when turn around times are tight . Start there and then experiment . " <p> Westbrook added that mobile video does have its own advantages , such as " flexibility , intimacy , the ability to film covertly , speed " , all of which can be harnessed through such experimentation . <p> " Rather than seeing mobile phones journalists make stuff that looks more like TV , I 'd like to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their smartphones . " <p> The shooting stance <p> When it comes to putting the theory into practice , a simple , but important starting point from Dickinson is to make sure you are holding the phone " the right way up " . <p> " It sounds daft but the number of videos I see with black bars down the side , " he said . <p> And if you forget this tip , Gabbatt has found a solution to the problem in Video Rotate . This " does exactly as it sounds " , he said , and can be " useful if you cock up and have filmed in profile but need it in landscape " . <p> Another simple but vitally important tip , is to keep the phone as still as possible while shooting , Dickinson said . <p> " If you can , always try and get two hands on your camera . Better still get two hands on and lean against something . A lot of the new kit has in-built image stabilisation but it 's still not great and software takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripod and adapter . " <p> WSJ 's Scheffler said that " getting stillness " by using a tripod and mic , ensuring strong audio quality and creating " nice compositions " are key considerations . <p> " Be focused on stillness , because a lot of times the device is so small and it picks up any jerky motion that you make that it really gets accentuated with every little movement , " he said . " I always say ' think of a deer hunter , like you 're hunting ' . Just stay calm and stay focused . " <p> But , Dickinson warned , " getting a good grip on your camera often means you can cover the mic by mistake " . Therefore to avoid this , or simply just to improve sound quality , it might be worth investing in a plug-in microphone . <p> And when collecting video , Dickinson also advises gathering clips of around 20 seconds of each scene , and then " hunting for detail " . <p> Shoot close ups of things in and around you . Use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editing your film <p> Making sure the end video let 's the viewer dive straight into the most interesting content is key , Gabbatt added , and as such he prefers not to " set up " the video . <p> " If people are watching video on the web , the title and standfirst provide that context , and you 're competing with people 's attention against pictures of cats and David Cameron topless on a beach , " he explained . " Every second should be valuable " no waffle . " <p> If someone starts waffling , I will just cut them and jump to when they start being interesting again . People understand what 's happening , and it just serves to keep the video tight and watchableAdam Gabbatt , the Guardian <p> Gabbatt does not think journalists should be expected to edit mobile video to the same sophisticated level as they would for television . He does not , for example , use cutaways . <p> " If someone starts waffling , I will just cut them and jump to when they start being interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening , and it just serves to keep the video tight and watchable . " <p> When it comes to working with interview-focused videos , chief executive and co-founder Matt Singer suggests that performing an interview " off-camera " first , before asking the interviewee to discuss the most interesting points of the interview again on camera , will help secure " one or two of the best quotes " on film . <p> In terms of journalists being able to quickly produce edited video packages , Scheffler says this is something he hopes to see more of , as most reporters currently submit raw footage . <p> " Reporters will send their footage in and we 'll edit it and they love how it looks because when it 's all stitched together it ends up looking pretty slick , but what would be great to see is that they start to do those things themselves . " <p> " The new MixBit app from the guys who started YouTube is a really interesting development in terms of doing quick edits on your phone , so that 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settle also recommends Voddio , iMovie , Splice and Cute CUT for editing . The possible technology of the future <p> Settle said Google Glass could either be " the future " , or could prove to be " the Segway of personal transport " . <p> " GG will need better battery life and an easy way to record good audio of guests as at the moment the sound capture is quite poor , " he explained , but added that for live-streaming purposes it " could be a game-changer " . <p> Westbrook added that Google Glass could become a key source for user-generated content and " may well spark a sub-genre of eye-witness journalism " . <p> " Once the quality improves they could be incredibly useful for on the spot reporting , " Gabbatt said , but added that " if you are doing mobile video you 're probably still going to be pulling out a different device and holding it in your hands .

@@97847398 @2047398/ <h> How to : Get started as a freelance journalist abroad <p> The country you choose to be your new home should depend on your experience and contacts . If you have few or no contacts with foreign editors and little or no appropriate published articles in your portfolio , then the best option is to pick a lesser-known country like Bolivia , or one with a notorious reputation such as Colombia . China and India are also so vast that prospects are good for motivated freelancers . The most difficult locations to make your mark are generally those places where journalists most want to live such as Paris , Rome , Rio Janeiro , and Buenos Aires . <p> It is also important to pick a country where you really want to learn the language and are interested in the local culture . If you are not a linguist and find the prospect of learning a foreign language daunting , avoid Serbo-Croat or Arabic and pick Spanish or French instead . Do some research and , ideally , make one or more visits to your destination of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you enjoy day-to-day life once the novelty has worn off ? What to do before you leave the UK <p> Again this depends on your experience . If you are already an established journalist in the UK , then getting regular commissions will be far easier . But if not , assume that you will be broke for the first few months . It takes time and a great deal of persistence to get regular commissions every month . Usually you will have to wait up to six weeks to get paid for a published piece , so it is wise to leave the UK with sufficient funds to pay your rent in advance for the first six months , and to cover your other living expenses for at least some of that time . <p> If you have little freelancing experience , you may need to supplement your income with a part-time job . One possibility is to get a TEFL ( Teaching English as a Foreign Language ) qualification as it is usually fairly easy to get this kind of work abroad . <p> Before leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they know who you are and where you will be based . Get your vital contacts book organised before you leave , including up-to-date email addresses and phone numbers of all foreign and deputy foreign editors in the UK . As soon as you have settled abroad , send them your new contact details . <p> Finally , buy a copy of every single magazine and newspaper published in the UK and pack them in your suitcases . There is no substitute for having the original copy in front of you to get a feel of a publication before writing that all important pitch . Settling in abroad - culture shock <p> Culture shock can happen to any expatriate irrespective of what you do for a living . To minimise it , start learning the local language as soon as you get off the plane . Get a private tutor or enrol in a language course . <p> If you play a sport , get involved with a local team . Most places have expatriate football/cricket/rugby teams . It will make you friends and open doors to potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other veteran expatriate freelancers . They are your rivals and will guard their patches zealously . Instead , introduce yourself to local journalists - they should have no axes to grind and might make useful contacts for story leads . <p> Lastly , do n't mope at home waiting for the phone to ring or an editor to reply to your email . Get out and about ; walk around your new city and get to know it well . Making contacts abroad <p> It may sound obvious but contacts are made by getting on the phone and meeting people . A good starting point is to get in touch with press officers working with the national government and the main foreign embassies . Also get to know who the local and international NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are and what they are doing . Make contact with government ministries and set up meetings with them . Ask to receive press releases so that you can anticipate events and get invited to press conferences . <p> But often the best contacts are those you make in your everyday life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender . These people will be able to give you a good idea about what is going on . Keep a diary of the dates of local events , festivals and international summits hosted in the country and get involved . Who is interested in foreign news ? <p> There are hundreds of publications in English around the world interested in foreign news . All the main UK broadsheets are interested in foreign news and features . On average , for a news story expect to get paid around 90-160 for 700-1,000 words . Features pay considerably more . <p> Of the UK newspapers , The Independent and The Guardian are the most interested in foreign features . Most newspapers have stringers on their books from across the world , but this does not preclude them from considering strong ideas from freelancers . <p> Below are websites that buy foreign news stories and use freelancers frequently : <p> Slate - an online magazine based in the US . Buys foreign news and dispatches . Pays from US$200 a piece . <p> WorldPoliticsWatch - based in the US . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pays US$150 a piece . <p> The Times Education Supplement as above but buys news about primary and secondary education . Pay from 120 a piece . Travel writing <p> Travel writing is a harder market to break into than news , being highly competitive and a little cliquey . The best way to start is to write for a travel guide book . The Rough Guide , Footprint and Lonely Planet like to employ freelancers living in-country . Pay is not good but it is a great way to travel and really get to know the country you have made your home . <p> How to pitch foreign news stories <p> Pitching a foreign news story is no different from pitching any other kind of news and or feature idea . Make no mistake pitching a story is the most important skill a freelancer needs to perfect . As a freelancer starting out , more of your time will be spent pitching stories to various foreign editors than actually writing them . <p> In less than 250 words , give a brief but focused summary of what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few questions that you will raise in the article and the possible answers . Finally , include a peg ( ie an indication of what makes it newsworthy ) and the names of people and organisations you intend to interview . <p> Take great care and time writing pitches and make sure that you have already figured out the piece in your head . Do not expect an editor to sort out your muddy thoughts for you . Send 2-3 recent relevant clips if possible with your pitch . <p> It is common to let editors know that , unless you have received a reply within five weeks , you will pass the idea on . Do not be afraid to chase up replies but usually most editors will reply promptly ( within a month ) if they like an idea . <p> Finally sending a pitch that is relevant to a particular publication is almost as important as writing it well . Bear in mind the political stance of each publication . <p> To save on your telephone bill , and to ensure you have a ' paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with foreign news stories <p> Ideas come from chatting endlessly to local people and reading . In a typical week , freelancers may interview a whole spectrum of people , including indigenous leaders , politicians , business leaders and students . Ideas will arise from these meetings . <p> You also need to become a news junkie . Part of your daily routine should be to sift through all the local media , from obscure university journals and trade publications to the best-selling national newspaper . Pay particular attention to local newspaper editorials that allow you to get a feel for the important and controversial issues of the day . Look out for trends and stalk controversy . In the same way as newspapers are divided into sections ( such as the environment , business , women 's pages ) divide your story ideas into the same categories . <p> Do not get stuck in the capital city but travel around the country for further inspiration . <p> Also keep a close eye on the type of foreign news stories that are being published back at home . Photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned more money from the photos I have taken than the published article . Most editors will say whether they need photographs but always check before writing your piece . Do take photographs whenever you can and always take pictures of the people you interview . The pitfalls of life as a freelancer abroad <p> In general , freelancing is not a well-paid job leave that to the city stockbrokers . The most difficult part is not knowing when , and if , you will have work each month . There are no guarantees and no monthly pay cheques to look forward to . <p> Freelancing can also be quite isolating . There is no daily banter and drinks after work with office colleagues sharing your daily experience to help you let off steam . It is also a constant cycle of pitching , waiting and writing . <p> In a good month , a freelancer might get up to nine articles commissioned . But , generally the reality is that they are lucky to get an article a week commissioned - an average of 400-600 a month . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you the freedom to be your own boss and explore the world on your own terms . If you are good at pitching ideas , you will get to write about what really interests you and what you believe is important . <p> Living abroad and getting paid for it while not being part of the rat race and daily drudgery back home is both liberating and exciting . <p> Getting paid in sterling and/or dollars while living in a developing country does give you more purchasing power . Earning as little as 450 a month should give you a decent lifestyle . <p> Useful books to get you started <p> Travel writing , by Don George published by Lonely Planet .

@@97847400 @2047400/ <h> How to : build a pivot table to find the story in data <p> Whether the information is found purposefully buried in a huge government release or sought out by Freedom of Information request , data stories are increasingly common in the era of electronic journalism . <p> Pivot tables are an invaluable tool for finding the story in all that noise . They are especially useful for simplifying large datasets without having to delete other chunks of data . <p> Essentially a pivot table let 's you question the information you have , rather than having to work it all out yourself . Since the ability to quickly sift through figures is paramount for a journalist using data , the ability to create and use a pivot table tool is vital . <p> The majority of spreadsheet programs have the ability to create pivot tables , so they 're extremely easy to practice using . This also allows you to practice cleaning data , which is another invaluable skill and one you 'll need before creating pivot tables . <p> First , select the Table 4 tab at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident 's visits abroad by month ' . Click and drag to select all the data and paste it into a new workbook . <p> Cleaning the data <p> This data will now require some cleaning before it can be entered into a pivot table . The important things to note at this point are that when creating a table there must be at least three columns or rows , and that all the data must be contiguous , or touching . <p> Delete rows 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 and everything after row 43 , then delete columns C to F. You should be left with just the data detailing the purpose from 2011 to 2013 . <p> Unfortunately the data still is not contiguous at this point , so scan the columns for any that do not contain any data . In this case , that should be the columns between each ' purpose ' entry . Now add ' year ' and ' month ' labels to the top of the appropriate columns , and copy the correct year down until it reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data is now contiguous and matching , but unfortunately it requires one last thing : the December entry for 2013 is marked as ' Dec rather than ' Dec ' . Change it to match the other Dec entries , as otherwise it will not be counted among them when filtered . <p> You also have to change June and July in the 2013 section to match the other years . Minor changes like this are hugely important when it comes to cleaning data for use in pivot tables . <p> Creating the table <p> Now , select the data . Using Excel , this is as simple as clicking and dragging over the data . Now select the ' Insert ' tab and then ' Pivot Table ' . It is best to insert the table into a new document . <p> On other programs like OpenOffice data or in a Google spreadsheet , you might have to click the ' Data ' tab to insert a pivot table . From there , though the interface might be slightly different , the basic functionality is the same . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year ' and ' Month ' options into the ' Rows ' section , and add the remaining options into the ' Data ' section . If you 're working in a Google spreadsheet you can add the year and month to the rows in the report editor on the right , and put the other options into ' Values ' <p> Now when you create the pivot table , you should be able to use the filter function to sort the individual years and months and receive quick sums of those dates . <p> For instance , by selecting ' All ' under the year filter and ' Jan ' and ' Jul ' under the Month filter we can quickly see that while the total of British people travelling abroad for Business barely changes between those two months , the amount travelling for Holiday changes frequently rises to nearly four times the amount , and this trend is accurate across each year . <p> An obvious story , perhaps , but one that demonstrates the ease and versatility of using a pivot table to sort your data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will update themselves when you choose different filters , so you can see any dramatic spikes or drops in the numbers even more clearly . <p> John Burn-Murdoch , data journalist at the Financial Times , will lead a workshop on spreadsheet skills at Journalism.co.uk 's forthcoming digital journalism conference news:rewired , on Wednesday 23 July .

People in the US were more engaged with the event and wanted more updates , whereas international audiences were more likely to unsubscribe from the bot , so AJ+ is now thinking about how it could develop a way to determine users ' preferences for alerts in the future . <p> The team will also try to figure out how to make initiatives such as Mila part of the everyday newsroom workflow , and work out how and when notifications can be pushed to AJ+ audiences on Facebook Messenger , WhatsApp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give people updates they actually want so that there is a propensity to consume this information ? <p> " We need to figure out that mix of curation and automation because at the end of the day , we 're still storytellers and we ca n't outsource our storytelling to a bot . <p> " That human nature of the story still has to come through , " said Hyder. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847402 @2047402/ <p> Some of the larger news organisations are adjusting their workflows to produce more videos , but for local publishers with fewer resources , even making the format part of their digital strategy can be challenging . <p> For Finegil , a group of 18 local and regional Italian titles , which has a central newsroom in Rome and is part of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso , the solution was to use Wochit , a paid-for platform that uses elements of automation to allow anyone to turn a text-based story into a video ready to be published online or on social media . <p> Its newsrooms vary in size , from some 60 journalists at regional papers to 15 reporters working for the local titles . But since Finegil newspapers started using Wochit heavily at the beginning of 2016 , after a short initial period of training and experimentation , at least four people in each newsroom have become regularly involved in video production . <p> The network is now able to collectively produce roughly 250 videos every month " the smaller newsrooms average two videos per day , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger titles . <p> The titles were mostly relying on videos produced by the group 's central visuals desk in Rome , which prioritised national and international issues for La Repubblica . <p> " We think this type of platform works better for social video formats , because you just have to choose the right story and images and overlay text , sounds or other visual elements . <p> " We mostly try to do short , one-minute videos , and they work better on social than they do on the web , even though they can also work online in the case of breaking news . " <p> The network has mostly focused on finding and developing social video formats , particularly for Facebook , and has found videos that summarise the news of the day , explanatory videos , listicles and animated photo galleries have had the most success . <p> For example , Il Tirreno , Finegil 's largest publication , produced 2.5 times more videos four months into using Wochit , with the average video generating 369 per cent more engagement on Facebook than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of average shares per video has gone up by 844 per cent , to 1.1k shares . <p> The stories that would benefit from being adapted to a video format for each title are decided on a case by case basis during the morning editorial meeting , and the pieces are also shared on the network 's collective social presence on Facebook , La Cronaca Italiana , every late afternoon . <p> " For local news , the best videos are the ones that have an emotional impact on the community . <p> " It can be good stories or negative situations that could set an example for other people , but you have to stay very focused on emotions and the issues in these communities . <p> " With the recent earthquake that happened in Italy , the videos we produced had an impact not only because of how powerful the images were , but because we were able to place the right text and the right sequence of images and not show only the negative aspects of that tragedy . " <p> Wochit allows journalists to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of the platform 's library of content from different agencies , such as Reuters , Associated Press or Getty Images . <p> Iannuzzi said Finegil 's approach is a mix of the two " local newsrooms mostly use their own material , but there are also cases when Wochit infographics or footage of international news are used for some video formats , such as the daily ' day in one minute ' round-up of global issues produced by the group . <p> " Usually we have the story first and then we think about the video , even when there 's breaking news or things such as a town hall event . <p> " What we wanted to do was to create videos from our existing stories and one of the best ways has been to turn a photo gallery into a video . <p> " We are now trying to become more skilled in the production of infographics to embed in the videos , to explain things such as law changes and political or economic issues to our readers .

It 's no different from switching from being a newspaper to being a radio station and I think they should treat it like that . " <p> According to the latest National Readership Survey figures , more than 60 per cent of its digital audience accesses the site exclusively from mobile devices . <p> The Independent still has a long way to go on digital , with an output that is still mostly based on text , and the challenge is keeping up the quality its print readers were accustomed to as well as reinventing itself . <p> " The huge opportunity it 's got is no longer needing to synchronise workflows with something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pure-play digital player because it is that , " Adam Tinworth , publishing strategist and journalism trainer , told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " It needs to make some smart choices about rebalancing perhaps some of the staff , figure out where the writing gives the most compelling advantage and how to then bring in other skillsets to richen the digital offering to make it really stand out . That 's the only way it 's going to make this transition work . <p> " It needs to be aggressively different from the other offerings out there , in the same way the print Independent was back in the 80s .

At this time , they should ensure that they keep thinking about the customers , the audience , " said Nel. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847408 @2047408/ <p> The most useful tool for you as a journalist is often the smartphone in your handbag or pocket . Your phone ( or iPod or iPad ) may come in handy when you unexpectedly find yourself at the scene of a breaking new story . You may even decide that your phone is up to a particular job and saves you buying and carrying extra kit . <p> Journalism.co.uk now records podcasts on an iPhone 4 , for example , as it provides better quality than some other audio recorders . <p> Inspired by the team of journalists from the Guardian who , when reporting from the field during Glastonbury , shot video on iPods despite many of them having little or no video training , here is a guide to shooting video on an iPhone . <p> After shooting video you can then edit footage using a programme such as Final Cut Express , iMovie or Windows Movie Maker " or you can edit on your iPhone . <p> Recording video on an iPhone , iPod or iPad <p> From the 3GS onwards , the iPhone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trim video . <p> But there is an app that goes further and allows you to edit using two tracks , mix sound , add fades and post directly to YouTube . <p> It costs -6.99 and is more than sufficient to shoot and edit simple voxes , complete with cutaways . So , if you find yourself recording a reaction piece and need a fast edit and upload option , using your phone could be the answer . The networks edition of the app also allows you to post direct to IPTV . <p> A few words of warning : <p> The lack of a tripod fitting means you will have to find a suitable surface to rest on . I shot the sample video below without a tripod or rest " and it is evident . You could invest in a solution " such as this GorillaMobile option for the iPhone 4 , which costs -34.95 , or the tripod for iPods and the iPhone 3GS . <p> The app takes a bit of getting used to when it comes to editing , so test it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the clock . A 15 minute try out should get you up to full speed as it is fairly intuitive . <p> 1stVideo does occasionally crash so do save regularly . <p> I had trouble with the YouTube upload option so opted to transfer wirelessly and upload from a computer . <p> How to shoot for web : <p> Quite a bit has been written about shooting video for the web . Video journalist Adam Westbrook recommends not to follow certain TV conventions . He advises to use talking heads sparingly , get subjects to look at the camera rather than at an angle and never to include a " noddy " ( when the interviewer is shown on camera nodding , a device used in TV as a cutaway ) . <p> When using a phone for videoing , set it to ' airplane mode ' , if you do n't want incoming calls , messages and interference to interrupt recording . <p> You can touch the screen to focus while recording . <p> Remember these six simple rules when shooting : <p> 1 . Get a closeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shooting . That will make editing easy and effective ; <p> 2 . Change angles . But make sure the new angle is at least 45 degrees from your last one . That will make editing easier ; <p> 3 . Use a tripod or a suitable surface . Shaky footage and poor sound are the two most common problems with web videos ; <p> 4 . Do n't cross the line . Imagine a line and shoot from one side of it ; <p> 5 . Use zooms and pans ( left to right or up and down ) sparingly . You will produce the best video on an iPhone / iPod / iPad if you leave the camera still " on a tripod or surface " and let your subjects move ; <p> 6 . Record some wild track . Make sure you record audio that is of a sufficient length so that it can be used for a clip sequence . Put that on a track with the images over the top and mix the sound so you do n't get jumps in the audio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have recorded your footage , you are ready to edit . You can either transfer your footage ( they will be mov files ) to your computer wirelessly " by having your Apple device connected to the same wifi network " or you can edit on your iPhone / iPod / iPad.1 . Trim your clips . It is a good idea to trim your clips before importing them to the timeline . Do this by going to the clip , click edit / trim and slide the bar to where you want your clip to begin and end . You can then give your clips a sensible name . The original file will still be available if you want to take a second clip or extract audio . <p> 2 . Build the timeline . Click video / new project / video and give your project a name . Click + to add a new clip and the tick to confirm . Move the cursor to the end point ( it needs to be green ) and add your next clip . <p> 3 . Make clips fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking to add an ' in ' and an ' out ' point , then click + to add the clip.4 . Mix the sound . You can mix the audio by selecting the clip and lowering the audio levels on overlays / cutaways . You can also fade the audio up or down by moving both sliders at once . <p> 5 . Add transitions . You can add a fade in by using a two finger touch and selecting the ' clip FX ' option . <p> 6 . Delete clips and change the order . A really handy tool , particularly if you want to rearrange the clip order , is the third button from left , which looks like building blocks . <p> 7 . Save your project . To render and save simply click the " S " . You can then share to a computer on the same wireless network or upload directly to YouTube . There is an email option but it will only work for the shortest of clips. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847412 @2047412/ <h> How to : bring agile into the newsroom <p> Wander into a room of developers and you may hear the term " agile " . But what is agile and why and how should journalists learn from developers and adopt some of the principles ? <p> This guide looks at how a number of newsrooms have taken aspects of agile on board , and how some journalists have actually been using some of the principles without knowing it . <p> Journalism.co.uk speaks to Cory Haik , executive producer for digital news at the Washington Post ; Brian Boyer , who was a news apps developer at the Chicago Tribune and is now news applications editor at NPR ; John Stefany , a project manager at NPR ; Martin Belam , who was lead UX ( user experience ) at the Guardian and now runs digital consultancy Emblem ; and Richard Sheridan of Menlo Innovations , software developers who train others in agile . <p> What is agile ? <p> " Agile is a set of principles used to improve the way groups work together on projects , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most commonly used in software development but it has relevance to other fields , including newsgathering . " <p> The principles were codified in the " agile manifesto " in 2001 but the ideas had been around for a couple of years before they were formalised . <p> More recently newsrooms have been adopting some of the principles . " Agile became a buzzy thing for newsrooms a couple of years ago , with Brian Boyer and others really champions of it in other places " , Cory Haik from the Washington Post explained . <p> " As the challenge of newsrooms became about integrating the technologist and the journalist together , agile just became part of the language . " <p> Move fast <p> Agile is about pushing projects out without delay . " It 's a recognition that in a competitive market there 's value in bringing new products out as quickly as possible , " Stefany said . <p> Agile recognises that " humans are naturally wired to make mistakes " , Richard Sheridan of Menlo Innovations said . " Our view and the view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that allows us to make those mistakes quickly , review , discover those mistakes as fast as possible and correct them before they kill us ? <p> " Being agile simply means reorganising your processes in a way that allows you to make those mistakes quickly , get feedback on them , so setting up short communication and feedback loops , and then iterating your way to the right conclusion even if it that conclusion is well different to what you imagined at the beginning . " <p> " The whole process is all about refinement and improvement , " Martin Belam added . <p> " Agile allows developers to focus on the things that are important , which is actual working software rather than things that are unimportant like extensive documentation , " Belam said . " One of the things that 's really important is to value working software above all else . " <p> It really tries to emphasise individual interactions over processes and plans and tools , delivering working software or other products over creating comprehensive documentation , and it favours customer collaboration over legalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole team , Stefany explained . " Agile recognises that customers sometimes need to see a product to assess whether that 's what they really need . You can describe things in requirement documents all you want but until it 's something that people can actually get their hands on , they do n't really know whether its what they wanted or not . " <p> Agile " also recognises that all of us are bad at estimating how long things will take and it really appreciates is that needs change over time " , Stefany added . <p> " In a competitive landscape you need to be able to respond to that in short increments rather than waiting months and then changing your game plan . " <p> Stefany summarised : " It really tries to emphasise individual interactions over processes and plans and tools , delivering working software or other products over creating comprehensive documentation , and it favours customer collaboration over legalistic negotiations . " <p> If a newsroom adopts agile , constantly refining and improving , the project will never be finished . The Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , as Haik explained when she delivered the keynote presentation at this month 's news:rewired digital journalism conference . When I spoke to Haik from her newsroom in Washington on Friday ( 20 July ) afternoon , she illustrated the point by describing the build of a new liveblogging platform the Washington Post is creating using agile principles . <p> The platform has been in development for the past three or four months with the goal to have it ready for the Olympics , but he Washington Post team started using the platform during the US electoral primaries , Haik told me . <p> " It was not complete but we would use it one night and then we would come back and do bug reporting then the developer and the designer-developer would work on things , put out a new version of it .... and the next night we 'd do it again , and now we 've got something that 's pretty great . " <p> Putting the user first <p> The news apps team at the Chicago Tribune team thinks of the process of building a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thinking about who the users are . " That should be really familiar to an editor , who should be an expert in their audience , " Boyer said . " The next question is ' what are their needs ? ' and the third question is ' what features can we build to fulfill those needs ? ' " <p> The team writes these features on notecards , putting them into piles labelled " must " , " want " , " nice " and " meh " . " The secret of the process is you sort them and then throw out the bottom two categories . You then put them in order of priority for the user . You execute by working through the list and when you hit a deadline you stop . <p> " Prioritising let 's you break your work into iterations . We usually work in week-long iterations , which means that at the end of every week we have completed a unit of work . It prevents you from getting stuck with three half-done features and your deadline is approaching . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cut off the bottom of the page " , Boyer said . " And that 's exactly what the inverted pyramid is all about . " <p> How does agile work ? <p> There are a number of variations on the agile methodologies and ways of actually applying these principles , Stefany explained . <p> The scrum <p> The scrum is used both at NPR and at the Chicago Tribune . It is named after the rugby term and is based on the idea of small teams working together . " In our case there is a product owner , who sets the vision , one or more developers , designers , a user-experience architect and the project manager assumes a role called scrum master , " Stefany said . <p> Removing impediments <p> Agile also encourages the removal of obstacles , such as lengthy meetings . As scrum master , Stefany 's role at NPR is to " keep the team on track following the rules of the process , and more importantly removing impediments that they have to doing their work " . <p> He also looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled for a whole bunch of meetings that are n't really necessary , so I 'll try to go and get those removed , for example . " <p> The Washington Post recognised that " there are too many meetings in newsrooms , particularly in digital " , Haik said , and have made moves to tackle this . <p> Sprint cycles - the start <p> At NPR , as with many other teams of software developers , the team meets every two weeks to plan what it is going to do for the next two-week sprint cycle . <p> " It 's usually about a two-hour meeting and we go through in fairly good detail as to what the plan is going to be for the next two weeks , " Stefany said . <p> The daily stand-up <p> Agile believes in stand-up meetings to keep them as short as possible . " We start each day with a daily stand up , " Stefany said . " It 's intended to be no longer than 15 minutes , and we go around the group and each person says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done today , and what impediments they have to getting that work done " . <p> The Washington Post also adopts the 15 minute stand-up for its weekly meeting of the digital leadership group , Haik told me . They too take the " rapid fire " approach , asking what colleagues are working on and discovering if connections can be made . <p> Sprint cycles - the end <p> The team at NPR holds a sprint review at the end of the two-week sprint cycle . " That 's where the stakeholders of the software come in , " Stefany said . If it is a mobile application , for example , the key people can see what the team has actually produced . " The rules are it has to be working software , it ca n't be smoke and mirrors , " Stefany said . <p> " This is their opportunity to provide feedback on whether it meets the needs , or whether for the next cycle the team needs to shift gears and rethink priorities . " <p> After the sprint review the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospective . They look at the process , assess how well the two-week sprint cycle went and ask " how we can in change the way we work together in the next cycle to make our process more efficient " , Stefany said . <p> Pair working <p> Some versions of agile encourage pair working , Boyer told me . " A lot of software developers think it 's absolutely mad , but I firmly believe that two programmers sitting at the same keyboard are more productive than two programmers sitting at separate keyboards . They catch bugs , they help each other talk through problems . " <p> Pair working is also is a way of helping people focus , Boyer has found . " If you are sitting at a keyboard next to someone for eight hours , you work the entire time . No one is checking their emails , no one is tweeting , and frankly it 's exhausting . " <p> Pair working is something the Washington Post has been doing for " a long time " , before it started thinking in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit together on one computer . " That limits the distractions , which is definitely key , " Haik said . <p> So what are the downsides to agile ? Belam says that agile can " make design more difficult in that you could produce what you expect to be a finished design and then at the end of the fortnight the developers say ' we got 70 per cent of it working ' and here 's our best guess of how that will appear on the page " . <p> Being agile in the newsroom <p> Stefany believes that journalists already use elements of agile . " Journalists have been doing this for a long time , " he said . " The assigning editor is the product owner , the voice of the customer , he/she prioritises what gets worked on on a daily basis . <p> " Your team could be a reporter , photographer , graphic artist and videographer , and they are going to work best when they are all in constant communication with each other , ideally face-to-face , but at least checking-in regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investigative projects that take months " , Stefany believes . " Traditionally we 've approached this by a long research phase , then photographers are brought in , then at the end graphic artists . But you really do n't have anything concrete until the very end of that process . In the meantime the story could change or your competitor could scoop you on part of it , so if you were to apply agile principles to that , you would be constantly developing publishable content . " <p> " We work in two-week sprints at NPR on the software side but there 's no rule to how long a sprint is , " Stefany added . " You could envision it as a daily story that has multiple deadlines during the day , so each deadline is a sprint . " <p> Breaking news does n't make it more difficult to do agile in a newsroom or a news environment , it just means you have to plan for itMartin Belam <p> " After a story breaks and you do your first pass on it and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ? what do we need to focus on now ? ' and then you try to improve that for the next one . <p> " If a tornado rips through a town , your first set of questions is n't to find out what is means for the apple blossom festival in two weeks . " <p> But can agile really work for breaking news ? " One of the criticisms I 've seen of using agile methodologies in a news organisation is that it does n't make room for the sudden big breaking news event where you need to do an infographic or change the style of something or the tone of something , " Belam says . <p> " I ca n't see that myself . The thing with agile is you always set aside a time in a sprint to deal with bugs , to do refactoring , which is where you go back and make code that 's more efficient . A well organised agile team should have 20 or 25 per cent of their capacity to do those things , so it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of capacity for breaking news events . <p> " Breaking news does n't make it more difficult to do agile in a newsroom or a news environment , it just means you have to plan for it . " <p> Agile at the Washington Post <p> Rather than following " hard core agile " the Washington Post newsroom has developed a " beta mindset " , Haik said . " We are borrowing some of the things that work in agile , like scrum meetings , stand-up meetings everyday or , if it 's a longer project , perhaps once a week " . <p> Teams at the Washington Post may consist of a developer , designer , an editor , a reporter , for example . " Everybody does their updates and then we keep notes , " Haik said . " It 's a very light documentation , it 's almost like a liveblog of what everyone is working on on the project . <p> " The idea is we are going to get something live as soon as we can and then we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from users , get feedback from the group , and then continue to work and to develop on it and iterate . " <p> This is how the Washington Post 's liveblogging platform developed , but have they tried using agile for investigative or purely editorial projects where there is no software element ? <p> Haik did not reveal details of one of the projects her team is currently working on but did say that they are " taking an agile approach to it " . <p> " We are going to have to build some digital things , " she said . " We 'll need a data journalist , for instance , but there 's no heavy platform building , it 's more about storytelling and the content . " <p> The team members on the project are going to be doing " check-in meetings , people are going to go away and work on things and come back and explain what they have " . <p> And the starting point is always the user , Haik said . " The team starts by asking ' what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell users ? ' " They then may " prototype some of that " , working out what direction they can take the data in . <p> " Instead of a long planning process , as reporters are working on the stories , the data journalist and a designer/multimedia journalist are going to work together and build things at the same time , " she added . <p> As at the Washington Post , the newsroom of the Chicago Tribune has also " cherry picked " elements of agile , selecting parts that " fit in really rather nicely with the news cycle " , according to Boyer , and at NPR , the newsroom is " just starting to scratch the surface " of agile , according to Stefany . <p> " We think there 's tremendous potential to bring some of these ideas into the newsroom , but journalists are not attuned to these kinds of processes in the same way as software people are , " Stefany added . Parallels between journalism and software development <p> Belam sees one of the parallels between software development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional print publication . <p> " The old model where you published a first edition and then you spotted some errors with it and you published a second edition and then a story develops slightly and you publish a third edition and by the fourth edition you 've got the thing right . I think that very much mirrors the iterative approach to software development . <p> " I think the thing that is difficult for news organisations is the fact that things are never finished with agile and although you could say that news stories are never finished , there is a final layout and design of a page and you know that 's the thing that you are sending off to print . " <p> But that may have changed with the development of digital . Belam feels the " circular iteration process where you do something , you test it , you see what works , what did n't work and you improve the things that work " mirrors online reporting . " Meg Pickard head of digital engagement at the Guardian published a blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Belam said . <p> " She looked at how the model used to be that you would commission and article , do some research , write it , get it subbed , publish it in the paper and then wander off and go and do the next one . She 's suggesting that with digital there 's much more of a circular thing there . " <p> Belam said the process of crowdsourcing may mean part of the journalist 's research is done in public and building on the story with the help of the audience has parallels to agile . <p> What else can journalists learn from developers ? <p> Boyer believes that although not agile , one thing that journalists can learn from developers is reserving time for self improvement . <p> " One of the things we had at the Tribune is that every person on the team in addition to being able to go to a conference was given five hack days , as we call them . They are sort of a paid vacation in which you are allowed to do whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to work on a project or attend a conference or you want to go and build a radio station in Africa , you are encouraged to . <p> " That something that seems really missing in newsrooms , when everyone is hustling for the deadline all day long and everyone is being encouraged to do more with less . <p> " I would love to see newsrooms give reporters a day a month or two days a month to learn a technology , to learn how to code , to learn how to use Twitter . It would benefit both the reporters and the organisation and the industry . " <p> The Washington Post has held hackathons , which have involved journalists as well as developers . The " social reporting " news app @mentionmachine , which monitors Twitter and media across the web for US election candidate mentions , was developed as a result of one such event . <p> Hack days and off diary projects are " very key to the culture " of the Washington Post , Haik said . " We feel very strongly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't necessarily fit in to exactly what we are doing now but ideas may come out of them or they could be an launchpad for something else . " <p> Advice for journalists <p> So what is the advice for journalists who want to begin bringing agile into the newsroom ? " Go and talk to your news organisation 's technical department , " advises Stefany . They are probably using agile and can share advice . <p> You have to try things and you have to try them quickly . Go fail , that 's my adviceCory Haik , Washington Post <p> Sheridan 's tip is to be open minded and embrace new ways of working . Although the agile manifesto was not codified until 2001 , the concepts arrived in Sheridan 's team a couple of years before . <p> " When I went to my team and suggested what we were going to do and that we were going to take a different approach the first reaction was one of my programmers raising his hand and said ' blood , mayhem , murder . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still some resistance but Sheridan is adamant that agile is the best way of working and shares his belief and best practices with those who attend his training courses . <p> And what tips does Haik have for journalists wanting to learn from software developers ? " You honestly have to embrace the ' fail fast ' mentality . Think of your failures not just as failures but as a path to something else . Is there a way to take whatever did n't work and build something else ? Learn lessons and just keep moving on . <p> " You have to try things and you have to try them quickly . Go fail , that 's my advice . " 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847413 @2047413/ <h> How to : build a distinctive portfolio website with ease <p> Do you have a portfolio website ? A strong , distinctive homepage is an important tool for any journalist , especially those freelancing or forging careers in new ways . When people hear about you , the first place they will look is the internet , and it is just madness not to exist there . A portfolio website is a good way to show off what you can do , and show you know your way around a basic website . <p> Whatever your specialty is , whether it 's print , photojournalism , interactives or video , your portfolio should show you off at your best . So if you 're a photographer , you want a portfolio with big hi-res images . By the same token , do n't put together a big photo gallery when you 're trying to flog yourself as a writer . <p> What 's more , as scary and techie as making websites sounds , the latest software means it 's possible for anyone ( yes , anyone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small financial investment and no previous experience . I have spent the last week rebuilding my own portfolio website to make the most of this ( up until now , it has just been a static page on my Wordpress hosted blog ) . My new site build took a total of about two days , from setting up hosting , to installing Wordpress , and building the individual pages for the site . It 's the third site I 've built since the New Year , and I 'm rapidly picking up tips and tricks to make it easier . So here are a few neat resources to help you build yours . <h> The process <p> Building a website from scratch pretty much happens like this : <p> You buy a domain name ( www.yourname.com ) and rent some server space to host your website <p> You find yourself a wordpress theme , download it to your computer , and then upload &amp; install it into Wordpress <p> With Wordpress you can simply create new pages , upload images , and add widgets as you wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website let 's you change the colours , fonts and other design elements so you can make it truly unique <h> Self hosted or free ? <p> Hosting your own website costs around -60 a year . You can choose , however to have it hosted for free , by the likes of Wordpress , Blogger , or Tumblr . This limits the number of themes you can use , what sort of material you can embed on your page , and means your domain address will have to have " wordpress.com " or " blogspot.com " in it . <h> Web hosts <p> There are lots of different companies who will host your website for your for varying fees . I have used the US company Bluehost several times although I have also used 123-reg.co.uk and 1and1 before with varying success . It 's a case of horses for courses , and as always it is best to shop around and do some research before committing . <h> Themes <p> The best place to start looking for themes is to search for " portfolio themes wordpress " or something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer popular choices . Do n't choose your theme based on the colour , font or header - you can change all that by learning a bit of CSS . A warning though : most of your time building the website will be spent trying to iron out the nuances of each theme . Any site with a dynamic element , like an animated photogallery will require images to be uploaded in a certain way , at a certain size ... make sure you plough through the attached Read Me file before starting ! <h> The big sell <p> You need to remind yourself of the purpose of your portfolio website . Do n't just say " to promote myself and my work " : that does n't cover the real purpose of a portfolio . You need to view it from the point of view of the visitor , and you want them to 1 ) find you , 2 ) stay with you , and 3 ) get in touch to offer you work . Your website must take them on that journey . The Mad Men type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it 's called the " Call To Action " and it 's the bit of copy which tells the customer what to do . " Pick up the phone and dial 0800 ... " " Do n't delay , call us now ! " . Does your website give your potential clients or employers a ' call to action ? ' <h> Handy links and resources : <p> Journalist and web designer Emily has produced a simple guide to building a portfolio site , and it is a great place to start . Over three or four articles she takes you through the technical first bits : finding a host , installing Wordpress and uploading a theme . <p> Wordpress are the most popular Content Management System to go for , because of its flexibility , ease of use and ... oh and it 's free ! Wordpress are great because they opened up their api and let thousands of designers create their own themes , much like Apple and Android let anyone design apps for their phones . The result is countless themes of different colours , shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique . There are options for the more exotic website maker though , including Joomla and Dupla . <p> Along the same line , Design Reviver is a real source of inspiration for anyone putting together websites . Sign up to their free forum to get your design questions answered too - I posted a question about colour schemes and within an hour had four really useful responses . <p> So how do you decide what your website looks like ? The theme you choose will determine it to some extent , but so will the colour scheme . How do you know what colours go well together ? Adobe 's free Kuler website combines various colours and gives you the HTML codes so you can quickly copy and paste them into your own website . <p> You know those little pictures right at the top , next to the address bar ? You can change them to match you or your company 's logo . You used to have to draw very small pictures in something like Paint or Photoshop , but now Favicon.cc gives you a big screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can install for free if you use the Mozilla Firefox web browser . It is a dream for anyone making a website because it let 's you " rehearse " changes to the web code so you can see what it does . For example , you can practice editing the CSS to see how it affects the font size , background or colour , before editing the final code itself . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847414 @2047414/ <h> How to : Apply for a job - and how not to <p> We recently advertised for freelance reporters for this site and received 82 applications in total . Despite publishing several hundred journalism recruitment vacancies every year , we rarely recruit journalists ourselves so it has been a fascinating insight into how journalists apply for jobs and the mistakes they make . <p> We do n't do stories about reporters stuck up trees ( with or without cats ) and you must know your RSS from your elbow . <p> You will also be located in the UK and have a good track record in media , business and/or technology journalism , relevant qualifications and a very keen interest in new media . <p> Please apply by emailing CV , links to your work and an indication of your approximate per-story rate . Absolutely no calls or agencies . <p> *** <p> All the applications , with one or two exceptions , were from experienced and qualified professional journalists . We were spoilt for choice and it would be fair to say most of them would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to filter down the applications and one obvious way was to examine how well the candidates had responded to the requirements stated in our advert . For the purposes of this feature , we did examine each application in detail but printing out and processing 82 applications is very time consuming , especially if you are a busy journalist or publisher without the support of a human resources department . So if you are a jobseeker making applications by email , the first golden rule is : first impressions are crucial . <p> Bearing that in mind , we were surprised that five applicants merely sent a CV with no covering email . Of those who did write a covering letter , six had significant spelling and/or grammatical errors and one made a mistake with my name , addressing me as ' Mr Thomas ' . A busy journalist may well dismiss such applications out of hand , without bothering to read the attached CVs . <p> Another point to remember when applying for jobs by email is to use a relevant subject line . In our case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our advertisers as a sort of post box address , so the lack of obvious subject lines in nine applications caused us some confusion . In the worst case scenario , the wrong subject line may result in your application being trashed before anyone has read it . <p> A covering letter should address the key requirements stated in an advert . If we take each point as highlighted in our advert above , you can see how our applicants fared : <p> * Freelance ... Thirteen applicants had full-time jobs , one seemed to be applying for a full-time job , and two were students . As we were looking for occasional cover , the full-timers were not suitable because they would not be available during normal working hours . <p> * You must know your RSS from your elbow ... An astonishing 79 applicants made no reference to their knowledge or otherwise of RSS . One admitted he did not know what it was . <p> * You will also be located in the UK ... Six applicants were not . <p> * Have a good track record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very keen interest in new media ... Forty-eight applicants did not state , or supply evidence of , knowledge in these areas . <p> * Please apply by emailing CV ... Eleven applicants did not include a CV with their applications . Two CVs were in unusual and ( for us ) unreadable formats ( see later ) . <p> * Links to your work ... Thirty-seven applicants did not provide links to their work , something we would expect for an online writing position . <p> * And an indication of your approximate per-story rate ... Thirty-one applicants made no mention of their rates . A handful gave specific per-story rates , while the rest quite acceptably quoted feature-length , per-word , or day shift rates . <p> * Absolutely no calls or agencies ... One applicant called the office . <p> Most of the applicants fell down on more than one of the above points and , in fact , only one applicant ticked all the right boxes . Out of the 82 applicants , we eventually shortlisted six whom we hope to trial over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assessing and replying to all the applications took nearly two days and destroyed our office printer . This would clearly be an impractical exercise for most employers in this field , so expect your applications to be skim-read on screen and to be assessed quickly . Think sound bites , expect stiff competition and do not expect a reply unless you meet the requirements as stated in the recruitment advert and have carefully crafted your application accordingly . <p> Applying for jobs by email - key points : <p> Read the advert carefully and respond to its key requirements in the main body of your email ( do not attach covering letters ) , including a summary of your relevant experience . Do not try to be clever , funny or criticise your would-be employer or its employees ( yes , a couple of people did do that ) . Follow instructions : if they ask you not to phone , do n't phone ! Break up your email into succinct , single-sentence paragraphs . If appropriate , suggest some story ideas . <p> Proof your email and CV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors even if they regularly make them themselves . <p> Ensure your CV only contains relevant details , and fits on one page . Ideally , supply it as a PDF ( Portable Document Format ) as this is a universally readable format - you can convert your documents for free at neevia.com . Failing that , MS Word is in common use but , if you can , supply a text-only alternative with it . <p> Use a pertinent subject line . <p> Do not presume anything . Do not expect a would-be employer to do the research on you ; no matter what your profile , you still have to present yourself . <p> If you can , try to put yourself in the shoes of the advertiser . What volume of replies are they likely to get to their advert , what is it about you that will make you stand out from the crowd ? <p> Also , if you are applying for a freelance position where they are asking how much you charge , try to tailor your price to suit the likely budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publisher , is it a multinational company or a small business with fewer than 10 employees ? Compare their advertising rates with those of a publication you already work for and know the freelance rates of . Do not under-price yourself but at the same time , try not to price yourself out of the market . <p> Finally , if you are rejected take the news graciously . Especially if you are freelance ; you might not be the right person for the immediate task but you may well be the right person for a job in the future . We left the door open for all of our rejected applicants to pitch story or feature ideas to us in the future and those that do may well earn themselves a commission if not the chance of some regular work . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847426 @2047426/ <h> Screencast : Create advanced search columns in Tweetdeck <p> Tweetdeck is a fantastic tool for monitoring Twitter , and advanced search columns are a really effective way to track breaking news or real-time information around a particular topic or beat . <p> This three-minute screencast explains how to set up advanced searches in Tweetdeck to track tweets by location , by sentiment or by the type of multimedia they contain . <p> But if you do n't have time to watch the screencast , you can simply follow the steps below . <p> 1 . Add a new search column to your Tweetdeck by clicking the ' plus ' sign in the left-hand navigation bar . <p> 2 . You can do a simple search using a combination of hashtags and keywords . For example , I searched for news around the recent EU and local elections using the ' #EP2014 OR elections ' " which will bring up tweets containing either the hashtag or the word ' elections ' " or both . It 's important here that the ' or ' is written in caps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search operator . <p> 3 . To search for tweets that pose a question , simply include a question mark . So ' #EP2014 OR elections AND ? ' will search for either the hashtag or the word ' elections ' together with a question . Incidentally , answering questions on Twitter is a good way to build your following and engage with other users . <p> Similarly , you can include tweets with a positive or negative attitude by searching for a ' smile ' or a ' frown ' . So ' #EP2014 OR elections AND : ) ' <p> 4 . If you want to search for tweets within a specific location , for example Birmingham , you can use the search operator ' Birmingham OR ( near : " Birmingham , England " within:25mi ) ' . <p> So to search for election tweets posted near Birmingham , search for ' ( #EP2014 OR elections ) AND Birmingham OR ( near : " Birmingham , England " within:25mi ) ' . This will search for either the hashtag and keyword ' elections ' , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 25 miles of Birmingham . <p> As there is also a Birmingham in the US , I 've specified that I only want results from England by including the search operator ' near : " Birmingham , England " ' . The brackets specify that these either one of these keywords must be included in the search results . <p> If I just wanted to search for news near Birmingham , I could just remove the first part of the search , so ' Birmingham OR ( near : " Birmingham , England " within:25mi ) ' . <p> 5 . For even more specific results , Tweetdeck also has a number of in-built filters that are useful . In the content tab at the top of your search column you can choose to show only tweets that include images , videos or links , and you can also exclude certain keywords , hashtags or users . <p> You can also search for tweets by language , and exclude retweets to only show original tweets . If you have a lot of search results , this is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can narrow results further in the ' user ' tab by searching for instances when your keywords have been tweeted by a particular user , and whether they also mention another user " which is a good way to monitor conversations between , say , two MPs . This box also allows you to show only content from verified users or members of a list . <p> 7 . You can also drill down to tweets with higher levels of engagement , which may give you an indication of how important they are , by specifying that you only want to see posts with a certain amount of retweets , favourites or replies . for example , for tracking breaking news you might want to search for tweets that have been retweeted 30 times or more . <p> 9 . You can also set Tweetdeck to notify you when the column is updated using the ' alerts ' tab at the top of the column , which is particularly useful for monitoring breaking news . <p> 10 . Drag and drop the icons in the left-hand navigation bar to reorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop-down at the top of each column . In Tweetdeck , you can also use the number keys shortcut to jump to a particular column " so hitting ' 5 ' will take you directly to the fifth column . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> Politibot works with two main components : a database of stories manually curated by the team from various Spanish news outlets , and its carefully crafted push notifications that aim to " recreate a conversation about the election issues happening every day " . <p> " We did n't want to automatise the selection process . <p> " The idea is that the articles you were able to read on 9 June , you will also be able to read on 23 June and 26 June and they will still be relevant . " <p> When you first start talking to Politibot , the first message you get is an explanation of what it does and some pointers for how to use the menu . <p> The bot also tells users any information they provide is kept anonymous and makes them aware they will receive an update once a day about something Politibot found interesting . <p> The last two push alerts the bot has sent before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Politibot asking users whether or not they agreed with the statements made . <p> When they first add Politibot , users are asked a few question about their gender , age and location , so that the bot can tell them which party their peers are likely to be voting for based on the same characteristics . They can then choose from the menu 's several navigation options and ask the bot for shorter or longer text updates , graphs or survey results . <p> " We started doing one push alert a day , with the exception of a televised debate when we sent three push notifications . <p> " For the last couple of days , we have been experimenting with sending two daily updates , alternating between one in the morning and one at lunchtime , or one in the morning and one in the evening . <p> " We 're noticing that what we send at lunch time does really well because of the longer break people take then . " <p> Politibot has had some 35,000 sessions since its launch , and Su+rez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed it before 20 June were opening it every day , with 25 per cent of them spending more than five minutes per day with the bot . <p> " It 's an interesting channel to interact with your audience , particularly useful for when you have a very committed group of people who are interested in a topic , so it could even work for another vertical . " <p> Although the team has been promoting Politibot on individual Twitter and Facebook accounts , Su+rez said they were surprised to see the bulk of the user growth came organically from Telegram rather than social media , as people are likely sharing the bot with each other on the messaging app . <p> The links and material the bot sends to people are not sourced only from El Espa+ol , but also from other Spanish news outlets , such as El Mundo , El Confidencial , El Diario or El Pa+s , all of which operate their own Telegram channels " El Diario 's is the largest one , with 10,932 members . <p> Before Quartz launched their bot-like news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bots in April , not many news organisations had a bot as part of their suite of digital products . <p> As publishers have had more time to familiarise themselves with the platforms that support bots , some news organisations are now trying to personalise their bots more and to find tailored uses for them as opposed to simply broadcasting daily stories through the channel . <p> " What we value most is the time people spend with the bot to discover content , and then they can go and read it wherever they want , " Su+rez said . <p> " We are planning something to convey the results on election night in a more innovative way , and we will run the bot for a few days after the election , but we would like to try and do something else with it after that too . " <p> Update : An earlier version of this article said Politibot was developed by El Espa+ol " it is in fact a project undertaken independently by Su+rez and a team of developers and political scientists . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

The rest use search engines to get what they want . <p> This means that if you 've written a piece about an event in your patch , most people will find it when they are doing a search for ' what 's on in Chester ' and less so by following the link to the story or going to the ' what 's on ' section from your homepage . <p> People actually read your article once they 've found it.It 's no good putting people off your article once they find it by presenting them with a solid block of text . <p> Online audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers and you need to make sure you take advantage of this . <p> Engage with your readers and give them something they ca n't get in print.Whether this is a reader debate , video , Google map or slideshow , make sure you offer online readers something that you ca n't reproduce in a newspaper . <p> Encouraging your readers to comment on suitable stories can help build up a loyal base of readers and make people feel more involved with your website . <p> What are keywords and how should you use them ? If you want more readers to find your stories you 're going to have to make sure Google and other search engines can find them . <p> One of the ways you can ensure they do this is to use relevant ' keywords ' in your copy . <p> Keywords , are the names of places , people , products , companies , events etc. and phrases ( such as protest , murder or robbery ) , that your article is about . <p> Some online writers use globally popular keywords not specifically related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , for instance . If used correctly these can help drive some traffic to your site , but the majority of these visitors will leave very quickly and never return . <p> You should also include as many similar or related phrases and synonyms of your keywords as possible . This makes sure Google really understands what your article is about and will be able to rank it so it 's easier to find . <p> Matt Cutts , a search engine guru and one of Google 's top engineers , explains how to use keywords correctly : " Think about what people are going to type into a search to find your site " and include these words . " <p> But beware of spamglishDo n't start cramming the same keyword into your article over and over again thinking that will help your Google ranking . <p> This is called ' spamglish ' : it will turn readers off and search engines will take a very dim view of it if they find out . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847449 @2047449/ <h> Disrupting the narrative : Telling stories with 360-degree video <p> News organisations such as ABC News , Sky News , The New York Times and Vice News have all started experimenting with virtual reality , but little research has been done to discover what production and delivery methods work best with the audience , and what can be done to improve stories viewed through VR headsets . <p> Sarah Jones , a former television reporter and current academic at Coventry University , presented her findings from recent research undertaken into the role that 360-degree video can play within journalism . <p> Speaking at the 2016 VR UK Festival in London today , Jones said that due to the nature of virtual reality , everyone views and experience the content in different ways . <p> This is challenging journalists to produce immersive stories whilst having no exact idea of how the audience will engage with it . <p> " No one watches it in the same way , " Jones said . <p> " Each time you give someone a VR headset , you see that picture of everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , but you also get everybody exploring the stories in different ways . " <p> Journalists are now left wondering how to best tell a story using this new medium , having to consider a range of factors that may result in breaking all previously established and practised conventions . <p> " Traditional journalism is really easy . <p> " You know what to say , how to put it together , how to illustrate it , and there is this clear structure and linear narrative . <p> " You 're starting with the best shot , you 've got some killer soundbites , a piece to camera and a few graphics " but now we need to think about how we tell a story in 360 degrees . " <p> Although there has been a range of 360-degree videos produced by news organisations in the last 12 months , very little research has been done into what works , and what does n't . <p> Jones chose to gather all the immersive VR news content created last year using 360-degree video and analyse the similarities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a focus group of 18 to 35-year-olds . <p> The 12 videos that Jones used for her study " including Vice News ' Millions March NYC , The New York Times ' Vigila in Paris and Sky News ' Migrant Crisis " were broken down into three different categories according to subject , length and narrative . <h> Similarities and differences in 360-degree storytelling <p> Jones found the videos were similar to each other , in that they focused on an ongoing story where the events were n't going to change dramatically , allowing journalists the time to film and stitch the footage together . <p> " It takes time to produce good content , and it has to be relevant by the time it is released , " Jones said . <p> The average length of the films also differed dramatically to traditional news , anywhere between six minutes and 39 seconds . <p> " There is obviously a limit to how long you could put on a VR headset when viewing 360-degree films , and that is usually 10 minutes , " she said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , you 're looking at a story duration of between one a half and two minutes , but VR content needs to last longer as the user is looking around and needs more time . <p> " So the average duration is about 20 to 30 seconds , rather than the three second shot you would have in television news " you need longer to absorb the story and look around and engage " it is a completely different scenario . " <p> Finally , Jones found that traditional news broadcasters , such as ABC and Sky News , stuck with " comfortable " , reporter-led narratives , whereas other outlets experimented more with character-led stories . <p> " Reporter-led narratives are less of a jump into a new world , " she explained . <p> But when filming in 360-degree mode , news organisations still had to take new considerations into account , such as which camera to look in for pieces to camera when using multiple GoPro lenses , whether the camera should be moving or not , and how best to position the rig at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera moving , " said Jones . <p> " Inside North Korea and Seeking Home both tried to merge normal footage with 360 footage ... which was quite awkward as it distacts from the immersive nature of the film . " <p> Character-led narratives were typically found to have one to three characters , with less scenes than reporter-led stories , and including backgound music and titles . <p> " People do n't often like titles , as it breaks away from that immersive nature of the story , but this is a challenge because it is really important for journalists to be able to contextualise what is going on and give people extra information . " <h> Focus group reactions to 360-degree video <p> Having looked at the differences and similarities between the videos , Jones asked her focus group of young people to tell her what they though about various aspects . <p> " We need to be building immersive journalistic content to reach the younger audience , which is traditionally disengaged with news and traditional news formats . <p> " This is a way to leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones . <p> Using samples of the 12 films she collected , students used a variety of headsets ( all of which worked with a mobile phone ) to evaluate how the footage worked as a piece of journalism , concluding on five main points : <p> The reporter 's presence was distracting <p> Although some members of the focus group preferred the reporter-led narratives to the character-led ones , they found the physical presence of the reporters to be distracting and restrictive . <p> " Participants could n't see the point of having a reporter in the shot , " Jones explained , " and felt they could n't explore as much when they were being guided for what to look at " they were not as free . " <p> " This is interesting because I 've always felt that there was this barrier within traditional television news which could be broken down with immersive 360-degree filming . <p> " But now I 've found that if you 've got the reporter there , they takes the place of the screen and become that barrier between you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that character-led stories were far more engaging overall , allowing the audience to connect directly with the characters in the story . Empathy did not increase <p> Jones found that whilst wearing the headsets , participants felt involved in the stories they were watching , but did n't feel any more empathy than expected . <p> " I 'm still a bit more divided on this , and it needs more research . We talk about it being this ultimate empathy machine , and yet the results are n't backing that up at the moment , " she said . <p> There are no distractions <p> " There is no room for mutitasking when you are using a VR headset , because you have the audience 's focus all the time , " Jones explained . <p> A participant found that " there is no possibility of distractions like there is when you are watching the news . I ca n't play on my tablet or phone whilst occasionally glancing up at the screen " . <p> So for capturing the audience 's attention , VR is a useful tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disconnection that is caused by the television screen because you are doing other things , but if you are immersed in the headset , there is no room for you to do that , " Jones said . <p> Personal space is invaded <p> Surprisingly , members of the group said the only part they " really do n't appreciate " is the fact that the characters in the stories felt visually close and were invading their personal space . <p> " It made them feel uncomfortable , " said Jones . <p> " It made them want to take off their headset when people were passing by very closely " particulary in situations such as a protest , where you 've got people really close to you . <p> " People did n't like that . That is really interesting to me , because I thought that 's what people would enjoy , so that is something we need to be thinking about . " ' FOMO ' " the fear of missing out <p> " Participants continuously felt like they were going to miss something important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Usually you watch the news on television once and that is it . But this is the kind of content that we want to watch repeatedly and make sure we have seen everything " which , of course , raises other questions about its place within journalism . " <p> The results from this research flagged up some important points to take into consideration when producing 360-degree video content for journalism , but highlighted that we still do n't have all the answers . <p> " I thought they would all put their hands up and say ' this is brilliant , we all want to be immersive journalists now , this is the way to go ' , but some of them were still very unsure about where the market is going , and if we can make the improvements needed . " <p> Jones believes that although the platform is n't going to immediately capture everybody , it is a way to engage those switched off from news in a different way . <p> " The question of whether 360-degree filmmaking is a gimmick for journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have a great potential tool , but if it is not done properly , it could be really detrimental , so studies need to be done to see what is working and what people want , " Jone said . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

The leading sales and direct marketing firm are concerned that in today 's competitive market many brands are failing to do enough to boost customer loyalty and are relying on outdated , lazy incentives to support their retention requirements . <p> The firm are worried that a number or brands are struggling to see the bigger picture and understand that in their customers ' lives do not centre on brands and products . With the modern world becoming more stressful and more expensive people are finding it increasingly tough to balance their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations . Visual Connect are adamant that for brands to become more compelling and retain a greater number of customers , their incentives and customer service needs to reflect these factors and offer customers something more meaningful and outside of their regular product inventory . <p> Whilst customers on the whole still welcome the odd money off ' coupon or special product offer , research by loyalty firm Collinson Latitude has suggested that brands doing this as their only means of customer incentive are running the risk of falling behind their competitors . Their research found that customers value choice , with 37% of respondents claiming brands that offer incentives from their own product inventory are old fashioned and outdated , and that 69% believed the value of an incentive scheme drops when the rewards on offer are limited . <p> The research also highlighted the impact a more creative , varied reward scheme can have , with 77% of respondents continuing to happily engage with brands that offer incentives outside of their inventory long after their initial purchase with the brand . <p> From this research and their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant that brands need to think outside the box and offer their customers more intriguing and exciting incentives . As well as boosting customer satisfaction and keeping them engaged , the firm believe that offering creative incentives can display that a brand really understands and cares about the values and needs of their consumer base . For example , Kellogg 's cereals regularly offer coupons for two for one ' entry to UK family attractions . This shows they understand that their core audience is made up largely of busy families who may not always have the money available to spend quality time together . <p> As a direct marketing firm Visual Connect are confident that face-to-face marketing can help brands understand more about their customers ' interests and values and offer the first steps towards offering customers more meaningful incentive and reward schemes .

' There are schools in their areas that are n't that fortunate and savvy , so we encourage them to ' adopt ' five other schools in their communities and share their experiences .

If you consider South Africa and the challenges the country faces , not everybody has equal opportunities , " Petersen said . <p> " The one thing that WeCan24 does , and it 's something I wish I had experienced growing up , is that it levels the playing field .

@@97847467 @2047467/ <h> How to : be a successful freelancer ( part one ) - Pitching <p> When you want to get published in a newspaper , magazine or website , you start by pitching the idea - not the finished article . A common mistake is to write an article then look for an outlet to publish it , but this is not how publications work . <p> The reason for this is that the commissioning editor will have their own ideas about what they want to see in the piece . They 'll know how much space they have available and how many words they need you to write . <p> Start by reading several copies of the section you 're pitching to so you get a sense of what they cover and where there might be opportunities for you . Believe it or not , many people pitch to sections they 've never read . If you want to hit a target , do n't just take aim and fire - do your research first . <p> Think of an idea for the slot you 're targeting - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best person to write about . All publications have writing staff - so why would they pay you to write for them instead ? <p> Submitting Your PitchCall the publication and find out the best person to send your idea to . You can glean information like this from websites and directories , but the media has a high staff turnover so it 's essential to keep checking that you are approaching the right person . <p> Most editors prefer to receive pitches by email . On bigger publications , editors receive many pitches every day and some wo n't even read them if they do n't recognise the writer 's name . <p> Write your pitch and send it . Describe the idea in a few paragraphs ( around 100 words ) and give some details of your professional background and experience ( i.e why they should ask you to write this ) . The idea is more important than your writing experience , but do emphasise any experience that you have . <p> What 's next after you 've submitted your pitch ? Responses vary enormously . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two if it 's a daily newspaper , perhaps a few weeks if it 's a monthly magazine . If you do n't hear anything you can take it that they 're not interested or the email has n't been read . The editor will not have time to give you feedback if your idea is not suitable . <p> If you do n't hear anything , you can always follow up with a phone call or a short email . If an idea is time sensitive , some writers phone up soon after they 've sent the pitch . They might say ' My email 's been playing up so I 'm just checking you received this ' but really this is just an excuse to get closer to the editor and start to build up a relationship . <p> Another follow up could be to pitch the same idea to another publication , tweaking it to make it relevant to the new recipient . <p> Do n't call usPitches are similar to press releases in that you do need to be sending them consistently to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers say they have a hit rate of only 1 in 10 pitches getting commissioned , so do n't despair if you are pitching stuff and getting no response . Your hit rate should in theory be much higher if you target lower profile publications . But ultimately it is a numbers game , sugared with a teaspoon of luck , and persistence will lead to success . <p> Finally , tweet or not to tweet ? By all means follow editors on Twitter to see what they 're interested in and hopefully start to build a relationship . Twitter can be great for gaining access to people who are unreachable by other means . But be aware that if you choose to pitch via Twitter with a public @ , then many people will be able to see what you 've pitched . And if you get a ' no ' , a public rejection is n't at all nice . Maybe it 's better to start chatting via Twitter , but take your pitches into the privacy of DMs or email .

There is also the built-in Export function , which allows you to take a snapshot of your site 's entire content , including custom pages , categories and tags . <p> Once you 've installed Wordpress and found a suitable theme to customise its look and feel ( Paul Deach says " I decided to use the default theme as it works so well , " adding " it is not the theme that drives and retains traffic to the site , it is regular relevant content that does that " ) you then need to concentrate on the site 's focus . This , in turn , will determine whether your content is curated ( i.e. gathered from elsewhere , perhaps publishing an excerpt with a link to the source ) , or whether it is original to your site . <p> On the topic of curated content , Phyllis Stephen says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which incorporate tweets so it is important to keep tweeting and engaging with people out there .

" I have integrated a Twitter feed into the site which is very simple to do , " says Paul Deach .

@@97847479 @2047479/ <h> How to : publicise yourself as a freelancer <p> One of the best and also the worst things about freelance journalism is that anyone can join in , which makes for a very big crowd . Often the best journalists make the worst sales people leaving the field open to those whose ability to blag commissions greatly exceeds their talents . How then to stand out from the crowd and impress those commissioning editors ? <p> A freelance journalist 's pitch becomes much easier if an editor knows who you are before you approach them . <p> On the whole websites are a good way for publicising yourself . Last month I had an approach from a new ( to me ) magazine with a -360 commission - they had found me through my website which only costs around -20 per year to maintain ( excluding my own time and there is not much of that involved ) . <p> If you are not a savvy designer and can not afford to get a professionally built site there are a lot of basic web packages out there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> People with Macs can download RapidWeaver from Realmac software - although you can also get Apple 's own iWeb for a similar price . A site using something other than the market leader will give you less of an identikit look . <p> When putting the site together , it is worth getting input from non-journalists . I had had lots of complements about my site but only when I showed it to someone outside the trade did they tell me that it looked like a vanity site . <p> " It 's not clear whether you 're telling PRs about your commissions , asking editors to give you some work or just showing off , " he said . <p> His answer was to start off with an over-arching page with buttons saying ' editors enter here ' , ' PRs enter here ' and divide the rest into sub-pages . <p> Getting people to your website is not the art that it was - link to as many colleagues and relevant sites as you can . The reason for this is that they will probably link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine - prioritises websites in search results according to how many other sites are linking to them . Link to loads and you are likely to come out on top of your search . <p> Make sure you have a decent web address and email address too : a service like Easily.co.uk will reserve **26;267;TOOLONG and for -9.99 per year ( that 's what I pay for Clapperton.co.uk and for another tenner they forward mails addressed to Guy@Clapperton.co.uk to guy.clapperton@gmail.com or wherever else I want it ) . <p> Having a ' serious ' web address works well when you are selling corporate writing skills rather than straight journalism . The clients are likely to be PRs or at least in marketing and they respond to a bit of image . The rewards can be high : with luck you can ask for 100 per cent more of a word rate than you would get in the ordinary media ; but you will also get twice the hassle in instances where clients like what you write but ' it 's not quite what they had in mind ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ; this is where a lot of journalists ' blogs and websites fall down . Many of them only list the journalist 's achievements and the places where they have been published . But a potential client will want to know exactly what they will be getting if they hire you . So some examples of your writing , a description of your methodology , an indication of your rates are all additional information that might help you land that deal . <p> Some journalists find the blog invaluable rather than just helpful . Blogger and freelancer Graham Holliday said that the last three commissioning editors he had contacted prior to this article being researched all knew him through the blog . <p> The trick , as always , is to have something to say on a blog before you set one up . Costs can be minimal ; if you have an ISP which offers web space and a package like the ones mentioned above , you will have everything you need already paid for . <p> However it is best to avoid writing just anything . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to published stories instead of just blogging when you have a story in the national press - and keep it up to date so people know you are still active . <p> It might be worth noting that my own success rate in selling ideas on the strength of such links shot up when I took my friend 's advice and put the first paragraph of each story on my page as well as a link to the full version . <p> Simone Castello , a freelance sub , spent her first few months methodically putting a database together and then offering her services to fill the breach immediately someone was advertising . <p> She kept her database up to date by scouring mastheads and browsing internal contact lists whenever employed on site somewhere ; more recently she became involved in an online forum for sub-editors to enhance her profile . <p> One hint she offers is to keep an eye on ABC lists . " You know how a magazine is doing , " she says - and you wil not be offering your services to something in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to technology and the established ways of building contacts are often undervalued . <p> Simon Read , personal finance specialist for the People , has tried a lot of the online approaches but still finds most of his work comes from personal contacts made by talking to people . He has appeared on TV and radio by ensuring he 's at the right parties and filling the right glasses with champagne . <p> " I 've tried all the usual sort of things like online listings and found a much better bet is the personal approach , going to events and making yourself known to people , " he said . <p> Press parties and press conferences are all opportunities to make yourself known as well as getting a story - have a stock of business cards and put a photo of yourself on your website so that people will recognise you when they find the card in their pocket and ca n't remember who you were . <p> Robert Schifreen , a former editor turned freelance , is another one for the traditional approach . <p> " By far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to send me ideas for articles or stories , accompanied by links to previously published work , " he said . <p> A side effect of much of this sort of self-promotion - and nobody else is going to do it for you - can be that the requests for TV work , radio work and public speaking will increase . This is fine but depending on your field the money can be terrible . The thing to remember is that this can still lead to more work , albeit indirectly . <p> Mr Schifreen said : " I guess it 's all brand building and if someone wants a security expert for a conference then my name is likely to be in their mind . " <p> Overall there are no rules but it remains important to remember that nobody is going to market you for free and just sending floods of business cards and mailers to editors who are already flooded with PR material is unlikely to work . A more tailored , creative approach across many fronts is likely to produce better results . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847486 @2047486/ <p> In parts one and two we look at pitching . Now let 's talk money . I find that the biggest mistake freelancers make is not to mention fees at all . Why is that ? It 's not exactly vulgar to expect to be paid a decent rate for the work you do . <p> Why do so many freelancers find negotiating rates so hard ? Money is an awkward subject for many people . Part of the problem is that we tend to personalise money issues too much . If you 're freelance it 's particularly easy to fall into the trap of measuring your own sense of self worth and self-esteem by what you 're getting paid . If you get a well paying job you feel great , if you 're having a dry patch then it 's easy to let your self esteem plummet . <p> A survey in 2007 on levels of happiness at work found that some of the people in higher paying jobs - the managers , lawyers and bankers - were the least happy , whereas those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled . <p> So having a higher salary does n't necessarily make you a happier worker . But as a freelancer , depending on how you work , your income can be unpredictable - it 's easy to get into that feast or famine cycle , when you either have too much work or not enough . And if that 's how you 're living and working , you have to be a fairly strong person not to internalise all of that to a degree . <p> It 's not surprising that many freelancers say that their confidence levels can go up and down depending on how things are going workwise . <p> Some of our day-to-day relationships with money can be very straightforward . You go into a shop , you see a price on something and that 's what you pay . Have you ever gone into a shop where they do n't have the prices on anything ? What runs through your mind then ? We tend to assume that it 's going to be too expensive . And this can be a rather uncomfortable feeling - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that 's what can be hard about negotiating rates - we 're right in the middle of that sense of not knowing . You do n't want to quote too high and maybe lose the job , but equally you do n't want to quote too low and risk missing out . <p> And sometimes , if it 's a job you 're really excited about doing , especially if you 've been pitching a lot and not getting any reply , it 's easy to forget to ask about rates . Have you ever agreed to do some work without agreeing a rate ? I think we all have at one point or another.Remember that if a potential client likes your work enough to hire you , they wo n't say no just because you ask about rates . That is how professionals operate - they clarify what the rates are . <p> The rate you get will depend on several factors , and sometimes one of those will be what the person hiring you thinks they can get away with . So how you communicate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on the rate you get . <p> There is always someone who will do the job cheaper than you . Negotiating on price rarely ends well . However , there may not be anyone who does the job better than you . And people will pay more if they believe in the value of what you 're offering and if they want it enough . <p> Are you wearing the cheapest clothes you could find ? Are you using the cheapest computer you could buy ? You probably took lots of other things into consideration when you were buying , just as there are other factors that come into play when someone decides to buy your services . <p> Before negotiating rates : <p> Write down what you want/need to earn in a year to work out your own daily rate . Be aware of what your own bottom line is - feel proud of the rates you charge . <p> Do your homework - know what to expect before you pitch to a client . Research both the client and current rates for the job . Ask your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . <p> Be aware of industry rates in both the work you do now and the work you intend to do in the next few years . <p> A website will build your credibility which will help you in negotiations . <p> Be aware of your own money issues that may be holding you back from earning more . You must have the conversation about rates with yourself before you have it with anybody else . Asking for a particular rate should be done in as neutral a way as possible - as if you were saying your phone number . <p> During negotiations : <p> Ask lots of questions about the job before you get to rates - clarify what 's involved , deadline , etc . Show that you are interested in the quality of the project . Do n't just focus on the rate . Find out what the client needs to feel they have made a good investment . <p> Do n't assume what the rate will be , always ask . Otherwise , you may only get the minimum payment by default . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always ask ' What is the budget ? /what are your usual rates ' etc . Depersonalise your language . <p> If pressed for a rate , give a fairly broad range and do n't quote anything until you 've established the parameters of the job . Be business-like : do n't just pluck a figure out of the air . <p> If you believe a job is worth more , say so and stick to your guns . If what you 're offered is fair and in line with what you were expecting , accept it . Do n't assume that you need to haggle every time . <p> Do n't be afraid to say no if the rate is not up to scratch - and there are times that you will have to say no , in order to have space to pursue better paying work . <p> For a new client , find out immediately what the payment and accounts process is . <p> If you 're offered a low rate : <p> Do n't necessarily dismiss it out of hand if there are other attractions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either .

@@97847487 @2047487/ <h> Screencast : using online tools to transcribe audio <p> As a journalist , finding ways to transcribe interviews as quickly as possible , while ensuring accuracy , is very important . <p> And as with many journalistic tasks , there are web tools ready and waiting to help save you time . In this week 's screencast we look at two examples : Transcribe and oTranscribe . <p> Below are written instructions on their different features , based on the video tutorial above . Both should be used in Chrome , although oTranscribe can also be used in Safari . <p> Transcribe <p> 1 . Visit transcribe.wreally.com ( you will need to pay an annual subscription of $20 ( -11.88 ) to use the platform ) . <p> 2 . Add your audio . Transcribe outlines the different formats it accepts . If you were to use an unsupported format you may find it has no sound . Do n't panic " you just need to convert it to a valid format . <p> 3 . You can play your audio with by pressing the play button or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also fast forward ( F4 ) , rewind ( F3 ) and you can also speed up ( F2 ) and slow down your audio ( F1 ) . <p> 5 . There are a number of ways to highlight certain parts of your transcript . For example , you can make text bold and put it in italics , and underline it . You can also add bullet points and numbered bullet points . And you can add links by highlighting text and hitting the hyperlink button . <p> 7 . When you have finished you can save your transcript as a text document , or just copy and paste the text out of Transcribe . <p> 8 . A great feature of Transcribe is that even if you leave your browser or accidentally hit back , Transcribe will keep your text in the box the next time you go to use the tool . You will have to add your audio file in again , but you wo n't lose your transcription , which can be a life saver ! <p> 9 . It is also worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet too " , so once you have set up the page , you can move offline to carry on with your transcription , such as while you are on the train . <p> 2 . This platform let 's you transcribe both audio and video , which is handy if you want to transcribe a filmed interview for example , and saves you having to have already exported it as audio only . So again , you find your media file , and insert it . <p> 3 . Again you have the ability to play , using the Escape shortcut again , or rewind and jump forward . <p> 4 . You can also make text bold , which you can do by either pressing the bold button or using the standard keyboard shortcut of control b , or command b on a mac , same for putting text into italics . <p> 5 . Just like Transcribe , you can also add timestamps to mark your work in oTranscribe with the relevant time of the audio . And these timestamps are interactive , so you can click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forward to that point . <p> Journalists can perhaps use this to either listen to their audio in full first , hitting timestamp at the most interesting points they then want to go back and transcribe , or use it while they are transcribing , so they remember where those parts were in case they need to go back , or edit out that soundbite in audio editing software . <p> 6 . You can then either copy and paste your text out of the platform , or turn the transcript into a markdown or text doc . Or you can send it to Google Drive , once you have linked up your Google Drive account , which is great for collaborative projects in particular . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> The four year old publisher often uses smartphones to broadcast live when out in the field during breaking news , but is taking advantage of the Facebook Live API that enables users to stream video from professional DSLR cameras and multi-camera set-ups . <p> " It has been a really big step for us , because it allows us to tell a story in a better quality , and to show certain things , like a panel conversation for example , that we would n't want to do with one camera , " said Kurtzman . <p> " But if we do use phones , we do n't find that the content ever suffers " if we are telling an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> By using the Live:Air Solo app , which allows them to switch between shots , stream footage from their computers and add graphics and text , the core team of three producers behind Facebook Live at NowThis is able to use existing videos that they already have pre-recorded to heighten live videos . <p> " Sometimes people write in the comments that they do n't believe we 're live because it is so highly produced , and we sometimes respond to them directly to prove it , " said Kurtzman . <p> " When you demonstrate to your audience that you 're listening to them and that it 's a two-way conversation , the engagement shoots up , it 's incredible actually . <p> " People like to know that they 're being heard , and when you are interacting with them or using their questions towards the interviewee , or just saying ' so and so had a really interesting point to say about this ' , they know their voice is being heard by thousands of people that they do n't know but who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that audiences are also drawn in by great visuals because they make streams entertaining to watch , such as when they streamed a man climbing the side of the Trump Tower , or when they tried Olympic cupping live in the studio , which was fun but also relevant to the news agenda . <p> Each scheduled live stream is monitored by a member of staff on a desktop computer and one or two others operating the cameras , while it is presented by one of a number of producers at NowThis . <p> The team looks to improve the streams , with staff giving each other regular feedback . The presenters are even attending a workshop at the end of August with an improvisation coach to help them be more comfortable ad-libbing on camera . <p> But the logistical elements of producing the streams have not been as challenging as tackling the technology , said Kurtzman . <p> " We 've learned a lot from the technical issues that come from this being so new . Our cameras were dropping out a lot at the beginning as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we have switched to a private router to help prevent those issues " the internet is never as reliable as you want it to be . <p> " When we filmed the Republican and Democrat conventions , we did n't have quite a reliable connection there , so what we ended up doing was downgrading the quality to 720p instead of 1080p . <p> " But if it means getting a stream that is not cutting out versus having a really choppy stream , I 'd always rather downgrade the quality because people are mainly watching on their phones . " <p> Kurtzman explained the story is still the most important thing , and that experimenting with different types of content will help publishers find out what their audiences want . <p> " I like to tell my camera operators to make it feel like the presenter is FaceTiming the audience through our cameras , as we want our audience to feel like we want them here with us , " she said . <p> " Now publishers are fortunate enough to hear back live from the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they want to know , so my advice to publishers would be to lean into that and embrace all of the tricks and the quirks of Facebook Live . <p> " Do n't condescend to your audience by giving something that is half-arsed " be smart and make something that looks good .

These are due for renewal in October 2016 , so the team is toying with different ideas to keep its paying readers interested , such as launching a new product closer to the time or revamping El Espa+ol 's subscriber-only product , La Edici+n . <p> La Edici+n can be accessed through a portal on the website and has the format of a digital newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early access to exclusive stories summarised at 10pm before they become available in full to all readers the following day . <p> However , Ram+rez said the number of subscribers has not increased much since the launch " the outlet currently counts " around 12,000 " paying readers . <p> " Part of the reason is that people in Spain are not used to paying for news , especially online , and those who are subscribing are doing so because they associate it with belonging to a community , which is the main reason why they subscribed in the beginning . <p> " I think it 's not that easy to pursue both high traffic and subscriptions .

@@97847490 @2047490/ <p> Malcolm Coles , the outlet 's director of digital media , said the organisation is trying to " create reusable assets " so that journalists can be more efficient in how they plan their coverage and report on stories . <p> Speaking at the Digital Media Strategies event in London on Monday ( 7 March ) , he explained how The Telegraph 's ' new formats ' team of four , created in the spring of 2015 , works with a small group of developers to plan and build new tools that can then be shared with the rest of the newsroom . <p> " When news happens , lots of newsrooms will have somebody doing a timeline , another person doing an explainer , someone else writing the story , so you end up having people write about the same thing at the same time . <p> " Journalists also assume readers know everything that 's been previously written on that topic , " Coles said . <p> The Telegraph has tried to solve some of these issues by creating a collection of embeds , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be quickly put together by journalists as the story requires them " " we want to support different levels of understanding among our readers " , he explained . <p> They can be created for news events that are known in advance or likely to repeat themselves in the future , and journalists can collaborate on their production when news breaks . <p> " So when a new story happens , instead of publishing ten articles on the same topic , we can take any updates or new developments and embed them into that one article where the audience is , " Coles explained . <p> He said The Telegraph divides the new tools it releases for the newsroom into three categories : <p> formats that do n't get much use and are only tried out by a few people ; <p> those that are fairly used , which leads to developers building an admin interface outside of the CMS , but which eventually stop working ; <p> successful formats , where someone in the organisation comes up with a better way to make use of the respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prioritising resources for the right tools <p> But how do they know if these new additions to the newsroom actually help journalists ? One of the challenges faced by the team is getting the embeds to work across the different platforms The Telegraph uses to distribute its content , Coles added . <p> Overall however , the embeds have increased engagement time by 25 per cent on the outlet 's most popular stories , and by an average of 15 per cent across the rest of the website . They have also made the process of publishing breaking news faster . <p> The organisation is in the process of rolling out a new , more efficient CMS , and it is experimenting with an internal Slack bot that works out how many embeds are being put into an article and automatically sends a message to the author to suggest other relevant elements that could add value to the story , such as a timeline or an explainer . <h> The ' wider audience ' versus Telegraph ' customers ' <p> The Telegraph divides its audience into four segments , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . <p> Readers who have only visited the website once over the last 30 days are referred to as the ' wider audience ' , whereas those who come regularly but only bring a few pages per visit are ' casual readers ' . <p> On the opposite spectrum are what the outlet calls ' bingers ' , or people who generate many page views but who do n't come to the site on a regular basis , and lastly , ' customers ' , The Telegraph 's most engaged visitors . <p> " We want to help our journalists understand what the spread is between those four categories of their audience , and what the distribution of traffic is throughout the day , what times different people turn up to read their content . <p> " But we also want to help them understand what does n't work so well , so they can stop doing it , " Coles said . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" I 'm sure there are going to be some things that CNN embraces that probably are n't going to be as successful as others . <p> " You ca n't necessarily jump on everything but you can sort of hedge your bets on the things that make sense . " <p> The organisation , Demaria explained , looks primarily to three elements for development : the mobile offering , newsgathering practices , and digital video . " And they are all intertwined , " he added , with mobile video playing a key part . Data at the centre of change <p> " What 's trending now in terms of audience behaviour in 2015 is different to what it was in 2014 ... and different looking forward to 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of traffic comes from mobile devices " and this figure can jump to around 70 or 80 per cent during the weekends . <p> " There 's a different sort of audience behaviour around mobile even on weekends , " Demaria said , adding that understanding and adjusting to that behaviour is key . <p> Data has played an important role in taking CNN 's legacy as a broadcaster and adapting that to new digital platforms . Analytics inform CNN of the subjects that attract most readers or viewers and could be transformed into individual verticals , such as CNN Style , which launched in July . <p> " With Nigeria , 80 per cent of our users get their content on mobile , " highlighted Demaria as an example . " But then we start to factor in what things they 're interested in , what sorts of videos they 're watching , how can we present more of those videos , how can we make sure those videos suit how they 're watching on mobile . <p> " So that 's a very specific example of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" <p> CNN 's activity on Snapchat Discover also highlighted more unexpected audience behaviours " while some have raised concerns about the way news would fit in with the rest of the content on the messaging app , those who watch CNN 's channel have a big appetite for hard news stories , revealed Demaria . <p> For CNN as for many news organisations , " social has broken down barriers , " he said . <p> Inga Thordar , editorial and programming director for CNN International Digital , will be speaking at news:rewired on 1 December about the broadcaster 's approach to mobile news , alongside experts from the Guardian , The Washington Post and BuzzFeed News .

" <p> One of these brand new segments is Cereal , a daily Facebook Live broadcast that kicks off at 11am ET .

After that , one of the Two-Way bloggers speaks to a newscaster about the headlines , before they connect with another reporter , either from the building or through a Skype video call , to do a deep-dive into one of the stories . <p> " It allows us to work in a lot of different news that might otherwise be hard to provide in Facebook Live format . <p> " A lot of times we have connectivity issues with people in breaking news situations , where we ca n't get the video signal strong enough for Facebook Live , so video Skypeing some people through Cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Knowing as much as possible makes you look prepared and interested in the person you 're interviewing . It also reduces the likelihood of any awkward situations or misjudged questions that could result in your interviewee clamming up . I once interviewed someone who had a prosthetic right arm ( something I only found out during my research ) . Being unaware of this fact could have made greeting the person awkward and could have set the interview off on the wrong foot . Researching people before you talk to them is essential to getting the most from an interview and ensuring things run smoothly . <p> Reliable recording kitDecent recording kit is essential .

Whichever recording devices you decide on , make sure that you know how to use them , and charge them fully before an interview.Plan your questions Plan the questions you 'd like to ask beforehand and print them out in the order you would like to ask them . If the person you 're interviewing goes off on an interesting tangent that you want to pursue , having your questions in front of you will help to get the conversation back on course .

If you have a time limit , prioritise your questions accordingly . <p> Putting people at easeUnless you 're after a provoked reaction , the best way to get people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up . Explaining the purpose of the interview before you start can help to put people at ease . Some people are nervous of being recorded but often relax into things when you explain that it 's purely for transcription purposes .

@@97847507 @2047507/ <h> How to : tame your RSS sources using Feed Rinse <p> Earlier this month , we looked at using Yahoo ! Pipes to create a pre-filtered aggregation of RSS feeds . The exercise was intended primarily to help demystify Pipes ' offputting ( but nonetheless cool ) graphical interface , rather than presenting Pipes as the paradigm solution for feed filtration and aggregation . <p> But there are good reasons why filtering and aggregating your feeds might be your main goal , rather than learning to use Pipes . You might , for example , as part of your news or feature research , be monitoring a number of blogs via their RSS feeds . Bloggers often post on a wide range of subjects , placing their posts under particular categories or tags , and you might only be interested in posts that appear in certain categories . The same applies to a lot of news sites . By filtering each feed and combining them , you can end up with a single feed with just the type of posts or stories you need . <p> Pipes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to manage a large number of feeds , your Pipe will soon begin to look like a bowl of spaghetti . Fortunately , on the web , there is always more than one way to skin a cat . <p> Another web-based ( and free ) solution is Feed Rinse . Feed Rinse has a far simpler interface than Pipes and you can achieve the same goal as our original Pipe exercise in half the time . <p> Figure 1 <p> To get started , you first need to create an account . Click the green " Sign Up " link or the orange " Sign up now " button at the bottom of the home page ( figure 1 ) . <p> You will then be prompted to set up a username and password and enter your email address . Submit those details and click the orange button " Let 's get started " . <p> You will now be presented with a page where you can enter your feeds . You have the choice of entering them in a list , one feed per line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ( If you use a desktop RSS reader , you can usually export all the feeds you have susbcribed to an OPML file . ) <p> Figure 2 <p> Once you have entered or uploaded your feed information , click submit . You can now set up filtering rules for each of your feeds . Click the " Set up rules " button next to your first feed and enter the criteria by which you want to filter your feed . In our example , we are going to allow posts that appear under several categories , so we select " allow the post " " if any " " tag " " contains " and then enter the categories ( tags ) of posts we want to appear in our feed ( figure 3 ) . You only need to apply rules specific to each of your feeds ; you can apply some generic rules later ( see below ) . <p> TIP : To find out what categories/tags a blog or news publisher is using , you can view the source code of their RSS feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . <p> Figure 3 <p> You can also use rules to filter by keyword . To add new rules , click the orange plus sign to add new rules , the orange minus sign to remove them . Once you have set up your rules , click the " Save changes " button . <p> Figure 4 <p> The next step is to create a ' channel ' ( this is the aggregation part ) . Click on the " your channels " tab ; name your channel ( figure 4 ) and add the feeds you want to include ( figure 5 ) . ( Click the orange plus button to add more feed options ; select the feed to be included from the dropdown menu . ) Save changes . <p> Figure 5 <p> Figure 6 <p> If you now click on the " your channels " tab and then the " Modify channels button " ( figure 6 ) , you will see you now have the option of adding a filter to your channel ( figure 7 ) . In this case we have added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin " Links for ... " <p> Figure 7 <p> Save changes . You have now created your filtered and aggregated feed . To access it , click the orange RSS feed icon next to your channel name , and select an option from the dropdown menu to add it to your RSS reader . If you just want to access the feed URL select " Other " and it should load in your browser window , allowing you to cut and paste the feed URL from there ( figure 8 ) . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847508 @2047508/ <p> Protecting sources is one of journalism 's central tenets . But in a world with sweeping legal powers and global surveillance , it is also one that is only getting harder , says James Ball , the Guardian 's data editor . <p> Earlier this week he gave a presentation to Hacks/Hackers London ( via Skype ) , a meet-up group of journalists and technologists , on how to communicate securely with sources , particularly whistleblowers , sharing his experiences of when it is necessary to communicate securely , why cumbersome security procedures may lead to breaches , and why burner phones may gain the attention of those monitoring communications . <p> Here are seven lessons shared by Ball : <p> 1 . Making contact : The source may give away information when contacting the journalist <p> A source may give away details as to his or her identity as they track down and make contact with a journalist . In which case there is not much the reporter can do to protect them as security may already be compromised . <p> " If sources have taken material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way they first contacted you , if they have done that from a system they do n't control , be it their work computer or work mobile , you will not be able to retroactively help them . So a large part of our role is actually being very honest in what we can and ca n't do . " 2 . Keeping safe : Follow the source 's lead and assume messages are being intercepted <p> Once contact has been made , the next step is to ensure the source remains anonymous . A journalist will often follow the source 's lead , Ball said . <p> " If you have a source who very cleverly contacts you through an anonymised system , do n't then phone up or email your editor , " he said . <p> " Given what we know and are learning about NSA and GCHQ you essentially should be working on the assumption that anything you say via phone , email , or text is going to be intercepted . " <p> Ball said it may well be an overly cautious approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start from " . <p> 3 . Protecting your material : Identify how to communicate around documents or data <p> A journalist may be trying to protect leaked documents rather than an individual , perhaps to avoid injunctions , Ball explained <p> In this case " you have a very different set of priorities , and the way you try and communicate may be quite different . " <p> If the aim is to protect material rather than a person , he said it is important to work out what your goal is and why you are communicating securely . 4 . It is not practical to communicate securely all the time <p> Ball said that it is important to use sound judgement when you need to communicate securely as it is impractical to rely solely on face-to-face meets . <p> The less glamourous side to these stories is that you are usually left waiting in the cold , you usually end up pissed off , and you usually wish you had an iPhoneJames Ball , the Guardian <p> " It 's really important " and this is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely all the time , " he said . <p> " Not being able to pick up a phone , not being able to use email gets expensive . You have to fly around to have conversations , you have to use encrypted chats ( which go down all the time ) , you have to do all sorts of things that are very difficult . It makes life miserable and it stops you being able to work and cooperate effectively . <p> " You have to know when to use security and when not to , when it 's appropriate and when it is n't , when it will just make you ineffective . " <p> To judge when to communicate securely you need to look at who you are dealing with . Ball advises taking legal advice to make sure you have handled and tracked material in an appropriate way . <p> " For example , a very basic thing is if you are doing something based on documents and you want to make it harder for them to be obtained , do you say you have possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or similar , or do you say that you have had sight of documents ? " <p> Principles <p> For obvious reasons Ball could not share a list of the security measures he takes when carrying out investigations . " I would love to list to you now everything the Guardian does or does n't use and why , but even that in itself is useful information . " <p> But he did give some general principles . 5 . Open source is better than closed <p> " Open source is better than commercial , " Ball said . Commercial platforms may be in a position where they have " voluntarily or been compelled to make deals to create ' back doors ' and you will not be in a position to know " , Ball said . <p> " Lots of open source security software has vulnerabilities , but it 's a lot harder for these conscious back doors to exist . " <p> Ball recommends using anonymous web browser Tor " but says its essential to learn to use it correctly . " If you are using Tor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are using it incorrectly , " he said explaining how he has seen people using Tor and then logging into Gmail which compromises security . <p> Tor also provides an example of the problematic nature of staying secure , in that " Tor makes your internet traffic really slow " , Ball added . <p> He explained how when he worked with WikiLeaks he was based in a manor house in Norfolk . " It was a slow internet connection to start with . And by the time we had run three security measures , it would slow to a standstill for about 20 minutes about once an hour . " 6 . Are your security principles workable ? <p> It is sometimes not appropriate to carry a mobile phone as location details can be intercepted , hacked and tracked . <p> Ball explained that he was once stuck for two hours at midnight at a train station in Diss did not have a phone , laptop or access to emails . <p> " The less glamorous side to these stories is that you are usually left waiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you usually wish you had an iPhone . " <p> He suggests making a security plan presuming the project may go on for some time . <p> " When you are setting down your security principles and the way you are going to approach a story , you do a lot better if you think about it first , " Ball said . <p> A lot of the time the thing you do to make yourself secure is what flags you upJames Ball , the Guardian <p> " It might extend for four weeks , for six weeks , in which case people are going to be tired and the right IT person is n't always going to be around . <p> " Are your security procedures cumbersome or are they pared down to the minimum ? Is someone who is really tired at 11pm , just trying to get something done urgently , going to follow them or are the procedures so slow and so awkward that they are going to be tempted to break them ? When you make the rules that 's the balance you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream people who will always follow it , and if you look at how any hacker or alleged hacker got arrested , it 's usually not because they did n't have security set up , it 's because they did n't use it , perhaps once for five minutes when they were tired . " <p> Ball said there are always " lots of people happy to pontificate on security in great detail with almost no regard to how real people use computers or what they understand or what they do n't " . <p> " We need security that we can understand and use day-to-day , " he said . 7 . Burner phones are not necessarily as sensible as The Wire might make out <p> Anyone familiar with US TV series The Wire will be aware of the burner phone , a pay-as-you go mobile with no name registered to it that is used to communicate a few times and then dispose of . <p> Ball said you first need to think about your regular phone . " You 'll have phoned your bank on it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and it all ties up into this huge big web . Any new phone after a week or two will be part of a huge tangled connection of thousands and thousands of phones . A burner phone , on the other hand , may only ever link up to one or two other phones , it never touches the network . <p> " But imagine you are some hypothetical organisation that was collecting data on every single phone call . You could very easily build an algorithm that found those phones and concentrated on them . <p> " Let 's say the phones always gave out their location , which of course they do , it would be very easy to check if there are any phones like that within a mile of where you are known to be and trace you . <p> " And this is kind of the issue with security . A lot of the time the thing you do to make yourself secure is what flags you up . It 's a horrible moveable feast , lots of things you think you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . But it 's all about trying to be proportionate , remembering what you are trying to do , using free open software , and urging any really super-smart hacker-types you know to build stuff that real humans can use .

@@97847513 @2047513/ <h> How to : use search engines for precision surfing <p> You have a few hours left to wrap up the research on a feature . You 've covered every angle but you 're hooked into Google to try and find one more nugget of information to pull everything together . Here are a few ideas to make sure you put your trust in good judgement rather than good luck . <p> 1 " First steps - different tools for different jobs . <p> Although Google is by far the most popular search engine it is not the best for every search and may be a poor choice for ' background ' work on new topics . Imagine you 've been commissioned to write an article about the illness caused by the norovirus . This is sometimes called the ' winter vomiting bug ' and causes outbreaks of sickness in hospitals and cruise ships . <p> Type the term ' norovirus ' into Google and you find official government pages and general fact sheets dominate the first 20 results . These 20 results also include a handful of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These tools may help you focus faster : <p> - - - alltheweb 's new ' livesearch ' engine provides search results alongside alternative search queries - as you type . This means you do n't have the laborious task of adjusting search terms . The range of alternative terms , for example , include ' norovirus outbreak ' and ' symptoms ' . <p> - - - You can also use Kartoo to choose from a range of suggested linked ' topics ' . Kartoo also lists linked search terms within visual ' maps ' that plot results within these maps and indicate how they relate to each other . As you highlight a result a small preview of the page appears in the left hand column . <p> - - - Clusty ' clusters ' results according to sub headings . Enter ' norovirus ' into Clusty and the suggested clusters include litigation ' , outbreak ' and cruise ships ' . Click on cruise ships ' and you 're given a range of further sub-headings that include passengers and crew ' and- gastroenteritis outbreaks ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for how a story has developed . Enter norovirus ' here and it displays a graph showing search trends for that term . Major news stories related to the search term are plotted on the graph . Interest in norovirus ' peaked when the virus hit the QE2 cruise in January this year . <p> Kartoo and Clusty are two of many ' meta-search ' tools which aggregate results from a range of search engines and display the results in different ways . Ixquick is another option . But while meta search engines are a great way to narrow your search , they are n't precise enough for detailed trawls . This is because meta search tools pull in just a few dozen results from major search engines . The gem of information you are looking for may be impossible to find no matter how many times you refine the search term . <p> 2 - Starting to focus <p> To narrow your focus further on specific angles we need to turn to specific commands . This section describes those you can use with Google although many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines . <p> Google will only return hits that include all your search terms so using the Boolean search term ' AND ' is not necessary . Google normally ignores small words however , so occasionally you may need to force it to include some words by using the ' plus ' symbol . For example , a search for ' charles I ' returns more results if you force it to include ' I ' in the search . <p> Other commands you can use : <p> - - - Force Google to exclude words . By using ' norovirus -cruise ' we can search for pages that do n't include information about outbreaks on cruise ships. - - - - Use the command ' OR ' to search for pages that contain either of two terms . For example , the search ' norovirus qe2 OR qeII ' allows for the fact that the cruise ship is described in two ways . Remember - Google is not case sensitive . - - - You may need to search for whole phrases . Do this using double quote marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact phrase and not just pages that contain both of those words . <p> Finally , always remember that you can use the ' search within results ' tool at the bottom of Google 's results page . The search ' norovirus qe2 OR qeII ' returns 805 hits . A search for ' litigation ' within those results returns 85 hits to explore . <p> A very neat solution to focusing your search in a niche area is to create a ' searchroll ' . At Rollyo you can create a ' roll ' of sites and then conduct searches only within those . Your ' searchroll ' can even be added to your Firefox browser search bar . 3 - Google mining <p> Sometimes , however , you need to be more precise . In these cases you can use a range of Google tools that can help you identify specific pages and documents containing precise terms . The first place to look is Google 's ' advanced search ' option . Here you can specify terms to include , exclude and exact phrases . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PDF , Word , Excel etc ) or from specific domains . You can also specify where on the page the search term appears ( in the page title or the content for example ) and you can specify the date range when the page was indexed or reindexed . <p> Other search tools bring together a range of additional Google features into one search window . These include Soople.com and Faganfinder . <p> While these advanced pages are useful you can also use a range of advanced search ' operators ' to hone results down . Once you get used to them you 'll wonder how you managed without . <p> Type these operator commands into Google 's normal search field before the search term you want to use . Here is a range of the most useful Google advanced operators . Some of these are n't available as an option in Google 's advanced search page . The operators ' are highlighted . <p> - - - norovirus site:www.hpa.org.uk - this restricts the search to pages from the Health Protection Agency 's site . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( you need to use this operator in combination with a search term ) . - - - inurl:norovirus - will only look for urls that contain the word norovirus . This search : ' inurl:norovirus qe2 ' will look for urls containing norovirus and the term ' qe2 ' anywhere on the page . - - - norovirus filetype:pdf - will look only in PDF documents for your term .

This operator also works for specific pages . To find out who links to HPA 's page on the norovirus use this : link : LONG ...

Picture it in your mind . What kind of site will it be in ? What does the document look like ? Once you 've done that , combine the free and powerful tools available to hunt it down . Here are a few examples . <p> Recently I explored the reintroduction of wild species in Scotland and I wanted to know how many sea eagles had fledged last year .

I found the answer using this search : " red kites " poisoning Scotland site:www.rspb.org.uk <p> I also looked into the links between the former Energy Minister Brian Wilson and the nuclear industry using this search : " Brian Wilson " " energy minister " site : . com " non-executive director " That search found that he had been appointed as a director of AMEC Nuclear . <p> Using the example of norovirus , imagine you want to find out about norovirus outbreaks in UK schools . You could use this search:norovirus schools outbreak inurl : . gov.uk <p> And focus it further by searching within results using the term ' minutes ' which take you to the minutes of official committees that have discussed this issue . <p> 4 - Digging Deeper <p> Carefully crafted searches can be used to obtain sensitive material and lead to real breakthroughs . Website owners make mistakes . Documents , html pages and whole site directories that should be hidden from view litter the web . But obtaining focused material can be , but is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filetype : , inurl : , and intitle : , are particularly important for constructing search strings that reach deep within sites . <p> There is no room here to explore the dozens of ways to do this but one of the simplest techniques is to look for directory listings within sites . Directory listings can exist to give users alternative access to files or directories - giving a bypass around normal site navigation . Their existence can be intentional or unintentional and sensitive material can be either intentionally or unintentionally left there . They can be easily accessed because they are often titled ' index of ' . If they exist you may find them using Google 's intitle:index.of operator in combination with terms often found in directory listings - terms such as ' parent directory ' , ' name ' and ' size ' , or ' last modified ' . <p> However , you must combine that search with other carefully chosen search terms such as minutes ' ( of meetings ) or subject terms . Be prepared for a lengthy trawl . The people who leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick cast through UK 's public sector websites reveals the breed is thriving .

But if you are tackling a sensitive subject you may want to keep a low profile by keeping your online presence anonymous . There are products that can help such as anonymizer and free services such as Anonymouse . You can also use the Tor tool to protect your identity online . It aims to offer journalists and NGOs a defence against surveillance . It works by distributing your online communication through a myriad of encrypted links . <p> Finding the best solution for anonymous surfing is beyond the scope of this article . If you think this is necessary then you need to find the right technical solution and be sure it works . <p> However , if you still need to be convinced that you need to keep a lower profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that carries out a series of tests to check what it can find out about you and your internet connection - your IP address for example . If you want to know what your IP address says about you then go to ip-lookup.net . <p> Many people are also amazed that Google keeps a log of all of your previous searches . To find more on this look at the search history pages in Google . You 'll need to sign up for access to your own search history . From there you can delete some or all of your searches . Even so , it is clearly not made obvious to Google users that this search engine tracks use in this way . <p> 6 : Google alerts <p> The subject of monitoring future web content is a tutorial on its own . Even so , as this ' how to ' is focused on search engines we should mention Google 's alert service . You can use this to monitor news , web pages , groups or blogs for keywords or phrases . <p> Like all email alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if you do n't create too many , and delete outdated alerts when redundant , then they can help you keep track of subjects for key assignments . 7 : Google 's cache <p> Google gives you access to its cache of nearly every search result . You can access this where it says ' Cached ' next to the url on the last line of each hit in the list of results . Click on this and you can access the page version last indexed by Google . The white information box at the top of the page shows this is the cached version and it tells you when the page was indexed . <p> Your search terms will also be highlighted in colour through the whole document . A really quick way to search for other terms in the cached version of pages is to add a term directly into your browser 's url alongside your other search terms . You will also need to add a plus symbol before the term . Press return and that new term will also be highlighted throughout the document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to use the cache . Firstly , if a website owner pulls a site page they want to hide you may still be able to access the information through the cache . Secondly , using the cache is another good way to surf anonymously if you do n't want to alert the site about your visit . <p> 8 : Feed engines <p> Do n't forget that sites such as Technorati , Blogger , Britblog , Blogpulse and Feedster allow you to search for specific blogs , subjects within blog posts and news feeds . Once you 've found what you 're looking for you can sign up to the feed . This is another way of monitoring key subject areas . Blogpulse plots selected terms on a graph showing the trend in how often these terms appear in specific feeds . Follow the link to Trend Search for that tool . <p> 9 : Search engine limitations <p> Key to undertanding how search engines can help is to know their limitations . You may be better to check the lie of the land using a specialist subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a meta search engine . Subject directories include Yahoo ! Directory , the UK focused BUBL LINK and the Librarian 's Index to the Internet . <p> Remember also that search engines have indexed only a small part of the web . Many sites , including newspapers , block search engine crawlers . The restricted access material on those sites is never indexed . Furthermore , search engines do n't index every page on sites they crawl , they do n't have access to most database sites , they are denied access by many sites and many crawlers ca n't access some file types . Strategies to access this ' invisible ' or ' deep ' web is beyond the scope of this article , but a useful introduction is here . <p> Another problem is that some search engines are clearly better than others and the algorithms they use to rank results are opaque and are often the subject of furious debate . A little known fact is that some engines include ' sponsored ' results within their main results list or content ( unlike Google and alltheweb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you search for ' airlines ' then you 'd probably expect to see a lot of sponsored links using most search engines . But would you expect to see so many sponsored links after running the search ' skin cancer ' ? Run that search in Dogpile and you 'll see that the majority of the results are ' sponsored ' in the main list of hits . <p> Finally , search engines are mutating and adapting . As this article demonstrates , some search engines do some things better than Google and new services appear all the time . Snap , for example , gives access to page previews . This gives you a much better grasp of what is relevant and that one service leaves google standing . <p> There are a host of sites dedicated to search engines and new developments . One of the best is Search Engine Detective by Pandia . Using this you can search for key terms ( such as search engine names ) in all good sites about search engines or among the most influential 25 .

That access is your safety blanketColin Pereira , HP Risk Management <p> Journalists are also usually sent on assignment in pairs or groups , alongside more experienced colleagues . <p> " Before going on a trip , you should do a cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how you can mitigate the risk , " Pereira told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " Part of that is selecting a fixer who has shown evidence that he is able to work with foreign journalists and have good access to the stories you want to get to . <p> " But in some countries , the fixer might be part of the problem , not part of the solution , so finding someone who is trustworthy is crucial , although this is a very difficult process as you can never be 100 per cent sure of someone . " <p> The good judgement and experience assets also apply to freelancers , he added , and these can be obtained in less dangerous places to begin with , rather than journalists attempting to travel to a conflict zone on their first assignment . <p> Pereira said freelancers should also take advantage of other colleagues and news networks operating in the location they are travelling to , and they should independently seek subsidised training opportunities beforehand . <p> " I think all freelancers should try and get a commissioning organisation before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are producing a lot of work for that commissioning body , they should be asking them to subsidise their training . <p> " They also need to have a network of people on the ground who are able to inform them about risks , the reliability of fixers and vehicles , general logistics and invest more time in preparing and thinking through the consequences before jumping feet-first into a situation , " Pereira said . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Now Heij is managing director of DNP , a news app which has adopted the model of " the journalist as the brand " . <p> According to Heij , when print newspaper De Pers was still running , it had been experimenting with a digital-only newspaper , and following the closure of the print title this was " reinvented " to become DNP within around eight months . <p> While some of the content on the app , such as that found within its reviews section or liveblog , is free to access , the app includes a subscription model for readers to access the work of individual journalists . <p> " What we believe is that people , journalists , matter more now than media brands . Readers follow journalists , not so much newspapers or media anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach in which we give journalists the possibility to publish for themselves .

So we set out to try to find other metrics , other things we could measure that would give us a better idea of whether a story mattered to someone . <p> " Everyone talks about impact in news and at NPR , impact is less about new laws being passed and more about creating empathy and getting people to care about what 's being talked about in the news , " he added . <p> Carebot has been tested by the NPR visuals team for the last two and a half months and the current version has been improved and expanded based on feedback from the newsroom , specifically on stories containing graphics and visual elements . <p> Initially , the bot also looked at some of the metrics the team was already measuring to try and get some relevant meaning out of them , such as dividing the number of Facebook shares of a story by the number of page views . <p> When a story is published by someone on the visuals team , Carebot starts tracking it and sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The frequency of the updates changes as the story gets older , so the reporter would receive information on how long people are reading a story for every four hours the day it has been published , and then twice a day for the following two days . <p> Image courtesy of Livia Labate/NPR <p> Livia Labate , the former Knight-Mozilla fellow who is developing the bot with NPR , told Journalism.co.uk that Slack was chosen as the delivery medium based on feedback received from the team , who did not want yet another analytics dashboard to dig through . <p> That being said , anyone who wants to look deeper into traditional metrics can go into Google Analytics and put the time spent on the story in context , as Carebot continues to track the article in the background after the three days without sending notifications to prevent it from overwhelming the journalists . <p> Image courtesy of Livia Labate/NPR <p> " One of the things we saw by testing it live is that people started asking Carebot questions , " Labate said , " such as how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an expectation that Carebot would go and retrieve that , which is why we built that feature in . " <p> A notification from Carebot would say the average number of seconds people were spending looking at a graphic . This has recently been shifted to median numbers at the team 's request , which are also depicted in an actual graphic as the notification comes through Slack . <p> " What we 're doing next is actually looking at aggregation for the first time , " said Labate . <p> " So far we 've only been talking about one story or one graphic , so we will also start representing how that story did compared to all other stories in the same category , or all graphics stories , " she explained . <p> " These different metrics are proxies that will help us define the notion of what we 've called an engaged completion rate , " Boyer added , " so the number of people who actually finish a story out of how many start reading it .

" <p> Labate said one the next steps is trying to define what the engaged completion rate looks like for a story that requires users to interact by scrolling . <p> " We know what it looks like for a slideshow or a click-through story , but on scroll-based we 're experimenting with identifying the percentage that you 've scrolled down to up to the end of the story but before comments begin , and then if you continue scrolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted beyond 100 per cent .

You can pick up work from anywhere . " <p> Sophie Dulson moved from the UK to work for Falklands TV soon after graduating this summer . She said : " Having an overseas job on your CV it shows that you 're prepared to move wherever for the job . <p> " For me it brings another culture " I 'm learning something . If you travel it 's only going to enrich your knowledge of cultures , stories and different people . <p> " There 's always going to be those reservations and those nerves : Will I enjoy the job ? Will I enjoy the country ? Dive in and throw yourself into the role and only good can come from that .

Do your research <p> Jeremy Lye , an Australian journalist who has worked throughout the Americas , said : " Try and brief yourself as much as you can . In my case I spoke to a couple of journalists in Latin America beforehand . All you can do is as much research as you can and just be aware of how much you do n't know . " <p> Tim-Glynne Jones says some journalism recruits in the Middle East experience a workplace culture shock when they arrive . His advice : " Do n't go with any preconceptions . Do n't go thinking you 're going to impose everything that you know on the environment that you walk into . It can take months " even years " to really understand the culture you 're working in , to adjust to the expectations and the restrictions . " <p> Learn the country 's culture first and foremost . Study it as much as you can so that it does n't all come as a massive shock to youSophie Dulson <p> Sophie Dulson , in the Falklands , agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's culture first and foremost . Study it as much as you can so that it does n't all come as a massive shock to you . If you can , try and build bridges before you travel . Start building connections and contacts before you get there so you 've got your foot in the door already . " Translate your CV where applicable and try to find equivalents for your foreign qualifications <p> James Savage has recruited a small team of English-speaking journalists in nine countries across Europe for The Local network of expat news sites . He said " it 's important to be able to interview people in the language of the country you 're in . <p> " In some countries like Sweden , where pretty much everybody speaks good English , that 's not quite so important but it helps . Even Germany and certainly France and Italy , you ca n't just call people up and expect them to speak English . It 's really important to have a good working knowledge of the language . " Be curious about your surroundings <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK fit in very well to our way of working , " Savage added . " They have that feeling for human interest stories and sometimes that 's a better fit than people who 've got a news agency background where there 's a lot of high politics , economics and business . " Be aware that different countries have different communication policies and attitudes to journalists <p> J++rgen Kalwa moved from West Berlin to New York in 1989 . He said " the surprise that I had when I came to the US with no credentials was they just trust you that whatever you say is correct . What they often would say when you introduce yourself was : ' How can I help you ? ' <p> " I grew up in a media culture where often the first question was : ' Why do you want to know ? ' You had to justify your curiosity and your interest . By and large in the US you find a general openness towards journalists . " Feeling homesick : know you 're not alone <p> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling : " We try and get people to go out for drinks with their colleagues , to go to Meetup groups and expat groups . <p> There are other people experiencing the same kinds of frustrations and issues you 've had to deal withJames Savage <p> " Even if you do n't want to live in the expat community in the long-term it 's a good way of realising that there are other people experiencing the same kinds of frustrations and issues you 've had to deal with : the bureaucracy , the different ways of being . " <p> Tim-Glynne Jones added : " There was something about being in a culture where you 're away from home , from all different backgrounds , it gives you this bond and I found that a really enriching experience . " Try to be confident <p> J++rgen Kalwa said he " felt really insecure at first and when I went into interviews I basically had scripts to not get lost . I did n't want to struggle . I did n't want to show I was n't as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of your responsibility and the effect your work has <p> Jeremy Lye has reported extensively on war and organised crime . He said the " idea of the journalist being a neutral fly on the wall who just soaks up everything around them and writes a fair and balanced story , I think that 's largely mythical . <p> " You do have an impact " people will act accordingly because there 's a foreign journalist there . Be very careful about what you report . It 's going to have an impact . " Stay safe and get training <p> " Do try to get some sort of training , " Lye said . " For conflict reporting there is training out there . Try and do as much as that as you can . Probably the biggest problem I had were n't gangs or militias or death squads , it was other journalists , sloppy journalists who did n't do their work and put other journalists in danger .

@@97847526 @2047526/ <p> Here are five key skills Steve Herrmann he looks for when recruiting for journalists to work for the BBC News website . <p> 1 . Traditional skills <p> " There are a few old fashioned skills that we would be looking for that maybe have n't changed , " Herrmann says . " One of them is basic curiosity and resourcefulness . " <p> He also says a legal knowledge is vital . <p> Asked whether he still looks for shorthand when recruiting , he says : " I would n't say it 's a must have , but it 's still proving useful for people because I think in the end when you are up against it and you have to absorb a lot of information and detail quickly , it 's a very tried and tested way to get that done . The people who have shorthand , I think , always find it useful even in a largely digital newsroom . " <p> The next on Steve Herrmann 's list of key skills , is about writing and " being able to be accurate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that under pressure and quickly " . <p> " The ability to get thoughts down or out quickly and succinctly and accurately is absolutely key . It 's not exactly a new digital skill that 's required , but it 's one that in some ways I think is more important than ever because the speed at which news moves now is greater than it ever has been . " <p> 3 . Visual storytelling <p> When recruiting , the team at BBC News online also want to see evidence of " an ability to appreciate the importance of still pictures , video , graphics and audio in communicating and telling stories , and the different ways in which those media can complement one another when you are trying to tell a story " . <p> " So even if they have n't done TV journalism or radio journalism and they are not a graphic designer , evidence that they have got some appreciation and understanding of those areas . And it 's very easy now to do this kind of thing on your own computer in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An understanding , interest , appreciation and awareness of how to tell stories using any and all of those media is key . " <p> 4 . Social media <p> Steve Herrmann also says " an awareness of how social media works and how social networks relate to news " , is necessary if you want to work for BBC News online . <p> You need to understand how to use social networks for newsgathering " and to understand how to leverage social media to find out things , to get in contact with people , to talk to people and to spot trends " . <p> Secondly , you need to know " how to use social media to get your own work out and your own journalism out and as a means of distribution " . <p> 5 . An appreciation of data <p> The BBC News web team also look for " an appreciation of the importance of data , of facts and figures " , Herrmann says , <p> " That 's obviously always been critical in journalism , that 's not new , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a simple graphic in a story that illustrates something as simple as a line graph or a pie chart , all the way through to a whole interactive application you can put figures or data or numbers into to get results that are relevant to you . <p> " That does require some specialist skills ; there are skills to do with coding and development , to do with numeracy and understanding data and to do with good design and visualisation , but there 's also some old fashioned journalistic skill needed to find the stories and to tell them in a clear and simple way . <p> " Again , it 's not necessarily being expert in all of those things but being aware of the importance of data and appreciating when it can be really effective and have impact . " <p> And finally ... <p> Herrmann 's final point is included in the list of 10 things every journalist should know in 2013 ( linked to above ) . It is the importance of embracing change . <p> " The last thing I 'd say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that if you are coming into journalism now and if you are working particularly on digital platforms , you have to love change . <p> " If you do n't love change you are going to be a very stressed out and unhappy individual because things change so quickly , whether it 's the tools that we use or the way in which audiences get their information . <p> " And in a way you have to love that because otherwise it 's going to get you down .

@@97847527 @2047527/ <p> As previous posts to the Journalism.co.uk forum will prove , I spent a large amount of time wondering whether or not to do an NCTJ course " was it worth the money and the time ? Did I want to concentrate on news when I was a features writer ? <p> I spoke to a few working journalists in the hope they could make the decision for me , but surprisingly opinion was mixed , especially in the dreaded shorthand debate ( a national newspaper journalist I know does n't  have a word of shorthand ) . <p> With the benefit of hindsight here 's my two-pence on the NCTJ : <p> Its worth every penny . <p> Even if you want to be a features writer the NCTJ is a well-recognised qualification within the industry . There is a magazine equivalent but I 'm not sure if its so well-known or respected . <p> I can only speak for the course at Lambeth but I am staggered by how much I already know about journalism , the government and the law and I cant imagine walking into any publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambeth Course The fast-track course at Lambeth is only 18 weeks . Its Monday to Thursday and they expect you to spend your Fridays on work experience . The homework and revision has me working literally all the time . <p> The fees are -800 ( international -3,390 ) at the moment and , according to the college website , are set to remain at that level for next February and Septembers courses as well . <p> After that there is talk of the fees going up to a couple of grand . I found other NCTJ courses in London cost around -3K and some were wildly more expensive so at the moment Lambeth is great value for money . <p> While Lambeth College and the surrounding area may not be the most attractive place in London or the world ( if you want leafy go to NoSweat ) , the course has an excellent reputation and pass rate . <p> The entry exam will see you writing a news story from a press release and quotes given to you . My story was about 500 plastic ducks that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did put : Villagers thought they were going quackers With phrases like that you better hire me before I get snapped up . <p> There is also a current affairs test with the usual questions like : Who is the Chancellor ? etc . <p> Once you 're on the course it is broken down into four sections : <p> Journalism Mainly geared to hard news writing but I 've found it really sharpens up feature writing as well . <p> You are taught what makes news and how to sub your copy to within an inch of its life to make your writing clear and concise . <p> Its pretty formulaic but a quick read of any news story in a newspaper , national or local , applies the same principles . <p> Favourite quote from the teacher so far : " This is probably the hardest exam you will ever do . " <p> Law Using the trusty tome McNaes Essential Law for Journalists you deal with all aspects of media law . Defamation made me want to lie down in a dark room . You also get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Menezes inquest this week . <p> Public Affairs Or how central and local government works . Its an absolute minefield and I have no idea how councils function with the amount of regulations they must adhere to . Very interesting stuff however and satisfying when you read the paper and see what makes the political news " Russian Yacht trip anyone ? <p> Favourite quote from the teacher so far : " If the council like you , then you 're not doing your job properly . " <p> Shorthand ( Teeline ) Ah , the beast you must tame . To pass the exam you must be able to write 100 words per minute ( this is only a C grade however , in other words , just a pass ) . <p> That 's a tall order in only 18 weeks but it can be done . The teacher says you must do two hours a night practice and she ai n't  joking <p> Its two hours a night or re-take the exam .

What 's good , what 's bad ? <p> It would also be interesting and helpful to hear from industry people with their thoughts on the NCTJ : <p> Do you think its worth it ? <p> What are your criticisms of it " the video and online aspects perhaps ? <p> Would you hire someone with an NCTJ over someone without ? <p> What do you think of the magazine equivalent course ? <p> Calling all feature writers and magazine editors " NCTJ , do you need it ? <p> This entry was posted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own site . <p> s . <p> Good that its working out for you . Was talking with a mate of mine at a paper who did a similar thing in the West country intensive , low-budget but got him where he is with minimal wasted time and money . Seems like the best plan in an uncertain environment . In fact , I rather wish I 'd done the same myself . I did a course at City uni that was n't bad , but was n't nearly as efficient , time and money-wise , as yours . <p> 1 . It was n't really a course in International Journalism , which to me would involve detailed instruction on different markets , various environments for journalists ( e.g. shield laws in the US , kisha clubs in Japan , censorship in Singapore , etc ) , global job-related contacts , etc . It was , pretty much , a course for international students wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a red flag when you realise that <p> 2 . It cost a lot more than the other courses . And that 's *before* you add the usual hefty mark up for students who are actually foreign . And this despite <p> 3 . No more than a couple of classes of legal tuition . The official reason was that since there were so many international students and many of them return abroad , it would be pointless to teach them UK law . Well , except that a lot do n't  return . And even if they do , how about at least a quick spin round the legal hazards you could most easily run into in the worlds bigger journalistic markets ? Would be handy for job interviews/freelance pitches at least . On the subject of which <p> 3 . Course turned out not to be NCTJ accredited , something they do n't  mention , while trumpeting it for all the other courses . i.e. its very easy to just assume they all have the requisite accreditation . Admittedly my fault for not checking that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of industry body endorsement , even if not the usual suspects ? It sits right alongside courses that have similar , after all . Would have been nice to have had it flagged , anyway . <p> Do n't  regret doing it , but do think investing less time and money , and taking a more intensive , cheaper course , would have been less risky . Well done on your choice . Best of luck w/things once its finished . <p> Thanks for your post . I always thought City was the holy grail of journalism courses but could never afford the -5K for the course . <p> Gim me Lambeth and a bag of chips any day . <p> Mickey Day <p> I 'm on the NCTJ Fast-track course at City College , Brighton and the course is consuming my life .

So there 's hope that a brain battered by 34 years into a damp rag , rather than the youthful sponges of my counterparts , will actually suck enough up to make the grade . <p> City College , Brighton is doing a fantastic job at pushing me further and faster than I thought possible and boosting my confidence at every turn .

Most days started early and ended late into the small hours . Despite this , the first year was pretty special . After years of feeling that I was too old to pursue a career in journalism , I sat through every lecture and tutorial in a state of sheer bliss . Learning to write essays was much harder , I had never done it before but I got myself a book and learnt to get on with it . <p> I did the first two-years of my Journalism degree full time and took the final year part-time over 2-years . Although my degree was accredited by the NCTJ most of the NCTJ exam revision classes were in the evening and I was unable to attend because of family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in vital work experience and published quite a lot of freelance work . But still , when I graduated in 2007 with an upper second and a prize in journalism , I had no NCTJs to my name and could not afford to sit them until I had an income . Saddled with a student loan , I was lucky enough to get a part-time job as copywriter which lasted until this week . I am now back to square one and after thinking of different options , have decided to sit my prelims . I did think of taking the Highbury journalism fast-track course but just can not afford to do so and it would mean going over stuff I already know . So I 'll teach myself law 1&amp;2 , then public affairs 1&amp;2 , and shorthand and sit the others by the end of the year . I will kill to get into a local rag . Its simply not an option to fail . Ive come too far . <p> So , in answer to your question , I am one of those really really old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi and thanks for leaving a response . This blog has had a lot of different views which is great . <p> First of all to Annie . No 28 is not old by any stretch . There is a man in his forties on my NCTJ course at the moment but there are an awful lot more in their early twenties . I think my point was that I felt older than the average rookie journalist starting out . In fact I had a CV crit with a reporter on a national newspaper when I was 25 and he said time was running out for me then ! How nice of him . The point of this blog is to hopefully get people , who have felt worried they might be too old to start out , together regardless of whether they are 25 or 85 . <p> Nazrin , wow ! I cant imagine doing my course , which is only 18 weeks , while having to juggle children and child care arrangements etc . Did you learn shorthand on the degree or was that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest thing for me . We have had to do 2 hours per night practice since the course began in September so I know what you mean about late nights at your desk . <p> I have to say though we had the first of three 100WPM exams last week and it was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be . There is a glimmer of hope ! <p> Really good luck with your distance course . I think there was another person who left a comment on on post doing the same and I 'm sure there will be loads of support groups on line i.e. Facebook etc if not maybe you should start one ! <p> Everyone on my course constantly Facebooks each other asking questions or simply telling jokes . Its a great support . Good luck again and let us know how you 're getting on . Amy <p> Great article , but if you find the 18-week course difficult , you 'll struggle in a newsroom . <p> I think this is probably just a case of time management . I passed all sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny . <p> With the intensive course ( which I did ) you should only need an hours PA revision a week , because the standard of knowledge needed for a pass is stupendously low . <p> Maybe three hours of law revision a week would be good too , and a good hour of shorthand every night is recommended . <p> Do n't  overdo the shorthand though . Its far better to do an hour a night then ten hours over the weekend , just a little at a time . <p> I recommend always using a dictation tape or CD at home , or put the files onto your iPod so you can do it on the bus or the tube . <p> Make sure you 're listening to dictation 20wpm quicker than your current standard for 80 per cent of your revision session , drop it by 10wpm for 10 per cent of the session , then finish at your current level . You 'll get there in no time ! <p> Best wishes <p> The New Journalist <p> Petch <p> Hi , <p> Just found your blog from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course and to break free from the tedium of crap job after crap job . <p> Thanks for your comments Amy etc . I am now about to start revising law and public affairs to sit 4 exams in May . I still do n't  have shorthand but will aim to sit for 100wpm in November . Too much too soon for me will be a disaster . However , will start it and see how I get on . How hard is the law anyway ? Any idea of the pass mark ? Ill be grateful for any comments . For all those oldies like me , keep going ! ! cos you are not alone.xxx <p> glennmc <p> hi , <p> i 'm 36 ( ! ! ) and about to send off my app. to lambeth college but am a bit concerned about my pure engineering background and pass degree ( too much partying in those days ! ) . i 'm pretty up on my current affairs and political structures etc , have worked with journalists in palestine , wrote some well received articles ( although not published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-jazeera english website should i get on the course , but wonder if the competition for places will be too strong for me. eg good grade history/politics students with published work . <p> would appreciate any info . on this ! <p> cheers <p> glenn <p> Amy Oliver <p> The criteria for Lambeth is a degree or equivalent . They do n't  ask you for your grade or subject , you just have to have one . I think the nature of the course is so tough they do n't  expect undergraduates to be able to cope with the pressure ! <p> You are then invited to sit an entrance test . This is a current affairs quiz and I had to write a short news story from a press release and quotes basically the news exam . <p> There was no interview the lecturer said you can make up any old crap about yourself that would sound good and she would have no proof it were true or not . The test is supposed to speak for itself . This no nonsense , on-the-job attitude is Lambeths mantra to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newsroom . <p> The fact you have already written pieces and been invited for work experience is a plus for you ( you can use non-published work in your portfolio should you need to for example ) , not for getting onto the Lambeth course . <p> I 'd say go for it . What have you got to lose ? <p> Amy <p> Lauren <p> This blog is brilliant . I have been following it for the last few months and just wanted to say what an excellent recourse it has been for me . Deciding whether to invest time and money taking the NCTJ course is a daunting decision . Reading honest and frank articles from some one who has been there , done it and got the t- shirt gives me so much more confidence in making my decision . <p> Thank you so much for researching and writing this , the comments from fellow students have also been very helpful . <p> Just wondering about students experiences of actually finding a job after the course I recently read a Media Guardian article about how journalism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession and the future looked very bleak . <p> Found this blog by accident I 'm a Teeline shorthand teacher in the West Country and found it very interesting . <p> Keep going Nazrin you have done so well and are nearly there good luck to you all . A lot of my students have gained their jobs by doing work experience at newspapers offices <p> Jeannette <p> Kat Udal <p> Hi I am currently looking into persuing my education on the NCTJ course in London . However , I can not seem to find any information about age limits , I 'm 16 and just started my A2 levels , I 'll be 18 when I leave college next year ( one of the youngest , I hate it . ) Around this time is when I was looking at joining the course but will I be too young ? I know sport journalism is what I want to do ( my dad has a big influence on that as I have been bought up with sport ) but will I be too young at 18 ? I really do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know please ! I will be very grateful Kat Udal <p> P.S : I have booked a place on the free workshop in July too . <p> Catharine <p> Hi , <p> First of all , thanks Amy for providing this forum . It is great to hear from people who have done or are doing the fast-track course . <p> I had my entrance exam and interview for the 20 week course at Darlington College yesterday . I find out next week if I get a place but at the minute I 'm just trying to come to terms with the prospect of being a hermit for five months <p> From the experience I 've had so far I 'm more Features orientated but the more I talk to writers and qualified reporters , the NCTJ newspaper course seems like the best platform to launch a career in any aspect of journalism . <p> Thanks Catharine <p> kizzo <p> Has anyone experience of doing the NCTJ Part time ? <p> I spoke to a Journo at the holy Beeb that told me doing an MA was a waste of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PG dip etc on NCTJ website and was looking at Press Associates and NoSweat . I will definitely not discount Lambeth now . Has anyone any experience of the former ? After hearing how intensive it is I am thinking to just attend the college that is the closest to my home/office . <p> I keep having nightmares about leaving my job , completing the course and not getting a job so I 'm keen to hear from part timers . The Part Time MA at Kingston requires attendance 3 week days per week not exactly what I had in mind . Any one got any advice ? Or is Part T <p> kizzo <p> time a mistake ? <p> Does anyone also know if I can skip a few legal exams having done a law degree ? <p> PS 28 is new 21 . I 'm 28 too and a load of my peers have also changed direction after five years or so of waiting for the weekends . An american friend of mind tells me its something to do with the moon shifting around the age of 27 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jeff <p> Speaking of Americans , moon cycles , the NCTJ , and being over 25 : <p> I am from the US , my mother has cautioned me about Saturn returning because I just turned 30 and if I can swing it I 'm seriously considering an NCTJ course in London this coming March . Visas do present something of an issue , but I 'm working on that <p> My initial plan was to apply for the International Journalism course at City University and do the NCTJ afterwards . <p> Have any of you met Americans on your courses ? If so , how did they fit in ? Could you put me in touch with them ? <p> And thanks for the awesome website , Amy ! You rock ! <p> Celia Osborne <p> Hi Jeff , <p> I think it all depends on what you can afford . In my opinion if you cant afford to go to City do n't  , just do your NCTJ . If you can afford it do the City course and do n't  bother with the NCTJ . Going to City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you work really hard and are determined , on a normal course like Lambeth you can do just as well I 'm currently into my 3rd month of the Daily Mail trainee scheme . <p> There werent any Americans on our course I 'm afraid so I could n't tell you . I expect there were lots at City . I suggest you get in touch with their HR department to see if you can speak to a few of them . <p> Good luck . Let us know how you get on . <p> Amy <p> greg goudling <p> I 'm glad I 'm not the only one who is finding it a hard slog . I 'm at Cornwall College and have just failed my PA exam . Passed Law and have Shorthand later this week . No social life for the six months living down here , lucky that Cornwall is dead over the winter ! <p> Amy Oliver <p> Hi Greg , <p> Sorry to hear about PA but I always thought it was a lot about luck more than anything . There 's no way you can learn the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learning those inside out helps . Have a few back up ones as well . I do n't  know when you can take the exam again but my advice would be to carry on revising right up to it . Otherwise you 'll forget everything . Hope the shorthand went well . <p> Really enjoyed reading your post . I am studying the PGDip at Cardiff University and know how you feel/felt ! My life has been completely taken over , but I am really enjoying it . <p> I have my PA exam after Christmas and I am slightly dreading it . Can I ask a cheeky question and find out how many questions there are to choose from on the exam ? <p> Hope you are enjoying whatever you are doing now . <p> Love Ruth <p> Kathryn <p> Hi Amy et al , really interesting reading all your posts as I too am 28 ( where did my 20s go ? ) and am thinking about a change of career and doing the fast track NCTJ in London . I 've just got some doubts about financing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite sure what to expect and really havent got that much writing experience ( other than an English degree ) but alot of people have encouraged me to do this.so any info on surviving without a salary and getting your first job would be GREAT ! Cheers , Kat <p> Jeremy <p> I 'm currently deciding what NCTJ course to do and the Lambeth one is calling out to me , however my concern is that I 'm very reluctant to leave full time permanent employment to do it . <p> Its frustrating that there 's so few part time NCTJ accredited courses in newspaper journalism in London ( and the U.K I 'm prepared to consider moving away ) so the one at News Associates in Wimbledon is an option does anyone have experience of the course there ? <p> Sophie <p> I studied at News Associates and i cant recommend it enough . They have the best news writing results out there and really good shorthand tuition . Lots of practical exercises , really engaged tutors and their full-time reporters are around for advice . No Sweat does n't  have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me but what are their results like ? <p> Ben Bouckley <p> I have just started an NCTJ student support group on Facebook , called ( oddly enough ) NCTJ student support group ! Please feel free to join am sure we can all help each other crack these exams . <p> Hi Ben sure it can be found quite easily , but feel free to post a link in a comment to the group . <p> Will W <p> Hi all , good chat . <p> I am currently in the process of deciding between offers between News Associates ( short track NCTJ ) and City ( Newsp J MA ) . I really like the sound of both , but the reputation of City stands out . I just do n't  know if its worth it though at 8 grand . <p> NA looks great and I am probably going to go for that . I would love to hear from people who have done the course there ( pop me an email : willw101@hotmail.co.uk ) to find out how they got on . <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nicki <p> I am studying an nctj , I work full time and have a two year old daughter . I passed my two PA exams and now have the rest to tackle . With the PA exams , make sure you use examples of news , it boosts your marks . The course has taken me longer than two years but I will get there . I am 32 and panicked that I was too old but I know that i will be a journalist . Good luck to you all . Dreading the law exams , so much to remember ! Wish me luck in November when i have to sit them . <p> That 's the group link Laura ! Good luck with the exams Nicki , it is worthwhile . I have just got what I consider to be my first really decent job in journalism at William Reed Business Media ( who publish The Grocer ) on the back of NCTJ study during several months of redundancy . <p> For all budding magazine journalists out there , the course is not as well-known throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how rigorous and worthwhile it is . At interview the fact I was studying the NCTJ and had already passed just one exam played very well . The distance-learning aspect also impressed them as evidence of commitment . <p> I guess before this I marked time from 2006 at smaller companies where the journalistic standards were a little less rigorous , there was less interest in developing staff , etc . Perhaps this is a necessary career course for all of us aspirants nowadays , but the truth is that I am sure I could have gone further faster if I 'd done these exams 10 years ago . But then , what school careers advisor back in 1997 would have told me this ? ! <p> A final note to Will . Why not try a distance-learning course ? I am doing one through Cleland Thom ( he sends through assignments for you to complete via email and marks them by return , supplies necessary textbooks through Amazon , you enter the exams separately at -34 a pop . <p> Tutor support is via email and Skype , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedigree and really takes the time . The key thing ? Youll save yourself thousands over a university course , and can work at your own pace . Do n't  want this to be a plug will simply say it is working extremely well for me . <p> Nicki <p> I 'm studying with Cleland too . Amazing teaching ! <p> nazrin wilkinson <p> Hi just caught up with this blog and I am so thankful that it is still going ! I will be sitting my exams in November but since the last blog write up have found work with a radio station and a free newspaper in London but still want to sit my exams . Thank you to you all for being so great , you have no idea how much this blog has given me inspiration to continue ! <p> louise <p> Hi , this blog post is brilliant , thanks Amy . And congrats to Nazrin ! <p> I wondered what you might think about the NCTJ magazine course that is run by NoSweat and probably some other institutions .. I 've spent the summer interning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications ) and would love to get into features writing . The consensus I get is that you do n't  need a qualification to make it , but most of the people ive spoken to that are relatively new hires *do* have qualifications I spoke to an editor at a national mag and she said she would n't *not* hire someone because they were unqualified , but a sturdy qualification does help her see people in a positive light . <p> Anyone completed a magazine course ? They seem to be shorter ( and cheaper ) than the newspaper ones , but not sure if they 're just considered a lighter version of the newspaper NCTJ .. <p> just wondering why No Sweat has a bad reputation ? I am due to go into second year German at university but would rather complete an NCTJ course over 6months and go into the real world . Has anyone completed the No Sweat magazine course ? And does anyone know if London College of Communication journalism FdA is NCTJ accredited because that is another option ! ? <p> Thanks , <p> Mena <p> Nicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do an NCTJ distance learning . Cleland Thom offers NCTJ Courses in newspaper and magazine journalism . Cheaper than doing a fast track that 's for sure ! <p> I read this prior to starting my fast-track course at News Associates Manchester . I have since written several articles on my website that may be helpful to all those taking the NCTJ Diploma in Journalism please take a look . <p> Hi Sara You will get a better response if you post this question on the Journalism.co.uk forum <p> Nicki <p> I passed my two law exams in November first time and now doing my second work experience placement . I am one of many unpaid workies who is getting the cuttings for my portfolio and loving the experience . <p> I 'm 34 and probably one of the oldest in the newsroom but once I have newswriting and shorthand then I can seriously start sending out job applications ! Next exam is in April wish me luck . <p> All the best to everyone , its hard juggling distance learning and a full time job with family commitments but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pagan Tordengrav <p> 800 wow that 's cheap ! Its costing me 4,170 for 18 weeks so far I have developed a benign tremor , a tick in my left eye and nervous exhaustion and it is only week 7 ! 
@@97847528 @2047528/ <p> With ever-evolving opportunities to discover and share stories on digital platforms , the need to keep digital skills up-to-date is vital for journalists . <p> In order to give journalists an idea of some of the main skills to be working on , we sourced ideas from the Journalism.co.uk newsroom and our Twitter community to compile a list of 10 key areas to consider . <p> We hope that the mix of skills , techniques and qualities listed below would help journalists to stay ahead of the game in terms of digital innovation , be able to harness the latest tools and techniques most effectively and create the best quality content for their audience . <p> There are , of course , lots of other useful skills to make you stand out in the newsroom , the list below is not all-inclusive , but these are some of those considered particularly important in today 's media world . In no particular order : <p> Validate and verify <p> In the midst of a breaking news event , as information and rumour spread around social networks and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , or as close to the truth as can be established , is a hugely valuable and important skill . And it is one which many journalists continue to hone . <p> Whether that 's establishing the date or location of an image or video , or simply corroborating written accounts of an event , the journalist 's role in uncovering the facts is no less vital on digital platforms . <p> @rachelabartlett Verify ( to the best of your ability ) everything before posting on social media . Also , experiment . ( 1/2 ) <p> In addition to the traditional skills involved in trying to reach the source and others who may be able to corroborate the story , there are a wealth of tools and options available online , such as to investigate the history of an image or key features of a video . <p> Chief technology officer of Storyful Paul Watson suggested to Journalism.co.uk that journalists use Google Image Search to check out the past-life of a photo . You can download a Google Chrome extension to do that with a simple click of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article has received so far , or what the key traffic referrals were ? If so , how will you then use that information ? Knowing how to find , understand and use analytics data is another important skill for journalists to really get to grips with . <p> Along with editorial judgement , journalists can use the data to , for example , consider optimum times of the day to share content on specific platforms , how best to deliver the content or what sort of content the audience is most engaged with . <p> News outlets use a multitude of platforms to measure this data , ranging from third-party platforms like Chartbeat , Omniture and Visual Revenue to their own custom-made platforms . The Guardian and Forbes Media have both built their own analytics platforms , and Journalism.co.uk recently spoke to those behind them about the process and benefits of ' doing it yourself ' . <p> 2013 offered up further examples of the power of the smartphone for both journalists themselves , and members of the public , to gather and share content on the go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming app Bambuser to share footage following an explosion in Prague , BBC News has used its Instagram account to share 15-second video snippets documenting the impact of the typhoon in the Philippines , and Sky News aims to have its journalists broadcasting " live within 90 seconds " thanks to their use of smartphones and broadcasting app Dejero . <p> Nick Martin of Sky News reporting via his smartphone from Peru <p> Mobile reporting is far from a new trend , but the ability to quickly capture , edit and share images and video with ease is a vital tool for any digital journalist and , as we head into 2014 , it is a time where digital journalists are fast establishing their ultimate mobile reporting kit to have to hand . Keep an eye on the Journalism.co.uk App of the Week for ways to make your smartphone a more efficient reporting partner . <p> Enhance the user experience <p> Previous years ' lists have addressed the importance of user experience , and responsive design in particular is expected to continue to be a big trend in the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more engaging ways to deliver stories on digital . This means trying out new tools and platforms which help enhance the experience , from building interactive timelines or images through to fully-immersive multimedia packages . <p> The emphasis being placed on journalists to consider new and more effective digital storytelling techniques only seems to be growing , particularly if recent announcements are anything to go by . <p> Last month the BBC announced plans to introduce a News Labs team to encourage the outlet to " be more innovative and more experimental " as well as " develop new formats " for telling stories . <p> And in the same month , just before the Christmas break , Trinity Mirror shared details on a new " digital content innovation team " it would be putting together this year , led by Alison Gow , new deputy digital publishing director ( most recently editor of the Daily Post ) . <p> In a statement at the time of the announcement , digital publishing director David Higgerson said that the aim is for Gow and her team to " innovate with content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our content online " . <p> Master the data basics <p> Data journalism skills vary widely , from more basic techniques involving cleaned tables of data and the creation of a simple line graph , through to more advanced processes to prepare data for analysis as well as coding to create interactive visualisations and apps . <p> For any journalist , the ability to quickly find the big stories within a dataset is obviously crucial , and most journalists are likely to find themselves working with data of some description on a fairly regular occasion . Therefore the next step is to be able to tell that story as most effectively you can . <p> And for the digital journalist of 2014 , an understanding of the tools at your disposal to assist you with those processes is key , including standard spreadsheet skills such as the ability to use pivot tables . A quick search online offers up some useful tutorials . <p> Do you have high social media referrals , or is search still a big player in driving traffic to your content ? If you are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to that already , but if not it is important to think about your content and how it will reach different audiences . <p> That means thinking about important , relevant keywords for those likely to be searching around that subject , as well as what headlines will work well on social . On Twitter , you need to capture the audience 's attention within 140 characters , in an environment where they are likely to be just dipping in and out of what may be a fast-moving timeline . And that does not just necessarily mean throwing in lots of hashtags to maximise your opportunity . As Sarah Laitner , communities editor at the Financial Times recently told Journalism.co.uk , journalists should " try to make tweets as straight-forward as possible " , with additions such as hashtags used " only when they provide context " . <p> Also bear in mind the different sorts of communities across platforms . Advice tends to be that visual content works particularly well on Facebook , for example , as Anna Doble , head of online for Channel 4 News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about platform as well " news outlets with a large mobile audience may consider more of a ' mobile-first ' approach to how stories are constructed and delivered and more native to the way mobile-readers consume news . <p> Be an active part of your social networks <p> Journalists are increasingly experiencing the power of online communities when it comes to newsgathering and the power of the crowd , and they may also be putting different tools and techniques into practice to make networks manageable and more meaningful . But how much are you giving back ? <p> Twitter is not just a place to broadcast , it is a place to engage , share , interact . Slightly different approaches may apply based on your own news outlet , the Economist for example has found that its audience only really wanted link-sharing from its main account , but this is supported by other " more creative " styles of sub-account , as community editor Mark Johnson explained last year . <p> But generally speaking , being responsive to your community is essential for effective social media engagement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms of Twitter and Facebook , to discover new communities , or more niche networks , who may be particularly interested in certain content or useful in terms of sources for specific subjects . We wrote more on how to engage with diverse communities in this feature from last year . <p> @journalismnews Wisdom in choosing social networks that will help them to reach desirable audience . <p> In a follow-up to the previous point , keeping on top of all your social media and other platform accounts is also important . Are your details up-to-date in your Twitter bio and do you make it clear how people can reach you ? Do you have a Google+ and LinkedIn account , and are these up to date ? <p> As well as being social , the point of these platforms is also to network . Do your networks need some TLC ? How long has it been since you followed someone of interest on Twitter , and could you be organising your Twitter contacts better using Lists ? <p> What about LinkedIn , are you making the most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your profile is up-to-date and linking to the right people could come in handy both for connecting with contacts but also when it comes to looking for your next journalism job . Journalism.co.uk 's managing director John Thompson has 8,000 journalism-related connections on LinkedIn , and so is well worth connecting with to gain a ' second-degree connection ' to those members of the community . <p> As well as keeping things organised within your own social media profiles , journalists can organise the rest of the web , and in some cases bring potential leads or other patch updates to you automatically , using tools such as If This Then That ( IFTTT ) . <p> @rachelabartlett being digitally connected , as in making sure all accounts/services linked , backed-up &amp; secure . Utilising tools like IFTTT ? <p> Journalists also need to back-up content , and consider using cloud-based platforms to keep copies of content you may need to access outside the office , or share with others .

Journalism.co.uk reported on how news outlets can try to keep their online properties , from websites to social media accounts , safe from being hacked , as well as more general advice . See this Journalism.co.uk podcast for more information . <p> Whether online or not , journalists have always had to think carefully about how they share information , particularly when it comes to anonymous sources , and a number of journalism events in recent months have served to put a spotlight on the issue , sharing advice from security experts . <p> On a final note , while this list is dedicated to digital skills , it is important to close by highlighting that all these should continue to work in tandem with the traditional skills of good journalism , and good writing .

It 's one of the main differences between human beings and the rest of the animal kingdom . We may still be slaves to the same old evolutionary urges but we sure know how to eat noodles in style . <p> In journalism , an abstract tool for uncovering the most interesting and insightful information about society , we can generally boil the workflow down to four stages : finding , reporting , producing and distributing stories . <p> So with that in mind , here are a range of tools which will " hopefully " help you carry out your journalism tasks more effectively . <p> 1 . Advanced Google Search <p> A somewhat simplistic start to the list , maybe , but Google has many tricks that every self-respecting journalist should be taking advantage of . <p> While it is very good for a spot of online shopping , journalists need to learn a few tweaks and tips to improve their searching with the use of search operators . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is probably the most powerful here , especially when combined with other search operators like filetype : or inurl : to find information that might be locked deep in the rabbit 's nest of a government website . <p> As with Google , every journalist should have some basic understanding of the merits of Twitter for finding tips and stories , but there are some power tools out there that can do the hard work for you . Chief among them ? Tweetdeck . <p> Tweetdeck 's main strength comes in being able to watch a large number of customised Twitter feeds , based on lists or searches . You can create your own lists of Twitter accounts around specific beats if you so wish , or follow those created by others and have them displayed together side-by-side to track the Twitter chat . <p> Twitter has a Google-style list of search operators as well , which can be combined to find niche corners of the 6,000 Tweets per second that could be the start of your next story . <p> The Wall Street Journal 's social media editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penned one of the most comprehensive guides to Twitter search out there and is worth bookmarking , sharing , printing off and , if prone to forgetfulness , tattooing on your forearms . It 's that good . Check it out . <p> As the first social newswire , Storyful has the inside track on finding stories around the world through social media , largely by building its own software similar to Tweetdeck but with automated alerts for keywords . <p> Screenshot of Storyful 's Multisearch browser extension <p> There 's a lot more involved in the full , paid-for service used by news organisations worldwide , but the Multisearch browser extension is a quick way to search for keywords across a handful of social networks . <p> Echosec is one of a whole range of sites and services that have sprung up in recent years to help people search for geolocated posts on social media . <p> Screenshot from Echosec <p> In short , the free service let 's you draw a shape around a certain area on a map and the software will return all the tweets posted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' premium ' service and Echosec opens up other social networks like YouTube , Sina Weibo and more . <p> GramFeed is a good alternative option for freely searching Instagram , while the mobile app Banjo relaunched recently with a slicker interface , although its new focus on events may limit its relevance for quickly finding social media posts around you . <p> Finally , if you have the budget , services like Geofeedia are used by news organisations all over the world for a really powerful geolocated search . <p> Ok it might not be all that simple , PDF tables and datasets in general are regularly full of holes , spelling mistakes and formatting disasters that will quickly put an end to any attempts to assess the data . <p> So DataWrangler will automate the cleaning process for you and even suggest edits to make data easier to work with . <p> There 's a handy video tutorial on the site to guide you through the process and , if you want to get more detailed , programs like OpenRefine and Overview are worth checking out too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early 2013 from a source wishing to discuss a potential tip , but only if communications were encrypted .

Greenwald ignored it . <p> The same source , a now slightly frustrated Edward Snowden , contacted film-maker Laura Poitras about the stack of NSA files burning a hole in his hard drive . Poitras persuaded Greenwald that he might want to listen , and the resulting revelations of government surveillance is arguably the story of the decade so far . <p> The lesson ? Learn how to encrypt your email . Mailvelope is a good option with a worthwhile tutorial for PGP encryption , the same as the NSA use , and Knight Fellow Christopher Guess has a great step-by-step guide for setting it up . <p> A well-trained journalist with the right gear can now do the jobs of a whole team from the 1990s , and although you may not need to be a one-person news publishing machine , it 's worth having a grip on some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for video on a smart phone , with a movable reticule to determine focus and exposure , sound meter , battery and disk space monitors , and more . <p> The ability to livestream from a smartphone device has the potential to turn the world of broadcasting on its head , and Twitter 's Periscope app quickly became the most popular platform around due to its smooth user interface and social media integration . <p> It might not be the best for broadcasting but is worth getting used to the options available for livestreaming , for if Twitter is the first draft of journalism , as the saying goes , then Periscope could be the first draft of broadcasting . <p> If you 're looking for a more professional option Bambuser and UStream are both used widely around the industry . <p> There are two reasons why people on work experience are often told to transcribe interviews by senior editors : firstly , it gives them an insight into the interviewing process from a seasoned reporter , and secondly , it 's really bloody boring . <p> For those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamline the process .

WhatsApp <p> WhatsApp has more than 800 million users so far and according to Mark Zuckerberg , it will only be a viable business option once it tops 1 billion . Alright for some , I guess . <p> But as well as a messaging app , WhatsApp is a great provider of push notifications for news organisations or journalists that might not have a custom-built app . <p> Traffic updates , football scores and breaking news reports also serve to underline the Mail 's WhatsApp channel as a service which provides readers with information they would n't get elsewhere . <p> And not only is the WhatsApp news service popular when it serves a specific niche , but it can work as an avenue for readers to provide tips and stories .

For legacy media organisations this has meant a shift from a print-first mindset to a digital one , followed by additional experiments with new tools online . <p> But how can newsrooms take on new initiatives and manage this change ? Lisa MacLeod , head of digital at Times Media Group in South Africa , shared her experiences at the International Newsroom Summit in Hamburg , Germany , on Monday . <p> MacLeod , who previously worked at The Financial Times managing newsroom reorganisation projects , highlighted the positive effect of many small changes as an alternative to running one big initiative . <p> " It does n't have to be a massive newsroom reorganisation or a massive system change or a massive change of management .

Researching use cases <p> Reveal 's work is divided into different components , as the project members work individually or together to analyse aspects from computer-assisted verification to the legal implications of scraping data and other obstacles faced by newsrooms dealing with UGC . <p> Spangenberg said the project also aims to " raise awareness and point to other resources available , so that people can have one platform they can use to tackle verification challenges " . <p> Currently , the website provides weekly round-ups of discussions from around the web surrounding verification , but also findings of the ongoing research conducted by members . <p> For example , the IT Innovation Centre at the University of Southampton is developing ways to automate certain elements of verification that do not require human input , by analysing keywords and images . <p> Other research includes contributor analysis , for finding out whether or not an eyewitness from social media is reliable and what elements from their background can be gathered automatically . <p> A third component is multimedia analysis , performed by The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , which is working on image verification solutions and comparing it to existing results from tools such as TinEye . <p> Spangenberg said these elements will be implemented on a level that can be " used in the day to day work environment of journalists " when the project concludes next year . <p> Research done by Reveal has three use cases that serve as a guide . The two journalism scenarios focus on event coverage by reporters and eyewitnesses , as well as gathering , organising and incorporating material from social networks into a final multimedia package . <p> There is also an enterprise scenario , which analyses content that is " residing in closed networks like businesses and enterprises in order to find people who have expert knowledge in particular areas " . <p> From an editorial perspective , the work is done in close collaboration with Deutsche Welle 's editorial teams and departments that use social media , looking at what challenges and requirements they face . <p> " Ideally , we will come up with a solution that really fits Deutsche Welle journalists in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also be deployable in other newsrooms that are facing similar challenges and produce something of value for people working with user-generated content , " Spangenberg said . <p> Building new tools <p> The Athens Technology Center ( ATC ) ' s Innovation Lab is the technical director behind the project and has been working with Deutsche Welle on a prototype called TruthNest , which will also be incorporated in the final version of the Reveal platform . <p> TruthNest is a web based platform that allows journalists to verify material posted on Twitter . When they log in with their Twitter account , users see the usual stream of tweets from their timeline , but with a few added elements . <p> The platform uses an algorithm that recognises names of people , locations and organisations mentioned in a tweet and groups them into categories . <p> There is also an option to create new streams , similarly to Tweetdeck " for example , a journalist can choose to monitor what an individual is posting about a certain topic , like Greece , or select the keyword to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Each tweet can be analysed , giving information across three categories : contributor , content and context . <p> Screenshot of the TruthNest demo , showing the different analysis option for a tweet <p> For contributors , which are eyewitnesses or sources , TruthNest gives the journalist information on a person 's reputation , presence and influence on Twitter . <p> The tool also does sentiment analysis to find out how many negative , positive or neutral mentions the author has received on a given tweet or a range of recent posts , that can be further drilled down into . <p> For images , TruthNest uses the TinEye API to show when and where a picture has been posted on other websites before it reached the social network . <p> The context category allows journalists to see who else is sharing information about a given topic by grouping together tweets containing similar keywords from around the world . There is also a proximity check , which compares a tweet 's geotag with the location the user claims to be posting from . <p> " It 's a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nikos Sarris , head of operations at the ATC Innovation Lab , " but it is up to the journalist to decide whether it gives valuable insight or not . " <p> Once TruthNest is fully developed , Sarris is hoping to monetise it on a subscription basis , according to a news organisation 's size and the number of searches they do per day using the platform . <p> If you are a journalist dealing with social media analysis and UGC verification and would like to provide feedback or test prototypes and components as they emerge from Reveal , get in touch with Nikos Sarris ( @nikossarris ) or Jochen Spangenberg ( @jospang ) . <p> Find out more about the challenges of verifying eyewitness media from social networks and the tools available for journalists at news:rewired ' in focus ' , a half-day event taking place on 21 October at Reuters in Canary Wharf , London . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847539 @2047539/ <p> Attempting to measure engagement is " one of the great neurosis " of the modern media industry , according to The New York Times ' James G. Robinson . <p> Discussions around metrics often focus too much on measurement and not enough around insights , Robinson , the outlet 's director of analytics innovation , told delegates at the World News Media Congress in Washington DC today . <p> " Trying to boil engagement down to a single metric is in many ways a futile task , " he said , " because engagement is something that happens in your heart and mind ... it 's an emotion . " <p> At the Times , metrics are centred around not just measuring engagement , but seeking to understand what motivates a reader to interact with a story in some way , whether through sharing , commenting or simply reading it . <p> " What we really want to do is not bring numbers into the newsroom , we want to bring the audience into the newsroom , " said Robinson . " The goal is to understand people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on numbers , of course , is that they can easily be misinterpreted when taken out of context . <p> This is especially risky because , as a recent Tow Center report highlighted , story metrics that are not seen as ' good ' enough can have a demoralising impact on journalists ' sense of themselves and their work . <p> The key to understanding the audience is to listen to them , said Robinson , using methods that can be anything from a big research study to just talking to people . <p> Listening is also a way to help journalists get better at producing stories that are relevant and interesting to their audience . <p> " A critical skill is for editors to synthesise their gut instinct about what makes great journalism with the signals that they hear from the audiences , " said Robinson . <p> One way editors at the Times are listening to their audience is by monitoring Reddit to see the stories that are sparking discussion . <p> Robinson noted that Reddit is not especially useful from an audience development perspective , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good etiquette by the platform 's community . <p> Although Reddit is part of the Times ' strategy , he explained it is harder to seed conversations there than on other platforms . <p> However , he said the Times sees Reddit as " less of a traffic-driving tool that we can control ... and more of a really great rich source of connecting our editors to our audiences " . <p> Links posted to the NYT subreddit are not just current stories , but can be anything the outlet has published " in the last 20 years " that redditors pick up and find interesting . <p> One example of a Times story that made it onto Reddit recently is Portraits of Grief " published at the time of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and revisited 10 years later " which received 1,200 comments on the platform . <p> The Times has built two tools to enable editors and journalists to monitor these conversations . <p> One is a bot that scans Reddit and sends an alert to a Slack channel every time an NYT story is discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists can also receive this alert in the form of an email . <p> These tools allow journalists and editors to listen to " and sometimes participate in " relevant conversations on Reddit as they happen . <p> The Times also uses Reddit as a source for stories , said Robinson , especially its sports reporters who are " immersed in the Reddit soccer channel " . <p> " Again , the metric of success for this project is not how much traffic we get back from Reddit , although when we do it 's very healthy traffic , " he added . <p> " It 's about understanding these audience segments .

@@97847542 @2047542/ <p> Editorial director of BuzzFeed Jack Shepherd revealed his tips for making content people want to share during his keynote speech at the 11th news:rewired digital journalism conference yesterday ( 23 February ) . <p> Speaking at the event at MSN UK 's offices in London , Shepherd said that creating shareable content was key to how BuzzFeed had grown from its humble beginnings in an office opposite a " gambling den " in 2006 to a site with more than 130 million global unique users a month in December 2013 . <p> " When Facebook overtook Google as our top referrer in 2010 it was natural for us to refocus on social content , " he added . <p> Here are Shepherd 's five principles for journalists to make news content more shareable on social networks : <p> 1 . Everyone likes lists <p> Although Shepherd said he was not a fan of the word ' listicles , ' it would be hard to argue that BuzzFeed has n't made a name for itself through lists such as 109 cats in sweaters . <p> " Lists are easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations , people know exactly what they 're going to get , " he said . <p> " The internet is chaotic and frightening and there 's something satisfying about having things organised for you . " <p> A list is just scaffolding for a storyJack Shepherd , BuzzFeed <p> However , he noted that a list itself is just " scaffolding for a story " . <p> " Lists are a natural way for our brains to process information , but what matters is not the list itself , but that it has good stuff in it . " <p> 2 . Appeal to emotion <p> Shepherd highlighted a 2010 study of the New York Times 's most-emailed stories which showed that people liked content which fell into one of four distinct categories : awe-inspiring , emotional , positive and surprising . <p> " Emotional engagement is a powerful tool , " he explained , adding that people are much more likely to share content that creates " a visceral response " . <p> One way journalists can ensure they 're on the right track is to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you just feel that prickling behind your eyelids that meant you were about to embarrass yourself in front of your co-workers by crying ? Did it make you LOL ? " <p> " If you do n't feel it yourself , no one else is going to . " <p> 3 . Extend content with community <p> Shepherd admitted there was " no easy trick " for shareability as every community is different , meaning there 's no one-size-fits all approach to engagement . <p> However , he said one thing all shareable content had in common was " an emotional hook " that would generate discussion and response in a natural way . <p> " The real goal here is a meaningful conversation and not an interrogation , " he said . <p> Shepherd referred to Young Me/Now Me , a project which encouraged users to re-create photos of their younger selves posing with siblings or in wedding shots . <p> Initially created by ZeFrank on Twitter , the emotional response generated by the project , which manged to balance both humour and nostalgia , meant it grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shepherd said that content was more likely to go viral if it generated a good response across what he called the " ' Gets it / Likes it / Does n't get it / Does n't like it ' quadrant " . <p> Each of those four responses is an opportunity to share , he said . <p> As an example , he showed responses on Twitter to the internet hoax Bonsai Kitten " which people either loved or hated , or thought was a real example of animal cruelty . <p> 5 . Pair the right story with the right format <p> " The difference between telling a story that people want to hear and that people want to share is often a question of format , " said Shepherd . <p> " If you do it as a quiz it totally changes the game , " he said , adding that the piece had recieved close to 20 million visits , becoming BuzzFeed 's second most popular piece of content of all time . <p> However , Shepherd said that sometimes the right format for a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's article60 words and a war without end which recieved more than 250,000 unique visits , with 50 per cent coming from social media . <p> " It 's totally a myth that nobody reads long or serious information on the internet , " he said , adding that half the people who read the article also did so on their mobile . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

This is a relatively new function of LinkedIn and allows journalists , particularly freelancers , to market themselves on the social network . <p> 4 . Ensure you have at least 50 connections , focusing on quality not quantity . Fifty is the " magic number " of connections , according to Krista Canfield , senior manager of corporate communications ( consumer PR ) at LinkedIn , who spoke to me for this podcast on how journalists can best use LinkedIn . <p> " The reason that 50 is a magic number is because that is when you will start seeing more second and third degree contacts that get you in touch with the companies , the sources , or the editors that you are really looking to get in touch with , " Canfield said . <p> 5 . Used LinkedIn Today to find news in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a news site taking its content from established sources , organising them by areas of interest such as online media industry , publishing industry and internet industry . It is curated by people in the industry via retweets on Twitter and LinkedIn comments . <p> 6 . Consider a LinkedIn share button on your news site . LinkedIn is an important traffic driver for many publishers and buttons can increase social sharing . 7 . Follow company pages . There are more than two million company pages on LinkedIn , allowing you to search for those that are part of your beat . For Journalism.co.uk these include Johnston Press , Archant and BBC News . By following a company you get updates when people join or leave . <p> 8 . Create a group for your brand , a real bonus for niche publishers . Incisive Media , a business-to-business publisher with 600 websites , is really utilising groups . <p> Incisive has more than 100 LinkedIn groups ranging from IT to narrower groups such as Asian risk management . <p> " We find LinkedIn groups are tremendously useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers , secondly , testing out content and editorial ideas and , thirdly , marketing events to them so that we develop programmes for users " says John Barnes , managing director of digital and technology at Incisive Media . <p> 9 . Act as gatekeeper to your group . The gatekeeper approves or denies access . Incisive media markets its groups with a profile and then controls which individuals it allows in . They have set parameters , asking for a certain number of followers and in many instances the gatekeeper will ask for a reference from someone who is already in the group " to vouch for the person , much in the way as a offline club would require a referral " , explained Barnes . <p> " You might want to require that members have 100 followers as you ca n't get those in one evening , " Barnes suggested . " That filters the spammers that are trying to target your community with job ads or commercial offers . " <p> If you already have a LinkedIn group you can eject people and set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up to Duedil , a tool we have recommended on several occasions on Journalism.co.uk . Duedil provides accounts and company information free of charge , allowing you find financial information and details of directors . By signing in with LinkedIn , you can follow and get updates from the companies you are connected to on LinkedIn. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

It 's definitely something that always seems to be ahead of the crowd , certainly the editorial crowd . " <p> He advised that journalists should " always go beyond the first hundred stories , keep digging if you really want to find something " when searching for original content on Reddit . <p> The vast range of content featured on Reddit makes the platform a great resource for journalists wanting to determine the level of interest or opinion in a particular issue or topic they might be considering reporting on , said Lanyado . <p> " I think the absolute best use of Reddit for a journalist is as a kind of litmus test of where the internet stands on something , " he explained . <p> Though Lanyado noted Reddit was not an entirely level playing field for gauging opinion , due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably quite left-leaning and liberal and libertarian , " he added that journalists could gauge popular opinion around a certain topic , online at least , " just by looking at a couple of subreddits on the subject " . <p> 3 .

" <p> Provocative headlines and images encourage people to click but it does not mean they enjoy the content , said Haile , and the spreading of articles over multiple pages has also allowed many sites to boost their metrics , for example . <p> As a result , publishers are " left with a world of infinite inventory , when the marginal cost of additional page views is effectively zero " he said , and " in that world the value of advertising space will always decline . " <p> So what alternatives are there ? <p> Social shares <p> Santoro suggested that , with the advent of social media , the amount of times a piece of content has been shared online could be both a quantitative and qualitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What makes that metric really interesting is that it 's standardised , " said Galant , " it 's the same for any publication and it 's public . " <p> Pageviews are recorded internally and verified by independent organisations , while social shares are recorded by third parties and open for all to see . <p> " For the first time ever in the history of journalism we have a public , standardised metric , " he said , but Haile questioned whether that truly solved the problem of measuring quality of content over a more quantitative value . <p> Andrea Ianuzzi , executive editor of the national contents division at Gruppo L'Espresso , said that it should not be a question of sharing or traffic however . <p> " Social media are not there to be distribution platforms , " he said , " and if we keep thinking of them as such we will always be failing in some way .

" asked Galant . " And how could we measure that using social media ? " <p> Relevance <p> Steffen Konrath , chief executive of Liquid Newsroom which specialises in ' real time web news ' , said the key metric for news organisations should be content 's relevance to the reader , as it adds value to a relationship and " helps establish me as a trusted source " he said . <p> Quality is what makes people stick to a siteSteffen Konrath , Liquid Newsroom <p> " If you 've conducted primary research focus groups , if you know what people are interested in then you know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in more traffic and better engagement with an organisation as the audience values the quality of its output . <p> " Quality is what makes people stick to a site , " he said , stressing the relationship readers have with outlets as not only an important gauge of the editorial content but as something that could be monetised . <p> " You can monitor feedback through social media and understand people 's interests or preferences , " he said , information that could then be used to ensure advertisers are aiming their campaigns at people who are genuinely interested in what they have to offer . <p> The key to delivering quality content to an audience is in understanding who wants to read it and why they want to read it , he said , <p> While praising the concept of content relevancy as a " fantastic idea " , Haile was concerned that , like the concept of impact , it was not a " scaleable metric " . <p> ' Combinatorial metrics ' <p> " The important thing is that it is important to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haile . <p> Ianuzzi said there are three types of people interested in metrics " the editor or manager , the journalist and the audience " each with different motivations . <p> While a manager needs to sell advertising , editors or journalists are more interested in the quality of the content they are producing and the effect it may be having . For the audience , however , it is a question of trust and loyalty . <p> " Monitoring how users are using our website is very useful but does n't mean we should become slaves to one metric , " Ianuzzi said , and Haile suggested the possibility of " combinatorial metrics " . <p> " They rely on two different attributes together where you have to win on both to do well , " he said . " You have to be able to drive a lot of people to the page and then keep them there , it 's not just having someone click and then have nothing to back it up . " <p> If we focus on just one metric we will almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be striving for impact and relevance , " he said , " But if we have to patch what we 've got " with what we have today " then attention matters right now . " <p> While impact and relevance are the most important points in terms of the relationship between journalists and their readers , Haile again stressed that time may be more useful on an industry level for comparing organisations and approaching advertisers . <p> " Advertisers can see the number of impressions but we can put forward the quality of those impressions , " he said , allowing outlets to differentiate on " standard " and " quality " impressions around different types of content on different parts of the site . <p> " A metric is nothing without context , " he said , and different metrics should be applicable to different situations . <p> " If we focus on just one metric we will almost always be wrong , " agreed Iannuzzi. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

" <p> This will include larger investigations , but also any story that could have a data element and the data team will raise awareness in the newsroom about how this may be possible . <p> Helena Bengtsson , currently at Swedish broadcaster SVT , will soon be joining the Guardian and new data editor Alberto Nardelli in guiding the wider newsroom in using more data . <p> " Training has been incredibly impactful in the US to spread data journalism , " said Pilhofer , " there 's hardly a newsroom in the US that does n't have a specialist in this area , and training is a huge reason for that . <p> " So it 's about giving people the ability to do their own work , the ability to explore and get excited about doing this .

" <p> Audience Development <p> The Guardian 's in-house analytics platform Ophan is " a gift " in terms of understanding the audience , said Pilhofer , and has helped the reporters and editors to become comfortable with thinking about audience data and analytics in their work . <p> A new editor for audience development will take this further , he said , both in terms of what data is analysed and how that is used throughout the organisation . <p> " What I want to get past is a reliance on the metrics that work well with advertisers but not necessarily for content , " he said , citing Medium and Upworthy as inspirations in how they look at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 're looking at the right numbers and behaviours that we think are valuable . " <p> Elements like total reading time and other " meta-metrics that tell you how the audience is behaving " will be explored by a team of analysts to help the newsrooms make " better decisions around their content " . <p> When asked whether this kind of restructure was uniquely applicable at the Guardian , or whether it should be an approach all news organisations should try to take , Pilhofer answered " emphatically and enthusiastically the latter " . <p> " It helps the newsroom , " he said , " it brings some parts of the newsroom that were more attached to the traditional , into the new . " <p> As an example of how this may work in practice , Pilhofer spoke of a recent digital project spearheaded by the photo desk at NPR . <p> The day before launch , he noticed a photo editor working with a developer " in the command line " , the base level of code for digital projects . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You provide a path . <p> " You say to incredibly smart and creative people , ' here , you 're now part of this and you have the ability to do things that you 've only imagined ' . <p> " Now you have an incentive . Now you have a path forward . " <p> Pilhofer joined the Guardian from the New York Times , where he was part of numerous Pulitzer prize-winning teams . As editor of interactive news at the Times he commissioned Snow Fall , considered a landmark in digital journalism . <p> Pilhofer will give the keynote speech at Journalism.co.uk 's news:rewired conference in February .

As a journalist , it is one of your key skills and , with the internet , there is so much information close to hand . Of the hundreds of journalists that I have interviewed , lack of preparation is the number one mistake . <p> Almost all of us feel interview nerves " especially if we have not been interviewed for quite a while . On the one hand , the adrenaline can work in your favour by helping you think faster on your feet .

Write these down . Your most relevant examples might be from your current or previous job .

" <p> Initially , CrowdVoice was set up to pull in media feeds only , showing what news organisations or bloggers were writing or sharing about a particular topic . But as the amount of crowdsourced material expanded , for example on issues like Syria , the website had to reinvent its structure . <p> Al Shafei said people can now access not just the media feeds , but a wealth of material divided into categories like ' featured voices ' , ' know the facts behind ' or ' understand the events behind ' . <p> Al Shafei said CrowdVoice.by is an " off-shoot " of what CrowdVoice does now , but in the shape of a more personalised and embeddable platform . <p> How CrowdVoice works and what kind of material it collects <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quicker and more organised way , to ensure they tell a story " as best as possible using citizen media and verifiable images " . <p> A journalist writing an article about an ongoing protest , for example , will be able to set up a topic or ' voice ' on CrowdVoice.by , with a couple of hashtags to work as aggregators in the background and pull in everything people are sharing on that topic . <p> This stream can then be embedded on their website , but it will not be published until the journalist or a moderator has verified the content is accurate . <p> Al Shafei calls this " crowdsourced curation " , but another feature of CrowdVoice.by will be " crowdsourced verification " . Using a software called PyBossa , an open source framework designed especially for crowdsourced projects , the platform will let people actively participate in verifying the content . <p> " As the journalist , you can pick who 's doing the verification , it can be just you or you can harness the power of your community . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verification , it can be just you or you can harness the power of your communityEsra'a Al Shafei , CrowdVoice <p> " If you 're a large organisations like Reuters , you definitely have the resources to do it yourself .

But they do have a huge community of readers and loyal visitors who can help . " <p> The team behind CrowdVoice.by is also building a feature that will help both with filtering information and engaging with people in certain communities . <p> " You will be able to block someone who is taking advantage of the platform in an inappropriate way , but also choose if you want to crowdsource information only from your Twitter followers or specific groups of people , " Al Shafei told Journalism.co.uk . <p> Because CrowdVoice.by streams will be embeddable , readers of a given publication will see all the material posted without having to go back to the CrowdVoice.by website . <p> They will also have different options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , URLs or existing photos ( for copyright reasons they wo n't be able to post original images ) and it is up to the journalist to approve or disapprove of the material , or follow up on it . <p> " The journalist can turn it off , they can decide if they want to allow readers to engage or say ' no , actually , I 'd prefer to give them the information , not necessarily receive it ' , " Al Shafei pointed out . <p> She said they are also considering some potential paid-for features , such as news organisations adding their own branding or self-hosting on their own websites . <p> " The Knight Foundation grant allows us to at least experiment with the model and develop it based on the value people see in it and the feedback they give us.

@@97847566 @2047566/ <p> Jeff Jarvis used the keynote presentation at the World Editors Forum in Bangkok today to discuss his views on the " relationships , forms and models " news businesses should focus on . <p> " Do what you do best and link to the rest , " Jarvis , a well-known news industry commentator urged , ( a view shared by Anthony de Rosa who recently suggested news outlets stop " matching " and re-writing 500-word news stories already online ) . <p> By linking rather than re-writing , news outlets can be more efficient , and move on to what they are best at . " Think about what the real value is to the community , " Jarvis said . But to deliver what the community wants demands that you know and understand those individuals . <p> " What if we are not in the content business ? " he asked . The news industry is good at manufacturing things , but needs to move beyond doing just that . " Content is only one of many things we do . " <p> News is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news providers have with the public , with individuals . <p> News businesses need to understand those people as they become more valuable to advertisers the better they are understood . The " myth of mass media " was that all readers see all adverts , and in the old model media companies charged advertisers the same amount to speak to each reader , Jarvis said . <p> But users can have different values , he said , and offering the same product at the same price to everyone " does n't make sense any more " . <p> He urged delegates at the conference to think in terms of " small data " and how that can be used to target goods and services to individuals . Unique users and page views are old media metrics , he said , and the industry needs to focus metrics on relationships . <p> Ecosystem <p> Lots of players are now part of our ecosystem , with bloggers and other people and companies operating in the online space . " We can no longer be isolated , " Jarvis said , suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with readers , and even with governments if they are able to provide source material . <p> In his speech Jarvis referred to a conversation he had with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . " You do n't make communities , " Jarvis said , but you can enable communities to do what they want to do , to share information . <p> Jarvis suggested news outlets should involve and transform in other ways . " We should be incubators for start-ups , " he said . <p> He also discussed reorganising the inverted triangle way of telling a story . There are " assets and paths " , Jarvis argued , citing Circa , a mobile news app , as an organisation that tells stories in new ways . <p> He also alerted delegates to Repost.Us , a site which allows you to add text sources to an online story , where the " article becomes embeddable , like a video " .

There is a " paradox of engagement and Facebook has 30 times the engagement we have " . He said the move to " slap on " a paywall does not make sense when we consider this fact . <p> He proposes a reverse paywall ( something that he has previously written about ) .

He gave the example of research that found small businesses in New York were frequently not active on social , and just 9 per cent were found to have a web presence , according to Jarvis . He proposed that news outlets provide that service by connecting the businesses with customers in the online space . <p> " Beware of the sponsored content trap , " Jarvis said .

@@97847567 @2047567/ <h> How to : get hired by a book publisher as a freelancer <p> With more than 7,000 UK publishing establishments and more than one third of these working in book publishing , why do so many freelance editors and proofreaders find it hard to make a substantial income from their work ? <p> Just a glance at the website for the SfEP will show you just how pessimistic that organisation is about editorial freelancers finding work . But having sat behind a publisher 's desk for many years , I know to what extent the industry relies on freelance resources and that the publishing world simply would n't turn without the editorial expertise , design know-how , and of course , the flexibility , tenacity , and patience that every freelancer brings to their work . <p> I 'm not suggesting it 's easy , particularly for new freelancers . But , on the other hand , some recent research I conducted amongst those taking on freelancers confirms that publishers ca n't always have the luxury of working with those they know and trust . ' New ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will improve your chances of a publisher taking on your services ? What qualities do they put above all others ? Well , the research suggests there are six clear factors that matter most to a publisher . <p> 1 . You can adhere to tight deadlinesBook publishing is a deadline-driven business . Publication dates and publishing on time - for the critical Christmas sales period or the start of the academic year - will define a project 's financial success or failure . <p> Delivering work late is an absolute no no and if a tardy author has already submitted late , you may well be asked to recoup that time in the schedule . Not fair , I know , but it 's business-savvy to oblige . <p> 2 . You know your target market inside outAn expertise or subject knowledge will be expected of you , certainly if you 're starting out . Even as an experienced editor , you will need to have a comprehensive , bird 's eye view of the readership . <p> Publishers will expect you to know the level your audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So for example , teaching experience is a huge help if you want to work in educational publishing and will help set you apart from other editors and proofreaders . <p> 3 . You 're easy to work withPublishers , like most business clients , will give work to people they like to work with . Hone your social skills and appreciate that it is n't only what you do , it 's how you do it , too , that matters . <p> 4 . Your communication skills , particularly over the phone , are second to noneAs a freelancer , much of the work you do is over the phone . You may be required to carry out quite sensitive work with high-level authors . Publishers will not want to risk fast-selling , till-ringing authors to the whims of a bad-tempered , crotchety editor . <p> 5 . You provide value for moneyMuch publicity has leaked out about publishers ' declining interest in the accuracy and integrity of an author 's text . In truth , a squeeze on profits has required an increasingly tight-fisted approach to editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers are not necessarily looking to pay the lowest price for a freelance job . They are paying for the job to be done well and within the required timeframe , so will take a view on whether a freelancer 's work represents value for money . They might even be prepared to pay a pound or two more per hour if they know that the quality of the freelancer 's work will save money further down the line . <p> 6 . You guarantee high levels of confidentialityAll publishers want to work with the best freelancers . By the same token , the best freelancers are busy freelancers who work with many different publishing clients . But any publisher ca n't afford to let a contender for market position see its trump card . <p> Over the top , perhaps ?

You may have to carry out more of your own research to identify exactly what it is your potential clients would require of you before employing your services - and what evidence they need to retain you on their database of freelancers . <p> But with more than 100,000 new book titles published in the UK last year , there 's a great deal of freelance editorial work still to be done.Mary James is the tutor for the Publishing Training Centre 's one-day course ' Successful Editorial Freelancing ' .

How you finding it ? <p> Nick <p> I did the Sheffield College fast-track course when I was 29 . I turned 30 less than 3 weeks after the course finished and actually secured a trainee job on my birthday . There was another 29-year-old on my course and someone in their 40s ( although he did drop out ) . Quite a few of the recruits at my paper turned to journalism in their mid-20s so 28 is pretty normal . I think a lot of the graduates are far too naive to be decent general news reporters and lack the life experience needed to ask the right questions so I think 28 is a great age to get into it .

I personally think at 28-years-old you are not too old to become a journalist or return to college to do an NCTJ-accredited qualification . <p> I , however , am 34 and I really think I am too old to go back to college and study journalism . What do you think ? I fear most people , if I did go back to college would be in their late teens early 20s . <p> Studying journalism is something I have always wanted to do but work has always got in the way . I have held several staff jobs at national newspapers and magazines and not having shorthand has n't  really got in the way . But I am largely now a web journalist so shorthand is not really needed . <p> And also , can I just add , you are one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is extremely difficult to get stuff published on mainstream newspapers unless its on a blog ofcourse.but do n't  get me ranting on blogs.As I kind of have a disdain for the mainstream media when it comes to them not crediting blogs from stories .. <p> My wife and I started submitting articles on a freelance basis to US newspapers when we were in our 40s . She writes , I take photos . Within two years we averaged 6 million readers per submission . Even though we produce travel articles , not serious news pieces our credentials ( NY Times , Boston Globe , etc. ) was an open invitation to write for other sections of the newspapers . Another open door to editors would be to have a working knowledge of photography , video and editing ability of each . <p> Because of vanishing budgets in the US newspaper industry we now need to get creative in monetizing our efforts . What my wife and I are starting to do is to trade our articles , photos and videos for " followed " backlinks from online newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site thereby bringing in more visitors . We make our money by these visitors clicking through to relevant merchants on our websight/blog . We still stay in print also , as there are still many benefits to being there . Being very cutting edge , this way of breaking into newspapers is opening many doors for us as its a win/win for all . <p> Good luck in entering the journalism field , you 're never too old . And while being educated in traditional methods , keep one eye outside the box . This is where the future of journalism lies . <p> Hi , I remember entering MFA school at the ripe old age of 29 , married with two little boys at home . I gave up the security of a family business to put all my efforts into writing which up until that time had been part time . I also remember thinking , Am I too old ? Now at 44 , with several books under my belt , two more in the works , numerous articles and editing jobs to get done , I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I should have . And at 44 I ask myself , am I took old ? Hell , I run four miles a day , train with weights five days a week , the kids are grown and I 'm in a punk band . Next on my list , I 'd like to become a foreign correspondent . The real question is , am I too old to be in a bunk band ? ( **27;391;TOOLONG ) In any case , you have great credits and you are definitely not too old ! ! ! Cheers V <p> It seems to us that there is all sorts of good news and solutions to global banking crises etc that never get covered by the BBC or other mass media because real sustainability innovations are too micro . Did you know that Bangladesh now installs more solar units than the USA and openly wants to share its proof that thriving carbon negative economics is simple for any community with sunshine -why do n't  we celebrate good news like this http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=YewyIARIaIM Gordon Brown came over to pledge support at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scandals can nag on in tabloids for 30 days but good news leadership perish within 24 hours <p> We believe that the student year 08/9 is a once in a generation opportunity to ask where do we want global to go- can we network around millennium goals as realities to action not just nice sounding social images . From Oct 14 , we have 10000 dvds of good news video conversation starters to give out to clusters of uni students do say ( info@worldcitizen.tv ) if you know a group who would like to play good news journalism <p> Of course we 'd love 28 year olds to join in too if they have peers or media spaces open to give this a dialogue from every angle not just the usual 1-dimensional political poles . <p> Roz <p> What is everyone going on about ? I did my NCTJ at 31 and I was n't the oldest person there by a long chalk . The only bar to retraining is money .

I 'm 23 and doing a postgrad broadcast journalism course but the people on the course range in age from just turned 21 to about 48 . There 's quite a few people who are about the same age as you and have worked in boring things like recruitment for a few years earning decent money and then decided to pursue their dream . Good luck with your course , it sounds as if you have some good contacts , given the papers you have written for . <p> All the best , <p> Charlotte <p> Kizzie <p> YOur situation sounds so similar to mine without however the succesful freelance career you 've had I 've just started the LIverpool course Im 29 and about and most of the people on my course are 23 . The worst thing is being asked what I 've done for the last 7 years since my degree and then saying I 've wanted to be a journalist since I was about 12 I always assumed I 'd fail as everyone banged on about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and got a distinction so teh NCTJ seemed like a natural progression <p> I learnt abit of shorthand last year so I 'm alright on the theory but 100wpm by january is pretty scary . Reporters on my placement whove already done the course their advice is shorthand , shorthand . shorthand ! <p> The editor on my placement says the news writing exam is a load of pants and not at all representative of what youd actually be doing on a newspaper we are currently already going though the past exams papers basically re writing ridiculously wordy badly written press releases ( ive had work experiencce on various publications and have never seen anything like it ) . My tutor likens it to taking your driving test in that you 'll never write like it again when you 're an actual journalist . Worryingly though more people on the previous courses have failed the news writing exam , than the shorthand <p> Looking forward to you next post ! <p> Kizzie <p> oh also how does one get it to freelancing for the indie/Guardian ? I 'm already looking at jobs but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. <p> Hey , I had to get a degree to get my mother satisfied , before I could move towards journalism ( no degrees on the subject back then and no courses either , and without an NUJ ticket forget it ! And the NUJ despised people with degrees as not the right hard-knocks material that would make journalists . Made it eventually , thanks to tireless help and advise on the job by early editor/mentors who taught me everything , from how not to write an essay when it was meant to be a feature , to working on and enlivening arcane subjects like industry &amp; computers ! Sounds like Amys got the drive for the job . The best thing to learn from the NCTJ course is how to make everything you have to write about capable of spinning into more than just one paid-for piece . Its a neat trick and ensures your income . I have seen being used , but simply never mastered it myself ! <p> Rola Mansour <p> When I was 28 almost 9 years ago , I had the same fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I was not . For Gods sake you are only 28. when you are 58 then yes think that thought , and look at some one who is 28 , then you will realize how young they are . <p> Basically I was moving house and came across some old offers and letters . I realized the doors were open but my brain was under the restrain that I was too old to join the media . <p> Just try and keep trying all sorts of media exist and certainly need good writers with wit and professionalism . <p> Krupa <p> I have just completed the BBCs revamped news trainee programme -now known as the BBC journalism trainee scheme where the main criteria is that you must not have a broadcast journalism qualification . The oldest trainee was 38 , the youngest 22 and I , at the age of 25 decided to abandon my 3 years working in the international development sector in the hoping of returning to it one day via my journalism . I am now a freelancer with the World Service and Radio 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many journalists enter the industry straight after university with no other experience . Journalism needs diverse life experience and despite not having any journalistic training , my three years working in the migration sector have really been welcomed . I 've learnt from some of the best journalists that you 're never too old . <p> You blog describes exactly how I felt when I started from scratch on the trainee scheme . Thanks for sharing your thoughts and good luck with the course . <p> I just wanted to reply to Sabuhi . Sabubi , it sounds like you already are a journalist ? ! I do n't  think you 're too old to start retraining . I 'm sure you 've got a lot of life experience that you could apply to the job and more importantly , as my journalism teacher keeps going on about , an ability to empathise with people . <p> When do you know you 've become a journalist ?

Not yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you write for web and have had several staff newspaper jobs ! <p> Also Chris Gaynor .

I 'm doing it distance learning though my work though . I do n't  work at a publication/newspaper and ive never done any kind of journalism before so its a whole new experience for me . I have to admit when I got my course books though I was a bit daunted . My colleagues were really reassuring though as they are in the same boat . I 'm finding the text book intersting so far though and ive started on teeline . I 'm just wondering how I will ever get a chance to build a portfolio though when I work full time . One of my colleagues suggested that you can write articles in the style of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? Any advice would be much appreciated . How did you get started freelancing ? Thanks ! Gemma <p> Amy Oliver <p> Hi Gemma , <p> I think its really admirable that you are doing your NCTJ as a distance course and while working !

I know because I 've been there . <p> I 'm about half way through NCTJ Fast Track Magazines course at Harlow School of Journalism and from what Ive seen ability , confidence , and commitment are the keys to success . Age does n't  really come into it a great deal . ( OK I concede maybe it does when it comes to shorthand as the speed of mental processing declines with age . ) <p> To my joy my job disappeared last year and the severance pay has allowed me to strike-out to pastures new .

Unfortunately , my tale is more woeful than most : I have n't got a degree ( through choice , might I add I was all set to study English Lit at Liverpool Uni but decided not to take up my place there , then ended up building a career as a fashion buyer , but it was n't really flicking my switch ) . I 'm finding this lack of a higher qualification really frustrating as I 'm not having much joy in getting onto an NCTJ course without one . T is a shame , as I left the world of fashion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; have submitted pieces to online magazines and have got a 2-week work experience placement at a local rag next month . But I really know I need to get the skills that the NCTJ course provides under my belt in order to be taken seriously as a writer . So Amy , I just wanted to know if you have a degree and if anyone else has had simlar experiences ? I strongly feel that ability and passion , coupled with important " life-skills " gained through not going to university should be equally as attractive when applying for NCTJ courses any thoughts anyone ? ! <p> All the best , Natalie <p> Amy Oliver <p> Hi Natalie , <p> First of all , congratulations you have no student debt ! I however have a degree , an overdraft and a student loan that Mr Brown continues to add interest too . <p> The degree is in creative advertising on the copywriting side . <p> You do n't  say what kind of journalism you hope to specialise in if at all is it fashion related or are you interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? Could you use it to muscle in somewhere i.e. a fashion mag ? <p> I hear you about the degree but I do n't  see why it should stop you in your tracks . The course I 'm on at Lambeth specifies that you must have a degree to get on it . They do run a foundation degree which I believe is two years . <p> Have you looked on the NCTJ website ? They have all the courses listed I think I read that Darlington took people without degrees . Darlington has an amazing reputation as well . Why not give the NCTJ a call and ask for advice . <p> Great on the work experience for the local publication and also the writing for online magazines . One of my posts on this blog details how I started freelancing from scratch so check it out if you like . <p> I think the key is to believe that you can do anything you want at this stage . If you have a story , pitch the idea to a national what have you got to loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in and ask them about work experience . <p> The trouble with being our age and getting work experience is that old chestnut the rent . I do n't  know what your situation is but if you can comfortably work for free for a bit then my advice is to get as much as you can . <p> Hope that is helpful . I 'm off to do my shorthand . Sigh . <p> Amy <p> Amy Oliver <p> I 've just read your comment Jez . Ha Ha and yes , while I expect you are tarring me with the childish Mason Pearson , I know what you mean about the babes drinking till dawn . Facebook never lies . <p> Nat <p> I need a bit of help with working out whether to do a degree or NCTJ or both ! ! What 's it like at lambeth ? <p> I think I have decided to do a BA in journalism on a NCTJ accredited course so that I can have both a degree and the NCTJ qualification . It will be about a year shorter if I done them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a BA in journalism which is NCTJ accredited ? I really need some help . There are so many to choose from on the NCTJ site . <p> On the other hand i am also thinking of doing a foundation degree closer to home at lambeth college in london . I can sit my NCTJ exams there and then after my course I have the chance to study for a extra year at the metropolitan university to get my BA. hmm i 'm nt sure Is both a degree and the NCTJ qualification needed to gain entry into the industry or should i just do the NCTJ ? ! <p> Natalie xxxx <p> Natalie Wall <p> Hi Amy , <p> Thought I 'd post back on here , as this is still my favourite part of your blog thus far !

@@97847571 @2047571/ <p> As 2015 draws to an end , we looked back at some of the trends that have made their mark on digital media this year to see what they could mean for publishers in 2016 . <p> We asked three industry experts to reflect on the changes they have noticed in newsrooms in 2015 , and to explain how these might shape newsgathering and distribution in the next year . <p> You can also listen to their take in our latest podcast . The rise of 360-degree video This year , news organisations have released a host of virtual reality projects and immersive videos , from one-off experiments to declaring a commitment to the medium by building dedicated VR apps . <p> And as more social networks have started to support 360-degree videos on their platforms , the format has become one to watch for publishers looking to innovate in their video news coverage . <p> " 360-videos are becoming pretty mainstream now .

To try to change that , RTE may give out Google Cardboard virtual reality viewers with the release of its next big 360-degree video project in the new year . The New York Times also took a similar approach in November , when it offered Google Cardboard viewers alongside the print newspaper after the launch of its VR app . <p> " It 's really hard to predict how it 's going to go because it really is an extremely different experience to what people are used to , " said Mulcahy .

@@97847573 @2047573/ <p> While shorthand is seen as vital for journalists in the UK , in North American newsrooms it is said to be far less common <p> It is the time of year when potential journalism students across the UK are weighing up offers from different courses and deciding which is right for them . <p> For the vast majority shorthand is something they will have seen people use while on work experience , but have never learned themselves . <p> Whether or not a course offers shorthand is used by many as a benchmark , with the NCTJ identifying the industry standard as 100 words per minute ( wpm ) . <p> But with the rise of digital technologies , where does shorthand fit into the toolkit of the modern journalist ? <p> Is it still the most important skill to have , or are editors and news editors beginning to prioritise other skills ? <p> Cardiff University trainees Andrew Curry , Alex Bywater and Emily Davies all agree shorthand was one of the key skills they had learned while studying , and for Bywater and Davies it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davies told Journalism.co.uk : " I only considered courses which offered shorthand , as I knew it would be something employers would look for . " <p> " Aside from that , in previous jobs and on work experience I found I was struggling to take down interviews accurately and to sustain a normal-sounding conversation when I was trying to take notes in longhand , so I knew it would make my life easier in the long run . " <p> Bywater added : " Shorthand is part of NCTJ accredited courses , which was an important factor for me in choosing where to study . " <p> " It 's a skill I think is very important and one I feel I needed to learn . However , I believe the core skills of being able to write clean and concise copy and being creative in your writing are more important . " <p> The NCTJ told Journalism.co.uk they still regard shorthand as being a fundamental skill for all journalists , so it remains a compulsory part of their Diploma in Journalism qualification . <p> A spokesman said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and point to the vast majority of job postings for trainee journalists requiring 100 wpm shorthand as evidence of this . <p> Alison Gow , editor of the Daily Post , told Journalism.co.uk she was less sure shorthand was as vital as it used to be and suggested with the increased emphasis on liveblogging and tweeting from major events , the ability to touch-type a verbatim quote was becoming just as important as the ability to take it down in shorthand . <p> She said : " If a reporter is liveblogging a council meeting or sat in court , typing up in real time , would they need a shorthand note ? Their notes are on the screen , after all . <p> " Possibly they would n't have time to liveblog and take a shorthand note if they were concentrating on the proceedings " most journalists who live-tweet in court are sat there in addition to another reporter who is taking a shorthand note of the proceedings . <p> " That may work for the nationals " and for the really standout moments of a major regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of resource . <p> " Something has to slip and if we are moving more towards convergence then I would see liveblogging as more important . " <p> This view was recently echoed by Andy Dickinson , course leader for the BA digital journalism production programme at the University of Central Lancashire . Discussing the topic on Twitter earlier this month he argued there were lots of good reasons to have shorthand , but no single compelling reason that it was a must have . <p> Outside of the UK shorthand is not taught as standard , which the recent discussion on Twitter attributed to the historical ban on recording devices in UK courts and many public meetings , which was not reflected around the world . <p> Even though recording devices are now allowed in many courts and meetings , the efficiency and legal protection a good shorthand note offers was the explanation given most often for why editors still value shorthand so highly . <p> Paul Rowland , news editor at Media Wales , told Journalism.co.uk : " Personally , I would put every bit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording , providing the shorthand was clear and legible . <p> " Anecdotally , lawyers are tending to prefer audio recordings as evidence in legally contentious cases these days , but as long as the law is happy that a shorthand note carries weight in court , so am I. " <p> The ease with which shorthand can be used while out and about in the community was also cited by practising journalists as to why they valued their shorthand so highly . <p> Reliability is also seen an important factor . It seems every journalist has or knows of a horror story where a journalist has relied on technology to record an important interview , only to come to the end and realise the battery has died or the device has failed to record properly . <p> Rowland said this was why shorthand will " always be crucial for journalists " . <p> " I always remember a couple of years ago a reporter coming to tell me about a great interview they 'd just done over the phone , only to return crestfallen a couple of minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken any shorthand notes as back-up , he was left with no choice but to conduct the whole interview again . " <p> Despite valuing other skills just as highly , Gow told Journalism.co.uk if she was a trainee now she would still make sure she had her shorthand due to the number of editors who will not consider candidates without it . <p> As an editor , she said she preferred job applicants to have a shorthand qualification . <p> " It tells me they can apply themselves to learn new skills and commit to quite lengthy processes to gain an outcome . That sort of attitude is itself a transferable skill . <p> " However , I would n't automatically discount someone who did n't have 100 wpm shorthand if they demonstrated other skills " online community management , for example , or had video skills , or a hyperlocal blog . " <p> Rowland stressed that when he was looking at applicants for reporting positions shorthand was still an essential requirement and he would not consider a candidate without it . <p> " If they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't got 100 wpm , but was considered to be close , they 'd have a chance . But it would certainly count against them . " <p> For next year 's trainees and beyond there is no doubt amongst those surveyed that shorthand is a fundamental skill and will continue to be so . <p> As long as editors continue to value it , it will continue to be a compulsory part of the NCTJ syllabus and a skill the majority of newspaper journalists would struggle to be without . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757 
@@97847574 @2047574/ <p> As the biggest social network in the world , and therefore the biggest captive audience , Facebook has become the golden calf of digital publishing in recent years , as news outlets sweat over what the latest algorithm updates may do to their web traffic . <p> Grabbing the attention of some of the 1.4 billion Facebook users is central to many organisations ' digital strategy , but Al Jazeera 's AJ+ , launched last September for a young US audience , seems to be light years ahead in terms of how Facebook users are engaging with their content . <p> Engagement is what 's in our DNARaja Sharif , AJ+ <p> At the time of writing , AJ+ 's total of 680,000 Facebook ' Likes ' is modest compared to , say , Vice ( 4.3m ) or BuzzFeed ( 5.1m ) , with whom they arguably share an audience and style . <p> But the ' People talking about this ' metric , which totals all possible interactions with a page 's content from individual users across the network over the last seven days , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . <p> For Vice , this figure currently stands at almost 424,000 , or 9.8 per cent of the number of page likes . At BuzzFeed , their engagement level is 39.6 per cent of total page likes . AJ+ ? More than 4.3 million individuals have interacted with AJ+ content on Facebook in the last week . That 's 635 per cent of their page likes . <p> " We were always set up from the beginning to be an engagement led channel , " Raja Sharif , strategy implementation manager at AJ+ , told Journalism.co.uk , and staff are told when they start that " engagement is what 's in our DNA " . <p> Without a dedicated website " and casting aside the walled garden of mobile apps for this exercise " social media platforms are the alpha and omega of the AJ+ publishing strategy . <p> But if almost every other publisher under the sun is trying to make Facebook work for them , what makes AJ+ so special ? We quizzed Sharif to find out . <p> Native videos <p> Although not explicitly stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king of online video for a while now . Videos uploaded directly to Facebook get a boost in users ' newsfeed and , according to The Next Web , Facebook even prompts some users to ditch their YouTube links for a native video . <p> As the upstart son of an international broadcaster , videos come naturally to AJ+ and make up 99 per cent of the outlet 's Facebook posts . <p> " We have regular meetings on a daily basis that help us understand and review how the videos are doing , " said Sharif . " That gives the team the lessons in how to produce the videos going forward . <p> " So it gives you retrospective information in terms of how the videos are doing , rather than dictate to you how you should produce those videos . " <p> Now that Facebook videos auto-play in the newsfeed , those first three to five seconds have become vital in grabbing the audience 's attention , a window engagement lead Jigar Mehta said is now at the centre of the production process . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds ? Do you think this is going to work on Facebook ? ' , " he told Nieman Lab in a recent interview . " That took time ; it was n't just that all of a sudden , everyone got it . " <p> So when producers dropped the AJ+ ident in favour of a striking image and text for the first few seconds , views boomed and with them the number of shares , likes and comments . <p> With the knowledge that much of their 18 to 34 age bracket will be viewing on mobile , videos average one to two minutes and any dialogue is subtitled , letting people follow the story without the need to get their headphones out or " more likely " just skip past the video . <p> Understanding the audience <p> " We were very particular about trying to ensure our staff would fit to the demographic we 're trying to capture , " said Sharif , adding that " consultants " have told senior AJ+ staff they have one of the most diverse newsrooms in America . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the news stories and how those news stories are approached . " <p> Recent stories include a huge wild fire in Northern California ; animal welfare in Idaho ; audio of an Alabama police officer threatening to kill a black man and cover it up ; sexism faced by a young , female engineering student ; a plot to bring down the Planned Parenthood ; and the abuse an " Italian Huntress " has received for showing off her big-game kills . <p> An AJ+ video , featuring strong language , from YouTube . The opening ident does n't feature on Facebook , where the video has had almost 6,000 interactions in eight hours . It has been viewed less than 4,000 times on YouTube . <p> All arguably capture the zeitgeist of public discourse among young , connected Americans and in the 12 hours all six have been online , they have garnered almost 20,000 likes , shares and comments . That figure does not include the conversations building up around individual comments , some of which reach dozens of replies in themselves . <p> " Our videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " continued Sharif . " A lot of our management , if I can put it this way , have raised their eyebrows in terms of the freedom we give in language that is allowed to be put in our videos . <p> " I think it 's very interesting that you create a team to reflect your audience . " <p> A dedicated engagement team <p> The AJ+ engagement team , which Sharif said is almost as big as the editorial team , has three subsets : a social media team , who write and schedule posts , engagement producers and a data team . <p> " We have engagement producers embedded in all our video production teams , " he said , " so those guys create an expectation of what audience is going to come and how they are going to engage around the videos . <p> " Then the data teams are the important teams , as they tell us whether the videos are reaching the right audience and what lessons we can learn from the data that we 're getting back in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work very well together . " <p> Mehta said the data teams are working on their own " engagement score " by which to understand videos and feed back information to editorial and production staff about when and why videos may be more popular . <p> Engagement stats for the Facebook pages of AJ+ , Vice and BuzzFeed <p> And what 's more , staff regularly trade roles within the newsroom to give them a greater understanding of the different factors that go into production " rather than silos building up " . <p> " It gets people to show what talent , perhaps , they have on the video production side , " said Sharif , " or have on the social media side . And it also allows people to empathise with each other so they know what to do . <p> " These are automatic learning sessions rather than ' lecture and audience ' kind of sessions . That rotation that we do between those teams really helps them to gel together . " <p> Most important , though , said Sharif , is a culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work " individually and collectively " in reaching new audiences in new ways . <p> " If it had n't been for Al Jazeera allowing us to experiment , I do n't think we would have been successful as we are , " he said , " and , more importantly I think , help other companies and colleagues understand the power of the digital platform for current affairs programs . " <p> AJ+ does n't have the same commercial pressures as many other organisations , pressures that could be a help or a hindrance depending on how they integrate with editorial . <p> But if Facebook really does become the biggest video platform on the social web , AJ+ might just be the light that guides the rest of the industry into making it work for them . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

a company 's organisational structure ; and a newsroom culture open to incorporating analytics for longer term development . <p> It also identified that some outlets have successfully tailored their approach to analytics according to their goals and business models , which can vary from editorial impact , to higher reach or converting readers into paying subscribers . <h> The use of analytics in European and North American newsrooms <p> Chapter two of the report analysed a number of news organisations operating in different markets to find similarities and differences in how they have incorporated analytics into their editorial workflows . <p> Three types of analytics were identified : <p> rudimentary " offers a certain amount of data , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " multiple analytics tools are used , but the newsroom 's structure and mindset are optimised for short-term results ; <p> editorial " bespoke tools , supported by an organisation and culture focused on short-term and long-term data-informed decisions , and flexible to evolve as the industry changes <p> Between themselves , the four organisations ticked the three boxes of tools , organisation and culture through their use of in-house analytics platforms , tailored metrics and dedicated audience teams . <p> Elsewhere in continental Europe , the study found audience development teams or even audience editors were not that common , with analytics often overseen ad-hoc or performed as an additional task by existing members of the newsroom . <p> An example of this is Ze.tt , a digital-only spin-off from the publisher of German newspaper Die Zeit and Zeit Online launched in July 2015 , which currently uses data to monitor and grow their audience , and Dutch crowdfunding platform De Correspondent , where analytics are mainly used to track newsletter signups and their rate of conversion to subscriptions . <p> Anonymously , several interviewees in the report expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have yet to tailor their approaches for interpreting the data in a relevant and insightful manner . <p> Cherubini and Nielsen suggested this was likely caused by the organisational structure of the company , a lower pressure faced by these outlets in competing for global audiences and a delay in adopting the relevant technology and terminology , which are often developed and marketed in the US and UK first . <h> Striking the balance between technology , organisation and culture <p> " Analytics are about technology and data , but not only technology and data , " Cherubini and Nielsen pointed out in the report . <p> They outlined a model where tools , organisation and culture are the three dimensions of a triangle designed to assess news outlets ' capability to figure out the best analytics approach to suit them and their resources . <p> In this scenario , the tools are represented by the technology used in the newsroom , including data sources , software , interfaces and internal and external analytics platforms . <p> The organisational aspect refers to a structured process of using analytics , assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the newsroom . <p> The third dimension , culture , was identified as an overall attitude of editorial staff to " routinely and willingly use analytics and data as part of their decision-making " . <p> While many audience teams often provide performance data to the newsroom through daily or regular emails , or by implementing short-term strategies to optimise content , " these are numbers without meaning and without consequences and rarely inform editorial decision-making " . <p> " Developing a culture of data ' in the newsroom is about making sure that journalists and editors who are not part of the audience team are given access to data that are relevant to them , know why " and agree that " this data is relevant for them , and know how to act on it , " Cherubini and Nielsen said in the report . <h> Challenges and opportunities in editorial analytics <p> Looking ahead , two types of challenges were defined in the report , according to how far publishers are from transitioning from rudimentary or generic analytics to editorial use . <p> News organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look at : defining metrics for measuring success ;

" <p> The idea came from the pair both working within local media , and noting a shift in technological and distribution of news over the years , yet little change to the sources or production process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge to ourselves at the start of the year to see could we reinvent city media " seeing if we could base the newsroom just on data , " said Rogers . <p> There is an enormous amount of information that seems to be largely untapped and that people just are n't looking at it and using it.Gary Rogers , Urbs.London <p> " A lot of local journalism still involves individuals going out and chasing ambulances and trying to find stories from selected small numbers of sources , or perhaps feeding off press releases or information that they are told in a more constrained circumstance as financial pressures push down reporter numbers . " <p> By replacing conventional sources and basing the newsroom purely on data , Rogers hoped to find a way to produce a scalable model that could result in stories cheap to generate , easy to produce and still extremely newsworthy . <p> Although the team initially had concerns they would inadvertently create a " not-the-news site " , possibly running the risk of focusing on the information that other journalists thought was too " mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following on Facebook of over 22,500 people , and has published over 300 articles . <p> By telling stories that were not based on single random events , explained Rogers , the team proved it is possible to tell the story of a city in a different way , through large numbers of occurrences and developing trends . <p> The pair chose to focus on London as they wanted to have a bigger audience to serve and a wider choice of information to analyse . <p> By using the London Datastore as their bedrock to gather content , which offers access to 600 data sets and growing , Rogers and Renwick hoped to make the work of the local authority more transparent to the city 's residents . <p> " Essentially the task we had was to take the Excel spreadsheets , which are organised and sorted , and turn it into a narrative story that you could read on a tablet or a mobile phone , " Rogers said . <p> Screenshot from London Datastore . <p> Choosing suitable topics to cover with data <p> The company began experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes around living in a city , such as housing , jobs , and transport . <p> " We found that doing the harder topics in the city has worked far more successfully than trying to do something light and frivolous . " Rogers said . <p> " Now people expect to get their information from us " a piece where we used national insurance registration numbers on migrant workers across the capital is our most successful story to date ! " <p> How they tackled the information <p> Their data analysis method was initially a challenge for Rogers and Renwick , attempting to tackle huge amounts of complex information and make them understandable to the average member of the public . <p> " We wanted to try out different depths and types of data to see what we could get out of them " some of them very well organised and easy to handle but some of them were complex and took lots of time , " Rogers said . <p> " Once we started , we felt like we were on a treadmill and it was quite stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish ! <p> " We were trying to think of a methodology around this to give us focus , " he said . <p> The pair soon began to realise that rather than providing breaking news , their role may be better to provide enlightenment around the story of the day . <p> For example , they could pick a big topic such as housing , dig into property prices to provide a bedrock of information on what was really going on behind the scenes there , which could be then used on any day when a related story is running in the media . <p> In order to save time , Rogers and Renwick decided to create multiple stories out of single data sets , as they found a large group of numbers would give a cascade of stories that worked at various levels . <p> We were trying to think of a methodology around this to give us focusGary Rogers , Urbs.London <p> " If we were going to spend a lot of time digging into something , we wanted to get a lot of value out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get data and analyse the trends of , for example , crime across the capital , and then you will get out of that more intricate stories such as the theft of dogs . You can drill down and report on smaller areas , such as crime data in different boroughs . " <p> The team at Urbs.London used this method across various subject areas , even analysing which tube line provides the most unreliable service in London . <p> " Although there are always lots of individual pieces of content to do , once you have done a few , you are almost on a production line and you could sweep through the data . <p> " The information was easier to handle than we thought it would be " the positive thing about the early experience was that with just a basic level of Excel skill , we could excavate just a few stories to start with , " Rogers said . <p> Screenshot from Urbs.London <p> Developing hypothesises <p> In order to save time analysing data , Rogers explained how the team would apprehend the value and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend time looking into issues just to find there was nothing particularly newsworthy there . <p> " We get this data set and have a drill around to develop a hypothesis of what might be in there " just to try and direct us , so we have the flexibility to change tack quite quickly when we see that is not the case , and to focus on answering a simple question " ' what is the story here ? ' " he said . <p> " You have to have a journalistic nose when working with data for sniffing something and thinking ' that smells a bit odd to me ' and saying ' I think we should investigate that more ' . " <p> Producing a journalistic style <p> In order to make the data as simplified as possible , all stories on Urbs.London are under 400 words , and link back to the original data for verification and authenticity . <p> " We were trying to build an interlocking picture of little stories which gave you the bigger whole , " said Rogers . <p> " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of them , you would get a bigger picture , so it is about linking and connecting all the way through . <p> " It sounds ambitious , but if you start with small building blocks , the Lego clicks together and you begin to get insights from looking at one thing to the other . " <p> Additionally , Rogers feels that infographics are unnecessary and actually take away the simplicity of the story which they are trying to create . <p> " What we did n't want to do was get involved in complex infographics which take time to interpret , because I think one of the problems in visualising data stories is that those visualisations themselves require levels of interpretations , and that seems like a barrier to understanding . <p> " So we were back to the simplest way to tell a story ... write it with words , " Rogers said . <p> " If I have taken away anything from the past six months , it is that there is an enormous amount of information that seems to be largely untapped and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . <p> " I do n't know if that 's because of a failing by journalists , whether collectively as a profession we have got used to being spoon-fed and not going back to the source , or whether the idea of digital source seems so difficult for us to cope with , but there were lots of things that were easily available and worthy of enquiry that other media was not touching . <p> " There are a lot of different avenues to pursue what we 've learned as an open city , data to news narrative organisation , but we are hoping that one of those can mean that this experiment can turn into some form of sustainable business .

@@97847588 @2047588/ <p> Graphic novels are a well-established storytelling method , although not one usually associated with hard news . But in journalism , where visual stories may resonate better with audiences than a text only approach , illustrations can help depict sensitive images and complex situations in a softer way . <p> Photojournalist Marc Ellison has spent the last six months working on a graphic novel called Graphic Memories , which details the lives of four women in northern Uganda and their struggle to re-integrate into society after being abducted in their teenage years by militant group the Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) . <p> He first became familiar with the issue in 2011 , when researching the reintegration challenges faced by women after they 'd returned as former child soldiers for his master 's thesis . <p> This enabled him to spend a few months in Uganda doing research , meeting and talking to some of the women that had returned after spending the majority of their lives with the LRA . <p> " An expert in the field said to me , ' if you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to these former child soldiers , specifically women , once they leave the LRA , because nobody has really looked at this serious issue ' , " Ellison said . <p> Although the militant group was chased out of northern Uganda in 2006 , women still returning are faced with a scarcity of resources and lack of help from the government and NGOs , which have been unable to keep up with the flood of returnees over the last decade . <p> Grace Achara and Jacinta Acan are among the four women portrayed in the novel and have both returned to Uganda as recently as September 2014 . Ellison was keen on " educating people about the fact that the war is only half of the story " . <p> An illustration from chapter 3 of Graphic Memories , telling the story of Jacinta Acan <p> The idea behind doing a graphic novel in a web format , embedding illustrations with photographs and video interviews , was to tap into the large digital audience . <p> Ellison 's project has been inspired by the work of cartoonist and journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print graphic novel about his experiences in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1991 . <p> " Having photos and videos to complement the illustrations is a constant reminder , throughout the stories , that they 're very real stories " , Ellison explained , " because I think after reading the first 50 pages of a graphic novel , it 's easy to forget that . " <p> " My hope was also that this novel could be used as some sort of pedagogical tool in schools , whether that 's in Uganda or in the West , to educate secondary school students about the developmental challenges facing post war communities . " <p> During his trip to Uganda in May , Ellison worked with illustrator Christian Mafigiri , conducting interviews with women who had returned from the LRA before spending the next few months creating storyboards , scripting and animating the chapters . <p> Each of the four final chapters contains around 30 illustrations , which he tried to " divide fairly evenly between the woman 's abduction , some of her experiences in ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each chapter is reserved for the challenges the women have faced since returning . <p> While some of the women 's experiences were very traumatising , having endured violence , witnessed murder and other horrifying acts , Ellison did n't want his work to focus on the " graphic or sensationalist " elements . But he felt it necessary to include them in the story and portray them " as tastefully as possible " in order to illustrate the problems faced by the victims now . <p> He said the decision of not depicting these scenes directly in the illustrations , but rather giving a rough idea and providing context through speech bubbles and videos of the women talking , is " powerful enough without having to show anything " . <p> " I think the advantage of comic book journalism is that most of us have read comic books or cartoons since we were kids and they 're often a powerful way of telling complex stories in a visual way , rather than just reading about them , " Ellison told Journalism.co.uk . <p> A video embedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her struggles in dealing with people who mistreated her upon her return from the LRA <p> For example , one of the chapters tells the story of former child soldier Mary Aluku , from the standpoint of NGOs and their work in a region where people rely heavily on foreign aid . <p> The women portrayed in some of the other chapters have coped with reintegration in society in different ways " relying on a relative for financial help and finding a job , or trying to make a living with skills learned during their time in the LRA , such as making and selling alcoholic drinks , but they are still struggling . <p> Many would like to set up businesses to support themselves and their families , but this is almost impossible because of the lack of training or access to higher education . <p> Ellison said the biggest challenge was telling their stories in an accurate and considerate way , without forcing them to relive traumatising events from their past they are still struggling to cope with . <p> " It 's easy for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to give people the bigger picture and educate the Western audience , " Ellison said . <p> " This different approach to storytelling is almost like having a virtual conversation with these women , as you 're constantly reminded throughout the story that it is their very real life story and people can empathise with what they 're going through . " <p> He also hopes that people reading the novel " will take that leap from reading a story to doing something about it " , either by wanting to learn more about the issues or help out by donating to some of the NGOs supporting the cause . <p> In December , Ellison will be travelling to Tanzania for two months , after recently receiving a fellowship from the Aga Khan Foundation in Canada and the Canadian government to work on another graphic novel , focusing on child rights and child marriage in Tanzania , which will be published in the Toronto Star next spring . <p> " There 's an appetite for using graphic novels to tell these kinds of developmental stories , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why I think some news organisations might find it hard to justify putting in that much work for a one-off project , " said Ellison. 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

@@97847592 @2047592/ <h> How to : make tax less taxing for freelancers <p> The business model for news production is changing . More and more permanent jobs are being shed in local and regional media and the industry is creating an ever-expanding pool of freelance journalists . <p> This is leading to greater pressures on journalists to find work . Coupled with the culture of relentless deadlines that exist to feed the public 's appetite for 24-hour news , freelance journalists have ever-increasing time constraints so do not always have the desire or resources to keep track of their finances , VAT , tax and National Insurance ( NI ) . <p> In this article , Derek Kelly , managing director of ClearSky Accounting , a specialist accountancy firm for contractors and freelancers , lays out the financial signposts for freelancers . Limited , not limiting Traditionally , the majority of freelance journalists have worked through their own limited company , because the tax advantages of working this way far outweighed any other method . <p> A limited company is a corporate structure created to handle the tax and business accountancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a third-party accountant . Given the specific and complex nature of accounting required by freelancers , you could consider using a specialist accountant , rather than a high-street service provider . This option provides not only a tailored service , but it also offers assurance to any journalist dealing with experts whose job it is to navigate the tricky waters of tax , compliance and all things related to Her Majesty 's Revenue &amp; Customs ( HMRC ) . <p> But regardless of what route a journalist thinks best for his or her career path , they need the facts to steer a prudent course . <p> Tax is taxing This is because it comes in many disguises . Having been in the business for 18 years , I know only too well that freelancers can easily get bogged down with all the ins and outs of VAT , income tax and PAYE tables . However , a freelancer should have an overview of the whole tax situation and be able to delve a little deeper into the subject . This puts them in the driving seat so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much to pay the taxman and when . <p> VAT VAT is a ' sales ' tax that is controlled and collected by the HMRC . Freelancers who work through a limited company and expect to turn over more than -68,000 per annum should register for VAT . VAT can be calculated ( and repaid ) on a cash or accruals basis - i.e. based on when VAT is received from invoices , or based on invoices sent during the VAT quarter for which payment has not yet been received . Freelancers can also opt for the flat rate scheme , which can save time and be financially beneficial . An accountant should be sought to advise which method is best for individual circumstances . <p> Income tax Freelancers are liable to pay income tax on all money received . Freelancers operating through a limited company will have the option of paying themselves a salary or taking dividends out of the profits . If a salary is paid , PAYE tax and National Insurance must be deducted and paid over to HMRC . <p> Freelancers who reach the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined income from the company will have to fill out a self-assessment form for income received in each tax year . The HMRC uses the details on this form to calculate whether any additional tax is due . Any tax owed is payable by 31 January of the following year . <p> Most freelancers pay an accountant to fill out their self-assessment form . The normal charge for this is -50 to -150 per year depending on the complexity of the financial affairs . Accountants , such as my own , ClearSky , include this within the monthly fee . <p> Professional insurance Freelance journalists , as part of their daily work , provide a professional service that is relied upon by their clients . This means that if mistakes are made , or the freelancer is deemed to have been professionally negligent , they have a direct financial responsibility to their client for any errors and may be liable for compensation . An example would be if a freelancer left a briefcase by their desk that someone tripped over ; the freelancer could face a claim against their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on evidence of freelancers having professional indemnity insurance ; having this protection proves to clients that the freelancer is professional and responsible in their approach and it can help in securing future work . <p> Freelancers may also want to consider taking out their own health insurance and sickness cover , because a long stretch of illness could mean no income . Policies range in scope and terms and therefore also in cost . Freelancers should consider how long they could financially exist whilst not working and seek a policy that pays sickness benefits after that period of time has elapsed . <p> Many freelancers work from home but it can not be assumed that a normal household insurance will be enough to cover any business assets . In any case , it will certainly not usually cover business risks but it is possible to obtain special ' working from home ' policies . <p> ' P ' is for ... ? P60 is a statement of how much PAYE tax and National Insurance has been paid by the freelance journalist during the year . This is issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freelancers running their own limited company will be a director and , regardless of income , must complete another P , this one is a P11D , which is a return of expenses ' payments and benefits form every year . <p> A P45 completes the three Ps and is a statement of earnings and tax payments from a previous employer ; it is needed to ensure freelancers are on the correct tax code when freelancers change jobs . If no P45 is available , then a P46 can be issued to receive a full code from the tax authorities . <p> Time to retire ? Pensions have long been the most efficient way of reducing tax and NI liabilities . For example , pension contributions of -6,000 per annum would result in a tax saving of -2,400 for the higher rate taxpayer ( assuming a 40 per cent higher tax band ) . <p> For freelance journalists affected by IR35 , there are significant benefits to investing in a pension as it will reduce the overall national insurance and PAYE liability . There are a wide variety of pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice as this could offer substantial savings . It is advisable to always consult an Independent Financial Adviser ( IFA ) before committing to anything . <p> Pensions are an important part of retirement planning and should be reviewed annually , they also serve as tax planning opportunities . <p> Claimable expenses Aside from any expenses that are incurred on client-related project work that can be charged to that client , general business expenses can also be legitimately claimed . This has the effect of reducing any tax and NI liabilities . <p> For those freelancers using a limited company falling within IR35 legislation , there is a five per cent general allowance for expenses . Freelancers can also still claim ' Schedule E ' expenses , such as subsistence and mileage payments . Whilst possible , it is not common practice for the limited company to have a dispensation , therefore freelancers must keep all receipts and ensure a P11D ( tax statement of expenses and benefits ) is completed each tax year . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

It then tells the story through the lives of different individuals . The viewer becomes a cashier , a cycle courier , and an office worker , and the film explains how the law will affect each person . <p> Journalism.co.uk spoke to Neal Mann , multimedia innovations editor at the WSJ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided to take this approach in interactive storytelling . <p> Multilayered storytelling <p> " A few months ago we talked about the potential for doing a healthcare video , an explainer for our audience on how the changes would affect them when they roll out at the start of next year , " Mann explained . <p> " A few things things went through our heads but one thing that really stuck was that we could do this from a first-person perspective . The healthcare roll out is all about how the law affects you , and that 's the story we wanted to tell . " <p> Mann 's view is that " traditional TV-style methods " do not always act as good explainers . <p> He therefore started to think about doing the piece from a first-person perspective " and using interactivity as a way to allow the reader to engage further and get more background " . <p> One of the big challenges for Mann , Cole and the reporters involved was to distill the story and explain the key facts and to point people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storytelling allowed them to do this . <p> " The interactivity adds another layer , " Mann said . " And that was really quite exciting because in news , and particularly in news video , we are normally condensing incredibly complex issues into very short periods of time . What interactivity allows us to do is to really expand on that and allow the viewer to expand on areas where they may need some extra background detail . " <p> Creating the video <p> So how was it created ? " Most of the time went into the planning stage , " Cole explained . " Neal and I worked with reporters in our DC bureau to really plan the script . " <p> Cole explained that the script , the first-person narrative , was key and getting it right took time . They also spent time finding suitable locations before filming " which was done using a headcam . <p> The headcam was an old hockey helmet with a DSLR camera mounted in front of the camera person 's face . <p> Cole , who wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " cheap DSLR " and " about $40 worth of equipment to build the rig for the helmet " . <p> The WSJ team then worked with a company based in Belgium called Zentrick which added the interactivity . <p> " We designed how the interactions would work , we scripted them and worked with a designer on our team to imagine what the look would be , " Cole explained , " and then the company in Belgium spent a week building it for us before we rolled it out on our site . " <p> Mann and Cole said it was hard to judge how long they spent on the piece as they were both working on multiple projects at the time , but were keen to get across the ease at which other newsrooms could create such an interactive . <p> Cole said reaction has been positive . " Looking at feedback and analytics to see how people are using this video we are finding they are interacting with it and we would certainly explore using this kind of interaction in future stories , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this project was we built all of this based on the story we wanted to tell . We identified that the Affordable Care Act is often a broad , political story for most readers and viewers . So we wanted to bring it down to their level , use this helmetcam point-of-view perspective , along with interactivity which allowed us to do that in a better way . <p> " For me it was really : prioritise your story , figure out how you tell that in the best possible way , and do n't let technology or a fear of something new get in your way . " Future approaches to video storytelling <p> Is this type of video something we can expect to see more of from the WSJ ? " Looking to the future we want to tell stories differently , " Mann said . <p> " One of the reasons we approached this in the way we did was the traditional news format does n't suit all the types of stories we have now , particularly when we have the internet at our disposal . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to tell stories in a different and engaging way and ultimately to get the viewer to the end of a video and have them understand everything they 've just seen . " <p> Mann also talked about plans to take the technology used in the video and roll it out across the WSJ and " so interactivity is something that becomes the norm " . <p> " Video is now a staple part of the Wall Street Journal 's output and we do it across a variety of different platforms , " Mann said . " It 's a way for us to engage with the audience and for the audience to get a different view on our output . " <p> So where does this web-native style of film fit into the WSJ 's other video offerings ? <p> " We are starting to look to the way in which we design video , " Mann continued . " This for me is a key aspect of what we are trying to do .

" So they send out a PDF , you or I go into the PDF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do a Datawrapper chart ... <p> " With Pro , when you get data from the organisations producing it , that will be in Datawrapper so journalists can see it , click a few buttons and see how it looks .

Mirko Lorenz , Datawrapper <p> Datawrapper has already been working with an organisation that produces " international trading data " and the Pro offering , available on a pro rata basis , will work with sources to simplify the process of data journalism in the newsroom . <p> " We want to put this data into the hands of journalists so they can see that data , they can cite it and essentially just copy it and throw it into their own layout , " he said . " So after shortening the way to create a chart we would like to shorten the way to find data . <p> " For a big data project like the ones we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking your own data , working with specialists or a team to get jaw-dropping visualisations . <p> " But in daily business I noticed that even high level publications , instead of doing a chart and looking at it from a data perspective they are linking out to the German statistical office for example because that 's where the news came from . " <p> The pricing of Datawrapper Pro may be prohibitively expensive for small newsrooms but that is reflective of the work that will go into it , Lorenz said . <p> Datawrapper will " remain open source " , with code libraries available on GitHub . The ultimate aim , though , is to push the field and practice of data journalism forward , said Lorenz , and better integrate the process in newsrooms around the world . <p> In recent years , news organisations themselves have been public in their decisions to restructure around data journalism for the same ends . <p> Lorenz said the intention at Datawrapper is to keep removing barriers to effective data journalism , and the team is particularly proud that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalists working to a deadline , a quality he wants to continue . <p> " In most newsrooms there is not that time on daily news items to work on it for another half an hour or an hour . <p> " We do n't want to churn stuff out , but why make something that can be simplified more complicated than it needs to be ?

Care also needs to be taken when using Skype or another VOIP system , instant messaging and social media networks , such as Facebook , Twitter , Google+ . <p> Solutions <p> When faced with verifying the sender of an email , there is some good old fashioned journalism to be done . You will need to cross-check sources and speak to the sender to verify the email source . Common sense can go a long way . <p> One technical solution to ensuring both the sender is who you think they are and also to keep the communication between you secure , is to encrypt your information . <p> Honan recommends using a PGP , encryption software from Symantec , and various open source options , such as OpenPGP . <p> He explains how a public key encryption system works for email . " Both the sender and intended recipients have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a public key and a private key . The private key is what you keep yourself and the public key is what you publish . <p> " If I wanted to send an email to you , I would go and look for your public key and encrypt my email using your public key . The only way that email can then be decrypted is by you entering in your private key . There 's a match there to keep that information secure . " <p> Once the relationship is established by swapping public keys , all communication is then encrypted . " The only way to break the encryption is for someone to get your private key . That means they have to gain access to your computer or you have to give it to someone . " <p> Risk 2 .

You wo n't find details of people who are risking their livelihoods or their lives to talk to me . " <p> You might decide to leave the names of sources in a notebook , but you will no doubt need to keep some sensitive information on your computer . <p> Honan advises encrypting your computer , particularly devices you carry round with you , such as laptops , tablets and smartphones , plus backup drives and USB keys , all of which can be easily lost or stolen . <p> " I wo n't say it is impossible , but once encrypted it is very difficult for someone to get that information , " says Honan . <p> When encrypting your laptop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Do keep backups but keep the backups secure and encrypted , " he advises . <p> Encryption is built into modern operating systems , such as iOS and Windows 7 and above , Honan says , " so it is a matter of just simply turning it on " . <p> Encryption protects your computer while it is switched off or asleep , but also ensure you have good anti-virus software installed to protect your machine from being compromised when it is switched on , and a firewall . <p> " Most modern operating systems have a firewall built in , so just make sure it is turned on , " Honan advises . <p> He also says you should ensure all software is up-to-date , which includes general software and browser updates . <p> If you are working with a lot of sensitive information , a good practice would be to spend time once a week making sure everything is updated and all your security measures are active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a WiFi network in a cafe or hotel , be aware that your security could be compromised .

" <p> But that advice comes with a word of warning . " Do be aware that certain VPN providers will surrender your logs and your activity to law enforcement or government agencies . " <p> Honan also recommends free open source software Tor , which allows you to browse the internet anonymously . <p> By using Tor your personal IP address is hidden from both the site you are browsing and anyone monitoring your online movements . <p> Honan has one final piece of advice , which is relevant to journalists who are dealing with sensitive information and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an issue , " he says , as a number of jurisdictions have the right to search your laptop without having to issue a search warrant . <p> Solutions <p> " Encryption is one way to protect your laptop , " says Honan , " but you can be then asked to decrypt it at the border and if you refuse , you may be denied entry into the country . " <p> He therefore suggests either keeping the sensitive information on an encrypted external hard disc , or storing it in the cloud . <p> " When you cross borders , you may just cross with a laptop with just the operating system on it and the applications you need , and then once you are in the jurisdiction , using Tor or your VPN , you can connect to your cloud provider and download the information .

@@97847611 @2047611/ <p> Smartphones and social media have turned the world of photojournalism and foreign correspondence on its head " time and time again images emerge from a story long before any trained reporters can get to the scene . <p> And this situation has been delivering the kind of shocking footage newsrooms dream of , footage which would otherwise be unattainable . Images from the Charlie Hebdo shootings , the murder of Lee Rigby , the Russian meteor strike , and countless images from Syria and Ukraine spring to mind " but it has also thrown the whole newsgathering process into a spin . <p> How can news organisations verify the images they are receiving ? How should they credit the contributor ? What about payment and responsibility ? Could asking for eyewitness media encourage the public to enter dangerous situations ? <p> Organisations like the EyeWitness Media Hub and Reveal have been investigating the field from an academic standpoint , researching case studies and debating best practice , but a new platform aims to take practical steps towards a new system . <p> " Verifeye Media is automating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyewitness media , " John D McHugh , founder of the company told Journalism.co.uk , " and we 're doing it in real time . " <p> That is the intention , at least . As an experienced , award-winning photographer who spent a good chunk of the last 10 years embedded with troops in Afghanistan , McHugh is fully aware of the dangers involved in sourcing and using newsworthy footage . But also of its value . <p> Recent research by EMHub puts the use of eyewitness media at an average of 30 items per day at each of the news organisations studied , " but eyewitness media on its own is a pain in the arse , " says McHugh , " because you spend more time and money trying to verify it than anything else . " <p> As such , he has been signing up select members of his own network to test out the Verifeye app . Building a body of users who submit images from around the world to a central editorial hub is the first step , from which they are licensed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay contributors within seven days . <p> Testing the Verifeye app in the Journalism.co.uk offices , with the ' auto-upload ' feature highlighted on the left . Image : Journalism.co.uk <p> Only footage captured through the app can be uploaded and , once the app goes public , only registered users will be able to upload images , complete with tags and keywords to make them easily findable by news editors . <p> That may seem to deny the serendipity of eyewitness media , the people at the scene uploading footage to their social networks , but McHugh intends to keep an eye out around big stories in the early months and encourage people on Twitter or Instagram to download his app and get paid for their work . <p> Verification and trust , tenets at the core of journalism itself , are the currencies Verifeye wants to trade in beyond the cold , hard cash . <p> " If the content can be proved to be real , it has a value , " he said , " and it does n't matter if it was a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their head out the window . It really does n't matter . " <p> Sometimes when you 're in the field you lose perspective . I 've been through itJohn D McHugh , Verifeye Media <p> Users will get vetted as thoroughly as the media itself , though . <p> Not only do the images come with the usual date , time and location metadata encrypted into the file , but Verifeye include a compass bearing and altitude reading , " so we can tell where you were , when you were there , which direction you were facing and whether you 're on ground floor or the tenth story of the building " . <p> When the app 's auto-upload feature is switched on , Verifeye editors can watch all the information appear on a map within seconds , reducing the time from submission to publication . <p> " All publishers have to do is sign in , go through and say ' I need something from the bomb attack in Kabul this morning ' and they see 20 pieces . They can stick what they want in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use them . " <p> Without a subscription model users are free to search and browse media , a policy McHugh is aware may be open to abuse . But ultimately he thinks it will be more cost-effective for users to license the best images directly , rather than search elsewhere . <p> That was certainly the case at Mashable , which became the first Verifeye client last week as Irish citizens voted to legalise gay marriage . <p> Screengrabs from the video have already been lifted by many other news organisations without licence or credit , despite still publishing a " Verifeye Media " watermark in the corner , but from an editor 's perspective , Roug said the process checked all the boxes for ease of use while supporting the contributor . <p> " It was very obvious that it was designed by someone with the concerns of freelancers in mind , " Roug , who herself has a background as a war reporter , told Journalism.co.uk , " and these are some of the things that we wrestle with all the time . " <p> Freelancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile environment training are all elements of support that can be lost as more and more freelancers are used , but at a greater disconnect from the news outlet itself . <p> " We have to use freelancers but we want to make sure the ethics are all there , " she said . <p> Because not all footage will be as heart-warming as the first to be licensed . <p> As a veteran of some of the worst the industry has to offer , including taking a bullet for his profession in Afghanistan , McHugh feels a duty to his contributors that may not be as strong at other eyewitness media startups solely in it for the money . <p> We are making clients pay at point of purchase so we can pay freelancers quicklyJohn D McHugh , Verifeye Media <p> Verifeye is the app and company he wished he had when he first went freelance , giving professionals another string to their bow that submits footage for publication in near real-time , and a quick avenue for eyewitnesses to get paid . <p> " But what I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any old time , " he said , " because that would be dangerous and we could get somebody killed . " <p> As an example , he highlighted the work of a friend currently embedded with Peshmerga troops in Iraq . <p> " Let 's say he sends through some content , I come to the newswire and I look at it and I go ' holy shit , he 's in a gun fight with IS ' . I go through it , put our graphic content cover on it and then I put it on the newswire . <p> " What I also do is say this is ' really full-on stuff , really dangerous ' and I 'll put an amber light on his account . And if some more stuff comes in tomorrow and it 's really good , but it 's really hairy I 'll put another amber light on .

So I 'll ring him up and say ' we 're really worried about you , you 've been there for ages , your stuff is great but it 's really full-on ' . <p> " And if we 're getting someone who is getting amber lights on a regular basis then we will shut down their account and say ' listen , you 're a nutter ' . We do n't want to get anyone killed . " <p> The Verifeye app in action , set to video mode . Image : Verifeye Media <p> Many outlets have issued statements declaring that they wo n't take footage from freelancers in Syria but that promise only goes as far as the quality of the content , says McHugh . If it 's good , it will run , but that also carries with it a degree of responsibility over the identity of the contributor , not just their actions . <p> Attaching a name or a social profile to footage from a dangerous area could have serious repercussions for the contributor , especially if they are a local eyewitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the news organisation . <p> Verifeye will take commissions from news outlets , however , if they know they have a contributor in a certain area but with all the appropriate support in place " because as soon as I ask someone to do something then we 're responsible for them , " said McHugh . <p> Beyond safety , his concern is for building a market . Verifeye is a " 21st century visual news agency " aiming for the middle ground between the longstanding likes of Reuters or Getty , with their trained correspondents , and the new social newswires like Storyful or NewZulu , which actively seek out eyewitness media from around the web . <p> It will not be easy . The system and app are still both in beta , but McHugh hopes the growing network of contributors and clients is enough proof of concept to take the app public for both citizen journalists and professionals alike . <p> " Even if you have your big cameras on you and you want to shoot some amazing stuff for World Press Photo , fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight away so at least we can report the breaking news event and get it out there . " <p> There may be many people " setting up UGC marketplaces because they see some money to be had but they do n't know anything about journalism " . McHugh has spent a lot of time thinking through how he can make life easier for both news outlets and freelancers , and believes he may have found the answer . <p> " Freelancers have been complaining for years about being paid late , saying that it puts their lives at risk when they have to make cuts to their security plan because they are short of money they are owed . <p> " We are making clients pay at point of purchase so we can pay freelancers quickly , and this could very genuinely save lives . " <p> Roug agreed . " This allows me to buy a video where I know the shooter has training and has all the safety mechanisms in place and the ethical component of this is the key feature , " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond other newswires because it has that ethical component .

The online readership is very social , with articles spread via social media , Patel told last month 's conference . <p> The lean forward approach of the website gives Economist readers additional features that are not included in the lean back edition , including blogs , multimedia and debates .

@@97847615 @2047615/ <h> How to use Spundge to collect , curate and publish digital content <p> A new platform called Spundge , which was unveiled at the Online News Association conference on Friday ( 21 September ) , has been built in a bid to help improve the efficiency of journalists ' digital workflows and their ability to keep track of their beat and stories online . <p> The platform aims to help journalists " gather , curate and publish a lot faster " , journalist in residence at Spundge Craig Silverman told Journalism.co.uk . <p> In a blog post explaining the thinking behind the platform , Silverman explains the concept is to offer a " terminal for journalists " . <p> " It 's a Bloomberg terminal for journalists . It 's an end to workflow madness and the start of something more efficient , more collaborative , and built for what journalists actually do . " <p> It offers a range of services , from bookmarking , content collection and curation , web searching and filtering , to publishing and syndication , which together are designed to " help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staying on top of the topics and people and companies and other items they need to track " . <p> It 's a Bloomberg terminal for journalists . It 's an end to workflow madness and the start of something more efficient , more collaborative , and built for what journalists actually doCraig Silverman <p> The platform also enables collaboration on content collection , annotation and curation , with built in elements to ensure accurate attribution when referring to content from across the web . <p> The filtering and collection of content in what it calls ' notebooks ' is a free service , while the ability to write stories in the platform and syndicate them to digital platforms is part of a pro service which costs $9 a month per person . <p> " For a lot of journalists we have a few different ways of gathering information for stories , one might be interviewing people , working sources we have , but a lot of the times we 're actually seeing what other people have reported or what 's on social media and really bringing that together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spundge is really great for doing that last part there , of finding stuff from other news sources , from social , pulling it together and then enabling you to really quickly turn that into content . " <p> Here is more information on the specific ways journalists can use the platform , as outlined by Silverman : <p> Adding content to a ' notebook ' <p> Journalists can add content they find on the web which is of interest , such as a news article , to a notebook by using its Chrome extension . There is also a " bookmarklet for people who use Firefox or Safari or another browser " , Silverman adds . <p> Rather than having to look on Twitter and then also having to look maybe at Facebook and then maybe also having to look in your RSS feeds , you can do it all in one placeCraig Silverman <p> Content can also be added within the Spundge interface , and notebooks can be directly accessed via the browser extension , for example . <p> " A notebook is the place where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a person , a place , a thing , any kind of topic you need to be watching , " Silverman explains . <p> Notebooks house streams of content based on filters such as keyword searches and information source selections , and also provide a place to store certain saved results . <p> " Rather than having to look on Twitter and then also having to look maybe at Facebook and then maybe also having to look in your RSS feeds , you can do it all in one place , " Silverman adds . <p> Within Spundge , users can add keywords as filters for notebooks , to tell the system " these are all the words that indicate something might be related to the topic of this notebook " . <p> These keywords are then applied across different information sources " or " fire hoses " " as Spundge calls them . These include Facebook , YouTube , Flickr , Instagram and Twitter . <p> There is also a Spundge fire hose which includes more than 25,000 RSS feeds " from news sites and influential blogs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at integrating other sources such as social news wire Storyful , which would mean the wire 's customers who use Spundge could search its content within the platform . <p> Similarly , as part of its testing , Spundge was able to use the Guardian 's open API to build its content into a ' fire hose ' , as well as Digital First Media in the US . <p> " So we actually took all of the RSS feeds from all of their properties , turned them into a fire hose so they can very easily see what 's already been reported . " <p> There are also further ways to filter results , such as by creating notebooks tracking keywords within specific , imported RSS feeds or " selected Twitter lists " . <p> Results can also be returned by " social engagement filters " , such as only showing tweets from accounts with a certain number of followers , or based on the number of retweets a tweet gets . Users can also filter by date , location and language . <p> The system also learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content is being marked by the user . <p> " There 's machine learning that happens and the stream just gets more and more relevant . " <p> Silverman said " one big thing about Spundge is it is collaborative as well " , with newsrooms able to have multiple team members working on notebooks , for example . <p> " So the layer of discovery and curation actually has another layer on top which is collaboration . <p> " So you can work with people to actually curate a notebook , stay on top of an item , maybe someone comes on shift and they need to know what 's already happening , they can open up a notebook and see what their colleagues have been saving and annotating . " <p> Embedding streams <p> Taking the process a step further , users can then take the act of saving items into a notebook and turn that into a stream " , he said . <p> The system will therefore take the saved items within a notebook and , based on the number you request , provide an embed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of collected content elsewhere . <p> " So again if it 's a breaking news event and you want to be showing the latest stuff that your team is finding , you can do that just by throwing an embed code up somewhere . <p> " It 's also a great way internally to share the things that people are working on and to see who 's saving what . " <p> Creating new content <p> For those with a pro account there is also the ability to write stories in Spundge , with close reference to saved notebook content . <p> " This gets rid of the problem where journalists have like 20 browser tabs open when they 're trying to work on a story or a blog post , " Silverman says . <p> Given Silverman 's background as editor of the Regret the Error blog , another important element is automatic attribution which occurs when content is copied from saved content into a new story . He says this will act as a flag to journalists to help them remember the sources of the referenced material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Instead of writing in one place , keeping your research in another , and then doing your social promotion in a third you can do all of that in one placeCraig Silverman <p> Once a story has been created it can then be published direct to a WordPress site , or sent as a draft . At the same time an update can be sent to Twitter and Facebook accounts . <p> Pro account users can also add a Google Analytics tracking code to articles to monitor where they have been embedded . <p> As Silverman sums up : " Instead of writing in one place , keeping your research in another , and then doing your social promotion in a third you can do all of that in one place .

@@97847617 @2047617/ <p> Publisher of long-form , investigative e-books Long Play started with just G500 spending money less than one year ago , but with large ambitions to disrupt Finnish media and encourage innovation . And now , almost nine months later , it is on the path to profit . <p> Long Play produces e-singles - on an average of one a month over the course of the year - each one a piece of long-form investigative storytelling with a G3.90 price tag . It was launched in January this year , by a small team of journalists with the goal to " publish high-quality content , digital-only , and make it work " , editor-in-chief Johanna Vehkoo told Journalism.co.uk . <p> " We wanted to change things and we wanted to create an atmosphere where people would think it 's possible to do something positive about it and to innovate , " she said . " It needed to be digital-only , it needed to be long-form , and it needed to have an emphasis on investigative journalism . " <p> And so the idea for Long Play was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 characters , but can be higher . Readers can either purchase Long Play 's editions individually , or join as a member to receive each month 's e-book via email , as a PDF . The membership , which costs G54 , also includes access to events , and Vehkoo said more " perks " were on their way soon . <p> The business model <p> The outlet has taken a lean approach to its development , Vehkoo said , largely as a necessity given a lack of funds at the start . It had initially hoped to pursue a non-profit status , but " we did n't get any grants " , Vehkoo told Journalism.co.uk , and so instead turned to " direct reader funding " as its business model . <p> In order to keep costs down early on , the team of eight journalists chose to produce the first batch of stories themselves , instead of enlisting the help of outside writers who " we could n't guarantee that we could pay " , she explained . <p> " We decided we 'll work for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some designers who really liked the idea so they wanted to help us pro bono . " <p> Now , almost nine months on and with the next e-book to be published this week , the team and their contributors are being paid , and the start-up is " very safe till the end of the year " , Vehkoo said . <p> Our own platform should enable us to expand our reader base and it also gives us a bigger proportion of the revenueJohanna Vehkoo , Long Play <p> " We 're past break-even and on the way to being profitable , " she added . And with some funding now under its belt thanks to two grants , it is also preparing to launch its own publishing platform and online store by the end of the new year . Until now , Long Play 's e-books have been published using third-party platforms such as the Apple iBook Store and several " Finnish e-book stores " . <p> " Our own platform should enable us to expand our reader base and it also gives us a bigger proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inspired by outlets such as the Atavist and Byliner in the US . Vehkoo also referred to long-form digital publisher Matter - recently purchased by Medium - although this launched after work on Long Play had begun , she said . <p> " We just found the idea of selling singles really interesting and something we could do without much funding because it only requires us to do what we do best , our journalistic work , " Vehkoo said . <p> " The model does n't require that we sell ads or anything like that . So it 's all just based on really high-quality content , so that we can focus on doing the hard , background research work , really giving time to write the story and to edit it . " <p> Starting with e-books was also a way to avoid the costs related to producing a print product , she added . <p> " The e-book model was very cheap , free actually , to start , because these stores need something to sell and we need somebody to distribute , so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those platforms do take a cut , adding to the appeal of building their own platform for selling . On Long Play 's own platform , readers who purchase an e-single will still be able to download it as an e-book in EPUB or PDF format , if they choose to , but they will also be able to access the content on the publisher 's website itself . <p> One of the editions was also turned into an audio book for the same price as a standard e-book . This " was an experiment with one of our distributors " , Vehkoo said , but added that they hope to do this again . <p> A smaller part of Long Play 's revenues come from journalism courses run by the team , which cover areas such as " writing a better story , editing , fact-checking , online security " . <p> The content <p> Stories have so far ranged from an investigation into academia and politics , and mining in Finland , to brain surgery and conspiracy theorists . The story relating to academia and politics was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold the most copies so far , of around 4,000 , " a very good result even outside of Finland " , Vehkoo said . <p> We 're not going to do Snow Fall-ing but we want to do multimedia when it 's suitable for the storyJohanna Vehkoo , Long Play <p> " And obviously in Finland , where the market is just tiny , selling 4,000 copies is really quite massive . " The conspiracy theories investigation came second , with sales of around 2,000 . <p> The stories are text-focused , with illustrations on the cover only . Vehkoo said they are not currently in the position to add multimedia content , due to " the requirements from different devices and different shops " . <p> An example of Long Play 's cover art ( this was the edition also turned into an audio book ) <p> But this is " something we aim to do later on " , she added , when their own platform comes into play . <p> " We 're not going to do Snow Fall-ing but we want to do multimedia when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform we want to enable that , but in a way that does n't disturb the concentration in the story . <p> " There will be some of it when we launch , but it will develop in time , " she added . <p> Currently the content is in Finnish , but the plan is to offer translations of those stories which " are not so Finland-specific " . The team is also looking at opportunities to partner with non-Finnish publishers and publish each other 's work , as it already has with Denmark-based publisher Zetland . As for who is reading the content , Long Play 's use of third-party platforms to sell its e-books means the information it has is limited , Vehkoo told Journalism.co.uk . <p> And so again , this supports the cause for Long Play to have its own platform to publish and sell from . 7756 @qwx867756 7755 @qwx867755 7757 @qwx867757

Here are five recommendations on how to protect the authorship of the content you create and make sure your work is always copyrighted . <p> Watermark your images <p> The first port of call in protecting your work as a content creator , says Andrew Wiard , experienced professional photographer and board member of the British Press Photographers ' Association , is to put a watermark on all images which are uploaded to the web . <p> Although it is possible to remove watermarks from an image , this process will make it much more difficult for rogue publishers to infringe on copyright . <p> Programme your own metadata <p> We have to reach the point where it is illegal to publish our pictures without our names and the consequences of stripping the metadata from our files carries very heavy penaltiesAndrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an image in the form of an Exif file , says Paul Ellis , founder of the Stop43 campaign and experienced professional photographer , in the form of date and time stamps and possibly a GPS location . <p> But almost all professional standard digital cameras can be programmed to put a line of your own metadata into the Exif . That information ought to be your name , your copyright symbol and your contact phone number , says Ellis . <p> " Programme that into your camera because that will ensure that every image you shoot from it will have that contact information in it at first , " he said . Join a registry <p> " The point about registering yourself , and later your photographs , is that it makes them easier to be licensed , " said Ellis , " so it 's actually a convenience for users who want to be able to license your work or who already have licences and want to be able to check the licence status .

" It may be through a third-party registry or through an agency or through my own website , but whatever the procedure it will be possible to find my work in this way . <p> " If it matches with a picture on whichever registry links with the Copyright Hub , you will then see the author , the phone number of the author and so on .

" If we do not have the right to be credited as the author there is ultimately no way to protect ourselves from our work being orphaned . <p> " That also includes the right to have our name in metadata and it requires legislation against the stripping of metadata .

" 2 .

" <p> Steve Herrmann said a knowledge of data journalism is something his team at BBC News online looks for when recruiting . <p> " An appreciation of the importance of data and facts and figures has always been critical in journalism , " he said , but news sites are now looking for " ways of using data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obvious one to many , but it 's crucial to understand the tone you should take when talking to sources on different platforms . <p> " There 's nothing worse than that kind of awkward moment when people start demanding ' send me your pictures if you are at X ' rather than having a conversation around it , " Alison Gow told us . <p> Mark Little , founder and chief executive of social news agency Storyful , feels journalists need to get used to jumping into conversations and speaking in " a tone of voice that is not self-important , that is not self-regarding " . <p> " People do n't care about what your title is , whether you are a correspondent or you are home affairs editor , " he said , adding that sometimes more established journalists can struggle to find the right tone when speaking to sources on public platforms . <p> " I think they have to learn how to be a little bit more human without exposing themselves to the risk of undermining the reputation of their news organisation or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going live <p> Live reporting became ever more popular in 2012 .

" It 's really important that people are telling the story live as it happens , " she said . 5 . Journalists are ' managers ' of information <p> " Journalists are no longer people who hold scarce information and serve it up to a passive audience ; they are essentially managers of this overabundance of information , " Mark Little told Journalism.co.uk . <p> According to Alison Gow , a reporter 's role is now one of " helping people tell the story " . <p> Journalists can curate the news by verifying and adding tweets or videos from eyewitnesses to news stories , or by using curation tools such as Storify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we asked Aron Pilhofer what we can expect from the New York Times in 2013 , he said his team would be focusing on deeper community engagement . <p> On Twitter the New York Times has carried out deep engagement by using hashtags such as #asknyt , inviting followers to flag up particular statements for fact checking . <p> Another example of the breadth rather than the depth of engagement is how the title approaches Google+ Hangouts . In August social media editor Alexis Mainland told us that her team was organising fewer Hangouts but with a greater impact . For one Hangout Mainland and colleagues spoke to nearly 100 people to find and select five really strong contributors . <p> 7 . Inaccuracies will be exposed <p> There are countless examples from 2012 of journalists and verification experts acting , in Mark Little 's words , as " bullshit detectors " , flagging up hoax or fake images and videos shared on social media . <p> There has also been a rise in news outlets harnessing the crowd as fact checkers , whether around statistics or political coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Regret the Error encouraging transparency , journalists must be aware that inaccuracies will be exposed and should know how to handle corrections online and on social media .

Local media <p> We need to know what is going on with the people we elect , the corporations that are existing within our societyAdam Cantwell-Corn , The Bristol Cable <p> The state of local media is of major concern to the founders of the Bristol Cable , as " certain qualities " are " drastically lacking " in terms of ownership and content , said Cantwell-Corn . <p> Last November , Local World chief executive David Montgomery wrote a controversial memo to Local World staff , including The Bristol Post , explaining his new plan for the publisher . At the core of the message was the proposal that journalists will use their skills in the " harvesting of content " from third parties " local councils , police , hospitals , businesses " and allowing the external organisations to upload articles themselves . <p> To the founders of the Bristol Cable , this is unacceptable . <p> " We need to know what is going on with the people we elect , the corporations that are existing within our society " , said Cantwell-Corn , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum seekers and campaigning for civil liberties . <p> " We really feel that the Bristol Cable can address those problems by being independent , democratically-organised and having a real , in-built vision of being accountable to the readership and communities that we are there to serve . " <p> " What you 're looking at there is reporters becoming much more detached from their communities , " said Alon Aviram , another co-founder , " and people recycling press releases in offices . " <p> Mike Norton , editor of The Bristol Post , refutes these claims entirely , citing 112 per cent year-on-year growth in traffic to his organisation 's website as evidence that the audience are " voting with their feet " . <p> " I think they 're very misinformed , " Norton told Journalism.co.uk of the comments from Aviram and Cantwell-Corn . " I do n't recognise the newsroom that they 're describing . I 've just taken on two more reporters and we 're investing hugely in the content and the product and our audience is growing . " <p> Norton accepts that local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press releases to the website , which now receives more than 1.2 million unique browsers a month , but that would by no means be replacing original reporting by trained Post journalists . <p> " We have many more people reporting on the events around the city than a publication like the Bristol Cable could ever hope to have , " he said . " Our audience would tell us if we were failing them but that 's not what we 've been seeing . " <p> For Aviram , the Bristol Cable is about looking at stories " from a grass-roots angle " and involving the audience directly , " so the people who are actually experiencing the issue and who are in that current affair are the ones producing the journalism , " he said . <p> The founders have already received -1,500 in funding from the UK Federation of Co-Operatives , which has been committed to establishing the forthcoming workshops , and are crowdfunding to " give a bit of liquidity after that " , until Cantwell-Corn hopes a co-operative model of community shares will fund the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nominal amount every year or every six months and become enfranchised with full democratic rights within the co operative , " he said . " They contribute to the running of the co-operative and give it some sort of financial support which will be based on one person , one share . " <p> " Mutual-benefit advertising " with other co-operatives , social enterprises , charities and NGOs will also play a part in funding the project , he said , but the community share scheme is where they are pinning their hopes , in " democratising media in the city " , a positive circle which Aviram hopes will sustain the co-op into the future . <p> " If people consider the Bristol Cable to be a public asset and they recognise that this is a local media source that they value then obviously the community share scheme is going to be much more viable , " he said . " And in order to get to that we need to raise the funds to have several print editions to generate that confidence . " <p> Co-operative editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol 's University of the West of England ( UWE ) , is helping to draft an editorial charter that the founders hope will be as open and democratic as the funding model . <p> We 're trying to bring people in to build the skills so they can create citizen journalism of a high standardAdam Cantwell-Corn , The Bristol Cable <p> In itself , Aviram and Cantwell-Corn recognise that a democratic editorial process could cause more problems than it is worth , but by rotating the editorship between members on a monthly basis they hope balance can be achieved , giving a voice to members of the community who may not otherwise be heard . <p> " Instead of the odd blog here or the odd tweet there , we want to bring people in to be real citizen journalists where they 're actually conducting long term investigations and they 're gaining skills , " Cantwell-Corn said . <p> Reporters will be divided by postcode or area of expertise to provide up-to-date information on local communities while also contextualising larger stories and multimedia . <p> Aviram , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli-Palestinian media collective 972 Magazine , among others , hopes to feature maps and " interactive infographics " alongside traditional storytelling , using data that is readily available in the public sphere . <p> This may be about " income disparity or economic inequality " , he said as an example , which the site will use to " build up a picture of the city in terms of that " . <p> " So we 'll map , in a very visualised , colour-coded , interactive way , the spread of betting shops , or pawnbrokers , or cash-for-gold exchanges . And in this way really hit a lot of pertinent issues and do it in a way which is engaging and accessible to a lot of people and serves as a communal resource too .
