The force feedback , car physics simulator , game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky . According to the in-game credit screen , Hard Drivin ' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland . Hard Drivin ' was released in 1989 , when arcade driving games were implemented with scaled 2D sprites and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games . Pole Position and OutRun are classic examples of driving games using scaled 2D sprites . The PC games Stunt Driver and Stunts were released after Hard Drivin ' and shared many elements with it .

During the replay , the player could not change the action on screen , but the replay could be aborted to immediately get back to active gameplay .

Besides collisions , a non-survivable landing after going airborne ( even if the car landed right-side up ) , or even going too far off-road , could cause a crash which would be replayed like any other crash , with the car even exploding into the same orange fireball . The game tracks the player 's progress around the track by invisible waypoints ( denoted by flags on the course map showing the player 's progress when the game ends due to time running out ) , and after a crash , the car is placed back on the track at the last waypoint passed ; this sometimes is a significant distance back from the point of collision .

@@25298562 @5298562/ <p> Gauntlet is a fantasy-themed hack and slash 1985 arcade game by Atari Games . It is noted as being one of the first multi-player dungeon crawl arcade games . The players , up to four at once in the arcade version , select among four playable fantasy-based characters : Thor the Warrior , Merlin the Wizard , Thyra the Valkyrie , or Questor the Elf . Each character has his or her own unique strength and weaknesses . For example , the Warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat , the Wizard has the most powerful magic , the Valkyrie has the best armour and the Elf is the fastest in movement . Upon selecting a playable character , the gameplay is set within a series of top-down , third-person perspective mazes where the object is to find and touch the designated exit in every level . An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase player 's character 's health , unlock doors , gain more points and magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen. 2 The enemies are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons , lobbers , sorcerers and thieves . Each enters the level through specific generators , which can be destroyed . While there are no bosses in the game , the most dangerous enemy is " Death " , who can not only drain a character 's health , but is difficult to destroy . As the game progresses , higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit , with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently . While contact with enemies reduces the player 's health , health also slowly drains on its own , thus creating a time limit . When a character 's health reaches zero , that character dies . The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit ( i.e. inserting a coin ) within a certain short time window after it died . This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely , if they are willing to keep inserting coins . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , the game is also noted for the narrator 's voice , which was produced by a Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip . The narrator frequently makes statements repeating the game 's rules , including : " Shots do not hurt other players " yet " , " Remember , do n't shoot food ! " , " Elf " shot the food ! " , and " Warrior needs food " badly ! " Occasionally , the narrator will comment on the battle by saying , " I 've not seen such bravery ! " or " Let 's see you get out of here ! " A memorable statement of the game occurred when a player 's " life force " points fell below 200 : " Your life force is running out " , " Elf needs food " or " Valkyrie ... is about to die ! " To accommodate up to four players , the control panel is wider than other standard uprights. citation needed Each player has a joystick and two buttons , one for " Fire " ( ranged attack ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts the game . After Gauntlet 's release , other games started using this design , so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run . There were some skilled players who could play a hypothetically unlimited amount of time on one credit , especially with the Warrior and Wizard , and thus causing the arcades to lose money . A ROM update was released , reducing the " extra shot power " and " extra shot speed " powerup bonus for Warrior and Wizard , and adding a new points-based difficulty counter to the game . The difficulty counter made the game more difficult , in 16,384-point steps , which removed more designated food from the levels , and made the monsters respawn faster . However , this means that on the default game difficulty of 4 , it was almost impossible to pass levels 1 " 7 without dying , and level 4 was designed so that some of the food drops would block the monsters from swarming the player . This was because the game removed some of the " default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least one food placement was removed from every single level ( at low scores ) , and on difficulty 4 , two or three food drops were removed . This made the game too difficult , even for the best players , unless they could find a machine set to difficulty 0 . Instead , the game gave bonus food for three or four players playing together . ( Three players gave all of the default food , while four gave extra food in random locations . ) This was later refined for Gauntlet 2 , so that Valkyrie and Elf would not receive extra food removal penalties , and only Warrior and Wizard would receive the extra penalties . Valkyrie and Elf would receive all of the default food that the current difficulty setting plus points difficulty scaling would allow , although Valkyrie would receive the fewest food penalties at higher ( non-point based ) difficulty levels . Elf would get some food removed at difficulty levels 6 and 7 . The game still gave extra food for three or four players playing together .
