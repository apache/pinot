Based on an analysis of the Department of Educations database of 25,000 students , UCLA Graduate School of Education &amp; Information Studies Professor James S. Catterall found that sustained involvement in the arts correlates with success in other subjects and developing positive attitudes about communityboth generally and also for children in poverty . The correlation is particularly strong between music and success in math . <p> Intensive involvement in a single discipline should probably be thought to be even more important developmentally than high levels of more diverse involvement in the arts . A Columbia University study focuses on youngsters who exhibit very high levels of involvement within a single arts discipline over the secondary school years .

Students preparing for what former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described as Americas " economy of ideas , " need an education that develops imaginative , flexible and tough-minded thinking . Researchers at the National Center for Gifted and Talented at the University of Connecticut found that students involved in the arts were motivated to learn not just for test results or other performance outcomes , but also for the learning experience itself . <p> WASHINGTON , DC ( November 12 , 2007 ) At an event with actor and musician " Little " Steven Van Zandt and MENC : The National Association for Music Education , Harris Interactive today released an independent poll which shows a positive association of music with lifelong educational attainment and higher income .

The sad irony is that No Child Left Behind is intended to better prepare our children for the real world , yet its leaving music behind despite its proven benefits , " said Dr. John Mahlmann , Executive Director of MENC : The National Association for Music Education .

" <p> Respondents of the Harris Poll cite skills they learned in music as helping them in their careers today . Seventy-two percent of adults with music education agree that it equips people to be better team players in their career and nearly six in ten agree that music education has influenced their creative problem solving skills . Many also agree music education provides a disciplined approach to problem solving , a sense of organization and prepares someone to manage the tasks of their job more successfully . <p> Other studies show the value of music programs to our future generations : <p> Students in top quality music programs scored 22 percent higher in English and 20 percent higher in math on standardized tests mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act ( University of Kansas ) . <p> In 2006 , SAT takers with coursework in music performance scored 57 points higher on the verbal portion of the test and 43 points higher on the math portion ( The College Board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Parents , educators , state legislatures and the Congress need to take these studies seriously .

A preview article in the local newspaper documenting the need for additional funds for your program is very valuable .

It was a great way to start each performance , and the publicity was wonderful . <p> Ask a good cross-section of parents to help . You can not organize and hold a fund-raiser on your own .

Success like this will , of course , breed success . Students will use their best endeavors to take lessons from the star teacher . Parents will push their gifted offspring her way . Managers will look to her to be training the next prodigy . <p> But there must be a lot more to it than that . Exceptional young musicians are often delicate seeds ; they need teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents are , in Miss DeLays case , have until now been a mystery . Now 83 , she has never sought publicity , nor has she published memoirs or a description of her methods . For more than a decade , though , she was closely observed by Barbara Lourie Sand , whose resulting book , Teaching Genius : Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician ( Amadeus Press ) , at last opens the door to Miss DeLays studio . Miss DeLay , it turns out , has no secrets . What she does have is a sound grasp of some basic rules that can be applied to any kind of training . <p> Teach the student , not the subject . The approach has to be tuned not just to the students accomplishments but also to their personalities . In some cases , Miss DeLaymystifying most of her pupilshas seen a trait worth developing in someone even though that person is not going to become a professional musician . The person is paramount . <p> Expect a lot . What you teachinformation and principles but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practicewill have to last a lifetime . Miss DeLay explains how , at the start of her teaching career , she imagined a circle of exacting listeners sitting in on her classes : Toscanini , Heifetz and others . What would they want to hear ? How would they respond ? From this exercise came the rigorous program she gives her pupils to take them through their five hours of daily practice . <p> Be positive . Fear is a strong incentive , but only for as long as the teacher is part of the pupils life . Encouragement lasts forever . ( Isaac Stern suggests that Miss DeLays characteristic endearments " Sugarplum , " " Sweetie " covered the problem of not being able to remember so many names when she was seeing dozens of students each week . But the cuddlinesspartly a front , of course helps pupils feel that their teacher is on their side . ) <p> Ask questions . This is where negativity comes in , but subtly .

A lot of Miss DeLays success may be owed to the scarf she always wears around her shoulders . <p> Break down problems . Students learn little from being toldin however positive a waythat they have done something wrong . And they learn nothing from being told or shown the " right " way . The teacher has to analyze , has to detect just what is going amiss and why . <p> Let progress show . Miss DeLay , like all other music teachers , marks her students copies of their pieces to indicate details that need attention . She then thoroughly erases those markings as the problems get solved . Perfection is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sand reports the nice story of a boy who said he could not possibly manage the speed Miss DeLay asked for at a certain point in a piece . So she put the metronome away and just asked him to play the passage over and over , a little bit faster each time ; lo and behold , he was attaining the impossible . <p> Remember what can not be taughtbut not so as to relax your efforts . However much they are given good examples , encouraged and taught to question , some students will go farther than others . Innate talent is an issue here but so is innate determination . There are parts of students minds that can not be reached , though they may be released . <p> Be a team player . Miss DeLay works with colleagues who take care of part of the instruction process , and she recognizes the importance of parents , especially where young children are concerned . Nothing will be achieved unless at least one parent is backing the teacher and promoting good attitudes toward work at home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is beyond the teachers competence to care .

To keep music education strong in your community , join the SupportMusic Coalition today ! <p> Music Making Grants ( formally Program Grants ) <p> How to apply for a Music Making Grant , formally known as a Program Grant ? <p> For the past several years , the NAMM Foundation has received hundreds of requests for grants and is grateful for nonprofit organizations around the world who seek support to provide opportunities for people of all ages to learn and make music . The hundreds of requests received every year far surpass the Foundations budgetary resources for grants . <p> The NAMM Foundation reviews and awards Music Making Grant applications by invitation only ; the application process is not open for general application for funding from the Foundation . Guidelines are provided for general information . <p> There has to be another way I can get the Foundation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Foundation has a back-log of organizations that it may consider for funding ; however , for this next year , it will only fund programs that have either received grants every year organizations that are considered " legacy grants " or first year grants awarded last year that will likely receive an " exit " grant this coming year . Grants are only awarded , however , to organizations that meet stated project goals and demonstrate outcomes , regardless of their legacy or renewable status per submission of required interim and final reports . We discourage you from contacting Foundation staff to lobby to be considered for an invitation to apply . As stated , the hundreds of applications from previous years together with a network of NAMM members who work closely with national and community organizations help identify potential candidates for support . <p> Is the NAMM Foundation likely to fully fund a project or just partially fund a project ? In other words , in the grant proposal would NAMM Foundation look more favorably upon a grant request that has us bearing part of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project ? <p> A program that is receiving support from another entity is a positive indicator that it has already earned endorsement and support from other funders . The opportunity to contribute to partial support of a quality project allows NAMM Foundation to spread its grant making funds to more organizations ; an opportunity to partially fund a program or project is encouraged . <p> Is there a financial limit that NAMM Foundation would provide to support a program ? <p> There is not a set limit ; projects are evaluated relative to the organizations ability to meet an outlined need . During the past 3-4 years , the average program grant range has been $5,000 - $40,000 . Grant award amounts also depend on the overall number of quality proposals received by the NAMM Foundation , and the availability of grant funds available per year , as determined by the NAMM Foundation Board of Directors . If invited to apply , we encourage you to request NAMM Foundation support for a reasonably low percentage of total project costs ; total project costs should be shared with other funders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAMM Foundation grant awards given each year ? <p> The number of grants awarded is relative to the number of quality proposals received and availability of grant funds . <p> The NAMM Foundation does not offer renewable nor multi-year grants ; all current grantees must reapply annually for continuing support . Currently funded programs will be considered only if all requirements of the grant have been met . Funding will be awarded for one-year projects ; narrative and financial reports will be due from funded programs on December 31 and July 31 . If a new grant is awarded , first grant payment is made only upon completion of required reports . <p> Does the NAMM Foundation ever give grants for the purpose of buying instruments ? <p> Yes , this can be considered as a part of a program grant proposal ; however , this should represent a relatively small percentage of the program budget , as should other equipment requests . <p> What is the scale or scope ( local , regional , national ) of a program that you think might receive a grant ? <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and project seeks to address . The grant review process will assess the programs ability to meet stated goals as outlined in the proposal . <p> How many years of support and how many dollars are associated with a successful proposal submission ? <p> A quality non-profit service agency and/or program generally develops successfully with carefully managed and strategically planned supporting and earned income . It is important to provide information about the success of the submitting organization and its ability to meet service needs and to attract other support and , if applicable , earned income/fees for services . Evidence of careful management and planning for sustainability can be achieved over just a few years or decades , depending on the history of the organization . The financial size of the organization matters less than its ability to plan and manage for quality service and sustainability . <p> Does the NAMM Foundation support capital or building/renovation projects ? <p> NAMM Foundation does not contribute to capital projects that include building or renovation , but rather offers program support , as outlined in the grant guidelines . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award notification is made in the month of May in the year following application for programs which run on an annual cycle . <p> Do you have reporting requirements other than occasional audits ? <p> NAMM Foundation Program Grants : An interim narrative and budget report is due December 31 ; a final narrative and budget report is due July 31 of the following year . Report templates are distributed to grant recipient organizations at least 30 days before they are submitted via the online application system . <p> What do you look for in the plan for sustainability of a program grant ? <p> Statements or a submission of a strategic plan that outlines realistic growth for the organization based on sound current organization management ( including control of annual financial management ) ; organizations with cumulated deficits will not be funded . Submission of audited financial statements strongly encouraged . <p> We have heard it said that there seems to be an abundance of guitar and drum-based recreational music programs but a shortage of keyboard-based recreational programs .

The ratio of earned to supporting income is also considered relative to the earned income opportunity within the service target . Good business and financial planning are the key to sustainability that includes consideration for both earned and supporting income . <p> Does the NAMM Foundation offer technical support to organizations who have not been awarded ? <p> The Foundation does not offer private consultation during the application process nor after grants have been awarded .

Music education in our schools offers students the opportunity to build skills that are a means to creative expression and last a lifetime , helps boost their academic achievement , and prepares them for the challenges of the 21st century workplace . Music education supports students healthy social development and enhances the quality of their lives . <p> The United States Department of Education designates arts education as part of the core curriculum in our public schools . In these essays , students express why its important to them that music remains a vital element of the core curriculum . <p> The ability to work together as a team is more important than ever before . To successfully meet lifes challenges , tomorrows leaders must be alert and attentive , be able to adapt to change with flexibility , and communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Neville et al , states : " Early childhood training in instrumental music improves visual focus , active listening and students abilities to stay on task ; continued music education throughout adolescence reinforces and strengthens attentiveness . " <p> Research validates these powerful statements from students who submitted essays : <p> " School systems must include music programs to give opportunities for students to learn skills , attitudes , and habits applicable to life . These skill sets can not be copied from a book , recited , or assessed by means of a standardized test . Instead , one experiences them in a creative and expressive environment . If students are to fully embrace the rich and diverse cultures of the world ; if they are to live up to their full cognitive potential ; if they are to prepare for living and working in a technologically driven world ; and if they are to live a life alive and wide-awake to the possibilities yet to come , this promise of the fine arts within education must be realized .

My schools band is a socially diverse group that envelops all kinds of stereotypes . Despite these divisions , these students identify with one another because they can say " we are the band " and make gorgeous music . During a time in students lives when they are so socially divided , unity through music is a very healthy experience . Most importantly , when students walk into a music class , they can leave all their struggles at the door . Music classes are safe environments where students can pour their entire beings into beautiful expressions of raw emotion . Teenagers find refuge from surrounding pressure and swirling emotions when they make music together . " ( Emily , 16 , Washington ) <p> " In bands and orchestras , performers have specific roles if one part is missing , then the ensemble is incomplete . Such an environment allows students to mature , gain responsibility , and acquire patience . Not only must they be patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master technique , they must also acquire the skill of working harmoniously with the rest of the group . The maturity and responsibility that the students acquire serve as foundations for future aspirations where exemplary teamwork , unity , and dependability are important assets . ( Amy , 17 , California ) <p> " The saying " practice makes perfect " is proven when learning to play an instrument . When a student practices , progress can be seen almost daily . A group of musicians playing together can make beautiful music . When the members of a band work together , each person depends on other members to be successful . This is an important lesson in life . It sometimes takes many people working together to accomplish a goal . ( Caroline , 12 , Virginia ) <p> In 2010 , a 12-year analysis of test scores by The College Board showed that students with four years of high school arts and music classes have higher SAT scores than students with one-half year or less .

In their essays , a keen awareness of the role music education plays in the bigger picture of their total academic achievement is evident : <p> " Band tends to work like a normal classroom as well , especially with the progression of skills . Much like math , where the student advances from simple multiplication to algebra to trigonometry , a band student must progress on their instrument starting with the fundamentals of music . They must then refine their sound , with the practice of scales and rhythms , to become more proficient with their instrument , much like homework . A band student must put this practice into context , similar to application of principles in math , by reading music and creating a beautiful sound with others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Having one eye on the music , another on the teacher , and playing at the same time requires a great deal of focus from a student , and our minds slowly start to use the same amount of attentiveness in all other classes as well .

They are needed for a student to reach their maximum potential . ( Insia , 13 , Illinois ) <p> " We need music education in our schools because music classes contribute to the development of creativity . Music education also allows students to think better ; studies have shown that music education increases students IQs and improves test grades . It also lowers recidivism rates , increases self-esteem , and helps develop better problem solving and communication skills .

Every elementary music educator will tell you that their elementary music curriculum consists of so much more , including achieving all of the National Association for Music Educations ( NAfME ) nine national standards ; meeting individual state educational standards ; creating a musical atmosphere where students experience success ; and teaching numerous basic musical concepts . An elementary music educator intricately plans goals and outcomes for each lesson every day in order to produce a successful and musical learning experience for students .

When I assign my students to compose or create musical pieces and then record them onto a classroom compilation CD , my students adore taking the CD home and asking their parents to listen to their songs . Many times I will hear from parents about these CDs because their child was so proud of his/her piece and asked to listen to it at least ten times in a row . here 's an example of a grade 2 project that results in a CD : <p> Use Finale Notepad or Noteflight and create a four-measure composition with one note.Group the students and have them work together to change the notes to the notes you chose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes to a C pentatonic scale.Once they have composed their song , ask them to title their compositions and type their names onto the score.Export their composition as a . mid ( MIDI ) file and open it up in GarageBand or Mixcraft for PC.In GarageBand , assign the students a style to create an accompaniment for the melody they wrote . I guide them to use a drum , guitar and bass as the accompaniment.Once they have listened to it and like it , save the song , share it to iTunes , create a playlist in iTunes , and share all of the groups songs to this playlist.Once this is complete , burn the compilation onto a CD and burn a copy for each student . Although this takes time , it is well worth it because when the parents receive the CD , they have a portion of your curriculum in their hands . <h> Communication : <p> In my blog , I wrote a post about New Years resolutions where I resolved to communicate more with my parents .

McKeesport was once one of the largest towns in western Pennsylvania and was known for the steel mills that lined the river banks . That all changed in the 1980s when the steel mills moved out and so did many of the workers living in McKeesport . However , one of the things that remained strong was the McKeesport Area School District and their music programs . <p> The Community Forum was a chance to highlight some of the good things happening in McKeesport including four student performances that included the Seventh and Eighth Grade Band , the High School Marching Band , the High School Womens Ensemble and the High School Orchestra . Getting students performing not only in their school but also out in the community is a key component to the success of the McKeesport programs . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " noted Beth Eger , Music Coordinator/Choral Director in the McKeesport Area School District . And those performances come in a variety of ways . From the marching band performing in community events as well as competing state wide to elementary general music classes actively performing in their own classrooms each day , music educators in McKeesport understand the value of any opportunity for students to perform . <p> A key component to the success at McKeesport is the support of school administrators . Superintendent Rula Skezas is about as supportive of an administrator as you can find . From her time as a principal in the district to her current role as superintendent , Skezas has supported and encouraged participation in the music program including participation by her own children in the McKeesport music program . Skezas understands the bigger picture of participating in music education . " The intrinsic value of music for each individual is widely recognized in many cultures that make up American life . Indeed every human culture uses music to carry forward ideas and ideals , " remarked Skezas during her opening remarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the forum and discussed the situation McKeesport and all Pennsylvania school districts find themselves facing no state budget which means no funds from the state to operate schools .

To gather statistics from past years , check listings from concert programs and yearbooks to keep track of the flow of students through music programs .

@@45588972 @5588972/ <h> MAC Corner : How To Use Advocacy Stats To Your Best Advantage 57559 @qwx467559 <p> There is not a better time to be providing this article . With the passage of ESSA ( Every Student Succeeds Act ) , the reauthorization of the ESEA ( Elementary and Secondary Education Act ) in December of 2015 , every music educator in the country should be heading the call to pull together the appropriate resources to position music programs to be center-stage for providing ALL children with a well-rounded education . <p> The new law provides numerous references to the specific ways in which music and arts education are exactly the types of programs that are necessary for students to amass the kinds of experiences that will lead them to a well-rounded educational experience . <p> One such example is the term , " well-rounded education , " pervasive throughout ESSA , which provides for a more expansive curriculum , including music . This new language is quite different from that of No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) where academic success was measured solely through student performance in math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central to a well-rounded education and music is articulated as one of these subjects . This thus makes it clear that music should be a part of the education of ALL children . Schools should thus be able to access Title I funds to tackle parts of the music program which may be lacking so that students may indeed realize quality experiences within the realm of the well-rounded subjects . To view more in-depth information about ESSA and read about additional provisions which may impact music and arts programs in your community , please refer to the documents available on the NAfME website or simply search for Everything ESSA . <p> What must be understood , however , is that because federal education initiatives are no longer in place ( i.e. NCLB ) , it will now fall to each individual state to align their current education plan with ESSA . Most states are currently in the process of organizing/working with advisory groups to develop and recommend strategies to be considered for implementation in the 2017-18 school year when ESSA will go into full effect . ( Federal funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 school year . ) Although we may not become involved at this level , it is important to know who is serving in this capacity in our states so that we can be assured that music education is at the table in these discussions . <p> So , what does this really mean for us as music educators ? The first order of business should be to perform a needs assessment . What needs to be addressed in order to provide ALL students with a quality , well-rounded education that includes music in your school ? It is fortunate that NAfME has recently updated the Opportunity to Learn ( OTL ) Standards . These OTL Standards were prepared by the Council of Music Program Leaders and identify the resources needing to be in place so that teachers , schools , and districts can give students a meaningful chance to achieve at the levels spelled out in our Core Music Standards . Organized into four categoriesCurriculum and Scheduling ; Staffing ; Materials and Equipment ; and Facilitiesthe OTL Standards assist us in reaching the overarching goal of music literacy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating , performing , and responding . <p> Many administrators still need to be convinced that large , high-quality music and arts programs are the tide that raises all ships when it comes to student achievement so since ESSA articulates that each state will now be accountable for providing a well-rounded education for ALL students , music educators should begin preparing data which provides decision-makers with the knowledge necessary to make decisions that will benefit students through music and arts programs . One of the most beneficial ways to help inform administrators would be to show how our programs contribute to the overall positive school climate in our schools . The NAMM Foundation has compiled a Facts and Quotes document that provides a comprehensive cache of data that provides exactly this type of information . It is available to download at : LONG ... <p> Although it is important to provide this type of overview data , school leaders always appreciate knowing how the results of research translate to their own district and/or individual school . It is thus also vital to provide building-level administrators with data on the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how music and the arts have contributed to a positive school climate within their own building . This could be accomplished by providing the following data on a year-by-year comparison spreadsheet . <p> class counts showing the growth of the program <p> number of performances provided over the course of the specific year <p> number of citizens impacted by above performances <p> number of parents involved in the program <p> number of students involved in student music organizations/ leadership programs <p> number of students who auditioned for honor ensembles ( local and/or state ) <p> number of students who participated in recitals or solo and ensemble festivals <p> number of students who participated in large ensemble festivals ( and ratings , if relevant ) <p> number of students who received college scholarships as a result of their high school music experiences <p> number of students who graduated as valedictorians , salutatorians <p> number of students who received college scholarships ( both music and otherwise ) percentage distribution of GPAs of music students <p> percentage of students who graduated on time <p> attendance rate of music students <p> discipline report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would also be impactful to provide corresponding data on the number of students who are not participating in the music program perhaps there could be a consolidated effort with the other arts educators in your building to determine the same sort of data from their programs so that a collective arts education document could be made available . In this way , it could be more easily determined how many students are NOT being served by arts education . The next logical question is , how can we expand our music and arts offerings to involve even MORE students . This is important because ESSA is about serving ALL students through a well-rounded education and not just a few . This is also the hard part . How can we reach out to involve more students in music and arts education to help achieve the mission of providing a well-rounded education for ALL . <p> Visiting with school counselors would be a great start . Ask them to tell you more about the students who are n't  involved . Who are they and what are their needs ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlay this reality into program expansion ? I have always wondered what it would be like to teach an iPod class where students were required to bring their favorite styles/selections ( with guarded parameters , of course ) to class and explain , in agreed-upon jargon , what it is about the material chosen that makes it especially meaningful and enjoyable . Students could then discuss among themselves the reasons that they agree or disagree with the given musical example . I would provide all students with an easy , fill-in-the-blank listening guide so that at the end of a semester , they would have a collection of these that reflect the music that todays young people listen to and enjoy . Each student could be asked to provide two selections per semester you would determine how they should differ from one another . Perhaps one would be a selection by a group and the other more of a solo performance . Perhaps it could be contrasting styles . Whatever the choice , this is definitely a music course that would be more appealing to many of our students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YET ! This is also a way to reach out to students in the building who you might never meet otherwise . <p> Whatever the area , it is important to honor all musical styleseven if its not your very favorite . Below are some non-traditional courses ( i.e. not band , choir or orchestra ) being offered in some of our more innovative school districts . <p> Mariachi <p> Hip-hop <p> Gospel Choir <p> Guitar ( Classical or Pop/Rock ) <p> Steelpan Ensemble <p> Taiko Drumming <p> Salsa <p> Bluegrass <p> Ukulele <p> The value of data collection can not be overestimated . Principals , superintendents , school board members and certainly parents , students and even the music and arts faculty itself would benefit from a genuine measure of how music and arts programs are impacting the students and the school overall . With the onset of ESSA , the stage is set for all of us to perform a needs assessment rooted in meaningful data so that we may move forward to provide the type of quality , well-rounded education that each individual state will eventually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We as a community are extremely proud of the rich tradition the Avon Public Schools has with respect to celebrating the arts and are humbled for receiving such recognition .

Many entries are by postmark deadline and you cant always be sure the envelope or package is postmarked the day it is mailed . <p> Always be on the lookout for new music . Visit local music stores ; attend conferences , conventions and concerts in your search for new music . Mark up programs and keep them in a separate file so that you are always ready to order should funds suddenly become available ( this occurs frequently toward the end of the year when fiscal budgets have to be expended ) . <p> Select music for the students that they will learn from and enjoy .

Studies at the University of Toronto show that infants : <h> Infants <p> Are intensely interested in musicThis interest enables babies to perceive nuances and changes in pitch and rhythm of songs in foreign languages that even their parents do n't notice . <p> Have precocious listening skillsIn many ways infants perceive music just as adults do . They can recognize the same song in a different pitch and tell the difference in songs containing missing or dissonant notes . Like adults , babies remember and prefer pleasant rather than unpleasant music . <p> Have an excellent memory for musicAfter 1-2 weeks of exposure , infants remember a song they have heard and can distinguish it from unfamiliar melodies . They prefer new music to the familiar though , because they are curious and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical environmentInfants are surrounded by music , even in the musical or sing-song way parents speak to infants . Studies show that infants prefer this style of speech and are more attentive when parents communicate in this way . Parents also sing more to young children and have a special repertoire of songs they use to entertainment or comfort them , namely lullabies and play songs . These kinds of songs have similar features across very different world cultures . These melodies are more emotional , higher-pitched , have a slower tempo and are more intimate . Infants prefer maternal singing to maternal speech and find it more calming . <p> Benefit of Maternal SingingInfants who are sung to are more content , sleep better and have an overall better sense of well-being . <p> Maternal singing is mesmerizing to infants and tends to catch their attention better than spoken language . <p> Mothers are usually a child 's first musical mentor and their singing enhances the bond between mother and infant.It also eases the burdens of care giving by producing a more content baby and a more relaxed mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs through their favorite TV shows , such as The Wiggles . They can identify these tunes easily and relate them to these programs . Toddlers enjoy singing on their own , while they play , and even deaf children will sing independently without prompting . <p> Deaf toddlers with cochlear implants also love music , despite the tones being suboptimal . They also sing along ( though often off-key ) and get a lot of pleasure from music . While they do n't often recognize melodies , deaf toddlers do recognize rhythms . <p> While there are skill differences between infants when it comes to musical perception and abilities , some children receive more exposure to music and may simply be more musical due to that fact . However , interest in the kind of music can definitely affect desire . Structured music may not appeal to some children if it 's not customized to their interests or tastes . As a result they lose interest . <p> Conclusion : Music is innate , universal and part of the human experience from a very early age . 57560 @qwx467560 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for the first time , I did n't know that I was actually opening a door to other things ... <p> - Student , Age 13 57556 @qwx467556 <p> Young children who take music lessons show different brain development and improved memory over the course of a year , compared to children who do not receive musical training . <p> National Association for Music Education .

@@45589008 @5589008/ 57559 @qwx467559 <p> When the late Lyell Clay learned that his state , West Virginia , was ranked 47th in the nation for music and arts education , he decided to do something about it . In 1996 , he contacted Mike Bates , Institutional Solutions Group , Keyboard Division , Yamaha Corporation of America , and enlisted his help to turn things around . Clay wanted to purchase equipment for West Virginia state colleges and universities to enhance their music education programs ; The Clay Foundation contributed $125,000 to initiate the program . <p> For four years , technology , training and equipment , and instruments were infused into teacher training programs . The program then moved into the K-12 sector in a few major communities , providing technology and training for teachers over three summers . <p> In 2008 , VH1 Save The Music Foundation came onboard and , shortly thereafter , officials from the State of West Virginia , including Governor Earl Ray Tomblin and First Lady Joanne Jaeger Tomblin , the State Legislature , the Division of Culture and History , and the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NAMM member retailers and other corporations and individuals with a vested interest in the future of their local communities became key supporters in the ensuing years . <p> Today , this tenacious group of concerned citizens is poised to attain their goal of rebuilding programs in all 55 districts and 55 counties in West Virginia . <p> This story was first reported in CounterPoint in January 2011 and an update was provided on the May 22 , 2012 SupportMusic Coalition teleconference . It is a noteworthy example of how the actions and efforts of many concerned citizens working together can have a lasting effect on music education programs in public schools . Conversations about this replicable model are occurring now in other states : If West Virginia can do it , why cant we ? is an emerging theme . <h> It Takes More Than Just a Village <p> This plan relies upon each school district to create its own long-term partnerships and planning to ensure all students will have access to a quality music education program . Once the initial goal of program rebuilding in all 55 districts/55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuild of programs in all K-8 schools that qualify for VH1 Save The Music Foundation grants is the next step . <p> " The key to success with a large scale project like this is to have the involvement of someone at the State level who has access to legislators and the Governor . That support from the Commissioner of the Division of Culture and History and the First Lady has really made it take off , really made it sing . Its been amazing to watch , " says Rob Davidson , Director of Programs and Policy , VH1 Save The Music Foundation . " West Virginia is doing it for themselves , and were here , as a national organization , to encourage and help them along . Theyve taken up the mantle , and were here to support them . " <p> Randall Reid-Smith , Commissioner of the Division of Culture and History for the State of WV , helped to attract corporate and community support for matching funds to put instruments into the hands of students , and is heartened by the steady progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most important goals : to encourage our young people to explore their creativity through the arts . We reached out to business , nonprofit organizations and individuals around the state and asked them to help us . They responded with enthusiasm and are supporting us every step of the way . " <p> First Lady Joanne Jaeger Tomblin , another extremely active ally , has been visiting schools and lending her voice . " I have personally witnessed the students playing their new instruments and I cant express to you how wonderful it is to see their faces . Music and the arts are so important , and they do make a difference in peoples lives . As we reach more schools , " Tomblin adds , " I believe were going to see West Virginia test scores improve . Music and arts education is so much more than learning notes and marching bands . It is about the growth and development of our students . " <h> Students Tune Into the Benefits <p> Justin Altizer , Music Specialist at Guyan Valley Middle School , wears the hats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was hired in 2005 , there were only 12 students in the middle school band program ; each year , enrollments have increased and Altizer projects about 150 students for 2012-13 . " We started the program from scratch , and it made a big jump with the VH1 Save The Music support . My principal gave a lot of flexibility for scheduling , which helped a great deal , and our school board has raised the band budget allowance . Band enrollments have increased every year . Kids lives are changed . " <p> Before the program , Altizer says , students played on instruments that badly needed restoration . " Older instruments are OK if there 's money to fix them . Now , when my students play on the newer horns and woodwind instruments , they realize they play pretty well . Their sound is much clearer and cleaner , and they are more excited to play . " <p> About 50 middle school graduates are already registered for band at the high school this year . Last spring , Altizer took 75 of his students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was inspiring for all of them , just as he intended . There were high school bands from all over , and his students witnessed both small and large bands performing . " Some of the bigger bands werent necessarily the best at marching , but they were more exciting and got more attention , " says Altizer . " Our students saw the possibilities for our county , and saw no reason not to have a 200-piece band at our high school . " <p> Barbara Green teaches music at Harman School , one of two original pilot program schools . Band program enrollment has now grown from only 10 students to 50 in her rural K-12 school of 200 students . <p> " When I was hired , there were barely any instruments to use and I struggled to get a music program going , " Green recalls . " The board even threatened to cut my position to half time . When the VH1 Save The Music Foundation sent the letter to the school board saying that if my position were not full time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reinstated my full time position and we were able to have a real music program . I 'm still teaching in a trailer , but now I have the whole trailer . It was wonderful to get these instruments , as well as a couple more grants for secondary instruments ( a bass clarinet , a French horn , and a tenor sax ) . " <h> A Legacy and Lessons Learned <p> For those who seek to replicate the model , starting with the teacher training programs in colleges and universities , Bates has some words of advice . " Find out in advance which schools offer the best music education programs and which ones have a high percentage of graduates who stay in-state after their training is completed . Its best to focus your funding and resources on those schools , for the greater good of the public school music programs . Its also important , " he continues , " to build in accountability and program feedback , right from the start .

Music education , which is such an important part of a strong , well-rounded education , needs the support of the music products industry to provide all necessary equipment .

Although online orders give small businesses a larger presence , it can also take business away from local companies .

" - " All high school students ( 1500 ) will be required to take a minimum of one study hall per day . " <p> They proposed putting 250 students in a large study hall each period with non-certified personnel to supervise . This is a perfect example of leadership making adult-centered decisions that are not focused on student needs for learning . <h> Impact on Students in the Music Program <p> OK , now I want you to think back to what you 've learned about Full Time Equivalency ( FTE ) . <p> The ( 1.0 FTE ) full-time high school choral director had 600 students in the program , an average of 100 students per period . By contrast , regular classroom teachers had average ( daily ) student loads of 125 . <p> If you recall , music teachers offer a higher FTE value than other classroom teachers because their class sizes are usually much larger . In this case , the high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTE classroom teachers . More than that , eliminating the four vocal groups would have prevented 354 students from participating in the choral program . And even after the proposed cuts , with 246 students still in the choral program , the high school choral teacher would still have had an FTE value of 2.0 FTE classroom teachers . <p> While no specifics were presented about impact on the instrumental music program , the administration did recommend that 50% of all music teachers be eliminated . This would have eliminated the entire elementary band and orchestra curriculum , and some instrumental positions at the secondary level . This meant that 276 high school instrumental students would have been prevented from participating in band and orchestra . <p> With 250 students typically in a study hall , this would be the expected breakdown : <h> The Response From The Music Coalition <p> Fortunately , this school district had a very active and involved Music Coalition . With consultant assistance , they did some research and presented a report with recommendations to the parent committee of the School Board . <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another motivation for the administrations new study hall requirement . <p> The administration perceived one music teacher as incompetent , had wanted to dismiss him for years , and the financial crisis seemed to provide the perfect opportunity to do it . However , the administration would have had to cut 50% of the music teachers in order to get deep enough into the seniority track to cut that teacher . As the Coalitions research revealed , the administration was willing to eliminate music opportunities for 630 students to get that one teacher ! ( Tenure , as is commonly believed , does n't  protect incompetent teachers from being dismissed ; it does , however , require a competent administration to document the need to dismiss a teacher . But , since few districts are using a functional curriculum , let alone consistent national standards for music education , this is often difficult or perhaps impossible . If a school does n't  have a written music curriculum that provides adequate student assessment , then there 's no way to evaluate the music faculty . ) <p> But , back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a segment from it : <p> " Since it is obvious that the administration did not philosophically support the validity of study hall as an appropriate academic function , it would appear that there are in fact only two real purposes to requiring study hall of all students : <p> To require an additional 270 students ( 45 per hour x 6 periods ) to attend study hall , equating to a total savings of ( 2.1 ) FTE for the district . <p> To eliminate the opportunity for 630 students ( 6 hours x 105 students ) to participate in the music program of the high school . " <h> The Community Demands Reinstatement of the Music Program <p> The community was so infuriated by the Music Coalitions findings that over 4,000 people joined the local music coalition and threatened to join forces to bring a lawsuit against the district . <p> The music program was completely reinstated and the recommendation to require each student to take study hall was dropped . <p> Once again , a committed Music Coalition was able to save music programs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> *Note : Or , as is common in the block schedule format ( particularly the A/B model ) , a district may restrict students to seven courses out of eight periods . With one , or even two periods , allocated to required study hall(s) , block scheduling becomes an increasingly flawed scheduling option. 57558 @qwx467558 57557 @qwx467557 57555 @qwx467555 <p> Opening my trumpet case for the first time , I did n't know that I was actually opening a door to other things ... <p> - Student , Age 13 57556 @qwx467556 57561 @qwx467561 57565 @qwx467565 57566
