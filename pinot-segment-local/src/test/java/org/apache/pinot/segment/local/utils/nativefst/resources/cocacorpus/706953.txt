@@110548607 @5948607/ <h> Intentional Interim Ministry <h> What is Intentional Interim Ministry ? <p> In the last twenty years churches have found it beneficial to have specially trained pastors who serve in an intentional manner and for specific purposes . They assist a congregation in coming to terms with its grief and past , adjust to change in leadership , look realistically at its current identity , and prepare to communicate its needs and vision to a pastor considering the call it issues . <p> There are five processes for the Intentional Interim Pastor : <p> Agreeing with the elders , council or congregation on terms of service and goals . <p> Entering a congregation in which uncertainty exists and quickly establishing relationships and stability . <p> Maintaining integrity of Word and Sacrament , attendance , stewardship , and programs . <p> Assessing special needs and focusing on at least one as a priority . <p> Appropriately sharing insights and bringing closure to the temporary ministry . <p> Assisting congregations in accomplishing these tasks are included : <p> Coming to terms with congregational history , the bad and the good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . <p> Facilitating the development of shared leadership , reinforcing the ministry of God 's people by honoring those who choose not to continue serving at the present time , and affirming the ministry of those who continue to serve or enter into new areas of responsibility/service . <p> Working with the Congregation Ministry Facilitator who assists a congregation in assessing its ministry , identifying where it and its community are currently , and identifying the congregation 's mission , communicating the mission to the called pastor , and establishing a foundation for the future which will be pursued with renewed energy and involvement . <h> What Scriptural Application is there for Interim Ministry ? <p> There is Biblical precedent for the use of Interim Ministers . There was John the Baptizer who in accordance with prophecy prepared the people for the Savior : <p> Matthew 3:1-3 records , " In those days John the Baptist came , preaching in the Desert of Judea and saying , ' Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is near . This is he who was spoken of through the prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Prepare the way for the Lord , make straight paths for him . ' " <p> John 1:6-9 says , " There came a man who was sent from God ; his name was John . He came as a witness to testify concerning that light , so that through him all men might believe . He himself was not the light ; he came only as a witness to the light . The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world . " <p> Paul requested Titus to serve temporarily in Crete with specific goals until pastors were appointed to serve the people there . In Titus 1:5 he wrote : <p> " The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town , as I directed you . " <h> What is the History of IIM ? <p> For several years the District President ( DP ) and Circuit Counselors ( CC ) discussed the need for pastors with special training to be available to meet the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Vice Presidents , District Staff , and others noted that many pastors and congregations are hurting , experiencing disruptions and conflicts . <h> What Need is there for it ? <p> Pastoral vacancies occur in 10% or more of the congregations of our nation , Synod and District each year . For a congregation the interim period becomes a time for : Disengagement from the former pastor . Answering questions regarding meeting current needs . Developing closer identification with Circuit Counselors and the District as the congregation goes through the call process and prepares for receiving and making commitment to the new called pastor . An interim usually is a time of confusion , grieving and maintenance . Can it be more ? Is it possible to be a time of renewal ? Of course , the answer is , " Yes . " <p> In the last twenty years churches have found it beneficial to have specially trained pastors who serve in an intentional manner and for specific purposes . They assist a congregation in coming to terms with its grief and past , adjust to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepare to communicate its needs and vision to a pastor considering the call it issues . <p> Traditionally the time between resident pastors has been filled by available area pastors who in addition to their regular work see that the work of the congregation is maintained , possibly assisted by a supply pastor , and with increased responsibility on the part of lay leadership . There will always be a need for this and may be what a congregation will choose for an interim period . <p> However , we now have the option of a trained Intentional Interim Pastor ( IIP ) available to congregations of the District . This program has first been carried out by the California-Nevada-Hawaii and the Pacific South West Districts with acclaimed results . The Michigan District followed their lead and more recently we have assisted in its development in the Indiana , South Wisconsin and other districts . Another form of it is available in the Minnesota South , Nebraska , Northern Illinois , Oklahoma , Texas and other districts . Almost two thirds of Synod 's Districts have adopted or endorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches and districts full time IIPs are used . In the Michigan District we currently have a few full time men and the rest are selected retired pastors , CRM , and others who may be available . Such avoids problems of support and health insurance between interims . Because of providing part-time service we have a larger number of trained Intentional Interim Pastors available . This is necessary because of the size of the Michigan District , the number of vacant congregations , and the needs of those congregations . We have trained intentional interim pastors who would be available for about half of our vacant congregations . <h> What is involved in becoming a district trained and certified Intentional Interim Pastor ? <p> Circuit Counselors can help by suggesting names of pastors for consideration or by sharing this information with pastors and asking those interested or who desire more information to contact Rev.
