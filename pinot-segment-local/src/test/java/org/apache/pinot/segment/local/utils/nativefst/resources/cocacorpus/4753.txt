" Intimidation of this marketplace and its potential , and fear that if you try to capitalize on this marketplace the approach may not work . " <p> A new research initiative at Univision , drawing directly on what Hispanics say about their day-to-day living and experiences as consumers , is out to eliminate both issues and is proving to overcome the historic difficulty in surveying Hispanic consumers .

John Dick , the companys Chief Executive Officer , calls this partnership with Univision the most revolutionary to date . " Its an ongoing gateway into Hispanic consumers , where advertisers can find vital , accurate information they need to support the campaigns they direct at this audience . " <p> Each survey prepared by Univision and CivicScience consists of several questions , grouped either within a story on Univisions Web site or mobile app , or as a sidebar to the story . The first questions are story-related , followed by others on topics from product purchases to favorite entertainment hot-spots . Each survey appears for an extended period of time , so that as many people as possible can respond . CivicScience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of categories demographic , geography and psychographic . <p> The polling process started last October after six months of development and testing .

As more media places open up , the scope of the questions will also expand . At some point , Univision could use polling as snapshot reactions to new programming initiatives , such as the recent launch of weeknight primetime talent contest Pequenos Gigantes USA/Little Giants USA , or Vino el Amor/Then Came Love , the new nightly telenovela that experiments with scenes and plotlines in English ( accompanied by Spanish subtitles ) and controversial subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we have a way where , in 24 hours , we get answers to questions on how Hispanics think , " Ruiz declares .

@@12165468 @765468/ <h> Five Big Questions ahead of Copa America Centenario . <p> Every day throughout the Copa America Centenario tournament , football writer Simon Evans will be bringing his analysis and opinion on the game here at Outside the Box ' . British-born , Miami-based Simon has covered every World Cup since 1998 and has worked across Europe and North America covering football for a number of international media outlets . He was the co-author of the Rough Guide to European Football ' and his work has appeared in the Washington Post , the Guardian , Reuters and many other publications . <p> Is this the start of a new Pan-American tournament ? This is the first time the United States has hosted the Copa America tournament , which traditionally has involved teams from South America . This 16 teams from the entire continent , including North America , Central America and the Caribbean . Officially this is a one-off tournament to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the world 's oldest continental football competition the Copa ends on June 26 and that 's it . But make no mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Pan-American championship will be on the agenda . If there is one thing we know about football administrators they tend not to turn their back on sources of revenue . So while we will have our eyes on the action on the field , the CONCACAF and CONMEBOL officials and their various commercial partners will be looking very closely at the numbers ticket sales and sponsorship deals but above all the television ratings . <p> A tournament involving teams from South , Central and North America as well as the Caribbean has the potential to be a real global event . Adding the U.S. and Mexican markets to the traditional South American audience , brings obvious commercial benefits . Many would argue it makes football sense too a 16 tournament has a natural flow and the top CONCACAF teams can now compete with South American nations in a way that simply was n't the case in the past . Are we really expected to wait another hundred years for the next edition ? <p> How far is CONCACAF 's best away from the South American elite ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive performances of CONCACAF 's teams . Three of the four teams from the region which competed in Brazil made it to the last 16 , with Costa Rica producing the biggest surprise by reaching the quarter-finals . None of the three faced South American teams in the knockout stage however , all going out to European opposition . But Costa Rice beat Uruguay in the group stage while Mexico held hosts Brazil to a goalless draw in their group clash , indicating the gap has closed significantly . We will get some early indications of whether that really is the case when the U.S take on Colombia in the opening game on Friday , while Mexico 's open up against Uruguay on Sunday . <p> Can James Rodriguez shine again ? Talking of the World Cup two years ago , one of the biggest stars of that tournament was Colombia 's James Rodriguez who won worldwide praise for his performances , including that memorable volley on the turn against Uruguay . Such was James 's impact , as top scorer in the competition with six goals , that Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French league club Monaco . Injuries have played a part , but things have n't gone quite as well as expected at Real for the 24-year-old who sat on the bench throughout the Spanish club 's Champions League final win over Atletico on Saturday . James started just 17 league games and three Champions League matches for Real this season . The Copa is the perfect occasion for him to showcase his talent again and provide his coach Zinedine Zidane with a reminder of the quality available to him . Can he turn it on again ? <p> Is Christian Pulisic the long awaited American soccer star ? While soccer has grown enormously in the United States over the past two decades , the country has yet to produce a truly international star . Landon Donovan was perhaps the nearest , scoring goals with ease at international level but his club career was mostly restricted to MLS . Clint Dempsey scored goals in the Premier League for Fulham and before him Claudio Reyna impressed in Europe too . But there is a buzz around 17-year-old Christian Pulisic that suggests he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a tender age , the creative , attacking midfielder with a wonderful light touch is already a starter in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund . Now U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann has decided to bring him into the national team fold well ahead of schedule . It may be unfair to put such scrutiny on a player so young but his talent makes the interest inevitable the Copa is a great stage for a young talent to show his ability . The next three weeks are n't going to make or break his career but it is going to be fascinating to see how he copes at this level . <p> Can anyone beat Argentina ? For all the other compelling storylines , the Copa America Centenario is ultimately about deciding who is the best team in the Americas . Looking at the rosters , the clear favourite is Gerardo Martino 's Argentine side. - Just look at his options in attack where he can call on Sergio Aguero , Gonzalo Higuain and a chap by the name of Lionel Messi.Holding things together in the centre of the field is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Angel Di Maria providing the width . The quality at the back may not be of such a high pedigree but if La Albiceleste play up to their ability they will be tough to stop in this tournament . After losing the World Cup final to Germany in 2014 and the Copa America to Chile in last year 's final , this talented squad also has no shortage of motivation to go all the way . But Brazil , Uruguay and Colombia will believe they can frustrate Argentina . It should be a fascinating tournament .

According to research by the AARP , as children grow , they and their grandparents talk more about issues such as morality and values , how to stay safe , school , spirituality , the news and any problems they may have . Talking about these things creates a strong bond between them , because children feel the unconditional love of their grandparents and do n't feel judged . Listening to them is one of the most important things that a grandparent can do to create strong ties . <p> As a music therapist , I recommend singing with them , especially if they are young .

And the most important thing is to spend time together and tell them that they make a huge difference in the lives of their grandchildren . <p> Q5 : What kinds of daily routines help develop good relationships between grandparents and grandchildren ? <p> A5 : Some grandparents live close to their grandchildren and can see them every day .
