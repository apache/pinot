@@347663 <p> Google 's algorithms rely on more than 200 unique signals or " clues " that make it possible to surface what you might be looking for . These signals include things like the specific words that appear on websites , the freshness of content , your region and PageRank . One specific signal of the algorithms is called Penguin , which was first launched in 2012 and today has an update.After a period of development and testing , we are now rolling out an update to the Penguin algorithm in all languages . Here are the key changes you 'll see , which were also among webmasters ' top requests to us:Penguin is now real-time . Historically , the list of sites affected by Penguin was periodically refreshed at the same time . Once a webmaster considerably improved their site and its presence on the internet , many of Google 's algorithms would take that into consideration very fast , but others , like Penguin , needed to be refreshed . With this change , Penguin 's data is refreshed in real time , so changes will be visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reindex a page .

It 's also important to remember that updates like Penguin are just one of more than 200 signals we use to determine rank.As always , if you have feedback , you can reach us on our forums , Twitter and Google+.Posted by Gary Illyes , Google Search Ranking Team

@@347682 <p> Dear AdMob Publisher , We 're making an important update to the way that we define banner ad impressions . Today , AdMob counts native and interstitial impressions when at least 1 pixel of an ad appears on a device 's screen . However , AdMob counts a banner ad impression each time an ad is served to the app . We 're changing the way we count banner ads to align with interstitial and native ads.On September 27 , 2016 , we 'll start counting an impression when at least 1 pixel of an ad appears on the device screen . This update will gradually take effect over the months of September and October for all Google banner ads . However , it wo n't apply for any ads mediated from third parties via AdMob.Why are we making this change ? By making this change , the impression data you see in your AdMob account will now show you when ads are actually appearing on users ' screens . This allows you to optimize your ad implementation while maintaining a clearer definition of an impression across apps.What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any action . As this measurement change rolls out , you may notice some differences in the banner ad metrics in your account -- i.e. impressions , CPM and clicks . The CPM calculated using this new definition will be utilized in the AdMob Network Report ( as Impression RPM ' ) , as well as within mediation features ( such as Live eCPM and Ad Network Optimization ) . We look forward to continuing to work with you to monetize your app.Kind regards , The AdMob Team <p> So , does this mean an advantage for publisher or not ? anyone say me . <p> I think 1 px is lowest one which improves more impressions for publishers as far as i know but if Google implement same for Adsense then its better .

@@6280390 <p> Google 's algorithms rely on more than 200 unique signals or " clues " that make it possible to surface what you might be looking for . These signals include things like the specific words that appear on websites , the freshness of content , your region and PageRank . One specific signal of the algorithms is called Penguin , which was first launched in 2012 and today has an update.After a period of development and testing , we are now rolling out an update to the Penguin algorithm in all languages . Here are the key changes you 'll see , which were also among webmasters ' top requests to us:Penguin is now real-time . Historically , the list of sites affected by Penguin was periodically refreshed at the same time . Once a webmaster considerably improved their site and its presence on the internet , many of Google 's algorithms would take that into consideration very fast , but others , like Penguin , needed to be refreshed . With this change , Penguin 's data is refreshed in real time , so changes will be visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reindex a page . It also means we 're not going to comment on future refreshes.Penguin is now more granular . Penguin now devalues spam by adjusting ranking based on spam signals , rather than affecting ranking of the whole site . The web has significantly changed over the years , but as we said in our original post , webmasters should be free to focus on creating amazing , compelling websites . It 's also important to remember that updates like Penguin are just one of more than 200 signals we use to determine rank.As always , if you have feedback , you can reach us on our forums , Twitter and Google+.Posted by Gary Illyes , Google Search Ranking Team

@@6280558 <p> Dear AdMob Publisher , We 're making an important update to the way that we define banner ad impressions . Today , AdMob counts native and interstitial impressions when at least 1 pixel of an ad appears on a device 's screen . However , AdMob counts a banner ad impression each time an ad is served to the app . We 're changing the way we count banner ads to align with interstitial and native ads.On September 27 , 2016 , we 'll start counting an impression when at least 1 pixel of an ad appears on the device screen . This update will gradually take effect over the months of September and October for all Google banner ads . However , it wo n't apply for any ads mediated from third parties via AdMob.Why are we making this change ? By making this change , the impression data you see in your AdMob account will now show you when ads are actually appearing on users ' screens . This allows you to optimize your ad implementation while maintaining a clearer definition of an impression across apps.What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any action . As this measurement change rolls out , you may notice some differences in the banner ad metrics in your account -- i.e. impressions , CPM and clicks . The CPM calculated using this new definition will be utilized in the AdMob Network Report ( as Impression RPM ' ) , as well as within mediation features ( such as Live eCPM and Ad Network Optimization ) . We look forward to continuing to work with you to monetize your app.Kind regards , The AdMob Team <p> So , does this mean an advantage for publisher or not ? anyone say me . <p> I think 1 px is lowest one which improves more impressions for publishers as far as i know but if Google implement same for Adsense then its better .
