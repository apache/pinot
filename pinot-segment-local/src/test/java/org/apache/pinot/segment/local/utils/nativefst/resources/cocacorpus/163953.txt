I decided to write a tutorial specifically to help out newbies who are n't  exactly sure what theyve just purchased . Its amazing to know that people who are n't  designers or even own a piece of design software are buying our vector packs . I never would have expected that . This tutorial is essentially a beginners guide to our Vector Packs brought to you by your friends at Go Media , the finest website development company in Cleveland . <p> You will learn : What are vectors ? How to open the files How to select and use the specific pieces you want Adding them to your exisiting design Finishing it up <h> Introduction : What are Vectors ? <p> Before we start , let me explain what Vector means . From the Wikipedia : <p> " Vector graphics ( also called geometric modeling or object-oriented graphics ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curves , and polygons , which are all based upon mathematical equations to represent images in computer graphics . It is used in contrast to the term raster graphics , which is the representation of images as a collection of pixels , and used as the sole graphic type for actual photographic images . " <p> Basically , a vector image can be scaled infinitely to any size . It can be enlarged to put on a billboard or the side of a building . It can be used on apparel and even on the web . Raster images ( such as jpg , gif , tif , etc ) can not be enlarged without losing quality . So when buying design elements , you want the most versatile elements that can suit any application . Vector graphics are the way to go because they can customized however you like . That 's why we call them Vector Packs ! <p> What 's the purpose of the Vector Packs ? The main purpose of the vector packs is to have a library or archive of commonly used vector elements that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially helpful if you are on a tight deadline and need to quickly add some flair or artistic elements . Some people buy them and simply use ONLY elements from different packs to create artwork that they never would have imagined they could create beforehand . <h> 1 ) Opening your Vector Packs <p> When you first download our vector packs , you 'll either be downloading a big zip file ( a complete set ) or an EPS . An EPS file actually means Encapsulated Post Script . I could go into a lot of technical jargon ( which I actually do n't  know by the way ) but I 'll just say this : Its a file that can be opened in vector editing software or rasterized at any resolution in Photoshop ( not recommended for our Vector Packs because the files are too large and its not optimal ) . If you download a ZIP file , you must first unzip it . We 've had some people try to open the ZIP file in Illustrator , which I 'm afraid to say will not work . To unzip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After you unzip the file , you 'll see the EPS files . <p> So how do you open the EPS file ? What software will open it ? We use Adobe Illustrator CS3 . We recommend using any version of Illustrator newer than version 10 . If you have a really old version of Illustrator , chances are that it wont work and we suggest you upgrade . You can also open these files with Corel Draw or Macromedia Freehand . But since we are n't  actively creating our artwork in those programs , we can not guarantee perfect compatibility . We use Adobe Illustrator and that 's your BEST BET when working with vector graphics . The concept is the same throughout , but there may be differences in other software applications . <h> 2 ) Open your vector editing software ( Adobe Illustrator ) <p> If you already have an illustration or design you are working on , open that up if its not already . Ideally , these vector pack elements are made to " enhance " your already existing designs . You can certainly make your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will use an existing illustration that our designer Dave did : <p> Original Illustration : <p> Now we want to add some cool " accents " in the background . I 'm going to look into the " Ornate Pack " from Set 7 and see what I can find . I think theyll compliment this existing illustration quite well . I already have my centerpiece , I just need to " fill it out " so to speak . <h> 2 ) Select File &gt; Open <h> 3 ) Pick the EPS file you want to use ( ornate.eps ) <p> While opening the EPS file , Illustrator might warn you about text that was created in a previous version of Illustrator . In this case , just click the button that says " update . " And if you 're missing fonts , it does n't  matter in this case because any text in our vector packs can be substituted with the default font . Its ok . So while you have it open , choose the piece you think will work with your design the best : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminds me of seaweed or some underwater plant thing . The theme of the illustration happens to be a girl with octopus tentacles wrapped around her , so I think it will fit well . After you 've selected your piece by clicking on it , just press Ctrl+C to copy it . Now go back into your original design . <h> 5 ) Go back to your original design and paste the piece in <p> I liked how they were fitting in , but I thought it needs something more . I went to our trusty " Radials " pack from Set 6 which I know I can always throw behind a centerpiece illustration like this and it will funnel the attention to the center of the image . <h> 6 ) Open up another Vector Pack and grab some more elements <p> Once you have it open , have a look around and decide which piece would work best for you . Select it and edit&gt;copy or press Ctrl+C to copy it . I chose the following traditional radial because it accomplishes my goal of " funneling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used for this purpose as additional " filler " behind your design . <h> 7 ) Add some more elements and arrange them how you like . <p> I went back to my design and pasted the radials and sent it to the back . I also gave it an " overlay " blending mode . Just do your typical tweaking to suit your own needs . I also added some bubbles to complete the " underwater " theme . <h> Youre Done ! <p> That 's all that 's needed to get the Vector Packs opened and implemented into your designs . There are tons of things you can do with them , but I wanted to give beginners a head start and hopefully this can help solve some of the common problems people are having . Most of the problems are caused because the person does n't  have any design software on the computer and are confused thinking that when they buy the Vector Packs , they can just run an installer and start magically creating designs out of nowhere .

Heather , Go Medias Zine Editor <h> Hand Lettering How-To <p> I 'm here to help you- learn how to take- hand lettering- sketches from your- notebooks to the digital environment to be ready to use for a design . Below you 'll find options for the end files to work as a vector and as a color-editable tiff file . These are the two- methods that I use most regularly to integrate lettering in to my designs . If you 're looking for something completely smooth and finished as vector , all you would need to do is use the pen tool to draw on top of what you import in to illustrator . This is very time-consuming , but worth it for final logos and files that need to be brought large-scale . <h> Step 1 : <p> Scan in your lettering , and drag the image directly into photoshop . <h> Step 2 : <p> Use the- lasso- tool to select the parts of the lettering that you want to use , if done in parts . Copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photoshop document using the- lasso- tool . If you have your lettering completely as you like it form-wise in the drawing , use the- lasso- tool to select your lettering and then copy and paste it completely in to a new file . <h> Step 3 : <p> Arrange the letters how you would like them to appear in your final design . It does n't  have to be perfect , but you want it to be as close to the general shape as possible at this point . <h> Step 4 : <p> Convert the file to greyscale image &gt; mode &gt; greyscale , and merge all the layers of the design together . <h> Step 5 : <p> In the adjustments panel , select your levels . Move the black arrow to the right , and use the grey and white to adjust your image so it is as black and white as possible . When complete , merge all your layers together again . <h> Step 6 : <h> Step 7 : <p> Use your brush in black and white toggle between the two by hitting x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specs that happened to be laying outside of your lettering , and close any gaps that were not together when you were- piecing together the letters . Zoom in to fine-tune the details . I will sometimes toggle back and forth to re-draw parts of letters that are looking a little off , skinny , or thick in certain areas . Here is where you need to make it your version of perfect , as it wont be changed other than through color after this point . Once you 're done , save it as a tiff file . <h> Step 8 : <p> Open a new illustrator document , and drag your completed tiff in to the file . <h> Step 9 : <p> Now you are free to select the tiff and change its color . Let the design process begin with your custom lettering ! <h> Step 10 : <p> Alternatively , you can take the file from when you dragged it in and make it a vector .

When you 're in Photoshop and you have a document , like a web mock up , with a ton of layers it can be hard to find the specific layer you are looking for . <p> If you find yourself in this little dilemma , click on the selection tool at the top of the toolbar . Right underneath the task bar you should see the option " Auto-Select " with a dropdown for Layer or Group . Make sure this is selected and then click on the item in the layer you are looking for . If you have Layer selected , it will take you right to that layer in the Layers palette and highlight it .

If you stop and think about it for a second , it- has to work this way . <p> NOTE : Right next to the Auto-select checkbox is a checkbox for " Show Transform Controls " .

In this post well cover the basics of getting your Wacom working , some finer details of getting it to work well , and finally some tips for getting better at drawing with a Wacom . We use Intuos 2s &amp; 3s here at Ohio Website Designers , Go Media . Specifically , this tutorial was written with the Intuos 3 6+11 in mind . <h> Step 1 <p> Getting your Wacom installed Well first of all , just plug the USB cord of your Wacom Tablet into your computer . You 'll see that the pen tracks right away , but it has one major problem ; it will not reach to all corners of the screen without having to be picked up for another swipe across the tablet . This is because you have n't installed the Wacom Software yet . <p> So calm down . Yes that new toy smell is really exciting , but we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with your Wacom or head over to wacoms website to download the software &amp; drivers for your model . Once installed , you should notice some things are different . <p> First , the tablet is proportional to the screen now you can point to any spot on the screen without picking up your pen . <p> Second , unlike your mouse , your Wacam pen will point to exactly the same spot on your screen when it is pointed at the corresponding spot on the tablet . This is really cool once you get comfortable with it . <h> Step 2 <p> Adjust your Wacoms settings Fire up Photoshop or PainterX and play around <p> I know you want to ! <p> I 'm only going to to cover the use of the Wacom with Photoshop because it is all we use at Go Media . For a great video tutorial on Wacom settings in PainterX , check out Ray Frendens guest post from a while back . <p> Go ahead and create a new Photoshop Document at a pixel resolution equal to your screen resolution . Set your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press on the rocker button closest to the tip of your pen , which should be mapped to be a right click by default . Set the brush hardness all the way to 100% and size to about 20px . Press F5 to bring up the Brushes palette and make sure the " Shape Dynamics " box is checked . Make sure the rest of the settings match the screenshot . <p> Now go ahead , draw a squiggly line ! Does the brush vary in thickness in response to pressure ? Great ! It does n't  ? Do n't  worry , it happens to us all of the time . Shut down Photoshop , fire up the wacom tablet properties software just for fun , restart Photoshop . Rinse &amp; Repeat . <h> Step 3 <p> Adjusting your Wacoms settings <p> In your start menu you should see a Wacom folder , and inside , a Wacom Tablet Properties program . This utility helps you tweak the special buttons on your tablet , pen pressure , and a lot of other stuff . The most important setting here ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Tip Feel . <p> As you can see from the screenshot above , I like pen tip to have a firm feel . This means that I have to press harder to get the same line thickness than at the default settings . I find that being able to keep a constant medium to hard pressure helps me make smoother lines . The software has a handy little preview of how hard you 're pressing so use that as a benchmark to find the best setting . <h> Drawing Tips <p> Before I started using a Wacom I imagined that it would magically transform me into a good artist . Not so ! In many ways the Wacom is more difficult to control than traditional drawing tools ( its saving grace is the Undo function ) . So unfortunately even if you follow this tutorial perfectly I cant guarantee you 'll be drawing scrolls like Jeff does . Even so , here are some tips for getting better as a Wacom artist . <p> Practice ! Plain old drawing is great , but also try some Wacom training drills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lines from thin to thick . Then try it thick to thin , then thin , thick , thin . Try concentric curves , squares anything that requires you to keep line thickness and spacing consistent is good . <p> Zoom in . Your Wacoms tablet area is proportionate to your screen , not your zoom setting . For that detailed linework go ahead and zoom in to reduce shakiness. 17223 @qwx877223

After all , yall have been asking for some tips about creating your own custom stickers . Since Evan and crew pump em out perfectly on the daily , they know their stuff. - <p> Take it away , Evan ! <p> Heather , Zine editor <h> Keys to Custom Sticker Greatness <p> When creating art for custom stickers , it is best to create artwork at a minimum 300dpi . You may use photoshop or illustrator , or a free alternative like Gimp . What 's most important is that your artwork is submitted as a high resolution file and converted to CMYK . A good understanding of the limitations of cmyk printing is helpful but the most important step is to create high resolution artwork . Resolution is not usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When you create a sticker design , you can fill our standard templates with any design you want . Things get a little trickier though when you decide to purchase custom die cut stickers . We can help you create a custom cut line , but if you 'd like to do it yourself , there are a few things you should consider . <p> 1 ) Clean cuts , simpler cuts are better . They cut out smoothly and faster . A lot of overly complicated edges will not only take longer to produce , but they may cause issues with storing your stickers . Fine points and thin parts of a die cut can complicate application and storage . Thin pieces of sticker do n't  stick as well as large pieces , and thin pieces often get bent when handling your stickers . If you can keep your designs custom die cut shape simple , you 'll enjoy the results more . If you require a very complicated cut with interior cuts or thin pieces , I 'd recommend using a kiss cut on a standard shape like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looks great when applied , but has more durability against bends in storage . A kiss cut is a light cut on the surface of the sticker that let 's you peel off a section of the sticker , like on a sticker sheet . We can create very complicated kiss cuts . <p> 2 ) Your bleed should extend 1/8 ? beyond your cut line . A lot of custom cut designs have a white outline . Some people wish to have a colored background to the edge of their custom cut line . This requires bleed color to extend past your cut line . We can help you set this up , and bleed is a standard that you should be familiar with when setting up cut lines for any custom job . Bleed is part of all of our standard templates . <p> 3 ) Make sure your black values are rich . We recommend rich black cmyk values of 60/40/40/100 . Or you can use photoshops standard black settings . One thing to be cautious of though , is when selecting the black swatch in illustrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . This layering of ink helps give you black values a rich dark appearance . <p> A good sticker design is a subjective thing , but but most are bold and relatively easy to see or read from a distance .

Everyone loves stickers and more companies have been including them with orders since they are an affordable way to promote your brand .

Since no texture library is complete without rust and metal textures , I got my camera out and shot as many images I could of the banged-up monster . The textures range from subtle speckles in the paint to massive rust damage . This makes this pack highly versatile , and will help you bring either subtle touches or nuclear damage to your pieces . <p> The textures can be used as overlays , or pasted in layer masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3264 x 2448 pixels . <p> This tutorial is rather short , and takes advantage of layer masks and blending modes . Count around an hour of playtime in both Illustrator ( Ai ) and Photoshop ( Ps ) . Plug your headphones , press play on some nice music , and let 's go . <h> The starting point : preparing the Road Hog design to our liking <p> The Road Hog tee design pack includes a biker/Americana inspired design , that you could take apart and re-arrange to your liking . Or , like me , you could just leave it in one piece . here 's a shot of the design in Ai . This is the " sea foam " color palette . <p> The design also comes in a black and white color palette , an " heritage " color palette ( rust tones ) , and an " Americana " color palette . Feel free to choose the one you prefer for this tutorial . <p> The original sea foam palette is nice , but the tones are a tad too strong and saturated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I managed to find a more subdued version of the color palette . After using the magic wand ( Y ) and the Select &gt; Same &gt; Fill color menu a few times , our base art was recolored . <p> The re-coloration process is really easy since the design is simple and the vectors well constructed . Just make sure that all of your shapes are ungrouped and unlocked , and it should go smoothly . I switched the bright yellow to the faded yellow at the left of the color palette image ( #f0eec1 ) , the main blue hue to the palettes faded blue ( #b2dabf ) , and the black to the dark brown/purple ( #5c4a4e ) at the right of the palette . I created the darker blue by lowering the brightness value of the light blue , which gave me #727d71 . <p> After recoloring the artwork , I added an outline to it . There are multiple ways to do so , but here 's how I do it : <p> Make sure all of your elements are grouped together <p> Duplicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathfinders Unite function <p> Change the color of the merged shape to #f0eec1 . I chose the light color because I thought at that stage that the background of my final piece would be dark ( the design has been hidden in this shot . ) <p> Finally , turn the design back on , and use the Offset path function ( Object &gt; Path &gt; Offset path ) to create the outline . I use Offset path as opposed to a stroke , because the result looks more polished . The downside to that is that unlike a stroke , you cant easily edit the width of the outline once its been created . A few things about the values Ive used : the thickness of the offset is set at 1/8th of an inch , and the joins to round for a softer feel . <p> We 've got ourselves an outline . To make things a bit cleaner , you can run the pathfinders unite function on that outline group one more time . This will fuse the multiple shapes that compose it together , living us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red the area where the most simplification will happen . <p> Now that we 've got ourselves a recolored and outlined design , its time to move things to Photoshop . <h> Setting up the stage in Ps <p> Much like when we were playing with the Awaken design , our Ps document will be an 18 ? x24 ? @ 300 dpi canvas . This time , itll be setup in a portrait orientation . <p> I 've completed the setup of my document with guides . I might have created a few too many , but oh well . I have guides at the 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 16 , and 17 inches marks vertically , and 1 , 2 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 22 , and 23 inches marks horizontally . <h> Background preparation <p> As I 've said when we were preparing our vectors and adding an outline to them , my original intentions were to have a dark background on our piece . After progressing in my design , I realized that it would n't work very well , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be light instead of dark . For the sake of brevity , I 'll spare you that back and forth in this tutorial . So let 's skip directly to the correct layer order for a light background with a dark border . <p> On top of that layer , create a new one , filled with our dark brown this time ( #584c4e ) . <p> Were going to take advantage of the Arsenals vintage poster borders texture pack to reveal the underlying yellow layer to make it look like there 's a dark border around our design . The process is very simple , and consists of pasting one of these textures ( I used the first one in the pack ) in a layer mask . Jeff made a video with step by step instructions , and its visible here : <p> Note that if you do n't  own the poster border textures , you could paste any other grunge texture in the layer mask . This series of free vintage film plates textures from Lost and Taken would be an interesting alternate , although a tad too intense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of the texture were interested in are these dark scratch marks . In order to extract them , well need to desaturate the texture ( CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+U ) , and to change its blending mode to Screen . <p> Were already starting to see these scratches impact the design as if it was painted on metal and exposed to things scraping it off its support . To further the effect , well play with the level palette ( CTRL/CMD + L ) , in order to increase the contrast of the texture . <p> A few notes about my Levels values : the 100 on the left is the value for the dark tones . It means that I 've made the dark pixels of the texture darker than what they originally were . The 0.75 is the value for the mid-tones . That slider is normally set at 1 . Bringing it to 0.75 means that the mid-tones are also going to be darker . Finally , the 175 on the right is the value for the light pixels of the texture . Its set to 255 by default . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually going to be lighter . Darker blacks and grays + lighter whites = high contrast texture . <p> Finally , I 've leveraged a layer mask to allow the texture to show only on the design and not on the background . <p> To create such a layer mask is easy . CTRL/CMD+CLICK the thumbnail- of your design layer to create a precise selection of its content , then click the new layer mask button at the bottom of your layer palette . <p> Following a similar process , I also added **35;0;TOOLONG to the design . Its effects are much more subtle , but you can see them in the gear behind the skull/wings/bones element . <p> My levels values were a bit different : <p> Its also to be noted that the texture was not inverted , and put on the Soft light blending mode at 25% opacity . I chose to do so because the results were less aggressive than when using Screen . I 've also confined its effect to the design only by using the same layer mask- process than before . <p> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its two textures . In order to do so , I gave it its own layer mask , and pasted **35;37;TOOLONG into it . After sizing it to cover most of the design , and playing with levels to bring its contrast to new heights , this is the result : <p> The original texture <p> Playing with levels <p> The result <p> Impacted areas details <p> To increase the worn feel even further , I created a layer group containing the designs layer and my texture . I then duplicated the background dark brown layers layer mask ( CLICK &amp; DRAG + ALT/OPTION+SHIFT ) to it . The result is n't very visible , but some of the masks grain let 's the dark brown show through . <h> Global textures <p> If the textures at the previous step are important because they give their character to the design elements themselves , the ones well apply now are just as important . They participate to tie the piece together , by giving their artifacts to the various design elements and the background in a continuous manner . You can choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few . I have three in my case . <p> The first one is **35;74;TOOLONG . As you can see , its a fairly clean texture . The main elements I 'm interested to see passed on to the design are those black , dirty marks . They look like smeared paint . <p> After placing the texture in the design ( rotated 90- counter-clockwise ) , desaturating it , I 've leveraged the levels to get the dark and mid-tones much stronger . <p> Once the blending mode switched to Soft light , and the opacity lowered to 50% , the result brings some subtle darker areas in the top left of the piece . Its like some liquid slightly stained the art . <p> The next to last texture well use is **35;111;TOOLONG . Its a texture that I use as a grain texture . There are only a few speckles of rust here and there , and the rest are a few light dots . <p> After desaturating it and playing with levels , here 's what the texture looks like : <p> And below is the result on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its very subtle , but still adds a little something . <p> Finally , the last texture I 've used to add more of the same dirty stain type of finish to the poster is **35;148;TOOLONG . <p> Nothing special to add to the process used before , other than because this one was a bit intense , I 've put on Soft light @ 35% opacity only . <h> The last touches <p> We could add more textures to the piece , but it would n't add much to the design . Its better to stop there . Now , you could either leave the piece here , or add just a tiny bit more of contrast and grain . Either way is fine by me , and will equally look nice . You could also add fake folds too , but well get to that in an upcoming tutorial . <p> The first of the finishing touches is to create a layer that contains a merged copy of all the layers of our piece . There 's a keyboard shortcut for that : **27;185;TOOLONG . Simply select your top layer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new layer containing that merged copy of your piece . I renamed mine to " Comp " and placed it in its own layer group . <p> Next , make two copies of that layer . Name the bottom one Aged 2 , and turn the top one off for now . <p> Download this Aged 2 action created by the good peeps at Go Media for an old tutorial , and run it on the Aged 2 layer . Put the layer on Soft light @ 25% opacity . The action created a photocopy type of effect , with something looking like old ink and grain . Below is a close up shot before and after switching the blending mode . <p> Finally , well use the stamp effect action Jeff released a little while back . Run the action on that last copy of the Comp layer we have remaining . The action will create two layers , one with just the black pixels of the stamp effect , and another one ( usually turned off ) with some more details . Turn both of the layers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Place that last layer on Soft light @ 25% opacity and you 're done ! <p> If you want more info about the action before buying it , you can read this quick blog post written for its release . <h> Done ! <p> And the piece is done ! Using the metal dumpster texture pack , we were successfully able to age and destroy the design . You should totally mock-up your piece to impress your clients : <p> That 's it for me today . If you have any questions or suggestion about the tutorial or the textures , do n't  hesitate to use the comments , or to tweet at me. 
@@98562194 @2762194/ <h> Everything You Need to Know About Dealing with Difficult Clients <p> Whether you are a freelancer or run your own company , we have all dealt with difficult customers . It can be an arduous undertaking to deal with the- idiosyncrasies- of different clients , but it is a must for any business owner or designer to properly handle difficult customer interactions . The consequence of handling a customer incorrectly will not only cost you money but will also create the possibility of bad word-of-mouth , which can affect future sales and money in your pocket . <p> If you do n't  believe us , just check out our post about the book " Thank You Economy " . The in-depth review tells you about the importance of guiding your clients through the design process and ensuring that their needs are met from the beginning to the end . Brushing off a clients issue could lead to a nasty review on a social media site like Facebook or Twitter , which could in turn could deter future clients from contacting you for design services . <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with the experts and we do n't  believe there is any industry that deals with more difficult customers than the airline industry . Go Media recently had the opportunity to speak with a manager at a major US airline who deals daily with difficult customers and knows the dos and donts of how to handle them . There is also advice on how to correctly tackle a demanding client interaction and the best way to resolve the issue so the person walks away with a smile on their face . <p> Read below for the Q &amp; A : <p> GoMediaZine : - <p> How often do you deal with a difficult clients/customers ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> In my current position , I deal personally with probably one difficult customer/passenger per day . As a department , the Passenger Service group handles a few dozen during the course of a day , I would estimate . These are people for whom something has gone terribly wrong in the course of their travels and who are looking for some sort of resolution . They are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> GoMediaZine : - <p> What is the best way to handle a difficult client/customer in a face-to-face interaction ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> While this is certainly something that varies by industry , I would say that there are a number of effective strategies that are more or less universal . In general , the calmer you are able to remain , the more rapidly you will see your customer bring the tone of the interaction down . You can only yell at someone for so long before you realize that he or she is not yelling back and you change your behavior , if for no other reason than out of embarrassment . - In an airport environment , and in particular in a hub station with the high volume of connecting traffic and increased probability that you will experience some sort of service disruption , this is even more critical . When you get a sandwich you do n't  like or your movie freezes or your bed is not made-up to your liking , you are upset and looking for someone to remedy the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , missing family or friends or important business or a cruise , you tend to go a little insane pretty quickly . <p> Once you have established that you will not elevate your tone to match that of the irate customer , you need to do a few more things . You have to listen to the problem and try to see it through the eyes of the customer . He- or she will tell you everything you need to know . The actual incident is never at the root of the behavior . The- more you are able to convey your empathy for the situation the customer is in " I was late coming in from New- York and I missed the connecting flight to San Francisco , where my sister is getting married tomorrow morning . " - the greater the trust that will develop between you and the customer . More than anything , customers want- someone from your company to understand the unfortunate circumstances they have been left in . They want to- vent , they want to feel that you have understood and cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lastly , they want a solution . They want to see you try to find a fix for their problems , and even if the- result is not ideal , they will be brought back to a calm state by your efforts and communication . Maintain good- eye contact , let them know what you 're doing , and try to deliver a solution that addresses their concerns . It is- not always possible to do this , and companies generally employ a Customer Relations department to handle- transactions such as refunds or compensation for situations where the employee and the customer were unable- to reach an acceptable resolution at the first point of contact . <p> GoMediaZine : - <p> What is the best way to handle a difficult client/customer who has posted disparaging remarks on a social media platform about you or your company ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> It can not be overstated the extent to which the social media world has turned the world of customer service on its head . It used to be that you had to be really , really unhappy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfaction . In todays world , a passenger will post a comment about a service experience while walking down the ramp to board an airplane . The immediacy provides a second of instant release for the customer needing to vent , but this can translate into a week of headaches for the company as they scramble to figure out what went wrong and try to fix it . <p> Many larger companies now have departments that do nothing other than this exact function they monitor the internet for content posted about the company or its workers , whether it is positive or negative . My company is no different . We have a Facebook page and a Twitter feed and these are monitored constantly . Passengers post their experiences all the time , and the positive ones are passed along to the stations to share with the employees . The negative posts are generally removed pretty quickly from our sites , and if posted elsewhere efforts are made only to have falsehoods removed from other sites . It is not advisable to engage directly with the complainant in an online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making direct contact , this is a better approach . You are able to understand what is at the heart of the issue and to provide resolution , if appropriate , utilizing the same techniques described above . <p> As I mentioned , the dynamics of a hub airport environment will supply an endless train of spectacularly angry customers as the weather , air traffic , maintenance and any number of other external forces conspire to wreak a unique brand of havoc on the prospect of successful completion of ones journey . There is no place quite like the airport when it comes to disappointment and rage , and every one of the positions staffed by an airline worker provides a fresh opportunity to- send the upset customer happily on his way or to see him led away in handcuffs . I believe there are very few customers that simply can not be helped , and this is typically because alcohol has been introduced into the equation . <p> I paint the job of the airlines Customer Service Agents , Supervisors and Managers as follows : In no industry do- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emotion with so little effort . If you genuinely care- about the customers you are interacting with , you have the absolute ability to make someones day , every day . Every one of us has seen a lunatic having a nervous breakdown at the airport . - It is loud and messy and tends to- be littered with profanity . However , if we can keep this person from escalating to physical violence or making any threats , we can send him away apologizing to us for his behavior and thanking us for taking the time to help. - This seems like a fantasy , but it happens every day . You have to like this . You have to find some personal- satisfaction in seeing this happen . You cant take anything personally . People lose their minds with the way- they allow themselves to behave in an airport . The ground staff has no security whatsoever beyond their podium- and the blind faith that you do n't  want to get arrested , so you probably wont jump across the counter at them . I- talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frame it as an exciting opportunity to make someones day . I- can discuss it this way because I believe it completely . I find few things more satisfying than taking someone- who is screaming and cursing and throwing paper and making a spectacle in the middle of the terminal , settling- them down , listening to the problem , talking it through and finding a solution . 100% of the time , I get an apology- and a " thank you " , even if they are still upset . <p> GoMediaZine : - <p> When you are dealing with a particularly difficult client/customer , how do you calm your own nerves in order to better deal with the person ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> I do not take anything personally at all . I am able to absorb the bile they - spew in the course of the rant and I try to remain as level as possible . I focus all of my energy on looking at the person and listening . I do not feel nervous or tense or stressed . I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear through the insults and cursing and ignore it . If you do not feel defensive , you will not act defensively and you will have a successful interaction . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> How do you teach those techniques to employees so that they can successfully interact with these troublesome clients/customers ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> This is a complicated question . To a large extent , it is difficult to teach people not to be defensive . This is a very natural reaction , and one that is more comfortable , particularly for our younger employees . Your company has to have a genuine commitment to providing excellent service , and this has to be communicated to your employees carefully and thoughtfully . Many companies have annual training programs that review policies and rehash the same tired cliches , such as " Its not what you say , its how you say it . " I submit to you that not a single person who has written one of these generic customer service training curricula has worked in an airport . <p> There are a couple things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as service standards . Make sure that they understand the way that the company ( and , by extension , you , as their supervisor ) expect from every interaction with a customer . - Make it a part of the company dialogue , all the time . If you advertise , use these advertisements to focus on the importance of the service your employees provide . The more publicly you shout this , the more clearly your employees can see that service is a value to your company . They feel a sense of pride . Operational performance metrics are good to discuss in order to involve the employees and illustrate that each of them owns a stake in the success of the company . However , you have to tell the story all the time through examples both good and bad of what is expected of them as far as service . Otherwise , they will default to operational success because , if nothing else , that keeps them from being disciplined . <p> Personalize any training or discussion about service . This is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people that do not travel whether by choice or otherwise with any regularity . It is a job . Therefore , it can sometimes be difficult for these employees to truly empathize with the person melting down in front of them , since they just look insane . Use examples in your training , in your discussions . Any training should center around participation . You should conduct role-plays , where each person has a chance to be the customer and the agent . The employees will learn from each other , as well , if you hold group discussion sessions and review complaint letters and swap stories . Everybody , from every background , knows what it feels like to be treated well and to be treated poorly . Work some Mr. Rogers stuff on them . It works . <p> Recognize outstanding service , and do it publicly and loudly . Have programs that recognize great service . Share compliment letters from customers with the employees . Compare it to complaint letter , where a passenger was in the same situation but the employee handled it differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compliment , and there are a few very small actions that can change the whole interaction . Have one-on-one discussions with your employees as often as you can regarding service standards , but especially when they have received a complaint letter . Review the letter with a focus on the customers perception , as opposed to the details of the incident . Have the employee come up with a way that something could have been done differently to prevent the letter , even if it would not have provided complete resolution . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> What are some of your tips and tricks to not letting negative interactions with clients/customers unravel your whole day <p> Airline Manager : <p> I do n't  know . I do n't  really have any . These things have never stayed with me on a personal level . The only time a passenger interaction stays with me is when I know that the person is still in the station and I follow them throughout the day to see if they make it out on one of the next flights . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your employees ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> I tell them to step away . Go take a break for a few minutes , let your supervisor handle it for a bit . Some employees take these interactions very much to heart and they are stuck with the feeling long after the passenger has left . I have had passengers say horrible things to my employees . Even after we have sent the customers away , denying them transport on us , the emotional affects of the incident linger . There is no single strategy for making this better , but I think escaping for a few minutes is generally a good place to start . <p> GoMediaZine : - <p> What are some ways you distress after dealing with a particularly difficult client/customer ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> In many of these situations , the ways that people allow themselves to behave are fairly absurd . While I do not generally become stressed from the interaction , I find it helpful to tell the story and laugh about it once I am back in an office or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good way to blow off steam , if nothing else . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> I think most of us can agree that people in the airline industry have to deal with more difficult customers/clients than people in other industries , so how does the advice you give translate to other industries ? <p> Airline Manager : <p> I think most of it translates fairly well to other industries . Customer service is pretty standard its just the level of crazy that our customers reach that is pretty unique . 17220 @qwx877220 
@@98562195 @2762195/ <p> Hello Zine readers ! - Simon from Studio Ace of Spade here today . I just wanted to let you know that my folded paper texture packs , volume I and volume II are now available on the Arsenal ! I hope you enjoy this textures tutorial , teaching you to add fake folds to your designs in a jiffy with the folded paper texture packs ! <h> What 's in the packs ? <p> The pack is centered around folded and crumpled paper , from a simple vertical and horizontal folds all the way to crazy crumpled and over-folded paper . Check these examples below : <p> These should cover a decent chunk of your folded and crumpled paper emulation needs . <h> How to use these textures <p> Just like the photocopy noise textures I released a few weeks back , the textures are black and white , which dictates some of the workflow to follow . This awesome post about blending modes I found on PhotoBlogStop gives us this information about the Screen blending mode : <p> Screen : Similar to the Lighten blend mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and results in smoother transitions . Works somewhat like the Multiply blend mode , in that it multiplies the light pixels ( instead of the dark pixels like the Multiply blend mode does ) . As an analogy , imagine the selected layer and each of the underlying layers as being 35mm slides , and each slide being placed in a separate projector ( one slide for each projector ) , then all of the projectors are turned on and pointed at the same projector screenthis is the effect of the Screen blend mode . This is a great mode for making blacks disappear while keeping the whites , and for making glow effects . <p> Keeping this information in mind , here are a few ways to use the textures . <h> Add the texture within your layer stack <p> The scenario : you just want to add paper folds as the finishing touch to your print . <p> While this might be a bit corny , I 'd like to use the burst-like folds behind the design ( and the silhouette in particular ) to create some divine rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of my Design layer group . <p> Composition wise , I think it could be more interesting if the rays were coming from behind the head of the silhouette . <p> Now , we simply have to use the Screen blending mode to our advantage again , so we can see the background effects of the piece again . <p> Since the effect is still a hair too strong , I simply decided to lower the opacity of the texture layer to 25% , and we get something much more subtle . <h> Paste the textures in a layer mask <p> Using these black and white textures in layer mask is super easy , because you can get a very quick sense of how theyll impact the content of that mask . If we look at the more crumpled type of paper textures , we find things like that ( in volume I , **43;214;TOOLONG ) : <p> This would be perfect to emulate a very worn print . Let 's have another look at the- Road Hog tee design pack by OK Pants ( more info about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a background effect set up , just like at the start of the tutorial I wrote about my metal dumpster texture pack . <p> I want to emulate a worn look for the piece , just like if the piece had been heavily scratched . Its simple to do . Let 's start by adding a layer mask to our design . Simply highlight the layer you want to add a mask to , and click the Add layer mask button at the bottom of your layer palette . <p> Make sure the layer and the mask are n't  linked together ( click on the chain link between the layer and mask thumbnails ) , so well be able to resize and move the content of each independently of each other . <p> Once these two steps have been taken care of , open your texture , copy it , and paste it into the layer mask . Simply ALT/OPTION+CLICK the layer masks thumbnail in the layer palette to access its content to do so . Resize the texture so it fills the whole canvas . Even though the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit ( you can use Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Sharpen a couple of times ) . Sharpening the texture will also bring out the fold pattern more . <p> Once you 're done , click the layer thumbnail again to admire your result And realize that obviously , the effect is too intense . Simply switch back to the layer mask content view , and make the edits needed to the texture . <p> First , let 's invert it ( CTRL/CMD+I ) . <p> The result is much nicer . <p> From there , using the level palette ( CTRL/CMD+L ) , you could make the effect stronger : <p> Or you could do it much softer , too : <h> Last thoughts <p> I 'm sure there are a few more ways to use these creatively , but that 's what I wanted to show you today . I hope you enjoyed going through the short how-tos as much as I had fun writing them . As usual , you should ask your questions in the comments below or by tweeting at me .

@@98562196 @2762196/ <h> How to Draw Your Own Vector Wings <p> Ok , I lied . Were not entering the Food Service industry . But a tutorial on how to make some chicken wings would be pretty cool , none the less . This tutorial is all about how to make those really cool hyper detailed wings that all those bro-dawg brands are rocking . <p> First things first , were gon na need to find a reference photo of a feather . After some searching on the information superhighway , I found one that I liked . The reason I chose it is because it had good curvature and a good amount of disheveled strands . Check it out below . <p> So I placed it into a new Illustrator file ( by going to File &gt; Place ) . Once in there , like a lot of the other tutorials on here that require tracing from a photo reference I 'll be turning down the opacity of the image and locking its sub-layer . <p> So were gon na start tracing the feather out . We do n't  need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put enough crazy ridges and stray strands to keep it as a good base . I did n't  go too hyper on the first one because well be duplicating the base shape and adding further detail to prevent the feathers from being so repetitive . We cant have a boring wing , you know ? <p> So I duplicated the feather base once and dragged it off to the side . I made a couple of my own tapered brushes for the detail . If you 're unfamiliar with making tapered brushes , we have more than a couple tutorials that touch on how to achieve this effect . Its a whole tutorial in itself , so like last time , I 'm omitting it from this one too . I added a ton of detailed strands all around both base shapes . I expanded the appearance on the brush strokes , deleted the invisible stroke marks ( by making a transparent box , using the magic wand to select all the invisible lines , and hit the delete key ) then added the shape of the details and the corresponding base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers . <p> Now I start building the wing . The curvature comes into play here , because its what is going to give our wing a legit look . I duplicated each feather , and switched off each style to keep it different , while decreasing the size little by little . I know I reached a good stopping point when the detail in the wing begins to get lossy with the naked eye . <p> Now we need to add the secondary part of the wing . I duplicated the wing we have so far and added it with the pathfinder . I turned down the opacity ( locking its sub-layer is up to you , but not necessary ) and got to work with the additional part . I added the detail strands much like I did in the feather . I also added some more smaller feathers to give it some more character and kill off a little of the negative space . <p> Now I repeated the expanding of the brush strokes , deleted stray transparent lines , and merged the wing all together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's duplicate it and mirror it like its shown below . <p> So let 's align this bad boy properly , and group it together . <p> You 're now equipped with a pretty nice set of wings to put behind your logo or graphic . I used a skull here from the Arsenal , well , because I can and there you have it . <p> Now I 'm gon na go look up some Hot Wing recipes and throw down in the kitchen . Adios ! <p> -Dave <p> The feather used as the photo reference was aquired by using Googles image search , from the website Owl Prowl .

@@98562198 @2762198/ <p> In this tutorial , my aim is to introduce some techniques that you might not be familiar with that can achieve a unique glitch aesthetic in your designs . I like the idea of using some aspects of glitch art to incorporate into graphic design and give it a digital feel whilst still keeping the main focus intact . If you are unfamiliar with glitch art , then I recommend watching this short video by PBS called The Art of Glitch . <p> This tutorial will be broken up into three sections . In the first section I will explain how I have created a glitch font using the free online font-building tool Fontstruct . The second section will explore some experimental approaches that can be used to create glitches within your imagery . The third section will be focusing on the happy accidents that were generated through the glitches and how to bring everything together in Photoshop . <p> 1 : Creating the Font <p> I decided that I wanted to create a custom font for this project because I wanted to experiment with a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't have the time to create a new font from scratch then manipulating an existing font in Photoshop can be just as effective . Alternatively you can download my font for free . <p> I created my font using the free font-building tool Fonstruct . Creating a similar font does n't require expert knowledge in typography , you will just need a bit of patience and an eye for what looks good and what does n't . <p> Firstly , I recommend finding an existing font that you want your font to look similar to and keep it in front of you for reference at all times . Any legible sans serif font would work great . <p> Inside the Fontstruct editor , you will be given many different shapes to work with which can be used to give your font a digital/pixelated feel . Experiment with the different shapes in your letters . You do n't need to be overly careful , but make sure that the letters still remain legible at smaller pt sizes . Try to keep some consistency throughout . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see what other letters you can replicate the same pattern in . <p> Continue to play around with the different shapes . Although it is supposed to look rough , try to keep the cap heights , median , descenders etc. similar to the font you have chosen to use as a guide . When you are happy with your font , click save and download your font . <p> 2 : Break the JPEG <p> In this section of the tutorial I will go through 2 simple methods on how I go about glitching my imagery . I will be using one of my own photographs which I took in my home town of Birmingham , England during the Christmas period . <p> Firstly , set up a new document in Photoshop at the size you want your artwork to appear . Insert the image that you want to use , and then save it out in JPEG format in a different name . This will be the image you will manipulate to produce a glitched effect . <p> Locate that file and change the extension from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a basic text editor like TextEdit . Begin to cut chunks of text out and paste it into different parts of the document . If you are working with a large image , you might need to use very large chunks of text . Keep within the middle and three quarters of the way down the document to avoid breaking any of the necessary the code . <p> Every image will react differently , so keep experimenting with cutting different parts out and moving sections around until you get something that looks cool . Create a few different ones and open them up in Photoshop . Sometimes Photoshop will throw up an error because it thinks the image has corrupted . If this happens , all you need to do is save it again from a photo viewer like Preview on Mac . You should then be able to open it up in Photoshop . <p> The second method is even simpler . There is an online glitch generator created by multimedia designer Georg Fischer where you can create multiple glitch images just with a few clicks . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with the settings until you have something you like and then download your image . This is obviously a much quicker way of doing it , but I recommend using both methods so that you have a more diverse range of imagery to work with . <p> 3 : Bring It Together In Photoshop <p> Go back to the- document that you set up in Photoshop with the original image inside as a background . You can now start cutting sections out from your glitched images . This will take a lot of trial and error . Try to use the more interesting glitches with the colours that stand out . Place them on top of your original background image roughly in the same place . Cut around the main focus of your design so that the glitched elements are n't getting in the way too much . <p> Play around with layer styles . I found that using Screen worked particularly well in some places . Since some of the glitched images can look low quality , your design can end up looking a bit too blurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter to sharpen things up a bit . <p> For the text boxes , I decided to create a diagonal line pattern to really enforce the digital aesthetic of the design . To do this , I have created a new document that is 3 x 3 pixels and have chosen a white background colour . Zoom as far into your document as you can , then create 3 pixels forming a diagonal line . Click Edit &gt; Define Pattern and name it . <p> Now with the Type tool , type in whatever text you want to appear in your design and position it wherever looks best . Draw out some basic rectangles behind it so that the text is legible but not covering up too much of the imagery . <p> On the layer that includes your text box , click on the Layer Styles icon and select Pattern Overlay . There you can locate your custom diagonal pattern . Make sure it is scaled so that you can see it clearly enough . I set the transparency to around 20% , but do whatever works best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case you want to keep the original layers . Then , merge the duplicated layers so that they become one layer . Use Hue and Saturation to make the colours more vivid so that the imagery stands out more . <p> Duplicate the merged layer again and apply your diagonal line pattern in the Patterns Overlay . Again you want the transparency to be around 20% . Once that is applied , use the Eraser tool to erase the middle so that you have the nice diagonal line pattern subtly appearing in from the edges . <p> Merging letters from your font into the background can also be very effective . Maybe you can type in some hidden messages that the viewer wo n't notice right away . Just type out your text , transform it to wherever looks best and add some layer styles , but make sure it does n't distract from the main text . <p> Wrapping Things Up <p> I hope you have enjoyed exploring glitch aesthetics through typography and imagery and that you have discovered something new . Do n't worry if something has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this tutorial is to encourage experimentation in your work . If you have come across something particularly cool with these techniques , then focus on that and bring the most out of it . 
@@98562201 @2762201/ <p> Well today , I want to talk about another one of my hobbies : photography . More specifically , iPhonography . I 'm an avid Instagram user . But even better than Instagram is VSCO Cam . Purchasing the whole set of filters in that last app was so worth it . I 'm a sucker for these often over-the-top film vibe images . Knowing that I do n't  shoot too much film these days ( despite owning a couple of Polaroids and an old Fujica ST 705 ) , its kind of the closest I 'm getting to it . <p> But editing images on a small screen is n't always the best and most practical . So , our quest today will be to create an editing workflow that brings us similar results , but by using Photoshop . I personally use Photoshop CC , but I 'm fairly certain that you 'll have access to the same tools than I do starting with Ps CS3 . <h> Let 's have a look at what kind of effect VSCO Cam produces <p> Ill use some of my own images here as examples : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded " look ( " crushed " colors ) , some grain , and some strange saturation mixed with cross-processed tones . <p> The faded look is the signature feature here . Well be exploiting the power of curves to accomplish some of that stuff . The grain can be either generated by Photoshops noise functionality , but well probably use a real film grain and/or dust texture for added realism , and the saturation and cross-processing will be done using adjustment layers . The adjustment layer bit is crucial in order to keep a non-destructive workflow . This will allow us to , by turning a few layers off , to always get back to the original image . <h> Step one : <p> This is very straight forward : open your image , and double click the background layer to make its own layer . <h> Step two : lightening the image a bit <p> The second step consists of lightening the image a bit . You could use a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer , but I decided to use a Curves layer instead . Curves are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the curve , and drag it upwards . I 've dragged it until my input value reads 130 , and my output value reaches 140 . <h> Step three : boosting the contrast <p> The contrast adjustment might not be necessary , depending on your starting image . Doing it here allowed to bring more intensity in the hay , and in that building in the left of the image . I could have used a curve adjustment layer to execute this step , but since I did n't  need much refinement , the Brightness/Contrast one works just fine . <h> Step four : let 's spruce up the colors <p> In my opinion , here 's where we really start to " cheat " with the digital image . A lot of cheaper digital cameras have sensors that do n't  render a color spectrum as extended as , say , a pricey high end DSLR . By adding a Vibrance adjustment layer , we can fix this a little . I pushed the slider to 35 . If you feel happy with the color rendition of your image , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the various films brand that became iconic rendered colors differently as well , and the specific way some of them reacted ( more saturated , more green , more blue , etc. ) got them really sought after . <p> Note : you can read much more about the vibrance functionality over here , along with visual examples . <h> Step five : emulating the " color profile " of film <p> This fifth step is where we twist the colors around to give them the film feel . Were using a Selective color adjustment layer . Well be touching up the yellows , the greens , the blues , and the blacks . See the values below : <p> Yellow : magenta +75 , yellow +25 <p> Greens : yellow +50 , black +100 , <p> Blues : black +25 , <p> Blacks : black +10 <p> If you know how certain type of films render colors ( shadows greener , highlight yellow-ish , etc. ) , this would be the step to apply their " color profiles . " Looking at my result , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preset of VSCO Cam . But you should experiment here . For instance , try reducing the magenta to -25 or so in the blacks . You 'll see that your shadows will take a green-ish hue . Following that logic , you could easily recreate a lot of different color palettes . <h> Step six : the all powerful fade <p> As we saw when we looked at the example images earlier , the " faded " look , with the washed out and " crunched " colors is key to emulate a VSCO Cam image . After tinkering with using the Exposure/Gamma correction adjustment layer and a Curve adjustment layer , it seemed that using a fill layer ( Layer &gt; New fill layer &gt; Solid color ) of the color #4e4e4e put on Lighten for the blending mode gave me the best result . <p> Want more fade ? Duplicate the layer , and toy with the opacity of the copy . Want less fade ? Reduce the opacity of the original layer . <h> Step seven : a hint of cross-processed colors <p> Cross processing " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chemical solution intended for another type of film . As particular chemical solutions are optimized for specific kinds of film , you will get unpredictable and interesting results when they are combined differently " ( read more about real cross processing on the site of the same name or on Wikipedia ) . <p> As you can see , the effect is quite strong . But it brings that interesting green hue in the dark and black zones of the image . To make this a bit more presentable , I just lowered the opacity of the layer to 10% . <h> Step eight : a bit more saturation <p> After all this color craziness , I 'm going to add a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to my layer stack . The slider is at 5 , but this is enough to give a little " kick " to our image . <h> Step nine : let 's amp the temperature up <p> Another trick that VSCO Cam let 's you do is to toy with the temperature of your image . So I went ahead and added a Photo filter adjustment layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive left mine as is , but there 's plenty of head room in the Density slider and layer opacity to refine the effect . Just make sure that the Preserve luminosity checkbox is checked . <h> This is technically it <p> This is it ! If you 've followed the tutorial until now , you 've emulated the look and feel of ( one of the presets of ) VSCO Cam . Just look at the source image , and at the result side by side : <p> But you know me . I love texture , grain , and dust speckles too much to stop there . The next two steps , that are absolutely up to you , will show you how I added some grain and dust speckles to my image . <h> Step ten : grainy <p> As I wrote earlier , you could just fill a new layer with white or a neutral gray , and add noise to it ( Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add noise ) . But real analog grain will be so much better . So after scouring the internets for cool grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 9000 x 7200 pixels @ 300ppi ) on DeviantArt , called Grain explosion . Its been provided to us by JakezDaniel . Careful though , as its apparently only for non-commercial use ( unless you get his permission ) . <p> The process is quite simple : import the texture in your design ( File &gt; place ) , and size it appropriately to cover your whole canvas . This one is so high resolution , that even at 26% percent of its size , it did the trick . Put the layer on Soft light at 15% opacity , and you 've got yourself some sweet film grain . <h> Step eleven : dusty <p> Another bonus step is to add dust , scratches , and other artifacts to the image . Well , JakezDaniel strikes again , because he has another sweet texture in his library called Film 400TMY . Same restrictions on its use , so do n't  come and pretend you 've not been warned . This texture features some subtle grain , and plenty of speckles of all sorts of dusty goodness . I also placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the blending mode of the layer on Screen , and tadaa ! <p> And there you have it ! First with textures , and then without them . <h> Now what ? <p> Well , the whole point is to see if this is an editing workflow that could be reused for a whole set of images . See below the before and after comparison of the other source images Ive mentioned at the beginning . The layer stack has been moved as-is to them . The only thing that changed is how much Ive resized the grain and dust textures . Their opacities and blending modes remain the same . These are at 100% . Just click on the image to see it in very big . <p> On that foggy landscape picture , you can see that the result is very satisfying . The fade works wonders , probably even too well . I suppose that the color edits could be different to fit the mood of the image better . <p> For our second image , the result is a bit more intense , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step is going to be the one step to adapt every time to the source image . <p> Note : this image had to be resized down to be able to upload it through WordPress . You can see the full size image over here . <h> Bonus : " tilt-shift " blur <p> Editing images using VSCO Cam is great , but only Instagram allows you to do that quick blur effect . It can be used either to recreate that sweet " tilt-shift " effect , or to highlight a specific part of your image . After a little bit of play time with the lens blur effect and documentation reading , I think I managed to create a satisfactory Ps equivalent . In our Tuscany fields scene , were more going to highlight a part of the image rather than do some tilt-shift goodness . <h> Step one : preparing the document <p> The first step Ive taken is to create a composite of all my layers so far . The shortcut for this is CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + E ( CMD + OPTION + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This creates a new layer at the top of your layer stack with a merged copy of what your document looks like so far . This is an immensely useful shortcut . You 'll notice that I renamed my layer " composite . " <h> Step two : adding a layer mask <p> This is pretty straight forward . You can either add the layer mask from Layer &gt; Layer mask &gt; Reveal All , or from the handy little layer mask button at the bottom of your layer palette , with the correct layer highlighted . <h> Step three : painting the layer mask <p> This step is where you decide what will be blurry in your image , and what wont . You can either use the gradient tool to paint on your layer mask , or a big , soft brush . <p> The gradient tool will help you to nicely emulate real depth of field . Just be remember to choose the right gradient type for the shape of blur that you 're looking to accomplish ( radial or reflected ) . The brush will allow much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my image does n't  have a very straight line of things I 'd like to highlight , the brush made sense for me over the gradient. - My brush is 250 pixels wide , and its hardness is at 0% . <p> Time to paint away ! Note that what will be white , will be blurry , and what will be black will be left - as-is . I 've chosen to highlight that zone at the middle of the image , and to make the sky and field right in front of us blurry . I followed roughly the hills edges . The brushs soft edges allow to somehow emulate a gradient . The second image highlights where the blurred out areas will be . <h> Step four : lens blur ! <p> This is where the real fun happens ! Go to Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Lens blur . You 'll see the following screen : <p> The following image shows my settings . I 'll explain below what they mean . <p> You obviously want to have Preview checked . Itll allow you to see the effects of your tinkering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created that layer mask before . You 'll want to use the drop-down menu to highlight Layer Mask . And at that point , you should see the blur starting to follow what you 've painted in the layer mask . If you 've painted in reverse ( it happens often when using the gradient tool ) , you check the Invert box to reverse how the filter will read your layer mask . The Blur Focal Distance slider should be set at 0 . This one works as follows : 0 is in focus , 255 is fully blurry . Since we have a predefined depth map , we do have to worry too much about it . <p> The Iris set of settings is where you can how the blur will look like . I chose my shape to be an octagon , but I noticed that an hexagon works as well . I do believe that this emulates the shape of the shutter in a real camera , but do n't  quote me on this . The Radius slider is where you 'll determine how blurry the blur gets . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curvature and Rotation sliders produced very subtle changes when I played with them . I assume that would be where you could recreate the " profile " of a lens and/or of a shoots circumstances by matching its physical characteristics . <p> The Spectacular highlights settings are where to tinker if you want to play with bokeh . They seemed to me to react exponentially rather than in a linear fashion , so I 'd say they are to be used with caution . <p> Noise is pretty straight forward . It adds noise to the blurry part of the image . I chose to put that slider to 2 , and to have the distribution set on Gaussian . You could have some RGB noise in there , but Monochromatic looks better in my opinion . <p> Once you 're happy with the settings , time to hit that OK button at the top and to render the lens blur effect . <h> Tadaa ! <p> One thing that I 'm noticing now is that the blur also blurred the dust and other film artifacts that Ive added to the image with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite easy : let 's recreate my composite layer in order to only include the stack of adjustment layers , and not the two texture layers , copy the layer mask over , and re-apply the lens blur effect with the same settings . And here you 'll have a lens blur effect and preserved textural effects . <p> Something to note is that how the layer mask looks like is really what makes or breaks the effect . My painting was really rough and quick , mostly to demonstrate the effect . A more refined job would have made things a bit more subtle and believable . A gradient truly is what will emulate depth of field the best . here 's a visual demonstration of this : <p> Its a bit softer , and much more believable . <h> On that note <p> That 's all for today folks !

If you 're not aware of the power that is a global swatch , they are special color swatches that are applied like regular swatches , but when the swatch is changed , all vector objects using that swatch are also updated . Similar to Symbols in Illustrator , or Instances for you Flash users . Like I said , awesome . <p> Global swatches come in very handy when tweaking colors in an illustration or design . Obviously you 're keeping your color palette tight , limited and harmonious so using global color swatches is the ideal method for ensuring all your elements are using the exact same color throughout the illustration or design . <p> Of course , this is only handy if you 're using global swatches from the go . Otherwise you need to go back , select one object using a color , go to Select &gt; Same &gt; Fill Color and then create a global swatch , and then apply that global swatch . Sheesh !

Once you create the layer style , you can easily " blingify " any layer . There is also a video tutorial as well . <h> Video Tutorial <h> STEP 1 <p> Choose an image you want to sprinkle with golden Photoshop magic . In this case i chose a full color image of a boombox and I 'm going to make it look like it is solid gold . Make the image into a grayscale image by " Desaturating " the layer in the **28;293;TOOLONG menu . <h> STEP 2 <p> Apply a color overlay Layer Style by clicking the FX button at the bottom of your Layers Palette . <h> STEP 3 <p> Set the color overlay to a rich golden color and make sure the Blend Mode is set to Color Burn <h> STEP 4 <h> STEP 5 <p> Repeat the exact same steps for 2 different cars . I copied and flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetrical composition started . <h> STEP 6 <p> We are creating a background for our composition that will look like a close of the boom box speaker shield . In Adobe Illustrator , draw 2 circles and separate them a descent width . Keep them aligned horizontally . Then choose Object/Blend/Make . You can also choose the blend tool from your tools palette . <p> Once you have a blend , you 'll want to open the blending options by going to Object/Blend/Blend Options or double clicking the Blend tool in the tools palette will bring up the same dialog box . Choose a # of blends that will leave some space between your circles . <h> STEP 7 <p> Expand your blend by choosing Object/Blend/Expand . Now Each circle is treated individually and can be edited . Select your entire row of circles . Hold down option and drag it down a good distance . Hold down shift at the same time to keep the layer aligned vertically . Then repeat the steps to make a blend . I chose 15 steps . You can see that I have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evenly spaced circles . <p> Select the entire grid and hold down option &amp; shift while dragging on a 45 degree angle . You now have a circle pattern that should look like the pic below <p> Copy and paste it into your Photoshop document <h> STEP 8 <h> STEP 9 <p> This is the hardest part of the tutorial and its all trial and error at least for me it was . Were going to create our own layer style that take a solid 2d object and make it look all blingd out . I chose this amazing vector artwork from Go Medias Arsenal Set 1 Crests . <p> First use a Gradient Overlay from the FX Layer Style tab in your layers palette . I created this gradient of different hues and values of Gold . Make sure you have contrast in your gradient . <p> This is what the Go Media vector crest will look like after the gradient has been applied : <p> Apply a Satin layer style within the same dialog box . You will want to experiment with your settings . Each object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see some depth start to take place and that is important . Choose a different Contour as well . I chose this double peaked one . <p> Choose a Bevel and Emboss from the Layer Style window . Select Inner Bevel . Adjust the size and softness . I chose 10 and 1 . Set the Shadow Mode to Color Burn and you may want to decrease the opacity . <p> Check the Contour Box under Bevel and Emboss . Choose a Contour . Each one will give a different look . <p> Choose the Texture box under Bevel and Emboss as well . Select a pattern from one of the Photoshop presets . Adjust the scale and depth and watch how it effects the Go Media Crest . Again , experiment with these settings to get something that is really starting to look like gold reflections . <p> At this point I feel as though the crest is a little too orange . I could go back in and adjust my gradient overlay but then i 'd have to adjust each point in the gradient where there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chose a darker desaturated green to help tone down the red in my gold layer style . I adjusted the opacity until i felt it was beginning to match the golden cars a little better . <p> And the last layer style for our gold effect will be to add a drop shadow to help with some depth . <p> Now , before you close the Layer Style box . You are going to save this style so you can reuse it on anything ! Click the New Style button just below " Ok " and give your style a name . Check both boxes Include Layer Effects &amp; Include Layer Blending Options . <h> STEP 10 <p> Copy and paste into Photoshop and this time apply your new style you just finished creating . <p> Repeat the same step for any additional elements you want to turn into gold . <h> STEP 11 <p> Were going to add some light effects using the airbrush and a layer style . Choose a standard airbrush and set it really large . I clicked one time at 100% . <p> Apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the layers palette . <p> Choose a color for the Outer Glow . Set the Blend mode to Add . Opacity 100% <p> Copy that layer and then place it in front of everything . Adjust the opacity to be quite a bit lower . Then use the eraser with an air brush setting that will allow you to erase over the middle of the car and near the edges . The result gives you the look of over spill from the light source . <h> STEP 12 <p> Were going to add some sparkle to our bling using Illustrator and more layer styles . Well then make a custom brush from our sparkle shape and bling this piece out with tons of rad sparkly things . Create a star shape in illustrator . I chose a 5 point star and duplicated/rotated slightly to get my final sparkle shape . <p> Copy and Paste it into Photoshop . Apply a Layer Style of Outer Glow . Only this time change the Blend Mode to normal and adjust the spread/size to give a faint blur around your sparkle shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer . It will bring up these options . Choose Create Layer . This will make the outer glow an actual image on the layer below your sparkly image . <p> Choose the layer above blurry sparkle shape . This should be the crisp sparkle . Choose Merge Down from the Layer Palette tab in the right hand corner . <p> Now go to Edit/Define Brush Preset . <p> Name your new brush . <p> And now you will see your new brush in the brush palette . ( and you can see that I 've created some of these before ) <p> Click once in your desired spot to add sparkle to your bling ! However these sparkles could look even better with another layer style applied to it ! Why not ? right ! <p> To tighten this design up a little more , I 've added the Go Media Logo complimented by an icy hot diamond because that 's how Chris Wilson likes to roll at Go Media . ; - ) <p> I simply applied my own style that I created earlier in the tutorial . Unfortunately , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . I actually had to tweak my style settings quite a bit to get it to match the other Go Media vectors that turned gold fairly easy . <p> So there you have it . Some badass blingin sparklies .

Also- she is the only female in a movie full of dudes , so she really needs to not be a troll . " <p> After a bit of pleading , Patrick ( the director working on the film ) also sent me through this rough sketch hed put together . It makes such a difference getting some rough input from a client as it means I have a starting point- even the crudest stick man helps me to get a result closer to what they originally envisioned . Anyway from this , I gathered she needed to be in pretty light armour , probably leather or cloth and covered in dirt . Nice . <h> The Concept <p> The next step is getting a rough sketch together . My initial sketches are always pretty awful ( I think I drew this one whilst on a bus in Spain ? ) , but the point of them is very much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across . If you spend any massive length of time on them , then ( if you 're like me ) you 'll resent any changes that need to be made , at the end of the day : time is money after all . In this version , Patrick could see I 'd gone for a cloth wrap that showed off more skin in a way that was n't too obviously sexual , and made the hair very loose , long and straggly . I also gave her two swords , but Patrick felt that a crude sword and shield might work better , so we went with that . <p> The developed sketch turned out like this . I tried to stay aware that whilst this character needed to be feral and wild , she also had to be quite attractive in her own way . To keep that appeal in there , I pretty much sketched her naked outline and started adding clothes after so as to keep that core feminine silhouette to the design . <h> Inking <p> Once that got approved I moved onto inking- I ink right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a scanned copy at a decent resolution just in case I slip up . A lot of top inkers recommend brushes to help you get a good line weight into your artwork , this can make your drawings a lot more dynamic and it really helps to give a sense of depth . Originally I just used digital inking via my Wacom tablet , but at my first comic con in Boston , a few editors from DC comics tore my portfolio apart , saying I had great talent but I really needed to use brushes to ink my work . Since then I 've tried my best to use brushes , but as with all things its easier said than done and I ended up ruining a few sketches with spilt ink pots and the like . Now Ive found a happy medium in the Pentel Brush Pen- which is what it sounds like ; a pen with a brush nib . I think its designed for Chinese calligraphy or something , but to my mind , there is no better pen out there for inking your artworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So now my inks are nailed down , its time to erase the pencil underneath and get the inks scanned into Photoshop . I use the Levels Tool ( Ctrl+L ) to try and clean up my image a bit and get rid of any paper grain . Basically I just move the black and white cursors a little closer to the centre until I 'm happy with the definition I 'm getting . Its useful to zoom right in here to make sure I do n't  have any pencil trails still knocking about . A trick I sometimes also do ( but not for this piece ) is run my linework through a Live Trace in Illustrator , then just save it as a PDF and open it back up in Photoshop . This can really help smooth out my lines and can make a huge difference if I 'm going for that ultra polished look . <h> Colours <p> For colour I generally duplicate my line layer and set the top one to multiply . For the lower level I go to Select &gt; Colour Range and choose black to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contract and contract by one pixel . Now I invert the selection and delete . This means that the lower layer ( which will become my colour layer ) has slightly thinner lines than my top layer . This way I can just use the paint bucket tool on my lower level to quickly fill the areas I need with colour . The downside of this is that the lines on the lower layer are now very jagged , but fear not- that top layer is still perfect and will keep the ultra smooth lines . Smart . <p> Shading wise I do love my gradient tool , but I 'm trying to broaden my horizons and so , with that in mind , for this piece I decided to use Copic Markers . Now I 'm no pro with these things yet , but Ive seen some amazing artwork from guys like Adam Hughes and Mahmud Asrar , so I figure its well worth my time getting to know them . They 're basically watercolours in a pen minus the mess ( are you seeing a pattern here ? ) . Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured it did n't  matter too much if I was n't perfect yet as itd probably add to the effect I was trying to achieve anyway . <p> So here 's how I work- I go back to my inks in Photoshop and place a screen layer over them and fill it with Non Photo Blue ( #A4DDED thank me later ) , this changes all my inks to a special type of blue that is really tough for scanners to pick up ( meaning the lines wo n't show up as much when I scan it back in and I 'll just have my sexy Copic shading ) . I print this out and then start going over it with the Copics . I only use grey as I already have my basic colours in Photoshop . Copics have two types of grey- warm and cool . Warm is generally for skin and warm things , and cool for clothes and cool things ( duh ! ) , however , for this character I really wanted to make her as pale and cold as us Brits really are and so I swapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm greys for the clothes . This contrasts well with the olive skinned Romans I illustrated later . <p> So the technique I use is just to start with my lightest colour and keep adding until I 'm happy . I apply each colour a few times to get really slight gradient differences and then switch up a pen for more defined shadow and light sections . Another cool tip is do n't  worry about going outside the lines- we have our perfect inks saved on Photoshop now , so if needs be we can always use that as a mask to clean things up . <p> Some other gadgets I have are these Sepia pens . Again , these come in warm and cool greys . They 're not quite as washy as the copics but they have a much finer nib and are great for detail . <p> I use these for any sections that need real precise details like on the leather strips or strongly defined shadow . Theyre great for hair as well . <p> Finally I have a couple of white ink pens for highlighting any areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inks can run a bit , but sometimes it can be helpful to get the whites in whilst I 'm in the zone and am pretty familiar with the illustration and lighting etc <p> Now for the fun part ; get the Copics scanned in and throw them into Photoshop . <p> I grey-scale them up with Ctrl+Shift+U to get rid of any colours that have shown up ( or not if I like the effect , I call it as I see it depending on the illustration ) . <h> Finishing Touches <p> Now is the time to take a good look over the illustration . I often notice some bits I want to be darker or lighter . Not to worry though , I just hide the Copic layer and start editing my original colour layer . I wanted the eyes much darker and I think I wanted the clothes to cast more of a shadow too , so all I did was highlight those sections and darkened them with either the Lightness Bar on the Hue/Saturation Panel ( Ctrl+U ) , or with the Gradient tool set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sections , like on the sword , so I did the same thing but with white . When I 'm creating a glow or a shine , I make sure to do it on a new level above my smooth inks , stuff like this really helps blend a work of art and brings a piece together . <p> I know what you 're thinking- " this chick is way too clean , wheres all the mud we were promised ? " . I know , and I 'm way ahead of you . I have this great texture in stock from Go Media Arsenal Grime Set 2 pack , I think its actually concrete , but it works really well for adding a natural , dirty looking texture to things . Normally when I 'm working with textures I like to desaturate them so they taken on the colours of whatever layers I apply them to , but in this case I thought the bluey grey colour worked pretty well ( having flashbacks to Braveheart ! ) so I decided to keep it as is . <p> To apply the mud effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete any part that is n't over the skin and set the layer to multiply- this ensures that all the dark bits of the texture stay dark whilst the light bits show through the skin colour underneath . After that its just a case of playing with the opacity to get the muddiness to a level I 'm happy with , I think I opted for around 50% opacity in this piece . Another cool trick I do here to add a bit of depth and volume is to select the erase tool and a really soft brush with a low opacity and just go to work erasing bits of the mud texture on the parts of the skin that would be either naturally lighter or catch the light ( since the mud layer is set to multiply , and only the dark bits are showing through , erasing them will make that area lighter ) . In this case I erased around the shoulder and hips , as well as on the top of the thigh to make those areas seem a bit more rounded and curved . <p> Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention anything about backgrounds , but I work to the Bill Beachy mantra of " under promise and over deliver " so whilst not going overboard I am going to try and produce a background thatll help set the tone for this illustration . Note : Bill Beachy is also the mastermind behind the best web design firm in Cleveland , Go Media . The basis for the background is very simple . Another texture from Go Medias Arsenal , this time from the Rust 3 set with a blue tint and a black gradient coming in from above . I 've also included just the hint of a pattern from the tribal vector pack in order to make that background a bit more dynamic . Also since the illustration is for a movie called The Northern Mist I figured its probably a safe bet to put some mist in there too . This is basically created on a layer above the background ( but behind the character ) by using some of the sexy Smoke and Cloud textures from the Arsenal . I use a few of these mixed together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the texture and just showing the white misty goodness ) , this gives a sense of volume to the mist in a very authentic ( and quick ! ) way . <p> To add a bit of depth and to create a foreground , I duplicated the mist layer and moved it above the character illustration to give the appearance that my Lady Briton was stood amongst the mist rather than in-front of it . I also added a bit of light in the top left corner to help show off a bit of light direction and some cheeky dust particles to make the light look a bit more dynamic and to add extra depth . One last cool little trick I did here was to put all the character layers in a group ( Ctrl+G ) and then apply a gradient mask to that group from the ground up , effectively fading out her feet . The result of which made her look as though her feet were disappearing into the mist , but still allowed me to keep the mist fairly fine . <p> So there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys from Cohort Pictures were really thrilled with how this , and the other illustrations turned out . In fact , they even hired me again right away to produce a short comic book in lieu of the traditional storyboards , so that they could use it as a marketing tool for the film ! <p> Alex Singleton is the owner of Hunting Town Design , a small design house based in Manchester UK specialising in Graphic Design and Illustration .

@@98562210 @2762210/ <h> 6 Questions to Consider When Rebranding Your Company <h> Things to consider before rebranding your company . <p> Here at Cleveland creative agency- Go Media , we take- branding- very seriously . We have helped many companies , whove undergone natural growth and change , take necessary steps to transform the face of their company for the better . Consider these six simple questions when rebranding your own company and you 'll be on the road to success . <h> 1 . What is the goal ? <p> Do n't  rebrand simply just because . You should have a specific set of goals driving your rebrand . Perhaps , for example , you are a tech company who needs to modernize a logo designed in the 70s . Ask yourself why you are rebranding and give yourself an excellent answer . Do n't  have one ? It may not be time . <h> 2 . Is brand boredom the reason for the rebrand ? <p> Many times business owners will rebrand because they 're suffering from brand boredom . They 're looking at their brand all day long , every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner , is normal and only natural . This , however , not a good reason to rebrand ! Remember that clients are not coming into contact with your brand as frequently as you . They need to become familiar with your color schemes , fonts , mark . This can only be accomplished through consistency . <h> 3 . What is your brand equity ? <p> Is your brand equity good or bad ? When customers come in contact with your logo , do they remember the amazing work you 've done for them ? Or , do they instead only recall a negative experience with you ? If you believe your brand to have a positive brand equity , this is extremely valuable ! Hold onto that value ! If you feel a change is in order , a brand refresh , is what we recommend . With a brand refresh , you 'll use enough new elements to move the brand forward while keeping enough old elements to maintain brand recognition . <p> Consider your brand to have a negative equity ? You may want to try something new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new brand . You 'll want to completely break any negative association with your brand if needed . For example , imagine you owned an airline that had a 50% incidence rate of plane crashes over a one year period . Your brand equity would call for a complete change to say the least . <h> 4 . What costs are involved ? <p> When thinking about doing a rebrand of your company , you must consider all of the costs involved . Your brand is more pervasive than you may at first think and if you 're considering a rebrand you 'll have to replace everything relatively quickly . This includes your letterhead , your website , building signs , ads , etc. - Hesitate to do so and your customers will be seeing two brands for an extended period of time . Focus on primary touch points first , then go from there . Also , possibly hold off on a rebrand until you have exhausted your stock of items with old branding . This way , when you 've rebranding , you can restock and be all ready to go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Keep in mind that your brand is not only a logo , but that your brand also embodies your company in its entirety . Your brand is your personality , its messaging , copy . Your brand is what you say and how you say it . Your brand is your companys vibe , the music you play , your uniform , the furniture in your office . Consider a rebrand and how these elements may be impacted. <h> 6 . How will you transition the rebrand ? <p> The rebranding process can be very disruptive if not handled with finesse . Making major aesthetic shifts or changing your names can confuse customers . Consider how you 'll educate your customers about the transition to your new brand . Some examples ? Place your old brand next to your new brand , or explain very clearly to customers that " ABC Company is now XYZ Company . " - Take some time to let things sink in . <p> I grew up in Cleveland Hts . Ohio and was drawing constantly . As a child I took art classes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " class artist . " I graduated from The Ohio State University 's department of Industrial Design .

@@98562212 @2762212/ <h> Getting Comfortable Asking for Money <h> How to Ask Clients for Money ( when its not your favorite ) <p> For many of us , asking to get paid- is n't among our favorite conversations . Its something that takes practice . Here are some tips we suggest for building your confidence when asking to get paid what you so rightfully deserve . <p> Show them the value . When meeting with new clients , make a smooth- transition from a discussion about project details into the value you 'll be bringing to the client immediately and over years to come . By doing so , you 'll build up not only their confidence but your own . Prove your worth by way of examples of past success and by speaking with assuredness about your experience . When your new client feels safe in your care , you 'll be able to show them that you deserve to get paid what you 're asking . Prep for this by practicing speaking about past clients and filling up your portfolio with only the best of past projects . What will you say about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a past client that really boosted their business to new levels ? What was your approach and how will that apply to this project ? <p> Make it easy . We suggest offering the client various options by which they can pay right off the bat , making it as simple and convenient for them as possible . Have your iPad and Square reader out and ready to go . Grab their credit card number and enter it into your system immediately and discuss how you 'll be billing them so there will be no surprises . Ask if you 'd prefer that you stop by in person and pick up a check . Be prepared and ready to have these discussions from the get-go . Do n't  miss a chance to get this all squared away from the jump . This will make the entire process easier for both you and your client . <p> Give them options. - Once you 've established what your client will owe , give your clients a few options regarding how theyd like to pay ( if you 're willing to negotiate this , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35% , 10%. 50% , 20% , 20% , 10% , etc . Once this has been established , put the dates in writing . Giving your client options here is just another factor in building a positive , trusting relationship between the two of you . When you either automate the payments or call to receive them , there will be no surprises . If you 're making a call , a simple , polite request for payment is all you 'll need . Leave out the fluff . Do n't  apologize for calling and bothering them . Please note : As much as you have hope for a fantastic , pain-free relationship with this client , you will have to review what will happen if payments are missed . ( This will also be detailed in your contract . ) Let your client know why its important they pay on time , how this will affect their project timeline , as well as how it impacts how you 've structured your own calendar . Get this out of the way so that you wont have to deal with it later ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping at a store , is n't it bothersome when you pick up an item you 're interested in only to find it does n't  have a price tag on it ? We think so . When you 're speaking with a new or potential client , be prepared to talk numbers by having a rough estimate of pricing for your services or hourly billing so that you 're not a deer in headlights when discussing pricing . Be prepared and after further discussion , be specific about what your client will owe so that there is n't any gray area . Let them know how they can pay , the total cost of your services and when payments are due . Let them pick up your shiny product , hold it in their hand , know what they 're purchasing and feel like its worth every penny . <p> Make it personal. - Great customer service always builds bridges between you and your client . Friendly notes and reminders when bills are due are always better received than cold , sterile ones worded in contractual type language . In addition , - keeping clients engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minds . <p> We hope these methods will help you find it easier to connect with future clients , have easier conversations about money and keep your billing processes running smoothly .

@@98562215 @2762215/ <h> Flash Tutorial : An Introduction to Animation for Newbies <h> Introduction to Flash Animation <p> Now , I only know a handful of the multiple software programs that Adobe has to offer , but , in my opinion , Flash is one of the more difficult to learn . Jumping into a project with Flash takes a lot of time and effort , so I want to go over the absolute basics with you . After all , it was quite difficult for me to find anything that helped me in my introduction with Flash . So for our first project , were going to make some rectangles move . <p> So , first things first . We have to open Flash . <p> The type of file that I typically open is an ActionScript 3.0 , which is the most recent version of ActionScript . Its- the best for what you want to do for a lot of technical reasons we do n't  need to- go over right now . But just know that Flash files that use ActionScript 3 can not include earlier versions of ActionScript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we are at the workspace . The big white space in the middle here is called the stage . If you want something to be seen , make sure that it is within the white space , otherwise , it is unseen offstage . <p> You will note that my workspace has all of my tools situated on the right hand of the screen. - Flash mostly uses the- same kind of tools that are used in most of the Adobe suite . <p> One important thing to note : when you are making shapes with a stroke , the stroke tends to act- as a separate component from the shape you originally drew it with , so I tend to make shapes without a stroke . <p> The main aspect of Flash is that it contains a Timeline that is typically affixed to the bottom of your screen workspace . The timeline is where you keep track of your layers and animation . The timeline is divided into separate frames that can be selected and keyframes inserted . <p> A Keyframe is a frame where content appears on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 24 frames per second , so it takes 24 frames of animation to create a second of- active content . <p> This is an example of a blank keyframe , which would be 6- frames long if played in Flash Professional. - Notice the empty circle at frame- 1 indicating there is n't any content . <p> This is an example of a blank keyframe , but has actions attached to it . Notice the a above the keyframe . Actions are the coding in Flash ( we wont get into coding in this post ) . <p> Pictured above is an example of a keyframe with content . Notice the filled in circle on the first keyframe . <p> This is what a tween looks like when applied to a keyframe with content , more specifically , this is a shape tween. - Tween comes from the words " in between . " A- tween- helps to create movement in your animation . <p> There are 3 different types of tweens . There are classic tweens ( creating a tween that can change size , position , and skew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols and text fields ) , and shape tweens ( drawing a vector shape on one keyframe and then drawing another shape in a second keyframe ) . <p> This is an example of what the timeline looks like when you are using keyframe animation . Each frame is a keyframe , so instead of using tweens , you are creating each motion within each frame . <p> So now that we understand the timeline , keyframes , and tweens , let 's draw some shapes . <p> What I did here is pick my color with the color picker ( no stroke ! ) and use the rectangle tool to draw a shape on Layer- 1 in frame 1 . <p> Before we get much further , I want to make sure that you know that there are two defaulted tabbed spaces that can be very helpful to you . Libraries are going to be used later in this post , but Properties is also very useful to you . <p> Properties will tell you what kind of content you have selected , can let you name instances ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , color , and all kinds of other useful tools that are necessary to the creation process in Flash . <p> Continuing on , since I want this shape to move , I 'm going to insert a keyframe at frame 45 , which will make this animation less than 2 seconds long. - To insert the keyframe , I simply right click so this menu will pop up . <p> With the keyframe at frame 45 highlighted , I take my shape and move it into the position I would like my shape to end up at the end of the animation . <p> Now that we have our shape in the positions we want , were going to click anywhere between the two keyframes and create a classic tween . Now , the shape will move within the 45 frames . <p> Now , let 's make- a copy the- same shape to- move in a different direction as the original shape . So to do that , were going to use the library panel . <p> The library stores shapes , animations , sounds , and even photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . <p> To make our current shape an aspect of the library , we must convert it to a symbol . <p> In this new menu , we are going to make this a movie symbol , and name this object " Purple Rectangle " and then click on Okay . <p> The symbol now appears under the library tab as Purple Rectangle . We are going to add a new layer and then drag our new symbol out . <p> Next , were going to position out our second shape where we would like it to initially appear when the animation begins . <p> After we have our initial position , were going to insert a keyframe on layer 2 under frame 45 and move the shape to- where we would like the shape to end when the animation is complete . <p> Now that we have our two- positions , we are again going to create a classic tween so that our shape moves . <p> Now let 's preview our hard work by going under the Control Panel , to Test Movie , to- In Flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently attending Virginia Marti College of Art and Design .

I 've seen a design I made years ago for a client on various " Pimp Your Myspace " type sites making the artwork available to non-designers all over . The client I did it for paid me for my time and its as much his concern as it is mine . But I do n't  bother policing stuff like that because I do n't  see any of it as a real threat .

If this happens to you , make sure you get the culprit to remove the artwork immediately . Email or phone call works best . Be polite , not mean or arrogant . Only apply pressure when they appear to be resisting . Most people will immediately take it down if caught . As far as legal action goes , its not worth it to even try . Say they got hired to do a $20,000 website because of some high quality Go Media art in their portfolio Eventually they 're not going to be able to hold up their end of the bargain and theyll fail . Its a waste of your time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Ripping your designs and selling them as their own <p> This gets a little more serious . Say for example , you have a t-shirt design you made . Some new clothing company decides to copy your image outright and print the design and sell it . Or even they might recreate it themselves , but its obvious the images are nearly identical . This is where some legal action might be a good idea , but in most cases , its not even worth your time to pursue it . A lawyer will tell you that you 'll spend more money on legal fees than anything youd make from the poor startup clothing company . At best , you send a Cease and Desist letter in addition to an email or phone call explaining your feelings towards the matter . <p> If its a large scale company that rips your designs ( which DOES happen ! ) you have a case . This happened when Johnny Cupcakes was commissioned to design some shirts for Urban Outfitters . They rejected his designs and then released shirts very similar to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , but you 'll be hard pressed to find a lawyer who does n't  want to go after a " big fish . " <p> What do I do ? <p> If this happens to you , you probably have a legal case and it could be worth your time to pursue it . <h> Blatant Ripping and Profiting <p> In the case of our vector packs , we are frequently notified by our own customers when they see someone on the net illegally sharing or distributing our products . This is a little different than someone ripping off our design . This is very similar to downloading software or movies . Its a digital file that we are selling to customers . That income becomes revenue that we use to pay our employees and grow our company . When people are stealing and sharing and in some cases even selling , it directly hurts our sales . We DO see a dip in sales when stuff like this happens . But when you try to contact the website , and its in Russian or Hebrew , its tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kind of assume people will be pirating your digital files if there is any sort of value to them . <p> What do you do ? <p> Most cases , you can simply report abuse or contact the site owner and politely ask for them to remove the link . That usually works . If not , be persistent . I have a friend who runs a Type Foundry and their fonts are always being pirated . He has since started an anti-piracy coalition online and gathered a team of creatives to help him fight it . I 'm not sure if its working , but its a good start ! <h> Conclusion <p> If you 're good , you will get your designs ripped . That 's a fact . People want to be like you , but do n't  have enough respect for you or themselves to ask permission . One of our designers here Oliver , keeps seeing his " circle series " being freely available as cell phone wallpaper , bands album artwork , etc . Sometimes its flattering , but most of the time its insulting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culprit is worth a damn . If the company is broke , a lawyer is n't going to care enough about it to help you . However , most small time offenders can be back on your side with a simple email or phone call . This entire post does n't  need to be this long , because from my experience that 's all that can be done . <h> Final Tips to Prevent Design Piracy : <p> 1 . ) Watermark your images with your logo or name 2 . ) Add a copyright tag on every image you post on the web 3 . ) Disable Right Clicking on your Image 4 . ) Other alternatives 17224 @qwx877224

@@98562225 @2762225/ <h> Advice : How to Get Paid , Dealing with Bad Clients <p> From time to time , Go Media faithful write and ask us for advice . They want to which printer we recommend , how to bill appropriately , or how to work that pesky Wacom . When we recently got questioned about a bad client , William Beachy Go Media President , could n't help but respond immediately . <p> Here was the question we received : <p> Go Media Fan : - Hello Go Media ! I need some advice for billing a particular client . He would like for me to go from hourly to a flat rate for my work . He also does not want the responsibility of final approvals for her printed products . I would like to create a " Job Order " form or convince him to stay at hourly . I need to cover myself here . He wants no approval and also if a mistake is made he expects me to pay for it . ( I am a very small business and cant afford that. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just to let you know this sounds like a bad client . Sometimes you got ta work with bad clients to pay the bills , but drop this client if they 're making you unhappy just as soon as you can . <p> Project-based billing is quite normal . Go Media does project based billing on 95% of our projects . We gather all the info , write up a scope of work ( detailed list of what were going to do ) and put out a price that we will stick to so long as the project does n't  change scope . If you 've ever only done hourly billing it would probably be good for you to learn how to do project based billing . Its a skill you 'll need . Clients want payment options ! If you only do hourly billing you will lose potential clients . You need to be flexible and offer billing options . Go Media works up all kinds of billing options : flat-fee , hourly , subscriptions , leases , extended payment terms , etc . Here are some tips about project based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how long things really take you to get done so , you may occasionally screw yourself by under quoting a job . BUT ! You also get to KEEP the extra money if you come in under hours ! So , over time it works out NOTE : DO NOT REFUND a client if you come in under hours . This is the deal with project based billing ! The client gets a choice pay hourly , or agree in advance what my work on this project is worth , no matter how long it takes me . Some clients want it both ways they want a price cap that we wont exceed and they want to be refunded if we come in under hours . No . Not fair . They get one or the other not both . <p> 2 . Adjust your pricing based on the client . Some clients are VERY easy to work with , projects go fast you can lower your estimates for them . Some clients are nightmares to work with you need to bump up your pricing for them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients to become even more demanding because they now are n't  worried about hours ! For this reason , it can be helpful to put in terms like " 6 rounds of revisions " so you have something to fall back on if they just keep asking for more . <p> 3 . Payment terms should include a deposit in advance of getting started ( usually something between 25% 50% of the project total ) , then split up the remaining payments over the course of the project this way , you 're still getting paid as you work ! Do n't  wait till the end to get paid that puts you in a TERRIBLE position . You will have no leverage . If they miss a payment you need to be brave enough to stop working . If they 're being jerks you need to be one too . <p> As for this client that wants you to be responsible for all proofing pre-printing , not proof anything , then make you pay if there is a mistake that they find on a final printed piece . This makes NO SENSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later why would they wait until AFTER its been printed ? ! ? ! This is insane . Are you working for Donald Trump ? I would NEVER NEVER NEVER accept these terms . I 've never heard of any designer taking on this kind of responsibility . This sounds like a lazy demanding client . Bad clients suck your will to live . The sooner you can get away from them , the happier you will be , and you will free up your time and energy to go market yourself and find good clients ! <p> Again this sounds like a bad client to me . Dump them . <p> Go Media Fan : Also , does your company have a scope of work or job order estimate type of template ? I am having a hard time figuring out where to start with this particular client because I really need to cover my butt ! - <p> Bill : Regarding our scopes of work they really vary from project to project . Some are just a 2-3 sentence description in a Quickbooks estimate , some are spreadsheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no format that 's ever going to be perfect . Ive been doing this for 20 years and miscommunication between seller and buyer are always going to be a challenge . Just think of it like this you 're putting down in writing your best understanding of the work you 're accepting and detailing the terms of the agreement . Even if this is just in an e-mail that 's all you need . Official documents with signature lines really do n't  help if something goes wrong . Waving a contract in the face of a client and saying : " I 've got your signature " will not resolve the situation . <p> Think of the exchange with your client as " I just want to be clear about what were agreeing to " and not " I need an official document that will hold up in court . " <p> Once you shift that perspective , you may relax about what format your scope of work needs to be . It does n't  really matter send a simple text email . <p> Consider this hiring a lawyer and trying to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands of dollars and untold time and emotional energy . Its rarely a winning proposition . And even when you win in court payment is not guaranteed . So , once you take that off the table it clarifies that you 're on your own . The scope of work is just for you and your client . This also reinforces why the payment terms are so critical . Get paid in advance ! <p> So here is what a typical scope of work looks like on a branding project : <p> Brand Standards Guide A brand standards guide is a valuable asset for your company ! It ensures that your brand mark is being applied accurately and consistently , which is critical in maintaining a strong brand presence . The final deliverable is a PDF document that contains the following guidelines : Clear spacing guidelines Minimum sizing and use standards guidelines for both print and web application Typefaces : primary &amp; secondary headings , body copy Colors : primary &amp; complimentary 3 Collateral examples &amp; use cases ( note : these are mockups ' to demonstrate recommended sizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include ) <p> Go Media Fan : Thank you again for all of your help ! - She owes me money so I feel like I cant dump her until I get that check in the bank , you know ? <p> Bill : When you let a client fall behind on payments , or give them payment terms like " due in 30 days " or " due in 60 days " you are in a BAD NEGOTIATING POSITION . You get desperate you jump through hoops trying to please them because you 're desperate to get that payment . <p> Bad clients use this leverage to extract more work from you than what 's agreed upon. - This is the exact position you need to avoid ! ( Stuck with a client because they owe you money . ) Good luck ! 17220 @qwx877220 
@@98562226 @2762226/ <h> Illustrator Poster Design Tutorial <p> With the re-release of our latest , horror-themed , vector set , we felt it was fitting to have an Halloween tutorial . So today , were going to work on re-creating this poster for Draculas daughter , a fictitious movie from five or six decades ago . We will be using vectors- from Go Medias Arsenal to help us out with this poster ( you can purchase below ! ) . <p> The design above was a team effort between Steve Knerem , Jeff Finley , and myself . As you can see , not all the details are historically accurate ( actor names , type choices ) , there are some alignment issues , and a typo , but its a good base to start from . <p> Well be using Illustrator as our main tool throughout this tutorial . This will allow us to easily limit the number of colors of our final piece . This is for two reasons : we want to potentially screen print the piece , and it forces us to design more efficiently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 to match our color palette , how to place them around , how to manipulate the type to create the title elements , and more ! Let 's get started , shall we ? <h> Step zero : the layout <p> The first step would be to take a piece of paper and a pen , and to comp some layout options . This is also where we looked at the content of set 23 , and decided which pieces to use . Steve is the one who came up with the concepts for the posters layout . He also fixed the poster size at 18 ? by 24 ? . - Here are a couple of the sketches he made : <p> - - <p> As you can see , the diamond element , along with the witchs head have been there from the start . The earlier versions of the composition were a bit busier , with a lot of elements in the bottom half of the frame . We decided to simplify things . <p> Since the process between Steve , Jeff , and myself was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth between us . From now on , this will be written as if we started from scratch . Also , since there were so many people involved and that some of the steps havent been documented , we might end up with an end result slightly different from the mockup at the top . <h> Step one : document setup <p> The first step is straight forward : we need to create a new document in Illustrator . I created an 18 ? x24 ? document , at 300 dpi and in CMYK . <p> Useful goodie : here are the main colors well be using . <h> Step two : background elements <h> Main background color <p> After placing a series of guides ( to find the middle , and get a sense of the bleed I 'd like to keep ) , I 've created a - new layer that I 've named " bg elements . " I then used my rectangle tool ( M ) to create a centered 18 ? x24 ? rectangle filled with a very dark gray ( #121213 ) . <h> Background texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placed it in above the dark gray rectangle , sized it to fill the whole artboard , and colored it in RGB black ( #000000 ) . This way , it contrasts softly against the dark gray of our background rectangle . <p> The finishing touch for the texture is to hide the parts of it that extend beyond our artboard ( when sized at 18 ? wide , the texture is almost 26.2 ? tall ) . Were going to use a clipping mask for this . Just create another 18 ? x24 ? rectangle above the texture group , center it , and remove any fill or stroke color . I 've also renamed it to texture clipping mask . Then , select both the texture and the rectangle , right click , and select the Make clipping mask- option . And you 'll have a clean looking background ! <h> Background burst <p> The purple burst is the focal element of the background . Youll notice in our mockup above that the burst is grunged out by the texture . This means that well have to place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In order to get a burst , we need to first create a circle . Mine is 16 ? in diameter . Its centered in the artboard , and filled in purple ( #614a72 ) . <p> Next , well be using the Zig Zag filter to create the burst out of that circle . Its in Effects &gt; Distort and transform &gt; Zig Zag . Make sure the Preview box is checked , and start tinkering with values until you get a satisfying burst . Ive used - an absolute value of 2.5 ? for the size , and 50 ridges per segment . I also chose smooth points versus corners , as it gives me a softer , more worn look . <p> As you can see , the burst is way too wide right now . A little bit of resizing from the center , and were good to go ( hold SHIFT + ALT while dragging one of the corners of the bounding box inwards ) . You could also make your burst around 12 ? wide right away . <p> And our background is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Copying from the vector packs <p> Now that we have our background , its time to grab the elements well be needing for the rest of the poster . I have the following : <p> You should note that you do n't  have to use these elements for your poster design . It would be absolutely acceptable to grab some other vector elements , or to make your own , to follow along with this tutorial . <p> As you can see , there are some things we wo n't need ( the hands of the zombies , the scrolls and supporting elements of the " sexy " witch , etc ) . Let 's go ahead and delete these . Ungroup , use the direct selection tool if needed ( A ) , select the parts we do n't  need , and here 's the result : <h> Preparing the portraits and the wolf ornament <p> I 'm going to walk you through preparing the first portrait . The process will be the same for the three other ones . Let 's prepare the top left one . <p> You could ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification is to have the four surrounding portraits toned down in terms of colors . This will let the center piece have much more visual impact . <p> First , we need a black circle we can put in the background . The head of the zombie is 2 ? tall , so I made my circle 2.5 ? in diameter . <p> If we look at the finished product , the circle has a lighter ( #232323 ) - stroke . It also crops the portrait closer . The first thing Ive done is to align the stroke of the circle to the inside , and to thicken it to 10 points . I 've then resized the circle closer to the top of the head . So close in fact , that some of the hair goes over the edge of the circle . <p> Next , and in order to simplify the recoloring process , I 've actually used the Pathfinder to merge the head together . We could keep it un-merged , but it would make the process even longer , to figure out all the paths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungroup the head , and start selecting the shapes to switch them either to black for the dark parts of the face ( #000000 ) , or to dark gray ( #222222 ) . It will take a few minutes , but its going to be worth it ! As part of the recoloring process , I 've also recreated the pupils in the eyes with two circles . This is because the original ones are half-circles , that get deformed during the merging process anyways . Once the coloring is done , its time to group the head back together . <p> - - - <p> Time to clip the head within the frame we created . Unlock the background stroked circle , and make a copy of it . Then proceed to paste it in front ( CTRL/CMD + F ) of the original circle . Then go to Object &gt; Expand appearance . Ungroup the result . This will allow us to select and use the inner circle as a clipping mask for the portrait . Once you 've applied the clipping mask , the portrait is almost done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use elements from the wolf ornament to pimp the portrait frame a little . Following a similar process to the zombie head itself , well be ungrouping the ornament , eliminating the parts we do n't  want , recolorizing it , and applying it to the top and side edges . After that , well be applying a stroke to all of that , to help it standing from the grunge texture of the background . See the process in pictures in pictures below : <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <p> There 's one thing that did n't  work according to plan , and it was in the next to last step . When offsetting the path of the copy ( Object &gt; Path &gt; Offset path ) , the black stroke around the ornate elements was just too much . So I used my direct selection tool to delete the extra elements around them , to make it visually lighter . <p> Following a similar process , you can prepare the three other portraits . Or , you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head clipping group is , and just swap the head out for the other portraits , so you do n't  have to recreate the circle and the other elements each time . This is done by simply dragging the layers in the appropriate order and within the right groups via the layer palette . <p> - - - - <p> In order to avoid having to recreate the frame around the head , I simply flipped it using the Transform menu available when right-clicking ( Transform &gt; Reflect ) . Below are a few shots of going through the remaining two portraits , as well as the wolf ornament . <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <p> Phew , that took its sweet time . Time to get the center diamond shape prepared . <h> The diamond <p> To create the " petals " , well be using two overlapping circles and a bit of Pathfinder magic . Well then proceed to trace the diamond shape , using our smart guides ( View &gt; Smart guides ) to align its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top and bottom " petal " , and its side extremities to the center of the horizontal petal line , and to the edge of the diagonal petal . I promise this makes sense in the images below ( you 'll be able to see my values for size , stroke thickness , etc. , in them too ) . <p> After some trickery with strokes and expanded appearances , we can recreate the same type of effect as in the original piece . It has a green outer stroke ( #60806b ) , which also seems to merge with the petals , an inner black stroke , and - - - - <h> Adding texture to the diamond <p> The orange part of the diamond features the hand-drawn snake skin texture that 's available in the vector texture pack . Well simply add this texture at the top of the diamond itself , and use a copy of the diamond path as a clipping mask . In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the diamond shape will be our big , central element in the poster . So if we just size the texture to cover the diamond , itll be very big once blown up to its appropriate final size . I 'd suggest making a collage of a couple of duplicates of the texture for a better effect . You should also consider making a couple of duplicates , then reverse the source texture to finish the texturing . This will make it look less uniform . <p> Because the diamond has a stroke aligned on the inside , well need to expand the copy , merge it to subtract the black outline from the orange diamond , ungroup the result , and delete the black outline before being able to use it as a clipping mask . Look at the image sequence below for the step by step actions Ive taken . <p> - - - - - - - - - - <h> Colorizing and including the witch in the diamond <p> The process to colorize the witch is very similar to the one used for the portraits : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , etc . My goal is to keep the color palette to a minimum overall , so I 've only introduced one more color , a dark green for the skins shadows ( #44594a ) . I 'm reusing the snake skins bright orange for her pupils and teeth . The lighter parts of her collar are that dark gray used for the portraits . I 've also left the crystal ball as is , as I want to keep its transparency effects intact . <p> - - - <p> After making sure that my witch is placed above the diamonds layer , I just placed it on top , and decided to size it to obtain a similar crop to our original piece . The hands will be cropped by the lower edges of the diamond , and the head of the witch will come pretty close to the top edges . The cool thing is that you can move the hands apart if needed to fill the frame better , which I 've done . After placing the witch , I just made a quick copy of the snake skin texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the final touches : the bats and birds . These were simply placed , duplicated and mirrored , and centered . I then colored them black for a higher contrast against that orange background . <p> After that assembling , I just created a copy of the diamond , witch , birds , and bats , and placed it in its own layer atop of everything else in the poster frame . <p> - - - - - - - - - - - <p> Phew , were done with the bulk of this tutorial here . Now , onto the type ! <h> Step four : type elements <p> There 's not too much type on this poster . Each actor portrait features the name and role . There 's a two part sub-header above the diamond . Finally , the main title is at the bottom of the diamond. - The typefaces that have been used are Hitchcock , Cooper Black Std , and Coop from House Industries . <p> The actor name and role are very straight forward . Two different sizes of text in a lighter gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and done . <p> - <p> The sub-headers ( " What is she hiding ? " and " What is her secret ? " ) are also quite easy . Theyre written using the Hitchcock typeface . The trick with these is to use the Flag mode in the Warp filter ( Effect &gt; Warp &gt; Flag ) . Were also going to use filler characters ( I 'm using the underscore , but whatever works , as they 're going to be deleted ) to fine tune the curve were giving the text . <p> There 's also a " shadow " effect with it . I 've obtained it by simply duplicating my text group , and offsetting the lower group by eight arrow taps down , and eight arrow taps to the right . <p> The process is identical for the second sub-header , except that its aligned to the right , and that the text offsetting is also reversed to the left . See the image sequence below for the various values Ive used . <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It features complex layering , and a full shape outline . <p> There are three layers : orange , black , and green . The key to the effect is to offset the black layer less than the green one to get the uniform look . In order to obtain the full shape outline , were going to merge a copy of all the layers , place it in the back , and either add a stroke to it or use the offset path function . I personally prefer offset path , so that 's what I 'll show you . Its all written in Coop Bold , and were using the Flag filter again ( but at 15% this time ) . The top line is sized at 200 points , the bottom at 250 points . The line height is at 225 points . <p> Along the way , I also realized that beefing up some of the shapes by adding a stroke to give them more weight and smooth the overall visual balance helped . The black layer of text , the green layer of text , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . In some cases , - some of the letter shapes needed to be - - - <p> And now that that 's done , we can say its over ! <h> Bonus ! Step five : fake folds <p> To finish things off , we can add a fake folds vector element on top of everything . A long time ago , I scanned in that folded/scratched paper texture . After placing it in Ai , I live-traced it and got the following vector element : <p> You just have to place that element in a new layer above your poster , drop its opacity to 50% , and you 've got yourself fake folds !

@@98562234 @2762234/ <h> Distress type by hand in Photoshop <p> We put a lot of energy into distressing , aging , texturizing , and simulating letterpress techniques with digital type . There are a lot of cool techniques out there . So here I am , sharing yet another one that 's really good for distressing specific parts of letters that are subject to more wear &amp; tear . <p> Well be using Photoshop and digging into layer masks &amp; scatter brushes . <p> But first , let me show you an example of what were trying to achieve . <p> Okay , so a couple of things about the way this type looks that I cant achieve using regular techniques : <p> The distressing is not even . This is not just noise or a texture overlay . <p> The outlines are not straight . Actual distortion of the letterform edge , from peeling , erosion , ink bleed , or whatever . <p> Certain parts of the letter seem more vulnerable to wear &amp; tear . This makes sense I guess . <p> Now let 's do some standard pre-grunge type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutorial . Blur the rasterized text by 1px . Now use smart sharpen with a 0.8px radius and at 140% . Remember these blur and sharpen numbers will depend on the size / resolution of your document . <p> Now let 's distort the edges of the text a little bit . Go to **27;323;TOOLONG , and choose a small ripple with a 22% amount . The edges should ever so slightly ripple . Heres what mine looks like now : <h> Step 2 : Make a grunge scatter brush <p> This is the brush well be using to paint away distressing on the type . <p> Open up your brush panel and check " Shape Dynamics " , " Scattering " , " Noise " , and " Smoothing " . This is gon na be a nasty brush ! Push the sliders for Size Jitter ( in Shape Dynamics ) and Scatter up &amp; down until you get a brush preview similar to the one you see here . <p> I generally like to keep my main brush very small &amp; soft , usually between 1-4 pixels and 0% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reset your foreground &amp; background colors to default black &amp; white . This means your brush will be black , which is what we want . <p> If you just swipe the brush around a little bit , you 'll see you 're now " painting noise " . Perfect ! <h> Step 3 : Paint the type mask with the scatter brush <p> Make sure your layer mask is selected , and use your brush tool to paint inside this mask . Black pixels hide the rasterized type layer , and white pixels show it . The mask starts out all white . <p> As you paint in your wear &amp; tear , think about the letters as physical objects . What parts look subject to distressing ? Call to mind rusty old street signs and roadside ice cream shacks . Vary the size of your brush between 1 and 5 pixels . Use larger brushes for the edges of the letters . Use a little more distressing in areas that seem especially rippled . <p> See how the mask Im painting looks noisy , like the brush preview above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressing that suits you . I tend to prefer very mild distressing . Just enough to get the lookers subconscious to think " not digital " . Be sure to make each letter different . Thats kind of the whole idea of this approach : more custom than a distressed font . <p> Cool , huh ? ! Once you do it a few times , this technique is n't much harder than overlaying a texture and it looks a lot better to me . <p> Were basically done here , but I 'll add in a paper texture to make our image more closely match the " SHHH " image . <p> That 's it ! Thanks for reading this quick tip , and let me know if you have ideas to take the technique further . 17223 @qwx877223 
@@98562237 @2762237/ <h> 7 Side Income Strategies for Designers <p> I 've seen some posts recently about how designers can make extra money online . Too often those posts are filled with crowdsourcing or design contest websites . Sure , you can submit a design to Threadless and maybe win some money or you could compete with thousands of designers to MAYBE get paid as a logo designer , but that 's unreliable and considered spec work . We do n't  want that . <p> If you 're a designer , you 're probably a creative thinker . You need to get out of your mindset that you can just sign up for something and start generating a passive income . It does n't  work that way . You cant just crap out designs and sell them as stock either , that wo n't work . Maybe it did in 2005-2006 but recently the stock market is over-saturated . That said , its still possible to make some good money selling stock , you just need to think about it differently . <p> I 'm going to talk about fresh methods that forward-thinking designers are using to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Every designer has them and you should get on it . <h> 1 . Selling Posters and T-Shirts <p> Its common these days for designers to have an online store selling their posters , t-shirts , stickers , buttons , etc . Where I come from , designers treat themselves a lot like musicians . Here you are making art and at the same time you have your own swag to go with it . While stickers and buttons are cheap items to get produced , posters and t-shirts tend to be cost-prohibitive for many designers . Fortunately sites like Society6 and Imagekind print your work only when customers order your design . While the profits are thin here , you do n't  need to pay up front for a large batch of products . <p> Become a poster artist or start a clothing line . <p> If you 're good , you might see a good business coming from your poster work . Get yourself featured on OMG Posters or Laughing Squid and you can expect to see some sales . And if you 're noticing a lot of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about starting their own clothing line . Their side project becomes a little bit more serious . Brandon Herbel of Make Believe Clothing is an example . If starting a line is something you 've considered , you might want to check out the book I wrote on the subject . <h> 2 . Selling Digital Files <p> If it can be downloaded , it can be sold . <p> Let 's get this out of the way . You are really leaving money on the table here . If you can make an icon , illustration , or create a cool effect in Photoshop , you can sell that sucker online . People buy it . I 'm 30 years old with 6 professional years of experience and a big enough ego that makes me think I should draw everything by hand . But I would still buy stock or some sort of time-saver or shortcut if its going to help me . Stock vectors , textures , fonts , layer styles , actions , themes , templates , frameworks , ebooks , tutorials those are all sellable assets . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not that hard tech-wise . <p> So how do you sell it ? You can either join a marketplace like iStockPhoto , Shutterstock , or Graphic River or you can sell it on your own site . Joining a marketplace offers you a built in customer base and all the technology for purchasing and downloading is in place . Just know that the website will either cost a monthly fee or will take some percentage of your sales . <p> Some good news ! We are redesigning the Arsenal and will be allowing other designers to sell their digital products in our store ! - However , its not an open marketplace . You must apply to become an Arsenal Artist and we have pretty high standards for what we will accept . Quality over quantity . If you are interested in making money as an Arsenal Artist , please email me with a link to your portfolio and ideally some products you already have made . You can earn a decent side income here too . <p> If you sell digital products on your own site , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself and figure out the technology to sell the products . But that 's not much of a barrier anymore . Using a service like eJunkie or Pulley is an easy way to do this . Most shopping cart or ecommerce packages support selling downloadable products . So the technology part should n't be holding you back . <p> Once you 're ready to sell , what ARE you going to sell ? What kind of products actually make money ? From our experience selling stock art and design files on our own website Arsenal , is that vectors and templates sell very well . But there are TONS of options for designers looking for clip art or stock . How are yours better ? How are they different ? You should have some foresight into what YOU like to use in your designs so chances are other people share your taste . Make stuff for your friends and your peers . What kind of solutions can you create for common design problems ? What effects do you consistently use in your work that you could simplify and sell as a Layer Style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option . Sites like ThemeForest have allowed authors to make over seven-figures- selling their own WordPress themes . Crazy ! If you design solutions based around WordPress for your clients , chances are you 've streamlined your process by perhaps building off a base-theme or creating common elements that you reuse for new projects . Nobody likes reinventing the wheel . I 'm sure you 've purchased a plugin or bought a Premium theme from places like WooThemes or StudioPress so why not start offering your own ? If they can do it , why not you ? <p> How versatile are your products in other peoples designs ? <p> One tip , the more versatile your products the better . For example , a stock illustration of something very specific wont sell as well as a halftone pattern or a simple distress texture . Also educational products sell very well like eBooks or Video Tutorials but creating those is a lot harder and takes much more time . Which leads me to my next point , learn to write . <h> 3 . Hone Your Writing Skills <p> More and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the pack . You may be a REALLY GOOD logo designer , but its only a matter of time before someone else becomes just as good or better . One way to enhance your reputation is to blog . Ok , no brainer , we all know that but how do you become known as the best designer ? Not just by designing but by talking about design . You should talk about typography or merchandise design . Make bold claims and back them up . Step up your game and figure out how to be a good writer . You do n't  need to go as far as Austin Kleon and become a full fledged author . But if you do , more power to you ! Your words can exist only on the web and that 's ok . <p> Take your blog seriously . <p> Most designers have a website . Most designers have some sort of blog whether it be WordPress , Tumblr , etc . Chances are its pretty stale and fairly self promotional . Maybe you write the occasional news update here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a project you are working on . Those are fine , but if you want to build a side income , try treating your blog a bit more like a business . <p> Turn your blog into a resource . Write thoughtful articles about things you are interested in and keep content fresh and current . Your goal is to drive traffic to your site and to your products . Hopefully you 'll also convert some of those into clients . Create content that starts conversations . <p> Write articles for other blogs . <p> If you start building up a track record of writing good content , you can start asking your favorite design blogs for author positions on their site . Have an awesome article you wrote ? Instead of publishing it on your own blog , try sending it to some more popular blogs and seeing if theyll pay you for it . You wo n't necessarily make a ton of money with just one guest post , but you could drive some extra traffic to your own blog and products this way . If nobody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Writing a book is easier than ever . <p> The problem with blog articles is that they 're typically free . People do n't  want to pay to read a blog article . But if you can write a blog article , you can write a book . Lots of times a book is just a handful of good articles sandwiched in between two covers or heck , simply compressed into a PDF and hosted on your site . <p> Sometimes your awesome article is too long and would fit better in ebook form . You 're a designer so you can probably make something classy in InDesign so your ebook does n't  look like the crappy spambooks out there giving ebooks a bad name . Look what the folks at A List Apart have done , theyve got a whole series of awesome books . I bet you they sell like hotcakes . <p> And if you want to get into physical production , you do n't  NEED a publisher . That 's what I did with Threads Not Dead . I set out to write the ultimate guide for t-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts , I needed to do it myself . I designed it nicely , formatted it for iOS and Kindle devices and hosted it on my website . I wanted to sell it for $50 so I recorded my own audiobook and bundled it with some other digital files . I had a whopper of a product all of a sudden . Something that felt meaty and substantial , but all in digital form . <p> The nicely designed ebook created high demand for a printed hardcover book so I sought out publishers but nothing came out of it . As a result I self published using a site called Lightning Source . If you want to know more about this , I wrote a much more in-depth article about how I made my first book . When the hardcover edition came out , I even held a launch party at a local indie book store so it felt official . Speaking of launch parties , let 's talk about how events can act as another revenue source for the not-so ordinary designer . <h> 4 . Host an Event <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take a step back and think about experiences people have . What are some of your best experiences ? Chances are you 'll remember events you attended or places you 've gone . People you 've met at those places . Want people to know more about your design studio ? Why not host a party at your office ? We did that with our Open Houses- for Go Media . While they were free to attend , we were able to sell merch and we got some new customers out of the deal . We also got to design really cool invitations ! <p> But what if you could charge admission to your event ? Or sell drinks ? Start your own indie conference for example . We did that with Weapons of Mass Creation Fest and others are doing it like Columbus Creative or Brooklyn Beta . Or put on a show with your favorite bands and design the poster and promotional materials for it . When Bill and Wilson were starting Go Media , they threw big events with hundreds of DJs during the winter when business was slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Have something you want to support or change ? Get people together in person to support or promote the idea . Create an experience around this . We wanted to help promote the cool indie spots around Cleveland while at the same time increasing Go Medias awareness in the city . So we started On the Map . We made short documentary vignettes on a bunch of businesses we liked around town and held an event to show them off . We could have charged admission or sold drinks , but we chose not to for that particular event . <p> Sell your stuff at other events. - <p> If hosting your own event is outside your comfort zone , try getting involved with design conferences , indie craft fairs , concerts , etc . Apply to be a vendor so you can set up a booth or table and you can sell posters , t-shirts , stickers , buttons , books , and other merch . What 's that ? You do n't  have those things to sell ? What are you waiting for , get on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only get your name out there but give you a little extra cash is to hold a workshop . Have it at your studio or at a local university . Make a one-day workshop on a technique or idea you know a lot about . Sell tickets to the workshop ( maybe with Eventbrite ) and make it limited so not everyone can get in . This should pay for your time and effort and also it will help you look like an expert while making new contacts at the same time . It will also allow you to promote your own work or other side projects if you want . But really , you 're selling the opportunity- for others to learn from an experienced designer like you . Why not ? <h> 5 . Ads and Affiliate Marketing <p> If you 've got any decent public profile or traffic to your website , you can sell ads on it . In fact that 's how most online bloggers and content creators make their money . You can quickly copy and paste a snippet of code to display ads from Google AdSense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty passive . If you have an email newsletter , you can sell an ad on it . If you 've got a podcast , sell a sponsorship spot or two . Heck , you could even get paid to tweet things for people . Speaking of tweeting for people , there 's a cool service called Headliner.fm that is basically a barter system for sharing . The more you share others stuff the more people share your stuff . <p> Affiliate Marketing <p> This one kind of has a bad rap . Just the term affiliate marketing sounds shady . But really , if you can buy a product online , there 's probably a way for you to promote it and make some extra cash . You do n't  have to sign up for big sites like Pepperjam or Commission Junction to do it either , but those are options . - You would be able to look for products you do n't  mind mentioning on your blog and youd link to them hoping your visitors would buy . For every sale you get a commission . Its pretty simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you do it right you can really earn a big income . And by doing it right I mean dedicate a ton of your time to it like its your full time job . You probably would rather be designing . <p> I would just start paying attention to stuff you buy online and services you pay for . Chances are they have an affiliate program . In fact , you can make money by promoting my own bookThreads Not Dead and get a good commission every time someone buys it . Most authors who sell ebooks probably have an affiliate program . You can always just look at Payloadz or eJunkie directories to see what 's up . <h> 6 . Make a Niche Website <p> I 've covered most of the easy stuff for earning a side income as a designer . This one is a little more complicated but its not so bad if you 're crafty . What I mean by niche website is just a small , unique , clever site that does one simple thing . Jessica Hische is the queen of this . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a beautifully designed website . For example , Should I Work For Free ? , Mom This is How Twitter Works , Inker Linker , Do n't  Fear the Internet , and many more . Find a - need and fill it . You 're a designer , you can solve these kinds of problems right ? Make it look nice and make sure you have a way to monetize them . You 're either going to use them to drive traffic to your main site , sell ads on the site so when it goes viral you can get some ROI , or sell a digital product ( like a single ebook ) on that site . We did this with our site ShirtMockup.com . In fact , Arsenal was started that way in 2006 ! <p> Leo Babauta of Zen Habits has small niche sites for just about every idea he has . Its like he turns each idea he has into a brand and monetizes it beautifully . He takes his blog posts and turns them into ebooks . He turns on his simple webcam and chats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns the whole idea into a course that you can pay for . Most of this " course " is set up in advance as separate blog posts and videos that are password protected with some live chat sessions here and there . I know because I took his Clutter Free course and its genius . While he talks about minimalism , you can talk about designery ( or otherwise ) stuff . <p> Another option is to jump on a trend . Designer Rob Dobi is my favorite example of this . In 2005 when NewsCorp bought Myspace.com for millions , Rob quickly created a niche site called myspacesoldout.com ( not available anymore ) which featured a single illustration of the founder Tom holding big bags of money with a snarky quote . ( I was able to find this ) After a few seconds it redirected the visitors back to his clothing line . Because of the timing and cleverness , the site went viral and he was able to drive quite a bit of traffic to his clothing company . He s also responsible for Your Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rob Dobi . He jumped on the opportunity beautifully . <h> 7 . Public Speaking and Teaching <p> Another way designers make a side income is from getting up in front of people and educating them . Or entertaining , whichever you prefer haha . While speaking at conferences wont necessarily get you rich , you can at least afford to travel to different places , network and meet lots of new people and of course promote whatever new thing you 've got going on at the time . Designers actually DO NT make a lot of money from speaking , they do it because of the other benefits like increased exposure , the opportunity to broaden their expertise , etc . Speaking opens up doors that sitting in your room designing all day does not . <p> One of those doors is teaching , which actually WILL get you paid . Unless you become a professional public speaker , which let 's be honest , you are n't  going to do that , speaking can parlay into working at your local university as a part time professor . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Sharing is Caring ( and lucrative ) <p> While not everyone is cut out to teach or speak in public there is one thing that most of these side-income-generating ideas have in common : Sharing knowledge and resources . If you can get over your fear that people will steal your ideas or take your resources and become a better designer than you , you will have overcome a major obstacle that prohibits designers from earning reliable side incomes . There is money out there with your name on it if you apply the techniques I talked about above . Seriously . If you have any other ideas , share them in the comments and let 's talk about this ! 17224 @qwx877224

Combination of linear and radial gradients can be very useful for achieving nice results in creating realistic vector illustrations . here 's a preview of the final illustration : <h> Step 1 : Creating the shape of the shoe <p> First we 'll try to create the shape of the shoe . From the Tool panel grab the Pen tool ( P ) and draw the path as it is shown on the picture below . You can use a tablet if you have one ( it might be much easier to draw with actual pen ) . If its hard for you to draw it all at once , try to break it into few paths you will put together in order to get the shape of the shoe . <p> Now we have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Select endpoints and under right click select Join . <p> Now we need the upper part . Using the same technique try to draw the shape of upper part of the shoe . <p> Next step is making a sole . Grab the Pen tool ( P ) and draw the path like you see on the picture below . <p> Select the green part of the shoe and the path and under the Pathfinder panel hit Divide button <p> Ungroup it by selecting Ungroup under right click or simple by hitting Shift+Ctrl+G on your keyboard . Set the Fill color for lower part of the shoe to dark red for now . <p> Select the green part of the shoe and hit Ctrl+C and then Ctrl+F . This will copy and paste-in-front the object . Now we have two pieces of the green part . Soon you will see why . Take again a Pen tool ( P ) and draw the line like you see on the next picture . <p> Select the green part of the shoe and the yellow line and under the Pathfinder panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete a bigger part . Change the color of the smaller part to white . You should end up with something like this . <p> We are going to add gradients to the green part of the shoe . <p> Select the white part of the shoe and under Object&gt;Path&gt;Offset path set the Offset to -3 pt . Change the color of the new object to yellow just to make it visible . Now using the arrow keys on the keyboard nudge the yellow object to the left . <p> Copy and then paste-in-front ( ctrl+C then ctrl+F ) the white part . Holding the Shift key on the keyboard select both , yellow and the white part , and under Pathfinder panel hit Intersect . <p> Remove the Fill color for the new object we 've just made and add the stroke . Using Direct Selection Tool ( A ) remove the anchor points on the left side of the stroke line . <p> Select the stroke line and under Object select Expand . After that change the color to dark red . This is what you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's create a few shadows . That will make our shoe look more realistic . <p> Select the green part of the shoe and make a copy of it ( Ctrl+C , Ctrl+F ) . Do the same thing for the upper red part of the shoe . With the upper part of the shoe still selected , using the arrow key on the keyboard nudge it a few times downwards . Then holding Shift on your keyboard , select the green part of the shoe and under the Pathfinder panel hit Intersect button . <p> Change the color of that part to dark green and send it behind upper red part of the shoe using right **27;352;TOOLONG Backward ( Ctrl+ ) <p> This is how your shadow should look like . <p> We will do the same thing for the white part of the shoe , to make it look like its attached to the shoe . Select the white shape and hit the Ctrl+C , Ctrl+F on the keyboard . Set the Fill color of the copy to dark green . Using Arrow keys on the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right click select Arrange&gt;Backwards ( Ctrl+ ) . It looks like the white part of the shoe is casting the shadow on the green part . Change the Fill color of the lower part of the shoe to dark green , a little bit darker then the shoe . <p> Let 's create few more shadows . Just imagine a source of light above the shoe . According to that light try to create some interesting shadows . Shadows are actually one of the most important things in illustrations . They simulate a nice realistic look . <p> Select now everything except upper red part and its shadow . Copy and paste-in-front the selected objects , and under the Pathfinder panel hit Unit button . <p> Now duplicate the new object we 've just created and change the Fill color to blue ( just to make everything more visible ) . Move it to the left a little bit . Grab the lower right point of the selection box and rotate it a little bit . Like its shown on the picture below . <p> Holding the Shift key on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathfinder panel hit Minus Front . You will end up with funny parts of the shoe . <p> Select that funny shape and ungroup it ( Shift+Ctrl+G ) . You can delete all parts except the one we will be using for the shadow . See the picture below . <p> Duplicate the new shape we 've just created , duplicate the lower red part of the shoe . Select both parts and hit the Intersect button under the Pathfinder panel . <p> Change the color of the new shape to dark green ( darker than lower part of the shoe ) . Do the same for the bigger part of the shape . This is how the shadow should look now . <p> Using the same technique make a few more shadows on the shoe . Some of them should have a lighter color to look like a highlight . Remember the source of the light right above the shoe we talked about in previous steps ? That light is very important . According to that light you can create different highlights and shadows . I will select all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the idea how to do that . <h> Step 3 : Creating the four leaf clover <p> Let 's create a four leaf clover for luck . <p> We 'll start with a circle . Grab the Ellipse Tool ( L ) from a Tool panel and create two overlapping circles . Select them both and under the Pathfinder panel hit the Unite button . <p> Grab a Direct Selection Tool ( A ) from a Tool panel and select lower anchor point and holding the Shift key on the keyboard drag it downwards like shown on the picture below . <p> Select Convert Anchor point Tool ( Shift+C ) and click on the same lower anchor point . You should end up with something like this . <p> With Delete Anchor Point Tool ( - ) remove two anchor points on the both sides of the object . That will make a shape of the heart we can use to complete the four leaf clover . <p> Now we have to add a golden linear gradient to the heart shape . <p> Select the heart shape and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fill color to green . Grab the Line Tool ( / ) from the Tool panel and draw the vertical line . Select the green part of the shape and the vertical line and hit the Divide button under the Pathfinder panel . <p> Ungroup the shape ( Shift+Ctrl+G ) and apply the radial gradient to both parts . <p> Select the heart shape with the golden part and group it ( Ctrl+G ) . Grab the Rotate Tool ( R ) from the Tool panel . Holding the Alt key on the keyboard click on the lower anchor point of the the golden heart shape and set the Angle in the Rotate box to 90 . Hit the copy button . <p> Repeat that action by hitting the shortcut Ctrl+D . To complete the clover hit that shortcut two more times . <p> You can also select all golden parts and unite them under the Pathfinder panel . After that offset the path for about 3 pixels and change the direction of the gradient . You should end up with something like this . <p> Place the four leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow . Make a copy of the clover ( Ctrl+C , Ctrl+F ) . Ungroup the copy ( Shift+Ctrl+G ) and unite all the paths under Pathfinder panel ( by hitting Unite button ) . Change the Fill color to dark green and send it backwards under right click&gt;Arrange&gt;Send Backward ( Ctrl+ ) . Using the Arrow key on the keyboard nudge the shadow 1 pixel to the right and 1 pixel downwards . <h> Step 4 : Creating the shoelaces <p> Let 's make shoelaces for the shoe . Grab a Pen Tool ( P ) and draw a line like this . <p> Under stroke panel set the thickness of the line to 5 and select Round cap to make end of the line rounded . <p> Expand it under Object&gt;Expand , make a few copies and place them like shoelaces . <p> Select the white and the green part of the shoe ( use Shift key on your keyboard to do that ) and unite them using the Unite button under the Pathfinder panel . Make 6 copies of that shape ( because we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( using Intersect button in Pathfinder panel ) . After cropping add radial gradient to our shoelaces . <p> Group all of the parts together , make a copy ( Ctrl+C , Crtrl+F ) , change the color to dark green , nudge it downwards for a pixel or two and send it behind white part of the shoe . <p> Repeat the previous step , but this time we will set the Fill color to gray , nudge it for the same amount like in previous step and send it underneath the shoelaces . Crop the shadow using the white part of the shoe . This might look like lots of work , but I think it is much better to do that then to make just one shadow to set the color to black and then to lower opacity . I think we can make the artwork look more realistic . <p> If you are not too lazy do it one more time to create the shadow for the thin red line . Repeat the previous step and set the color for tiny parts to dark red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one copy of the shadow for the shoelaces . Each part of the shoelaces select with one copy of the red line and using Intersect button under the Pathfinder panel make a crop which will be a small shadow casting on the red line . <p> Now we need holes for the shoelaces . With Ellipse Tool ( L ) make few circles and place them to look like holes for shoelaces . Set the color to dark green . <p> Holding the Shift key on the keyboard select all circles and under Object&gt;Path&gt;Offset Path set Offset to 1 pt . <p> With new circles still selected remove the Fill color for them and set the stroke to 1 . <p> Expand them under Object&gt;Expand and use a golden gradient as a Fill color . Make a copy of the golden rings , nudge them in the same directions as other shadows , change their color to dark green , and send them backwards ( right click&gt;Arrange&gt;Send Backward ) . <p> Let 's select lower green part of the shoe . Under Object&gt;Path&gt;Offset Path set the Offset to -5 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path we have now longer than we actually need . Remove the Fill color and leave just the stroke . <p> Set the stroke to 1 and check the box for Dashed Line and set the dash to 4 pt . <p> Expand the dashed line , apply the golden gradient we 've used in previous steps . If there is anything overlapping the shoe just erase it with Eraser tool . <h> Step 5 : Creating the pattern <p> For the upper part of the shoe we will create a pattern . From the Tool panel grab the Rectangle tool ( M ) and create two rectangles like it is shown on the picture below . <p> Select both rectangles and under the Object , Blend select Make . <p> In the Blend option box set the spacing to Specified Steps to 20 .

Since I was a little kid , I loved to draw ; at first I started drawing all kind of things that I saw in the books usually animals were my favorite subjects ! After a while I started to create original drawings . <p> A few years ago I discovered the digital drawing and was excited to see the simplicity of using the graphic tablet . Once again I was combining those 2 ways of drawing : copying and using the imagination . <p> I recommend to use this technique of copying something when it helps you to save some time while you 're working , or to achieve better quality . For example , if you need to draw a hand in a specific position , and you 're not so sure you can draw it from imagination , my advice is to take a camera and capture the position &amp; form of a hand . Its useful to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand easily . <p> Here is an example of some wings I drew using this technique . These wings are yours to use in your designs royalty free and can be purchased from the Go Media Arsenal . <p> In this tutorial I want to show you how I draw a hand using a picture plus some imagination , and make it all look like a classic pencil drawing ! <p> I use this kind of drawing to give to the design an artistic look . In my opinion the hand drawing effect looks great applied on anything from animals to gothic ornaments . Another advantage of this style is that you can make great artwork using only one color . <h> Let 's get Drawing ! <p> Step 1 : Find a Reference The first step is to take a picture of a hand , you can use the same picture that I used in this tutorial , see the download link below ; it already has the opacity reduced to 30 % so it is exactly like the one i started here with . <p> Step 2 : Sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will adjust on the picture . In this case I 've increased the size of the fingernails , and made a a white area in the middle of the hand where I want to put a small brain . Just make a place holder for now , but make it a little smaller than the actual brain will be so you can draw the hand tightly around the brain without gaps . You can draw some drips too . You can put them between the fingers , and on one side of the hand , like i did . You will sketch all this on a separate layer . <p> All that being set up , you should start drawing the hand . <p> Step 3 : Build the Outline The file size that I us is somewhere between 50/ 50 cm and 70/70 cm at 300 DPI . Get your graphics tablet set up &amp; operating properly . Take a look at the settings that I usually use for the brush . These settings work well for the file size were using ; I recommend that you try them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color ( something like 3f311d ) , not black . Black has a too strong of a contrast with the white background which gives your linework an overly sharp appearance . So my advice is to use those colors for the brush , but if you want to use black for the brush you can change the background color to a light cream or gray and everything will look OK . <p> Start by making a new layer where you will draw the outline , it should look like this . You will also draw the lines that you consider will help you in the next step ; ( the first level of shades ) , so look for thicker and darker lines from the picture and draw them too . <p> After the outline is done you can start making the shades , but first I made those red dashed lines which follow the shapes of the hand . You should always have lines like this in your mind when you start hachuring , so you can represent the volume in the right way . <p> Another thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust the contrast of the picture until it will look like this . This will help you to see where to put the darker and most important shades . You will see that after this first level of shades are made , the subject will start to look good . <p> Step 4 : Begin Hachuring Now , when you start the hachure , do n't forget to make a new layer . I recommend that you always make a new layer when you do something new or different on your design and you 're not sure how it will going to look . <p> We all know how bad is to work on a wrong layer . : ) <p> Now your drawing should look like this . The hatchring it 's made from overlapping lines in different directions and different lengths , so where you want to make a darker area you will draw thicker lines . In lighter areas you will leave only a few lines and you can make them thinner for an even lighter tone . <p> The hachure should look something like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker then the rest . That 's because of the multiple overlapped lines . If you will make it smaller you will see the effect that I want to achieve ; and that 's to look like a textured gradient . <p> Step 5 : Add Details After you have finished with the darker tones , make another layer , and start working on the details . You should not make too many details , or at least not small ones because you will not be able to see them when the drawing will be printed . <p> To assure that you have enough details you have have to look at the drawing at approximately the size that it will be printed and see how it looks . Or better yet you can print it on a paper at the real size so you can have a preview of the final work . <h> Drawing the Brain <p> Now in case you are not used to draw brains , find a picture of one and try to imitate the texture that you see on it . The most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source when you make all the ' wrinkles ' ' . This will actually make it to look like a brain . <p> Now its time to merge the layers you created while drawing the hand . Once merged , apply a color overlay effect to give it a red color . Now you can see the parts from the hand that you will have to erase , parts where the brain and the hand are overlapping . <p> Now you will understand better why I told you earlier to make the placeholder for the brain smaller than the brain will be . It 's easier to erase what 's behind the brain . <p> Now you can delete the color overlay effect and get rid of the unwanted layers , if you have some . If you think that you may want to color the drawing later , you can keep separate layers for the hand and for the brain . <h> Final Touches <p> Step 6 : Add Extra Shading Finally let 's put some shades around the brain as you think it would reflect on the hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever you put new shading . <p> And now you can merge all the layers together , and you 're done ! <p> You can use this technique for making t-shirt designs , illustrations , posters , you name it . From my experience I can tell you that it will be appreciated very well . <p> Step 7 : Add Texture to the Final Presentation If you want the drawing to have more impact when showed to a client , I recommend you to change the white background to one more ' ' artistic ' ' . Usually I use a combination of different textures and old papers pictures , and it should look like this . <p> Here are some details from the drawing , and some designs that i created using this technique . <h> More Examples of this Technique <p> I hope you liked my tutorial and find it useful , for any other question , do n't hesitate to write here or contact me at whyball@gmail.com .

@@98562249 @2762249/ <h> How to make a vector pattern brush <p> Hey everybody ! I hope the last few weeks have gone well for you whatever that may mean . I hope that you found at least a little time to soak up all the great resources and knowledge being shared around the design blogosphere . Finally I hope you enjoy this little tutorial and share it with your design friends . <p> Were going to make a pattern brush . <p> Were going to start in Illustrator ( I 'm using CS3 ) . <p> I chose to make a wavy line brush because its relatively easy and it teaches the basics of pattern brush construction without a lot of messy details . It also gave me a chance to share another technique involving blend modes and distort filters . <p> So to start off , hit the backslash key or click the line segment tool from your Illustrator Toolbox . Draw a line about 650px wide . Now hit " v " to switch to your selection tool and select the line segment . While holding the ALT key ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment down about 80px . You 'll see that holding the ALT key while dragging makes a copy of the selected object . Now , I hope you did n't  click anything else , because were going to hit CTRL+D to duplicate the last action again . Now you should have three lines nicely spaced on top of each other . <p> Like this : <p> Now were going to make a blend between these three lines . First we need to modify the default blend options . <p> Go to Object&gt;Blend&gt;Blend Options . <p> Change the default setting from " smooth color " to " specified steps " , and then change the number of steps to about 8 . <p> With all three lines selected , hit ALT+CTRL+B , or <p> go to Object&gt;Blend&gt;Make . <p> You should now have 8 lines between each of your original 3 lines . <p> Looking good so far . Let 's give our lines some personality with a distort filter . For this brush I used the Roughen filter . With your lines selected , go to <p> Effect&gt;Distort &amp; Transform&gt;Roughen . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the defaults from " corner " to " smooth " , and decrease the size and detail to 6 and .93 , respectively . The screenshot below shows the effect I got from those settings . Just put in whatever settings look good to you it wo n't prevent you from following the rest of this guide . <p> We 've got a little change of pace coming . Were going to have to move out of Illustrator for a little bit to get this pattern brush well patterning . <p> Open Photoshop and make a new document 2500+2500 pixels . <p> Copy your wavy lines from Illustrator and paste as a smart object into your Photoshop Document . After you paste , hold the shift key and scale the smart object so that it just touches the edge of your document . <p> Photoshops Offset filter shifts the pixels of your image by a certain amount . This is really handy for making edges seamless . <p> Go to **25;381;TOOLONG <p> ( They really hide this super useful filter , huh ) . <p> Since your document is 2500 pixels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , or close to 1250 pixels . Make sure the " wrap around " option is checked . <p> You 'll see the seam right away . It should be just about dead center . This is what we need to fix . <p> Fixing this seam is really the only subjective part of this whole guide . It really helps if you have a Wacom set up . Hit " B " to activate the brush tool . Set it to 100% hardness . Now just use the bracket keys to find increase or decrease the size of the brush until its equal to the thickness of your lines . For me , this was about 4px . Now erase and draw in the lines so that they connect nicely . here 's how mine looked about 1/2 through the fix-up : <p> Keep at it . Try to imitate the movement of the rest of the lines . This will depend on what Roughen settings you chose back in Illustrator . <p> Finally , okay I 'm done . <p> Save your document as a PSD somewhere handy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Were almost there . Let 's get that PSD into our Illustrator document . <p> Go to File&gt;Place <p> and browse to the PSD you saved . In order for this to be vector again we need to autotrace it ( this is why we worked at a nice high resolution while in Photoshop ) . With the PSD selected , go up to the little down triangle beside the Live Trace button and choose " Detailed Illustration " from the list of autotrace presets ( this one almost always works the best for me ) . <p> Sweet ! You probably want to make this thing a lot smaller before you make a brush out of it . So with the selection tool , hold shift and drag inward from a corner to scale it down . <p> Drag the whole object over to your Brushes panel . A new brushes dialog will pop up . Choose " pattern brush " . <p> Now you 'll be faced with a few options . The only one I really changed on this screen was the Colorization method . I changed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting means that the brush will take on the stroke color . <p> Now you 're free to draw away with your new brush ! The best way to test it is to hit L to draw a circle shape and use the brush as the stroke . If you do n't  see any seams it worked ! <p> This method applies to all kinds of pattern brushes . If you want to make a chain pattern brush , just draw one . Then export to Photoshop , use the offset filter and fix the seam . Then back to Illustrator for autotracing and brush-making . <p> Something cool that was not covered in this guide is that pattern brushes have special parts for the beginning , end , and corners of strokes . This is really cool and adds a lot more flexibility . Keep your eye on the Go MediaZine and maybe a future post will cover these parts of a pattern brush . 17223 @qwx877223 
@@98562251 @2762251/ <h> Distressing Techniques in Adobe Illustrator <p> Simon from Studio Ace of Spade here . Jeff Finley asked me to compile a list of some common distressing techniques as a supplement for his eBook " The Designers Guide to the Apparel Industry . " Distressing graphics is a pretty integral part of designing t-shirts . This tutorial will demonstrate three easy to understand and easy to apply- techniques- for adding a distressed or grunge look to a design using Adobe Illustrator . <h> Adobe Illustrator Technique #1 : The Grunge Brush <p> For the first technique , well learn how to take advantage of Illustrators brush tool and of some of the brushes that come bundled with it . Our subject will be a vector of a blimp I created a few weeks ago and used for one of my Studios entries for Signalnoises retro poster competition , " Air traveling " . <p> The Step 1 is easy : open your vector file . <p> Step 2 is easy as well : make sure your vector object or group is expanded . To do this , select all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Windows or Mac box ) , then go to the menu " Object " then " Expand " . You might be prompted to select what you want to be expanded . Check all the boxes . <p> Once this is done , well move to step 3 : select the brush tool and get the brush that interests us . Do n't  forget to de-select your vector art or else you will apply the brush to it . Open the brush panel from the left toolbar ( or with F5 ) , then click on the menu icon at the lower left corner . <p> Step 4 Now , well have to pick a random color that is not used at all in the design element were planning to grunge out . The reason for this is because well use the magic wand tool later to select the brush strokes we are about to make , and we do n't  want anything else but these brush strokes to be selected . Here I picked a really loud blue ( something like #3FE6FF ) . <p> Now its your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple brush strokes in order to cover your vector element . In my case , 2 strokes were enough . <p> Experiment with different thicknesses , placements . You should play with how you position/draw the paths with the brush tool , with the stroke thickness For instance , I was hesitating between a 2 pt. thickness and a 4 pt. one before settling on 3 pt. , because it looked the best . I would also not be afraid of editing the paths afterwards with the direct selection tool ( keyboard shortcut : A ) to modify their directions . You want to cover most of your design , but also make sure that you wo n't go overkill with it . Also , watch how I tried to leave out of the blimp the big chunks at the top left of the top stroke . These would have been over the top in my opinion , and would n't have looked so realistic . <p> Quick tip : to quickly toggle the brush stroke on and off , - switch the stroke color to your background color by tapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , time to move towards step 5 . <p> Here , well expand the brush strokes like that we can merge them with the design using the pathfinder tool . To do so , select your vector object and your brush strokes ( I used CTRL/CMD +A since these are the only things I have in my art board ) . <p> Then , go again to Object &gt; Expand in order to expand everything . <p> Step 6 : the pathfinder . Now comes the time to merge everything . Go to the pathfinder ( Shift + CTRL/CMD + F9 by default in Ai CS3 ) and click the merge option . Depending on the complexity of your design , that can take a few seconds . <p> The 7th and last step is to use the magic wand tool ( shortcut : Y ) to get rid of the blue we do n't  need in our final design . <p> Click anywhere on the blue strokes to select all of them . Delete ( DEL key ) and <p> And its distressed ! Victory ? <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleaned up too . To see them , select everything ( CMD/CTRL +A ) , then use the magic wand once more ( Y ) to click on one of these left over points . Once they 're all selected , you can delete them . <p> And here it is , our distressed blimp . <h> Adobe Illustrator Technique #2 : the grunge vector element <p> The grunge brush technique is easy and convenient ( the brush comes with Illustrator ) , however it might not look very realistic " especially if you have to make the brush really thick , big or to repeat it a lot to cover the design . Real distressing looks more or less random and does n't  repeat itself . <p> For this one , I 'll use a texture of the Destroy I vector pack ( first one of the preview actually ) . Its subtle enough , yet you can duplicate it for more intricate effects ( as will be demonstrated ) . <p> Step 1 : Open the files you will need : the blimp vector and the grunge vector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Go Media Arsenal . <p> Step 2 is similar to what we did previously with the brush strokes : change the color of the grunge vector to a color that has not been used in the element you want to distress . Again , I choose a bright blue . <p> Step 3 is where it becomes fun : its sizing and placement time . I chose to center the vector , then to size it big enough to cover my vector blimp . But then I realized that the single instance of the texture was n't enough distressing for my taste . <p> So what I did as a 4th step was to copy the texture and then paste it in front ( CTRL/CMD +F ) <p> After that , I just had to rotate the top copy a bit to accentuate the grunge feel . I rotated it of 90- for that tutorial , but remember that experimenting is the key and that you should find what suits you . <p> Step 5 : Expand the vector grunge elements ( Object &gt; Expand ) . <p> Step 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Cleaning out . Like earlier , we are going to delete the grunge vector(s) used to distress the blimp in order to keep just the distressed blimp in the final art . <p> ( Do n't  grab that one , go grab the high resolution file , its going to look much better ) <p> Its going to be really simple and share a few common steps with the previous techniques . Our experimentation subject is going to be- this vintage radio vector I did a few weeks ago as part of another entry to Signalnoises retro poster competition . <p> Step 1 : open your file . <p> Step 2 : let 's place ( File &gt; Place ) that grunge texture in our document . The process is really similar to opening the file . <p> Now , our 3rd step is to live trace it . Its going to be easy , as when you place and select the texture , the live trace button appears on the top toolbar of Illustrator . We could use some of the presets , but I believe we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So instead of selecting them , click on Tracing options at the bottom . <p> I always set Path Fitting , Minimum Area and Corner Angle to 1 when using Live Trace . Its supposed to give the most details from the object I 'm using as an input . I also checked Ignore White since I just want the grunge of the texture to come out . Then I also check the Preview box to see what those settings are producing . <p> I bumped the Threshold to 160 in order to get a darker texture ( more pixels are converted to black ) . Once you 're happy with the result , click Trace and do n't  forget to hit the Expand button . 
@@98562255 @2762255/ <h> 10 Mistakes Designers Make When Applying for Jobs <p> Applying for jobs can be a daunting process , but it is important to remember to put your best foot forward when sending out your applications . Employers get tons of submissions every day , so make yours stand out by not making any fatal errors . Read below for the top 10 mistakes designers make when applying for jobs and what employers are looking for in resumes , cover letters , and portfolios : <h> 1. - Sending resumes in . doc instead of . pdf <p> Its surprising how often designers send resumes in the . doc format . Microsoft Word is not the program designers should be using when laying out their resume , and may result in an immediate rejection . We recommend using InDesign or Illustrator to design your resume . Your application is a great chance to show off your design ability so use design programs to layout a beautiful resume . One of things you will often do as- a designer is creating logos , letterheads , and business cards , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to showcase those skills by creating your own brand identity for the documents you send to potential employers . <h> 2. - Sending form cover letters <p> Employers can tell when you have cut and pasted a form cover letter from the web . The jargon is always the same . Your cover letter is your opportunity to show your personality to the company you are applying to , so use the opportunity to demonstrate why you are the best person for the position . Use your own words , not the words of others to illustrate why you are the best candidate for the position . Include ways in which your style blends with theirs or call out specifics about their company like their company culture or artistic style as the reasons why you want the position . Do n't  make it seem like you just want any position. - Show that you want their position because you want nothing more than to work at their company . When you are applying , you are asking to be a part of their team so show you have some team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and care about working there specifically . <h> 3. - Not following instructions/directions <p> Most companies will immediately reject your application if you have not followed the instructions they have outlined in their " help wanted " post or ad . Read the requirements carefully and make sure that you have followed them to a tee and have sent the requisites in the correct format . <h> 4. - Not showing a diversity of work in portfolios <p> Every portfolio should include work in the following categories : branding , illustration , print design/layout , and web design . If you also have work in other categories include those as well , but you 'll want to have at least 2-3 examples within each category listed above . If you are fresh out of school and do n't  have much client work , create spec work to show you have the skills necessary to land the design job you want . If you only show you can illustrate and provide no work that exhibits your skills in designing brand identities , a company will not know you can complete work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack-of-all-trades designer and you can handle any client project that comes your way . <h> 5. - Spelling/Grammatical errors <p> If a potential employer can spot a spelling or grammatical error within seconds of looking at your resume , cover letter , or portfolio then you have n't checked your work . What would happen if you made a spelling error in a clients project and sent it to print ? Who would pay for the mistake ? The answer is probably you or the company you work for . After you have completed your resume , cover letter , and portfolio , send it to friends , family , teachers , etc. and have them check over your work . If an employer can catch the mistake within mere moments of opening your documents , then your friends or family will be able to as well , saving you a potential rejection email for your carelessness . <h> 6. - Not having an online portfolio <p> We live in the digital age and every designer whether you are a web developer or not should have an online portfolio . Sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio site , so take the time to create one before applying for jobs . The best option is to have your own website so you can truly stand out amongst other applicants . <h> 7. - Obviously cutting and pasting from past resumes or cover letters <p> This is an egregious mistake . If your cover letter has 2 different fonts that might also be different sizes , it is obvious to them you cut and pasted and did n't  take the time to consistently format . I know searching for jobs can be a laborious process and many times you are applying for multiple positions at once , but the employer shouldnt know that , all they should see is you are dying to work for their company and want nothing more than to be apart of their team . <h> 8. - Asking potential employers for recommendations or help in job search <p> When you apply for a position and are not awarded the position , you should not ask the employer for recommendations for other companies you should apply for . It is not the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so do n't  ask them for suggestions of their competitors . The web is a great resource to find job openings and design firms in your area . Take the time to look for them and do n't  ask a potential employer to help you . <h> 9. - Not taking your time <p> This has been covered slightly in the other rules , but it should be iterated again . TAKE YOUR TIME applying for positions . Check your spelling , have someone proofread your resume , cover letter , and portfolio , carefully craft your cover letter to reflect your personality and interest in the company , and make sure it is n't obvious to the employer that you have hastily put together your application . These little mistakes make it easy for an employer to not consider you as a serious applicant because you did n't  take the application seriously . <h> 10. - Applying for multiple positions in a company <p> When you apply for multiple positions in a company it shows that you do n't  have a specialty . If you are n't  qualified for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one you are most qualified for . If you are trying to branch out or gain a new specialty then apply for the position you are most apt for and once you have the position , pair up with the person who does what you want to do next and learn from them . It is much easier to move into a new area of expertise within a company than coming in cold .

Being an extreme metal fan and a logo designer , it was only natural for me to start creating logos for the metal scene . The demand for these logos were more popular than I expected and I managed to get quite a lot of work from it alongside my studies . <p> Now that I am focusing on different areas of work I have decided to write a tutorial to explain in detail how I went about creating the most popular of all my logos ; the death metal logo . This will be a symmetrical , hand rendered , vector logo . <p> Step 1 <p> First of all , it is important to know a lot about the band the logo is for . What sub genre do they fit in ? ( technical death metal/progressive death metal/old school death metal ) What are the lyrics about ? ( politics/urban life/religion ) What type of audience are they trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have collected enough information about the band , you can then start researching the relevant visuals . If you are not so familiar to death metal then its a good idea to find as many logos you can to use for inspiration . To make the logo more unique its a good idea to find inspiration elsewhere including **25;408;TOOLONG symbols , typography , non-metal logos etc . <p> The logo I am using for this tutorial was for an old school death metal band . They had influences from hardcore punk and the lyrics were about politics and society . I took inspiration from death metal logos , punk logos , gothic architecture , the Book of Kells , Blackletter fonts and ambigrams . <p> Step 2 <p> You should now start drawing the logo straight onto paper . Start drawing the letters from your influences , if you lack experience in working with typography pay careful attention to the fonts . They do n't  need to be perfectly drawn or measured , we will use Illustrator to do all of that . Spend a lot of time on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are happy with as these sketches will determine how good the logo is . <p> Some letters are more difficult to make symmetrical than others , use backwards letters if necessary or make 2 thin letters symmetrical to one wider letter . You might want to just keep the first and last letter symmetrical if you want it very legible . Try to keep the widths of the letters as consistent as possible . It helps to understand the basics of typography . <p> Some letters a more tricky than others to make symmetrical . It is sometimes a good idea to start with the most complex letter , then draw a flipped version of the to use as a template . You can then try to fit the other letter inside the template as best as possible . Sometimes the first letter will still need to modified to get a balance between the 2 . <p> Here are some examples of sketches where I have had to make 2 letters symmetrical with each other . The green areas are where the template was drawn from the other letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erased . <p> Once you have some sketches you are happy with , scan it in , get the band to pick their favorite . <p> Step 3 <p> Open up a new Illustrator document at any size/mode . Import &gt; Place the sketches in . Go to View &gt; Rulers . Then drag down rulers wherever things need to be on the same level and wherever you want straight lines . <p> Step 4 <p> Lock the layer with the sketch on and open up a new layer . Make the fill color transparent and the stroke color a bright red . Select the Ellipse tool and draw circles wherever there are curves in the logo . The more thorough you are , the smoother your logo will look . <p> Step 5 <p> Open up a new layer , drag this layer under the layer with the circles on and lock the layer with the circles on . Select the pen tool , change the fill color to black and make the stroke transparent . Now start to draw in the shapes , using the guides and circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  worry about making everything join . <p> Zoom in and use the anchor points to get it as smooth as possible . If you have trouble seeing the sketch underneath , go to Window &gt; Transparency and select 50% . <p> Step 6 <p> Use this opportunity to change any parts of the letters to make them look better . Make sure any symmetrical letters are perfectly symmetrical by drawing one side , duplicating it ( alt+mouse ) and using the selection tool to flip it over . <p> Step 7 <p> Now you have half of the logo complete , create another new layer . Copy and paste all the letters onto the new layer , make the Fill transparent and the Stroke blue . Flip them so they are completely symmetrical to the other half of the logo . Place each letter over the closest matching part of the other side . Lock that layer , go back to the main penning layer . Now draw in all of the other letters using the blue outlines as a guide . Compromise between the 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping it symmetrical and legible . Keep working at this until you get all the letters the way you want them . <p> Step 8 <p> Go to View &gt; Grid and use the rulers to give the logo consistent spacing and alignment . If everything looks exactly how you want save the file and go to Export and save as JPG just to show the band and so you can view it outside of Illustrator . Make any changes before continuing . <p> Step 9 <p> Although the logo is now finished in black and white vector form , bands usually want the logo in different colors and textures . This could be achieved in Illustrator but I find Photoshop is easier to use , although it will no longer be scalable . <p> Select all the letter Shift+Drag the logo out until the width is at least over 1000 pixels ( about three times the width of an A4 page ) .

@@98562260 @2762260/ <h> Create a Complete Apparel Tech Pack <p> So you just spent 10 or more hours creating a crazy t-shirt design and your client has officially signed offso what now ? <p> You may have created stellar photo-realistic mockups and used tons of really cool colors- but none of this means ANYTHING if your screen printer ca n't clearly interpret your vision ! <p> I find that many of my clients have had bad experiences with low-budget designers in the past who have been able to create great art , but do n't  know the first thing about how to put it on apparel . This can end up costing the client a lot of time , stress , and additional set-up fees at the printer . Over the years , I 've found that a client truly appreciates the fact that my designs come ready to hand-over to the screen printer that very same day with no questions asked . <p> The best rule of thumb when preparing files ? Leave nothing to chance and pretend that your screen printer is about 6 years old . ( As you establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out some of these steps once your screen printer knows your file style . Remember that , like designers , every printer is different ! ) <p> This tutorial will set out to give you step-by-step instructions for ensuring that your files are properly set up and ready to go to print ! ( AKA : Creating a Tech Pack ) Hold on , cuz its long , but once you get it down , your clients and printers will love you ! <p> This Tutorial will Cover : <p> File Preparation for Apparel <p> Creating A Full-Size Blank Shirt Template <p> Setting Up Your Tech Pack Template <p> Completing Technical Callouts <p> Full-Size Screen Separations <p> Double Checking Your Work <p> Equipment needed : <p> Adobe Illustrator <p> Pantone solid coated booklet ( or use Adobe Illustrators included PMS swatch set and take your chances ) <p> An actual blank apparel body that your client wants to use , or a clear photo and accurate measurements ( shoulder-seam to shoulder-seam and top to bottom ) <p> Digital camera <p> Ruler <h> Step one : File Preparation <p> For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design for one of my more recent clients- the Nastia Gold line by Olympic gold-medal gymnast Nastia Liukin for Vanilla Star Jeans . Though a little girly and basic for Go Media style , it works well for the purposes of this tutorial . <p> We are already assuming your shirt has been broken down into halftones , bitmap files , etc and brought into Illustrator . <p> The first thing that I like to do is to change my document size to be about the size of a real-life t-shirt . In this case , for a standard girls tee , I know that I need a document approximately 24 ? x 30 ? in order to leave plenty of room for call-outs , headers , and all the other things we will go into later . <p> Before diving in , I go to my Links menu and highlight all of my links , which makes sure that no layers are locked . Click the arrow at the top right , and select Embed Image . <p> If I had used any special fonts ( mine happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that you select them , go to the Type menu and click Create Outlines . This ensures that your printer wont be calling you looking for attached files or fonts later . <p> Next , in a separate file , I like to create an accurate template of the blank t-shirt or hoodie I will be using to gauge correct size and placement . This way , I do n't  have to waste time trying to print out my artwork and re-sizing it until I get it just right . Instead , I take a clear photo of the blank garment that my client wants to use , or ask them to send me one . Keep in mind that you generally want to use a middle-of-the road size shirt ( Medium is good ) , as your art has to fit on both a size S and XL . <p> For this particular client , they did n't  have a blank supplier picked out yet , so I used an existing template that I had already traced from a photo . Simply drop your garment photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and using your pencil tool , trace around your blank garment . ( It does n't  have to be super accurate , as different shirts will have different wrinkles and curves ) <p> Once you have traced your shirt and created an accurate template , enlarge it to real-life size using a few key measurements . Measure the distance from the top of one shoulder seam to the other . You may also want to measure the distance from the top of the shirt ( top of shoulder ) to the bottom ( hem ) . For this garment , my shoulder-to-shoulder distance is approx. 12 ? as this is a juniors tee . I make sure that my " Rulers " are turned on , then size my template accordingly . <p> Save this file for future use as a shirt template , or click below to download the one that we have provided for you ! Now you are really ready to begin ! <p> Keep this template on its own layer called " Shirt " and lock it . Now in your layers palette , create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer that you will be playing in- doing all of your masking and sizing . Also create a third layer and call it " Details " - we will get into this layer last . <p> From here , copy and paste your original art into your " Art " layer . Begin playing with placement , seeing which parts of the design may run off the edges , how they might align to the collar or seams , etc . <p> Once you find a placement that you are happy with , unlock your " Shirt " layer , and using your white arrow , select only the main body area ( not the lines representing seams ) and copy and paste it into your " Art " layer . You can now use this as a clipping mask to make your art look like it is bleeding off of the edges . The main body area of the shirt should appear to cover the art in your " Art " layer . Under your " Layers " palette , click the little circle to the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your " Art " layer . Then simply hit COMMAND+7 or Object&gt;Clipping Mask&gt;Make to mask out your art . <h> Step two:SETTING UP YOUR TECH PACK TEMPLATE <p> Now that you have your art where you want it , lock both your " SHIRT " layer and " ART " layer . From here on out , we will be working only in our " DETAILS " layer until we do color separations . I like to start setting up my tech pack by copying and pasting my clients logo into the top left corner of the document . I then align my type to the left and right underneath the logo I type in all caps : <p> SHIRT PRINTER SHIRT BRAND SHIRT COLOR SCREENPRINT COLORS <p> Next , I align my type to the top right and type in all caps : NAME JOB # <p> From here , fill in any and all information that you know . Your printer is the name of the clients chosen screen printer ( if you know it ) . Your shirt brand would be , for example , American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular design.Job # will most likely be given to you by your client , if they have one . <p> Once you get to screenprint colors , you will want to grab your trusty Pantone Solid Coated book to accurately choose your colors . In my experience , this is the book that most printers use to accurately show inks . There are also separate Pantone books just for metallics , neons , etc , but we will stick with the basic book for now . <p> After selecting my colors , I create little boxes with my rectangle tool to act as little swatches for each color . Next to each swatch , I list the name of the color- for example , my first color is PMS ( Pantone Matching System ) 7499 C ( Coated ) . <p> TIP : if you use the Pantone swatches that Illustrator provides , they will look very different on the screen than in an actual Pantone book . Always go off of the book , and try to make the ones on your screen look like the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even though I can see that PMS 871 C is a metallic gold in my Pantone book , I made sure to note that I wanted it to be metallic foil , not just metallic ink . The more information you can provide , the better . <h> STEP THREE:COMPLETING TECHNICAL CALLOUTS <p> Now we want to really get into calling out any special art placements , special treatments , etc . I begin by calling out that it is OK for the PMS 7449 C color art to run off the sides . I show this by drawing a clean line using my line segment tool , and writing exactly that . <p> " PMS 7499 C ART CAN RUN OFF EDGES " <p> Next I want to point out that it is OK if the art runs off the collar and prints on the inside back of the t-shirt , since I know we will have a neck label sewn in over the top . So again , I call that out : <p> " INK RUNS OFF COLLAR . OK IF INK GETS INSIDE OF SHIRT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my art , for the most part , to appear centered . This is up to the eye of the printer , but let 's him know that I will be looking for that . So I add that in : <p> " ART CENTERED " . <p> Hopefully , by this point you are starting to get the picture . The more info that you can provide your printer , the better . I also always like to provide at least one measured point of reference in this case , I would like the top of the black screen ( the top of the rose ) to be approx. 2 ? from the base of the collar . So again , I draw a line pointing to that place and write : <p> " BLACK SCREEN BEGINS APPROX. 2 ? FROM BASE OF COLLAR " . <p> Finally , I know that my client has custom neck labels that they would like sewn into the neck of these t-shirts . So I copy and paste the neck label art , placing it in a red rectangular box so that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Youd be surprised ) . If there is an associated ID# for that particular label , go ahead and include it . If your client wants to screen print neck labels , go ahead and include that art too , just in case . Or , at the very least , make mention of the fact that it needs to be there . <p> Do n't  forget to include any other custom treatments such as : contrast stitching , various garment treatments and washes , rivet or rhinestone embellishments , embroidery , etc . <h> STEP FOUR : FULL-SIZE COLOR SEPARATIONS <p> Hang on guys , you are almost there ! While many printers are smart and able to figure out how to unmask your " Art " layer to make separations , many are n't  . To eliminate any confusion , I like to provide color separations at the bottom , off of the art board , but on my " Art " layer . Lock your " Details " layer , and unlock your " Art " layer . Select everything in that layer and copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and unmask it ( ALT+COMMAND+7 ) Delete your mask , leaving just the art . <p> This next part gets a little tricky , so pay attention ! Depending on how many colors your art has , this will determine the number of separations that you need to make . <p> My particular file has 5 colors , so I need to make separations for 5 separate screens . The way that I approach this ( and others may do it differently ) is to copy and paste the art that we just unmasked 4 more times in a row . I then write each Pantone colors name above each separation , like this : <p> Now PAY ATTENTION depending on what color you are separating ( my first color is 7499 C ) - wherever that color is shown in the art , it needs to be made BLACK . Every other color in the art needs to be made WHITE ( so that it wont show up ) . <p> As you click on each piece of the art , turn it the appropriate color and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 7499 C showing ! <p> NOTE : This will mess with your brain , since you are used to thinking in terms of colors , not translating those colors into black-and-white . But I promise , it gets easier . <p> Proceed to do this for every color , leaving only the areas that are that specific color showing . IE : If you are on the green screen , then all areas that are green should be black when you are done with separating that screen . When you get through every color , you will have screen print separations ! <h> STEP FIVE : DOUBLE CHECK YOUR WORK ! <p> Double check everything , send a JPG to your client for final approval with all of the callouts shown ( in case the client has any revisions ) , and off to the printer it goes ! Send a copy of the final AI file to the client , and kick back until the samples roll in ! Whew , you made it ! <h> Conclusion <p> As a full-time art director for the new skate apparel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freelance designer for my own firm ( www.marenkellydesign.com ) I know the tech-pack can seem like a lot of extra work that you may not think you have time for . But once you get the process down , it really should n't take you longer than 30 minutes , and it acts as a major selling point to your clients . In my experience , it even helps to justify a slightly higher , flat-rate per design , since the client knows they are getting quality , print-ready art ! <p> Thanks to these easy-to-understand files , I have also gotten a lot of work over the years from screen printer referrals .

@@98562262 @2762262/ <h> Tutorial : How to Design and Print Custom Silk Screen Die-Cut Stickers <p> This post is a revealing walk-through behind the design , illustration , and sticker printing process. - I 'm proud to show off the new artwork I created for the upcoming Weapons of Mass Creation Fest 4 event . - The artwork below is going to be used for stickers , t-shirts , posters , etc . In this post I 'm going to show you how I created it and how I set it up to become a die-cut sticker . I got these custom die cut- stickers printed at Sticker Robot and they did a great job ! Let 's do this . Strap yourselves in , this is going to be a fun ride . <h> Step 1 : Sketches ! <p> Way back when I started WMC Fest I used the phrase " defy the hand you 're dealt " quite a bit . I wanted to bring that back this year . A couple years ago Brandon Rike created an image for WMC that featured a hand stuck with two arrows . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to expand upon that and combine it with images of friendship , togetherness , and community . Those are frequent ideas people have when they think about WMC . I started sketching and I came up with a pair of holding hands with a sword through them . You know , like were fighting this struggle together ! <h> Step 2 : Photoshop Prep <p> Since this artwork is going to be used in lots of ways , I created my Photoshop document at 18 ? x 24 ? at 300 DPI. - Why did n't  I use Illustrator you ask ? - Just personal preference mainly . This design could have been done in either program to be honest . Since we are setting up the files for CMYK sticker printing , I chose the CMYK color mode . Once I got my new document set up , I copied and pasted my sketch in the document and sized it accordingly . <h> Step 3 : Gathering References <p> Before I start illustrating , I need to find a reference image for my holding hands . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accurate . I asked Bill to shoot a photo of my wife and I holding hands . It does n't  have to be perfect , but I want to at least get the pose correct so I can manipulate and illustrate it in Photoshop to my liking . Here is our reference photo : <h> Step 4 : Blocking it Out <p> After I placed my reference photo into my document , I rotated it and cut out just the arms and hands . The rest of the photo is- unnecessary . I also went ahead and blocked in some additional reference like perfect circles , real fonts , starburst lines , and framing for the die-cut sticker . <h> Step 5 : Start Illustrating <p> I reduced the opacity on my reference to something like 25% so I could start drawing on top to create the illustration . I use my Ye Ole Wacom Intuos 3 tablet and my brush settings are below . There are better drawing tablets out there , but this has served me well since 2006 ! <h> Step 6 : Hand Lettering <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing the type . Now it took me many tries to get the letters correct for " Defy the Hand Youre Dealt . " My sketch itself was n't detailed enough so I had to improvise a lot . I knew I wanted " defy the hand " on the left arm and " you 're dealt " on the right arm . It was just a matter of making the letters fit ! It was a lot of trial and error . Some tips for your own lettering would be to block in the letters first . Try a rough draft and get the letters in there how you want . Then you can turn that layers opacity down and draw it again over top while being more creative with the letter forms . Since I do n't  have a very steady hand ( often a little jittery from coffee and anxiety ) my letter forms are not perfect . They 're a little wobbly , which is ok considering my entire design will be slightly imperfect . <p> The rest of the lettering was easier because I had a font to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set my reference type up with ITC Caslon and warped the type and got it into place . Then I drew over top of it my own custom version of it . For the dates , I loosely based my letters on the font , I drew it in rather quickly . Check it out : <h> Step 7 : Shading and Stippling <p> Once the drawing was complete , I printed it out and used a good old fashioned light box . I placed my outlined drawing down first , then placed a blank sheet of paper directly on top . The light box allowed me to see through the paper so I can have precise detail when stipple shading . I used a set of fine-detail Micron pens . There is no shortcut to stipple shading , believe me I 've tried ! - I actually tried using my Wacom tablet to do this , but I did n't  get as natural and consistent results . So I went analog for this ! To be honest , stipple shading is much easier using Micron pens and doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My intention was to scan my shading into Photoshop onto a different layer . Then I could do whatever I wanted with it ! <p> One trick to note : I did a separate scan for any stippling that would be " highlights " or " distressing " on my image . For example I did the stipple shading on my text on its own piece of paper and scanned it separately . That way I could change its color easier . I did the same for all the abstract dots that fill the background . In the end those were going to be lighter than the background , but it is still nice to have it on its own layer . <h> Step 8 : Coloring ! <p> Now that I had my outlines and shading complete , its time to fill it with color ! I knew I wanted to go with my tried and true WMC Fest color palette . With my outlines and shading layers on top , I made a new layer underneath everything for each element . I started with the left arm first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made a new layer and started coloring the right arm an orange color . By having the outlines on a layer above your colors , all you have to do is get close and color between the lines . It does n't  matter what kind of brush you use , I 'm just painting in solid colors . To make sure Im using the same consistent colors throughout the design , I use " color overlay " layer style on each layer . <p> Also , since I made my background dark , notice how I changed the colors of " we are weapons of mass creation " and " until the end " to something brighter . Also , take a look at how I colored the little flag in the middle and the rays shooting out from the center . I just selected those layers and changed the " color overlay " setting to the color I wanted . No additional coloring needed . <p> Here is what our design looks like without any outlines on top . <p> And here is our finished design when we turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might see some subtle distressing on the type . What I did for that was duplicating some of my stipple shading layers and placing them strategically on top of the type . Since the shading layers are the same color as the background , I was able to achieve a slightly distressed look . <h> Step 9 : Prep for Die-Cut Sticker Printing ! <p> The design is done ! Now I just need to send it to print ! But before that I had to make sure I was adhering to the specs that Sticker Robot calls for on their website . They actually screen print their stickers , but use a CMYK simulated process print . They literally screen print tiny dots of Cyan , Magenta , Yellow , and Black to get the exact colors in your design . So all I had to do was send them a high res CMYK . tif file and they did the rest . No complicated color separation work for me ! <p> The trickiest part in setting this up for print was creating the die-cut layer . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer that tells the printer where to cut the sticker out from the background . Since we are n't  going for traditional square-shaped stickers here , you need to specify the shape of your sticker ! <p> Its pretty easy . See below : <p> One thing to note was that there should be at least a 1/8 ? safety area separation from your artwork to your die-cut line , and an additional 1/8 ? bleed - area beyond your die-cut line . This will ensure your sticker has enough room to move around slightly on the press . <p> Another cool thing with Sticker Robot is they are one of the few sticker printers that allow you to print a grayscale design on the back of your sticker ! To set this up with my custom shape sticker , I mirrored my sticker shape horizontally and designed the sticker back . I used a collage background I designed for the festival last year as my background and added our website URL . The only catch is the design had to be black and white . Check it out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The design was sent off to Sticker Robot and here 's a few photos they took of the sticker printing- process , from film to packaging : <h> Film for the black plate . <p> Film is printed for each color . Cyan , Magenta , Yellow and Black . The film will be used to expose the screens . <h> The film is exposed . <p> A bright light is used to expose the film through the emulsion to the silkscreen itself . Each color will have its own screen . <h> Silkscreen Sticker Printing <p> A squeegee pushes ink through the screen onto the vinyl substrate , one color at a time , one sheet at a time . <p> a close up of cyan ink on the squeegee <h> Cyan and Magenta Ink <p> The cyan and magenta ink have been laid down . Next will be yellow , then black and finally 3 coats of clear UV protective ink . <h> Silkscreen Quality Ink <p> Silkscreen ink is notoriously thick and durable , typically 10-20 times thicker than digital ink . This is magenta : <p> Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <h> Magenta , Cyan and Yellow <p> The basic colors are coming together- were just missing the final color , black . <h> Black ink is laid down <p> Now its starting to look like a sticker ! <h> Sticker Diecutting <p> This is a tedious process , where each sticker sheet is literally cut one at a time a truly custom sticker . See the video below that shows the process on creating die cut stickers . <h> Sticker Packaging ! <p> this is what a couple thousand custom die cut WMC stickers look like <h> Conclusion <p> So there you have it , that was how I created the artwork for the 2013 Weapons of Mass Creation Fest and how the stickers were created .

@@98562264 @2762264/ <h> What is the pack about ? <p> What 's so special about this texture pack ? First of all , these are hand-made textures . They were made using an old photocopier that had a toner on its last leg . The result is a pack of six fantastic noise textures . The process was simple : I created a black document in Ai , and printed it as many times as I could before the toner gave up . Because it was almost ready to throw away , it would n't print a perfectly black sheet . I got these black rectangles , speckled with white spots and stripes . Once scanned in , cleaned up , and inverted , these make up for perfect noise textures . <h> A closer look at the content <p> Some technical data : you get six textures , that are around 4760+6400 @ 600 dpi . Here are what they look like : <h> How can I use these ? <p> I thought you 'd never ask ! In order to demonstrate the possibilities of the textures , I 've put a quick little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base . Well use both Ai and Ps for this . here 's a preview of what well be doing : <p> Basically , well use these to age Jeffs design , along with a few other tricks here and there . here 's a 100% crop , to get a better sense of what these textures are able to do : <p> Note that if you have n't purchased the Awakened t-shirt pack , or have no idea of what I 'm talking about , you should go read and watch more info : - over here . <h> Let 's get started <h> - Step 1 : document setup <p> Once you have that new document setup , fill its background with dark gray ( #231f20 ) , and setup guides for the center and margins . I might have gone a tad overboard with mine . My vertical guides are at the one , two , 11 , 12 , 13 , 22 , and 23 inch marks . My horizontal guides are at the one , two , eight , nine , 10 , 16 , and 17 inch marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a look at Jeffs design : <p> As you can see , there are quite a few elements that compose it ( feathers , purple circular element , red circles , white circle , blue geometrical element , silhouette , and off white stars ) . I could simply select everything , and copy and paste it in Ps . The only issue with doing that is that it wo n't allow us to individually texture the elements . Since I want to do something refined and individualized , I wont go that route . Were going to copy and paste each element one by one . Itll be a bit long , but worth it in the end . <p> Use the main image as a reference point to position your elements , and make sure that they 're always sized at 100% . Also , do n't  forget to paste the elements as smart objects , so they retain their vector characteristics . Itll be crucial for later . <p> Note : you may have to center or nudge elements manually . <p> The purple circular pattern . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The white circles . <p> The black silhouette . <p> The stars . <p> Aligning the stars back in place ( the top star is at the intersection of the top red circles ) . <p> Nudging the wings back in place . <p> here 's a view of how the design elements are placed compared to my initial guides . If you want your design or some of its elements to be bigger or smaller within the finished print , now is the time to adjust the sizes . For instance , I 've decided to size my design so it reaches the smaller rectangles inside of my guides . <p> And here 's a view of my layer stack so far . <h> Step 3 : let 's roughen these vectors up <p> The next step will involve the use of Illustrators roughen filter ( Effect &gt; Distort and transform &gt; Roughen ) . I learned about the effect through that 2011 Method and Craft article by Simon Walker . Basically , the effect distorts your paths and adds more or less subtle variations to them . <p> Well be applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minus the wings . This is where retaining the smart object quality- of the elements pasted in Ps comes handy . You simply have to double click on the layer thumbnails of the smart object in order to be brought back to Ai , and to be able to edit the vector element . <p> Let 's start with the purple circular pattern element . I 've turned off the other elements of the design for better legibility , but you do n't  have to . <p> Once you 'll double click on the layer thumbnail , Ai will open and youll be able to edit just that element . <p> Let 's select our element , and bring up the roughen filter ( Effect &gt; Distort and transform &gt; Roughen ) . I suggest zooming in a little bit , in order to fully appreciate what the effect does to your paths . Oh , and tick that " Preview " box to see what 's happening . <p> Obviously , the default values are a bit extreme in terms of result . After a little bit of tinkering , the values Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relative <p> Detail : 50/inch <p> Points : smooth <p> Note that you can come up with your own values . These should be considered as a starting point for your own exploration . Also , you could decide to expand the various elements from strokes to paths , or to leave them as is. - Once you 're happy with the filters values , validate them . The next step : save your work ( CTRL/CMD+S ) , close the file in Ai , and head back to Ps for a little surprise <p> The effect is applied ! Isnt that neat ? Now , you 'll simply have to go through the same process for the other design elements ( minus the wings , once again : the halftone effect they have is enough ) . I personally used the same values for the roughen filter for all the elements , as it gives consistency to the final piece , but you could spend the time to find the perfect values that works the best for each specific part of the design . Below , a few shots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values Ive ended up using for the white circles : the effect was n't visible enough with the other ones I settled on earlier , so I upped the ante a bit . I did return to my previous values for the other elements though . <p> And done with that part . <h> Step 4 : textures ! <p> Finally , we can play with textures here . The photocopy noise texture pack is made of black and white textures , which will somewhat dictate the workflow well have with them . First , we need a bit of a refresher about blending modes . This wonderful article by PhotoBlogStop will give you every detail you ever wanted to know about them , including math ( ! ) , but well focus on Screen : <p> Screen : Similar to the Lighten blend mode , but brighter and removes more of the dark pixels , and results in smoother transitions . Works somewhat like the Multiply blend mode , in that it multiplies the light pixels ( instead of the dark pixels like the Multiply blend mode does ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the underlying layers as being 35mm slides , and each slide being placed in a separate projector ( one slide for each projector ) , then all of the projectors are turned on and pointed at the same projector screenthis is the effect of the Screen blend mode . This is a great mode for making blacks disappear while keeping the whites , and for making glow effects . <p> The most interesting part of this quote is the emphasized sentence : " this is a great mode for making blacks disappear while keeping the whites , and for making glow effects . " It just happens that the noise effects in the textures from our pack ARE white speckles and stripes . So we simply have to put the textures on screen to retain just their noisy part , and the rest shows up as transparent . After that , if the effect is too strong , you simply play with the opacity slider of the texture layer . Let 's put this into practice by adding some noise to our background layer . <p> Go ahead and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background layer , and sized to cover the whole background . <p> Give it a quick sharpening ( Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Sharpen ) , and simply change the layers blending mode to Screen . As you can see , the effect is quite strong . <p> Were simply going to lower the opacity of the layer to 25% for something a bit more subtle . <p> Also , Ive given the background elements their own layer group . <p> Its time to start adding our subtle noise to the rest of the design . We could simply use the texture clipped over each element , and tinker with the opacity sliders to create some subtle overlays . But this would show the noise as white or light gray speckles over each design elements . Most of these being line art , we would n't see much of an effect . <p> Were going to use another trick from our bag , and paste the textures in layer masks . Remember that whatever part of a layer mask that 's white shows the art , and whatever part of it that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduce that pasting the textures as is will simply obliterate the designs . Nothing subtle here . What we can do however is to invert the textures once theyve been pasted in the layer masks . From there , playing with levels to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect is childs play . <p> The process to paste a texture in a layer mask is easy : <p> Add a layer mask to the design element you 're interested in impacting ( with the layer highlighted , go to Layer &gt; Layer mask &gt; Reveal all ) . Make sure to click the little chain link between the layer and the layer mask to make it disappear . This will allow you to move or resize the content of the layer mask without changing the design element itself <p> Open your texture file , copy its content ( CTRL/CMD+C ) <p> Go back to your design , and ALT/OPTION + CLICK your layer mask . This will allow you to get access to and edit the content of the layer mask itself , rather than your design <p> Paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of the layer mask at will <p> Click back on the design element and admire the result of your work <p> Here are some images of the process with the wings . Ive used **36;473;TOOLONG again . <p> Layer mask added and unlinked . <p> Pasting the texture in the layer mask . <p> Resizing the texture to cover the whole canvas . You have access to the same transform controls that outside of the layer mask ( CTRL/CMD+T or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+T for proportional transformations ) . <p> It can seem that the effect is too subtle . here 's a 100% crop to convince you otherwise : <p> Blue geometrical element , before <p> Blue geometrical element , after <p> Layer mask detail <p> White circles , before <p> White circles , after <p> Layer mask detail <p> Silhouette , before <p> Silhouette , after <p> Layer mask detail <p> Stars , before <p> Stars , after <p> Layer mask detail . Note that I 've used the same textures than for the silhouette . I 've simply moved it to the top right a little bit . <p> And here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Its time for the finishing touches . <h> Step 5 : let 's wrap this up <p> Now that all of our design elements got their individual weathering treatment , its time to tie everything up together . In order to do so , well first add a layer mask to the whole design layer group , and paste one of our textures in there . This will unite the elements together visually , by giving them a consistent weathering . I used **36;511;TOOLONG for that ( the one with the heavy striping ) . <p> Once that 's done , well add two more textures at the top of our layer stack . The aim is the same : to tie all the elements visually together , by impacting them all with the same element . First , let 's add **36;549;TOOLONG to our design . Make sure it fills the whole canvas . <p> Let 's make it significantly darker , so its effect will be much more intense . <p> After that , change its blending mode to Screen . <p> Since the effect was a tad overbearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there , but I 'd like a effect similar to a vignette , that would detach the center piece from the background a bit . Ill be using **36;587;TOOLONG to accomplish this . Let 's place it into our document , in a way similar to the image below ( its been rotated upside down , and scaled up so it covers the whole design ) . I 've also given the two top textures their own Global textures layer group . <p> Once its in place , simply change the blending mode to Soft light , and lover the layer opacity to 25% . This gives a much softer result than Screen , and still let 's the backgrounds subtle noise show through .

@@98562278 @2762278/ <h> What is a " Vector Pack ? " <p> Ok , so it has come to my attention that some people who purchase stuff from Go Medias Arsenal surprisingly have no idea what they 're buying . But they buy it anyway . Strange <h> Vector Packs are NOT software <p> Some people call it software . Some people call them programs . Some even call them plugins or brushes . Well , truth is , they 're none of those ! Some folks have called us asking how to install the design software or wondering why these magical things are n't  creating designs FOR them . Well , I 'm here to explain this to all the n00bs . And do n't  worry , weve all been a n00b before . I had no idea what vectors were until after 3 or 4 years of using Photoshop to do all my graphics . It was uncomfortable to learn vector software at first , but it was SO worth it once I wrapped my brain around the whole concept of vector graphics . So , if you would consider yourself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least enough to feel confident that you can use some awesome Go Media Vector Packs ! <h> So what the heck IS a Vector Pack <p> All products listed in the " Vector Pack " category on the Arsenal are just that , packs of vectors . Its just a collection of various vector shapes that you can copy and paste into your artwork or design . We organize the vector packs into themes such as Heraldry , Splatters , and Hooladanders ( our word for flourishes ) . When we release new vector packs , we like to bundle a bunch of those themed packs into a Set and offer them at a discount . So you 'll find that a " Set " of vector packs contains 7 different " themed " packs which sell individually for about $10 . Or you can just buy the entire Set and get all 7 themed packs for about $35 . <p> Now some people are n't  sure what a vector is . I suggest if you really want to understand what a vector is , read the Wikipedia entry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Novice Graphic Designer most likely uses Photoshop to do all their designs for print and web . Which I would say the majority of non-designers probably think Photoshop is how all designs are made . Not true . Photoshop is excellent for photo based design and web design . But it is NOT the optimal software to use Vectors in . Adobe made a special program just for that ! Its called Adobe Illustrator . <p> Adobe Illustrator is our software of choice . We feel that you should be using it if you are working with our Vector Packs . I will also recommend that you use version CS or above . They 're on CS3 right now and soon to have CS4 on the market . <p> A common complaint is from people who use old versions of software . Cranky VonClementine who uses Illustrator 8 ( from way back in the 1990s ) calls us to complain that his vectors are n't  working the way he thought . However , Spanky McFadden who has the most up-to-date software calls us and gives us a pat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So , make your life easier ( and ours ) by updating your version of Adobe Illustrator to the latest version . <p> There ARE other vector graphics applications that people are using . Corel Draw , Macromedia Freehand , Inkscape , Macromedia Fireworks . While these all have their use , we honestly do n't  use them and cant always offer our expertise and support on those programs . We try our best to make sure our Vector Packs work with ALL vector software , but I ca n't stress enough that if you want a smooth ride with our products , you should use the same software we do . <h> Summary <p> Now , to sum up what you 've read so far . You know that Go Media sells radical collections of " themed " vector artwork that are bundled together into Sets . They are to be used with Adobe Illustrator . Not Photoshop ! Sure , you CAN use our vector packs in Photoshop to some extent , and pro users will understand how to work around the softwares limitations . But if you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft Word , then you should avoid mixing vectors and Photoshop all together . Do yourself a favor and download the trial of Illustrator if you do n't  have it already . <p> And just a reminder , the Vector Packs are NOT software . You do n't  download the Vector Packs and install them . No copying them to your plugin or presets folder either . Its simply just a file you OPEN with Adobe Illustrator . The whole pack is laid out in front of you like a buffet table and you just take your pick . Select one , copy it ( Edit &gt; Copy ) and then go into your design and paste it ( Edit &gt; Paste ) . See the awesome image below : <h> Vector File Types EPS , AI , etc . <p> Also , the files that are usually associated with vector are . eps , . ai , and in some cases . pdf . Go Media uses . eps files because we believe they are the most widely supported file for vector graphics . <h> But my file is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called us with complaints saying that their software wont open the file after further investigation , the customer was trying to open the ZIP file with Adobe Illustrator . This is not going to get you anywhere . If you 're trying to open a ZIP file with your design software , you would be considered an ultra n00b and should consider taking some basic computer classes . But to help the ultra n00bs of this world , as there seem to be quite a few that purchase our products , let me brief you really quick on what a ZIP file is . <p> A ZIP file is kind of like a folder . Any file with a . zip extension means that a bunch of smaller files were " zipped up " into a neat little bundle . So when you buy a Complete Set from us , you 'll download ONE file . Something like **25;625;TOOLONG . You will need to " unzip " this file in order to " extract " the 7 individual vector . eps files inside . Kind of like a birthday present ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller , more convenient way of getting multiple files . Its faster ! <p> Your operating system ( Windows XP , Vista , Mac ) should be able to " unzip " these files for you . If not , you 'll need a program like Winzip , 7-Zip , WinRAR , or Power Archiver . If you would like to further understand ZIP files , go ahead and read this article . <p> There you have it .

@@98562285 @2762285/ <h> Introducing The Shops rolled ink texture packs , volume 01 and 02 <p> Ladies and gentlemen , drum roll please . I 'm happy to announce that my rolled ink texture packs are finally available on the Arsenal ! Simon from The Shop here , and I 'll be walking you through both texture packs , as well as through a few techniques to make good use of them . On to the texture tutorial ! <h> So , what is it about these textures that makes them awesome ? <p> Well , for a start , they have been created by hand . I used both a foam and a rubber roll to execute them , and lots of rich , deep , black ink . <p> The result is that series of 28 textures in total ( 14 in each pack ) . After experimenting with pressure , ink quantity , roller motion , and paper types , the textures were left to dry for a few days . After the drying was complete , they were scanned in at very high resolution ( 800 dpi and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and minimally edited to produce a set of textures sized at 5000 x 7800 pixels on average . <p> Both sets are delivered in the form of flat RGB . jpg images in a ZIP archive . <h> Cool story , but how do I use these textures ? <p> Oh boy , am I glad you asked . I precisely prepared a quick piece showcasing these textures , so we could experiment a little bit . Well use both Photoshop and Illustrator for this tutorial , but you should be all right with just Photoshop . <p> It includes the vector type element used in my piece . I crafted it using a typeface called Felt Noisy , made by the awesome folks at PintassilgoPrints . Consider buying that amazing , messy brush style font ! You wo n't regret it one bit . The file is available in Ai ( CC ) , EPS ( CS3 ) , and PDF formats . It includes a black and white and pre-colored version of the artwork . <p> I 'd like you to also quickly read the post it includes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install them . <h> Step 1 : file setup <p> The first step is to create the canvas well be working in . I 'm using an 24 ? x18 ? file @ 300 dpi . <p> I 've also created a few guides to give a loose structure to work from . I 've placed my vertical guides at 1 ? , 2 ? , 12 ? , 22 ? , and 23 ? . My horizontal guides are placed at 1 ? , 2 ? , 9 ? , 16 ? , and 17 ? . This " grid " gives me a quick indications of my pieces center , as well as marks a nice border zone around it . <h> Step 2 : the background <p> Create a new layer above the yellow layer , and fill it with our dark green- ( #337061 ) . <p> You know have two layers , one being completely invisible . <p> Were going to leverage **45;688;TOOLONG from the second volume of the rolled ink textures . Pasted into a layer mask , this texture will allow us to reveal the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright border around our dark piece . <p> Open the texture in Photoshop . <p> Select its content , and copy it ( CTRL/CMD+C ) . Head back to our piece . Add a layer mask to our green layer . <p> Make sure the layer and the layer mask are " untied " to each other ( no chain link ) . This will allow us to move/transform their content independently from each other . <p> Now , ALT/OPTION+CLICK on the layer mask to access its content . Simply paste the texture in there ( CTRL/CMD+V ) . <p> In a layer mask , black pixels represent the parts of the image that will be hidden , and white pixels the ones that will be shown . The various gray levels represent the various degrees of transparency . With that in mind , were going to place our texture so it will allow a bit of the yellow layer to show at the edges of the piece . Well obviously have to invert the layer masks content to achieve our effect . <p> You can see that I 'm slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once the texture is in place , invert it ( CTRL/CMD+I ) . <p> Click back on the layers thumbnail to admire our result . This is the perfect moment to further tweak the layer mask if the result is n't quite where you 'd like it to be . <p> I 'm personally happy with the texture overall , but I think some of its artifacts ( paper folds and creases ) are showing too strongly . I 'm going to use the levels panel ( CTRL/CMD+I ) to fix this . With the layer mask selected , bring up the levels . Tweak the various sliders until you reach a level you feel comfortable with . My values bring a stronger contrast to the texture , " washing off " some of its detailed creases , folds , etc . <p> And here 's our cleaner , and better defined result . <p> And were done with our background . Proceed to some house-cleaning ( or else ! ) , and let 's get ready to move on to adding the type element to our poster . <h> Step 3 : bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to open one of the files containing the type element . <p> You have a couple options from here : <p> Grab the pre-colored element , copy it , and paste it into your Photoshop document <p> Use the monochrome element , tweak the colors to your liking , copy it , and paste it into your Photoshop document <p> Get the Felt Noisy typeface , and use the many alternate characters available to tweak the type element to fit your tastes just right ( and then paste it into your Photoshop document ) <p> Because I 'm already happy with my current color scheme , I 'll settle on the already colored type piece . Simply copy it , and paste it in your Photoshop document . I HIGHLY recommend keeping the type as a smart object , as this will retain its vector properties within your raster file . This could come in handy should you decide to tweak the types placement or size later . <p> Size the type to your liking . <p> Once you 're happy with the type , proceed to organize things a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink textures . <h> Step 4 : using the rolled ink textures to create ink noise <p> If you have n't done so yet , its time to grab Media Militias actions , and to get them installed . Next , open **45;735;TOOLONG from your asset pack . <p> You can use levels to tweak the texture to your liking ( lighter or darker ) . <p> Once you 're done with that , its time to run one of the actions to obtain a version of our texture with a transparent background . Make sure that your colors are reset to the default ( you can press " D " for that ) , and run the " maximum opacity " action . This will ensure the best result for the following steps . <p> You 'll end up with a file looking like this <p> Simply drag it into our main file . <p> Turn it into a smart object ( Filters &gt; Convert for smart filters in Photoshop CC ) . <p> Once the layer is a smart object , resize it and position it so it covers as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an overwhelming effect . <p> Once the texture is in place , proceed to give it a color overlay of our bright yellow ( #fbfbd9 ) . <p> Open LONG ... and follow the same process . The only difference is that you 'll give it a green color overlay ( #337061 ) . <p> Once you 're happy with your ink effects , its time to organize things a little bit . I renamed my layers to reflect the textures that were used to generate them , and grouped them properly . <h> Step 5 : textures ! <p> Its time to add a little bit of textures to our piece . This will tie things together , as well as add extra depth . <p> Adjustment layers , clipping masks , and clipped layers will become your new best friends . While it might seem cumbersome at first , such a workflow has many advantages . You could go back to your original piece of content in a heartbeat , by simply turning layers off . You could quickly change the intensity of an effect used during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle . <p> The gist of it is to use clipped adjustment layers to your textures , so you can revert your changes at all times . Makes sense ? Alright , let 's get going . <p> The first texture is BBAntiqueEnvelope04.jpg . <p> Place it in your document so no seams are visible . <p> Desaturate it ( the Saturation slider of the Hue/saturation adjustment layer is set at -100 ) . <p> Next , use a Levels adjustment layer to bring the textures artifacts and grain out . <p> The next texture is VVColoredGrunge02.jpg . The interesting feature of this texture is that it features a soft vignette . Well make advantage of that to focus the viewers attention to the center of the piece , where the type is . <p> Well repeat the same process : place the texture as a smart object , desaturate it , use levels to enhance it , and switch its blending mode . <p> Blending mode : Soft light @ 35% opacity . <p> This concludes the texture part . Heres what my layer stack is looking like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the finishing touch will be a subtle halftone effect . This will allow us to give the piece a tactile feel , as if it were printed . <p> Because of the effects nature , the colors in the piece have slightly shifted . You can fix this if you do n't  like the result by adding a hue/saturation adjustment layer , clipped to the halftone layer . <p> And were done ! Isnt it looking nice ? <h> Concluding thoughts <p> Well , were done . I hope you had as much fun following along as I had writing this tutorial . I also hope that this short write-up helped you to see the potential these ink textures have to quickly bring some ink elements in your designs , to be used as masks , or as textural elements . <p> Do n't  hesitate to reach out if you have any questions !

@@98562289 @2762289/ <h> Create a Grassy Field in Illustrator in 13 Simple Steps <p> Sometimes , you just need some grass . It can take a design from blah to brilliant , especially when you need a natural and organic look . Grass can be a subtle nuance , or the key piece of your design . <p> We have lots of options for Photoshop , but your designs may need to work in many different mediums , so you 'll eventually need vector images . No problem . Illustrator is your best friend , so let 's jump in and kick some grass . <h> Getting Started <p> 1 . Open a new Illustrator file using a width of 500px and a height of 250px . <p> 2 . Get some grass ! <p> You have three options for getting grass : ( a ) download what we have provided for you ( recommended for this tutorial , ( b ) use the built in grass in Illustrator , or ( c ) make your own . Its your decision , but for this tutorial we will be using the files provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Grass in Illustrator ( CS5 ) , open the Windows -&gt; Symbols pallette -&gt; Symbols Library Menu -&gt; Nature . <p> 3 . For this tutorial , place the Grass.ai or Grass.pdf file from above . File -&gt; Place -&gt; select the Grass.ai/.pdf where you saved it . Resize the image as needed . <p> 4 . Head to Windows -&gt; Links -&gt; fly-out menu and select " Embed Image " . This will allow you to directly edit the contents of the Grass file . This technique is nice for bringing a Placed image into projects you have already started . <p> 5 . Lastly , using the Selection Tool , CTL ( Right ) Click any of the grass designs and select " Ungroup " . <p> 7 . Name it Grass01 , or whatever you like , - and make sure its set to " Graphic " just in case you want to import into Flash later . If its just for illustrator , it does n't  matter if its Movie or Graphic . Repeat this for the other symbols , or for any grass you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new layer and hide the layer with the Grass.ai/.pdf file by clicking the eye symbol in the Layers window . <p> 10 . Now , you need to edit your new lawn with the grass you just sprayed selected , go to your Symbol window and click the Break Link button . <p> 11 . If you want to reduce the amount of repetition , grab the Warp Tool , select a group , and move some of the grass around until it looks less like a pattern . <p> 12 . To add some definition to your grass , we are going to make a new set of grass using the Symbol Sprayer tool again . We used Grass02 for this example . <p> 13 . Now grab the Symbol Stainer tool , choose a brown foreground color , and spray over the Grass02 symbols you just made . <h> Project Notes <p> Notice that we bled off of the artboard . The nature of the Symbol Sprayer tools is that they 're a bit messy , so just make sure that you move your groups around to position them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep adding layer after layer until you have your final concept . Between creating symbols and editing with the Warp Tool and the Symbol Stainer , you can quickly design a textured field of grass and retain the vector qualities you need . <p> Tara Hornor enjoys her fancy title of Senior Editor for Creative Content Experts , the copywriting business she owns with her husband .

" <p> PART I Start Up <p> PART II The creation of your art and working with a printer <p> PART III Business <p> Let 's boogie ! <p> So you 're a great illustrator , designer and master of artistic mayhem . You rule the design world and celebrities are begging for- your next shirt design , right ? - This is your dream , everyone loves your dream , right ? - Well , let 's figure out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg for your next piece , and of course , make you a big ol wad of cash at the end of the day . <p> In the Spring of 2009 I was asking myself the questions " How do I start a shirt line ? " - and " Where do I begin ? " . - In this article I will share 3 points that will help you get started : - - Creating your idea , Research , and Who is Interested ? <h> CREATING YOUR IDEA <p> Simply put , what do you like ? - Skulls , ponies , - vampire movies ? The answer to this question will be the factor that separates you from the competition . Not necessarily that you draw the best looking ponies with brass knuckles , but originality. - What other questions should you ask yourself ? <p> How about : do you design in Photoshop ? Are you- a vector wizard in Illustrator ? Do you hand draw your art ? <p> What about subject matter ? - - Do you dive into pentagrams , do you draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you answer these few questions you 're on the move . <p> Here is one of my shirt illustrations. - This is one of the first drawings- in a sketchbook solely- dedicated to my shirt line. - I had to ask myself- what I like , - because- after doing work for clients and their content- I needed to think about me and what I would like to see on a shirt. - For me its art nouveau line art . I love following tattoo artists and seeing what they create . I also love to draw the human figure . Remember , keep it simple and have fun ! - I 'll thoroughly- dissect- the drawing in PART II , but for now here is the " The Octolady . " The first image is the sketch , and the second is the final piece . <p> I did n't  overwhelm- myself with " questions of worry " such as " What will people- think " or- " Is it good enough ? " . - I approached this piece , as I do with all my work , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the competition ? " - My answers have been " Its original and- I 'm not trying to copy or follow any specific style or look . " <p> I have also- educated myself with print locations on a shirt ( covered in PART II ) . - I shopped- developed ideas from my sketchbook around to friends and clothing stores to get some feedback as well. - This might seem like overkill , but the results of such effort lead into the next point , RESEARCH . <p> Find out the success stories of these brands and where it all started for them. - I found out I was n't that much different ; I 'm just a dude with some creative ideas that wants to provide a good product . <p> Start researching the market of a successful apparel brand . For example , - TAPOUT- struck gold with the rising sport of MMA. - The point is , TAPOUT knows its target market , they 're not trying to hit every person from the soccer mom to the war vet. - Likewise , you need to find out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stores ? <p> Grab a computer and obliterate Google with your questions , its free ! - Some great sites I use are T- Shirt Forumsand- I am the trend . These are great resources- where I probably learned 50% of my information just by reading what- people were asking. - They cover business , printing , start-up costs and everything in between . <p> HOMEWORK : Take 15 minutes everyday for 2 weeks and research these sites , find other sites and follow the successful brands on Facebook and Twitter . You 'll take yourself to school and not have to pay a dime . Its worth the investment . <p> Ok , we covered who to research ( TAPOUT , Silver Star , etc. ) and where to research ( Google , Blogs , etc ) . What else ? Oh yeah , business research. - - Ill- detail more in the- PART III , but for now , here are some points . <p> Take into consideration that everybody- has different backgrounds . Personally I needed to learn and keep learning about running a business. - Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREE advice , FREE counseling , FREE paperwork and FREE information. - Familiarize- yourself with becoming a business person . - YES YOU THE- GENIUS ARTIST ; - find out the paper work you need and what it will- take to run a well structured shirt business. - I spent the winter months of 2009-2010 devouring the info on the SCORE website and about 50 more websites . I feel a hell of a lot more educated after- all this legwork . <p> My overall point with research is that it does n't  cost you any money before you have to- spend money. - When you know what , where , and how much money to spend you will have an educated decision that will only help you in the long run. - Let 's keep moving . <h> WHO IS INTERESTED ? <p> I figured everyone would like my work and want to buy my product. - Then I got a reality check . After friends and family buy , who else is interested ? - A good rule of thumb is knowing your target market , who is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract to buy your awesome shirts . <p> To find my answer I showed my developed sketchbook work- and final designs to tattoo artists , boutique stores ( not baby clothing stores but higher end fashion ) , skate and snow stores , other artists in film , gaming and comics. - - Do you see the pattern ? These groups are my target audience. - - These- specific- people- I know will be attracted to my work and say " Hell yes I 'll buy one ! " - ( That is an actual quote. ) - Its not necessarily- ages 14 -25 but a group of people who- appreciate my style . I can- shop my work around to many places and people and- not- handcuff myself with- a certain age group. - The funniest thing to this day is I have moms buying Establish the Frontline shirts for their sons without- hesitation . WHAT ! ? - That was another surprise niche . <p> Lastly , here 's the truth : not everyone will like your work , not everyone will buy your shirts. - Start developing tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet thousands of people with mixed reactions. - Be excited when someone buys and do n't  be a poor sport or unprofessional when someone does n't  ; its business , not personal . <h> WRAP UP <p> To recap the START-UP article we covered : <p> CREATING YOUR IDEA originality , what do you like and how will you set yourself apart from the competition . <p> WHO IS INTERESTED ? find your niche market , - know who to sell to and who will buy . <p> I hope this article helps you get started and answers some of your questions. - The night before I finished writing this article I was thinking about my past year and half and what has helped me get to where I 'm at. - Rome wasnt built in- a day. - Everything takes time , everything is still taking time. - - Be patient , strive for quality not quantity. - Being patient is frustrating .

@@98562294 @2762294/ <h> Make it Look Like Affliction <p> As graphic designers for the apparel industry , we 've heard the phrase " Make it Look Like Affliction " so many times . Its a strange coincidence . You have a dozen apparel companies and bands who have absolutely nothing in common with each other except for one thing . And that is to make their shirt look like the ever so popular clothing line started by Eric Foss and Todd Beard in 2005 . You know , with the dark gothic imagery , skulls , a generous helping of intricate ornaments and woodcut linework , the huge placement across the shoulders , the faded prints , the garment dying , the splatters , the grunge , I could go on ! Its an alternative clothing companys dream ! The ironic thing is , while these bands and clothing companies attempt to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack , they wind up all looking the same just not quite there . <p> So why is Affliction the brand that most of these people want to be like ? <h> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good . Certainly much better than most of the shirts it hangs next to in the mall . Its hand drawn , which is admirable in the world of cut and paste graphic " designers " today . Not everyone can just pick up a pencil and draw 16 skeletons riding horses wielding various weaponry . Its very ambitious illustration driving artwork . I have always had respect for that . <p> 2 . ) Its trendy . Between a mix of the appropriate spooky subject matter and design fodder such ornaments and splatters it appeals to the rebellious ( and somehow the jocks ) . You will see that on childrens t-shirts at Value City Department Stores for $10 ( havent checked , but I 'm sure you 'll find some ) . I have been wondering when this trend will die out , but its really peaking now . I walked into Buckle recently and checked out the shirts . Just about every brand had some sort of ornate flourishing on it . Yeah , its like the make it cool button . But the people behind Affliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . ) Their shirt quality . They have access to specialty apparel manufacturers ( possibly overseas ) to custom distress , dye , sew , and print their shirts . Word on the street is Affliction gets their shirts cut and sewn by JS Apparel . Printed by Massive Prints and dyed by LA Dye and Wash House . <p> 4 . ) Their marketing owns you . They have countless Hollywood celebrities wearing their gear . And that probably means more to the general public ( those that drop $30 for a t-shirt ) than the actual design itself . I am going to make a judgment call and say that a lot of teens at the mall are more concerned with impressing their friends than the art on the shirt . They are more apt to buy into the marketing and celebrity influence than most . Having such a large group of celebrities really does influence what the ignorant public thinks about your brand . A lot of clothing company startups try to sponsor the most popular bands they can because they know they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it DOES have an influence on sales . This kind of thing matters to the general public ( surprise ? ) . " Fall Out Boy wears this brand so I must wear it too ! " <p> 5 . ) They are setting the standard for this new generation of t-shirt printing . 5 years ago , you could n't go to your local screenprinter and have stuff printed and customized to the extent that Affliction does . You still cant today ( realistically speaking ) , which is changing . Affliction is making this kind of customization popular . With everyone being a designer these days , everyone wants to start a clothing company . The DIY revolution is beginning to take off and individuals are now finding resources that only large corporations had . Its still not that easy to get this stuff done , but its out there if you look hard enough ( and can afford it ) . <h> Changing the Industry <p> I remember a year and a half ago trying to get Jakprints to do some " specialty " printing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They tried a few techniques that they use , like discharge inks and bigger prints , but it was n't as easy as it seemed . Even today , your typical screenprinting shop wont be able to do it . But the more popular these brands like Affliction get , they will force printers to step up their game and offer these services . But even today , there are only a small percentage of apparel brands with access to this kind of service . <p> So apparently , Affliction is sort of becoming a role model for clothing companies that want to appeal to the metal and hard rock scene . Even if you 're not a fan of this brand , you have to respect what it is doing for the industry . Inspiring tons of designers to get off their ass and start creating . Its also inspiring tons of entrepreneurs and business men to try and capitalize on this fad while its pretty much still young . So its natural that we have about 1 or 2 requests a week from different companies that want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is one brand that is consistently mentioned . I am sure other designers reading this get this request too . <h> Advice to Bands and Clothing Companies <p> I can offer some advice to bands and clothing companies that are asking us to " Make it look like Affliction " : Be prepared to pay for it ( hand drawn illustration takes us lots of time ) and make sure you have the resources to be able to print and produce what we design for you . Nothing is worse than spending 15 hours designing a t-shirt that will never be printed because of either A ) budget or B ) lack of resources and know how . Do not just flat out copy Affliction , I hate that . Affliction is doing some good things , but we hate to copy other peoples work . We encourage bands and clothing companies to understand Afflictions success formula and adapt it to their own unique vision . <h> Advice to Designers <p> Us designers can change the way a t-shirt is perceived . It does n't  have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the box " and really challenge what you know about t-shirt design . Educate your clients on the possibilities and do n't  just give in and copy and paste what someone else already did . One of the best things about Affliction is that they 're hand drawn . I understand not everyone can draw , but to those than can , do it . Youll be surprised . As I tell myself when I 'm struggling to come up with a design : " Just fucking draw it !

@@98562303 @2762303/ <h> Tutorial : Animating Birds with After Effects <p> Like a lot of motion designers I spend many hours trying to accomplish complex animations in a short amount of time , while attempting to optimize my workflow within After Effects , Photoshop , and Illustrator . This tutorial utilizes Trapcodes Particular , which is one of After Effects more popular 3rd party plugins . Creating an animation like a flock of birds is very versatile and is a great filler animation which can add a lot of style to a piece . You can also adapt this technique to create other flying creatures . perhaps a flying skull with flapping wings ? <p> here 's a short clip of the Go Media promo reel that utilizes the bird animation that you will learn to create . ( To view the entire promo reel , click here and scroll down to the bottom of the tutorial ) . <p> So what we are going to do is create a flock of birds in After Effects using Trapcodes plugin , Particular . <p> 1 . Open up After Effects Create a composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something similar to this : <p> 2 . Set up your Wing Layers Once you have your composition set up , create two new solid white layers both about 300+300 pixels . Name one of them " right wing " and the other " left wing . " <p> 3 . Create your Bird Shape in Illustrator . We need to create our wings which will be animated in After Effects ( AE ) . All you need is a silhouette of a bird shape . So you can draw this yourself in Illustrator . Fortunately , Go Media has already done the job in their " Flock of Birds " vector pack . So once you have your bird created , simply click and select the shape like so : <p> 4 . Paste the shape into After Effects as a Mask So , with your bird path selected in Illustrator go to Edit&gt;copy . Now , go back to your opened after effects project , select the " right wing " layer and Paste in the path by either hitting " Comand/Control+V " or by going to Edit&gt;paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " layer as well . <p> 5 . Remove half of the bird and line up the anchor point Now you have the bird shape copied into After Effects as a mask . You can turn off the " left wing " layer for now . Now you will have to delete some points from your mask because we only want half of the bird on each of our wing layers . Be aware of where you put the mask shape in relation to the solid layers anchor point . <p> You will want to to have the center of the birds body to be right on top of the anchor point . An easy way not to screw this up is to just move the mask , NOT the layer . Select the mask and hit " Command/Control+T " to free transform the mask around the layer . Notice on the images below where the anchor point is . <p> So once you have the right half of the bird assembled , you 'll want to turn on the " left wing " layer and do the same to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it completes the bird shape . And remember to move the mask NOT the layer . We want the anchor points to practically be in the same place on both the layers . Once you are done you should have something like this . Notice the anchor points . <p> 6 . Turn both layers into 3D Layers Now for the fun part ! Turn both " wing " layers into 3D layers by clicking the switch/button that looks like a 3D box . <p> 7 . Expressions instead of Keyframes Now instead of keyframing the wing layers to make them appear like they are flapping , we are going to add in some expressions . This is n't a tutorial on expressions so I wont really get into how they work . In a nutshell , expressions use math and scripts to animate certain properties of a layer . And that 's exactly what we are going to do use expressions to animate our wings . Easy huh ? <p> So , twirl down the transform properties of the " right wing " layer . Create an expression on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click " on the stopwatch icon next to " Y rotation " property . You should see something like this : <p> Now , you 'll want to replace the text in the expression to read : 60*Math.sin(15*time) <p> On the " left wing " layer create an expression on the Y rotation as well . Except this one will be : -thisComp.layer ( " right wing " ) . rotationY <p> Your layers should now look like this : <p> 8 . Add in a Null Object to control movement Now that you 've added those expressions , your bird should at least be flapping . What we are going to do now is add in a null object layer to control the entire movement of the bird . <p> Go to layer&gt;new and create a new Null Object . Rename the null object to " center " . Turn this into a 3D layer by clicking the button that looks like a 3D box . Now parent your other two wing layers to this new null object layer . If you do not see the Parent column you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column from the list . <p> Once you parented the layers to the " center " layer , we will need to change some of the parameters of the " center " layer and add some more expressions . <p> 9 . More Expressions Twirl down the transform properties of the " center " layer and make sure the rotation parameters are as follows : <p> X Rotation = -84 Y Rotation = 0 Z Rotation = 183 approximate <p> Now , create an expression on the " X Rotation " that reads : wiggle(3,70,1,1,10+time) Create an expression on the " Y Rotation " that reads : wiggle(2,50,1) <p> Now all of your layers and bird comp should look something like this . <p> Once you 've got your comp and layers looking like this .. and your bird is flapping away in 3D space , well need to create a new comp which well actually have the Particular emitting our flapping bird . <p> 10 . Use the Particular Plugin <p> So , create a new composition like this one and make sure that the background of this composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be black or white because our birds will be one of those colors . You can change the background color of a composition by hitting " command/control + shift + B " . Or go to **25;782;TOOLONG Color . <p> Create a new solid layer and name it particles . <p> Create a new solid layer and name it background , turn this layer off for now . <p> Create a new camera . <p> Now drag the bird composition from the project window into the " main " composition that we just made . Turn off the pre-composed bird layer by hitting the eye icon . <p> Make sure all of your layers are the length of the composition or at least as long as you want them in frame . Although the bird comp layer is turned off , in order to see the custom particles that we will be emitting , the bird comp layer needs to " in frame " in the timeline . Your " main " composition should look like this now . <p> 11 . Apply the effect to your " particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Particular effect to the " particles " layer and start emitting our custom particles . Select the " particles " layer and go to **32;809;TOOLONG . Now that the effect is applied , twirl down the parameters for the effect . You should see 7 main categories and should look like this : <p> 12 . Customize your settings <p> Twirl down the " particle " tab and let 's customize our system . You will want the " particle type " to be set to " Custom Colorize . " When you select that option the grayed out " custom " twirl down should be available now . Twirl down the " custom " tab and have the layer set to " 4 . Bird " ( the pre-comp bird layer ) . The time sampling should be on " Random-loop " and the subframe sampling should be set to " off . " Because our particle type is set to " custom colorize , " you will be able to change the color of the birds just by simply choosing the color in the particle tab . Your particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twirl down the " Emitter " tab . Here is what your parameters should look like for this section : <p> Now let 's take a look at the " physics " tab of this effect . This is where we can determine wind resistance , wind direction , and turbulence for our flock of birds . You will want the " physics Model " to be set to " Air " . Twirl down the " Air " tab . Everything should be set to " zero " except for " Spin Frequency " which can be set to " 0.5 " . Twirl down the " Turbulence Field " tab . The more you " Affect Position , " the more irregular the birds flight will seem . The setting I use are as follows : <p> 14 . Motion Blur Almost finished now . One last section of the Particular effects that we need to go over is the " motion blur . " I generally have this set to " comp settings " but you can experiment with this on your own . I actually think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I think the motion blur actually takes away a lot of the detail in these birds . And I think if you 're putting on a motion blur you do not need to be using the Go Media Vector pack shape . You could then just use a simple shape that you made right in After Effects with the pen tool . My motion blur settings look like this : <p> 15 . Tweak your camera settings You also want to make sure that your camera is positioned in a place where you 'll be able to see these particles . You should have your z depth somewhere around " -250 " My camera settings look like this : <p> 16 . Tweak the amount of birds Now we are going to make 2 keyframes in the emitter tab of the Paricular effect . So at about 7 frames on your timeline keyframe the " Particles / sec " to be about 100 . Then move to the 9th frame and keyframe the particles / sec to be " zero " . This will let out no more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your comp should now look like this : <p> 17 . Add a simple background The last thing we need to do is add in a background . So turn on the " background " layer that had you turn off . Select the layer and go to **26;843;TOOLONG . Now within the ramp effect choose 2 nice sky blue colors and create a nice sky type gradient . Now that you 've done that you are finished and should have created a beautiful flock of birds . <p> Here is the entire Go Media show reel that features use of the bird animation throughout :

I asked what the view was from the front lines of the printing industry and got some surprising responses . <p> For example , we receive tons of emails from designers wanting to know where to find a good " All Over " printer to produce their huge design . The over-sized t-shirt has been extremely popular for awhile now in communities like emptees . <p> That 's why it surprised me when Corey from Raw Talent said that the over-sized t-shirts might be on their way out . He sees <p> " designs pulling back from the large , over-sized , gaudy prints ( a la Affliction/Ed Hardy ) to a more subtle piece that still makes as big of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes Corey with the decidedly simple answer " Simple sells " .

Plus , they see it from a different angle they see the good , the bad , and they know which designs actually move off the shelves . They work with fantastic veteran designers and complete newcomers . When I asked them what advice they would give to a young designer , they did n't  hold back . <p> Understanding the limitations of apparel print techniques while still maximizing the potential of the medium was an overriding theme echoed by the experts . T-shirts are not posters , brochures , or websites . Youve got to account for the medium . <p> A formal ( or industry ) education is the best thing a designer can have in their arsenal . It is very unfortunate when an artists vision does not line up with technical capabilities . The more knowledge of these capabilities by the designer and how to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product as well as a more efficient and effective production experience. -Corey Bramlett <p> Jeff Weisenberg shares some specific things to avoid when designing for apparel . These are the kinds of things that might take a designer a few strikeouts to learn so take notes ! <p> The biggest mistake young designers make is not taking into consideration that a t-shirt is not flat . A t-shirt is 3-dimensional and you must think about what graphics and placements would look like when the apparel is being worn . Be aware that extremely detailed areas in an image may be lost when applied to the t-shirts . Also use the color of the apparel in your graphic ! You may be able to save a couple bucks by using the apparel color instead of adding another ink color . Jeff Weisenberg <p> A couple of the guys really underscored the importance of knowing your audience &amp; designing for a niche . Heres what Rodney Blackwell had to say : <p> Know your niche . Whether you 're into robots or funny slogans , the more you can master your " thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run . -Rodney Blackwell <h> File Prep Tips from the Pros <p> Yes , this is a complex topic that could fill several other posts . Still , I was curious what kind of major problems screen printers would like to rant about if asked . Following these basic tips will save you time &amp; money and make sure that your vision actually makes it to the presses . <p> Vector-created art is by far the best . Any Photoshop file must be at least 300 dpi . All text should be converted to outlines . Submission on a template is always best . Make sure all designs are the correct size , or if vector , the correct size is noted . Make sure all ink colors/PMS are noted in the art file . It is also great to see special notes noted in the art file . -Corey Bramlett <p> Jeff Weiseberg wisely suggested that you invest in a Pantone guide . I checked around , you can grab one on eBay or Amazon for between $30 and $70 a worthwhile investment . <h> Make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So you see a shirt on our portfolio and think " Thats impossible to print ! " Well , actually , it can be done you just need the right process ( and budget ! ) . <p> There are enough techniques , processes &amp; options out there to make your head spin like the girl in the Exorcist . Personally , I am pretty clueless about the all the different processes , compatible materials , average costs everything . There is a lot to learn , but if there was one point that resonated among the printing experts , it was take the time to understand this stuff . <p> For a very detailed knowledge base of apparel printing techniques , check out this section of T-ShirtForums.com ( resume head spinning &amp; swearing in other languages ) . If you 're starting from scratch all of this info probably seems a little daunting . So I asked our panel to narrow it down for us what are the main techniques that are gaining popularity ? <p> Here are the trendy techniques according to Corey Bramlett : <p> Soft-hand ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the most requested and produced by us . Over-sized printing is obviously very popular . The best way to choose is to get as educated as possible about the techniques and processes . We even offer a really cool service call we call " Print Architecture " where we help designers " build " their piece maximizing the effectiveness of our specialty methods. -Corey Bramlett <p> I asked Corey for some more details about " Print Architecture " , but did n't  hear back in time . Ill update the post when new details emerge . I actually stumbled upon a great resource on one of Raw Talents subsites , FashionLab . This Methods Page categorizes print techniques with designer-friendly lingo , making it pretty easy to understand . <p> Back in January , Rodney Blackwell participated in the The Imprinted Sportswear Show at Long Beach . He suggests that one of the best ways to learn about printing techniques is to attend a trade show &amp; see the stuff demonstrated in person ( not to mention cracking jokes &amp; shaking hands ) . <p> At these shows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close and personal . You can see all the specialty screen printing inks and how they are used to make cool effects on t-shirts . You 'll see the advances that digital printing has made .

On top of that , you 'll get a first hand look at the latest fashion blank t-shirt brands and styles , with a chance to feel the quality first hand . This can be a HUGE help when trying to find that perfect blank t-shirt to compliment your designs. -Rodney Blackwell <h> Ok . So who wants to print my 14 color design ? <p> Not all print shops are created equal . Youve probably discovered this while shopping around and wondering how everyone else does it .

@@98562332 @2762332/ <p> Great now we 're finally into fontlab . This is pretty much the easiest part of the entire process , so no worries . First thing you need to do is open a new font . Go to File , New and a window will pop up with a bunch of different characters : uppercase , lowercase , and various other characters . If you double click any of the windows with a character in them , you will be able to add in your own design . When the character is grayed out that means there is n't any information there . <p> Now all you need to do is copy the character in Illustrator and paste it into Fontlab . Something to keep in mind is you may have to look around for your letter after you 've pasted it into the window . Usually it wo n't perfectly paste near the grid lines . You may need to move around the canvas and grab the letter and move it to the grid area . Just make sure that you are selecting all the nodes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click and drag to select all of the nodes at the same time . If you 'd like to select only one node than all you need to do is click one at a time , pretty simple right ! <p> Something that I love so much about fontlab is that each node is given x and y coordinates , so it 's easy to move around the nodes perfectly into place . You can move the nodes using the arrow tools on your keyboard . If you hold down the shift and arrow key together you can move an object much faster . If you 'd like to work on another letter you just close out of the character window you 're working in and double click on another one . Continue copying and pasting your letters into each of the windows until you have imported your entire font . <p> Wow , you 're so close to finishing up this font it 's scary ! You 'll notice that there are dashed lines on each side of a letter ; these are to help with kerning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between the stroke and the dashed line , I use this all the time . So how exactly do you figure out the right spacing for your letters ? I have to admit that I am not a kerning pro but I have a little recipe that I 've gotten from my book , Designing Type , that I 've found really helpful . It really helps you to understand how letters work together and breaks down pretty much every letters characteristics . I would really recommend buying the book because there are lots of useful tid bits on how to make a kick ass font . Below is the formula that I follow whenever I am working on the kerning for a font . <h> Spacing Capital Letters <p> 1- Set the left and right sidebearings of the H. Each sidebearing is 25-50 percent of the width between the inside of the strokes . Sans serifs have tighter spacing than serif fonts. 2- Test the sidebearings of the H by setting the word HHHH ' . The letters should be harmonious " not too open or cramped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sidebearings are slightly less than the sidebearings of the H. 4- Test the O by setting the word HOH ' . The O should appear balanced between the two H forms , and the color of the word should be even . If not , revise the sidebearings of the O. 5- Re-test the O by setting the word HHOOHH ' . Again , all six letters should be harmonious , and the color of the word should be even . If not , revise the sidebearings of the O. The initial H may also require readjustment. 6- Once the H and O are satisfactory , the other upper case sidebearings can be set as follows : Diagonal and open letters with minimum space : 4-A-4 4-V-4 4-W-4 4-X-4 4-Y-4 4-T-4 4-J-1Straight sided letters with heavy verticals : 1-D-5 1-P-5 1-R-4 1-L-4 1-K-4 1-B-3 1-E-3 1-F-3 1-U-2 1-I-1Straight sided letters with light verticles : 2-N-2 2-M-1Letters with round sides : 5-Q-5 5-C-3 5-G-2Letters with a central spine : 3-Z-3 *-S-* <p> 1 Equal to the sidebearing of the H 2 Slightly less than the sidebearing of the H 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 Equal to the sidebearing of the O *Must be adjusted visually <h> Spacing Lower Case Letters <p> 1- Set the left and right sidebearings of the n . The right sidebearing will be slightly thinner than the left , since the arched corner is lighter than the vertical stem . The left sidebearing is 25-50% of the n counter . 2- Test the sidebearings of the n by setting the word nnnn ' . The word should be even in color , and neither tight nor loose . 3- Set the left and right sidebearings of the o . The sidebearings of the o are smaller than those of the n. 4- Test the o by setting the word non ' . The o should appear balanced between the n forms , and the color of the word should be even . If not , revise the sidebearings of the o. 5- Re-test the o by setting the following words : nnonn ' nnonon ' nnoonn ' Adjust sidebearings of the o and/or n as necessary . 6- Once the n and o are satisfactory , the other lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with minimum space : 4-v-4 4-w-4 4-x-4 4-y-4Letters with short vertical stems : 1-r-4 1-m-2 1-j-1 2-u-2Letters with tall vertical stems : 1-b-5 3-p-5 3-k-4 3-l-2 3-h-2 3-i-1Letters with round sides : 5-c-6 5-e-6 5-q-1 5-d-1Irregularly shaped letters : *-g-* *-a-* *-s-* *-z-* *-f-* *-t-* <p> 1 Equal to the left sidebearing of the n 2 Equal to the right sidebearing of the n 3 Slightly more than the left sidebearing of the n 4 Minimum sidebearing 5 Equal to the sidebearing of the o 6 Slightly less than the sidebearing of the o * Must be adjusted visually . <p> Ok , now our kerning is complete ! This is pretty tedious but it 's so important to get a nicely kerned font , I would say that it is equally as important as a nicely designed font . If your font is hard to read then who will want to use it ? So to test out your kerning abilities open up quick test to see how the kerning looks . To open up quick test go to tools &gt; quick test as &gt; Open Type TT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your font would look all typed out . You can highlight the text and add in your own . A good sentence to test out is : The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog . This will give you a good idea of how the characters will work in a sentence . You can also grab some Lorem Ipsum online to test out whole paragraphs . Print out a variety of sizes so you can see how the letters work large and small . REALLY scrutinize the font at this point . You want to make sure that it 's easy to read . If it burns out your eyeballs you should probably keep working on the kerning . <p> Once you get something you feel proud of , you 're done . My test is that if I want to show the project to everyone I know , that means I did a sweet job . Fonts are n't  as easy to make as some people may think , it has taken me weeks to finish a font . You should be really proud of yourself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorials if you have questions please feel free to email me . If I 'm not too slammed with design projects I 'd be happy to help critique fonts or answer any questions . Thanks for sticking it out and getting through this marathon of a tutorial !

@@98562348 @2762348/ <h> 13 ways to trick your client into happiness <p> In an ideal world our clients would think like designers . In an ideal world our clients have a good knowledge of marketing . In an ideal world they think logically and communicate clearly . Well folks , this is not an ideal world . And , unfortunately , our clients do not think like a designer . They do n't  necessarily know the basics of marketing or branding . They are not designers . That 's why they 've hired us . <p> Now , if we could just get them to trust us . Well , that 's not going to happen . So , what 's left ? I 've got It ! Well TRICK them . Yeah , that 's the ticket . <p> I 've developed a few techniques over the years that help me " trick " my customers . These tricks are for both of our benefit . I trick them into picking the best design and trick them into being happy . Its a win-win . <p> 1 . Lower your customers expectations . Ok , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to suck . " But I AM suggesting that you set your customer up with realistic expectations . Do n't  promise the world . And if they 're ASKING for the world you need to be honest with them about what you can accomplish . Even at the risk of losing a project I really hammer home exactly what we can accomplish so the customer knows what to expect . <p> 2 . Limit your concepts . Its natural to think that giving your customer 8 logo concepts is better than giving them 4 , but is it ? First off , the customer is relying on you to give him or her the best options . You should be the one narrowing down the options to the best few . Whatever you decide to show your customer , be prepared for him or her to pick your LEAST favorite option they always do . Secondly , too many options can be very confusing . There are too many possibilities , too many styles , too many choices to be made . In my experience 3-5 concepts is optimal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they have a good choice while still controlling the situation . <p> 3 . Clients like shiny color stuff better than black and white stuff . Its unfortunate that clients are influenced by " bling " ( color , gel , gloss , drop shadows and lens flares ) but they are . If you have two concepts to pitching to a client and the first one is an AMAZING concept that you 've sketched out in pencil and the second concept is mediocre at best , but its polished , full color with gel effect and drop shadows , can you guess which concept the customer is going to pick ? They 're going to pick the color one every time . They cant imagine how cool the pencil-sketched concept is going to look . They only see a pencil sketch . So , if you want to steer the client to a particular design sell it ; add that color , add the gel , whatever . Make sure the one you really want them to pick looks just a little bit better than the others . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person if possible . If something bad happens do n't  try to hide it . Just be honest immediately . A mistake that YOU point out is twenty times better than a mistake that THEY discover . Let 's say you designed a flyer and misspelled a word . Do n't  quietly pray that they wo n't find it , because THEY WILL . A hundred people will point it out to them . Bring it up , apologize and offer a solution . I will frequently offer free design services if I 've made a mistake . This allows me to keep their money in my bank and simply " work-off " my mistakes . Also , clients can get really nasty through e-mail . If you 've made a mistake get them on the phone . They will always be much nicer if they 're actually on the phone or meeting with you in person . <p> 5 . Beware of " scope creep . " Some clients like to make changes as you go through the design process . Do n't  let this slide without saying something ! Every time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describe how the change will affect the design process and establish a new set of expectations . Now , I 'm not talking about changes like : " Please add the word From to the first sentence . " I 'm talking about when a customer says : " Hey I would like to add a photo gallery to my website . " In that scenario you need to say : " Ok , but we will miss our deadline if we are going to do that additional work . Also , it will cost $XXX.XX more dollars . " <p> 6 . Narrow down options . If , even after all these tricks , my customer is proving hard to please , I will try to narrow the design decisions down . For instance , can we settle on a color scheme ? Can we focus on just picking a font ? Can we decide on the principle image they want me to use ? I might make them come to a decision on these item outside of the design itself . So , the next time I 'm working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and images to use . Then I only need to make the layout work . <p> 7 . Only work with the decision maker . Frequently you 're not even working with the person making the decisions . You 're working with the lackey that 's between you and the decision maker . I really fight to try and work directly with the guy/gal that 's calling the shots . Otherwise you 'll be doing everything twice once for the lackey , then again for the decision maker . <p> 8 . When working with groups ; elect a leader . Similar to rule #7 is working with groups . Sometimes the group does n't  even know who the leader is . So , you 'll be getting different feedback from different people in the group . I request any group to elect one person to do all the communicating with me . That way , when the leader collects the feedback from the five other people in the group , they will realize that its all different . Bob says change the color to blue . Susan says change the color to white . Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense . <p> 9 . Touch base if the project is running long or starting late . If I 'm not moving real fast through a project , or if the start of a project has been delayed I 'll drop my client an e-mail . Basically I 'll say something like : " Hey Bob , I just wanted to let you know that I got swamped and will be starting your project on Thursday . Sorry for the delay . We should still meet your deadline , no problem . " This pro-active approach is always much better than having to answer their question : " What 's going on with my project ? " <p> 10 . Educate your customers . I know this is a tough one , but you have to try anyway . When a customer asks me to do something that is not good design I will take the time to explain why MY way is more effective that THEIR way . It takes some tact to communicate this without ruffling feathers , so be gentle . <p> 11 . Do n't  fight with your customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the customer what they want even if its a miserable design . If you 're asked to design something in a way that you know is terrible , you should make your case , try to teach them and give them better design options . But , at the end of the day , if they 've got their heart set on something ( even if its an ugly mess of a design ) Give it to them . <p> 12 . Give a little extra . If you just do one small little extra task and let them know about it , theyll be very grateful . It does n't  have to be a lot of work . It can be something very small . But it should be outside of the work that was agreed upon . A quick note to the customer might read something like this : " Hey Bob , I noticed that the logo you provided me had a little scratch through it . I removed that and cleaned up the lines on it . This was not part of the project scope , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No charge for this additional service . " <p> 13 . Say Thank you . Amazing . All I need to know I really DID learn in kindergarten . Theyve done studies on the power of a " thank-you . " Disgruntled customers can be magically transformed into satisfied customers with the mere muttering of the words : " Thank You . " So , thank your customers for their business . Thank them when they make a payment . Thank them when they buy you a beer . <p> With that said , thank you for taking the time to read our blog . I hope this has been helpful to you in some way . If you have more helpful hints for keeping your customers happy please add a comment . <p> I grew up in Cleveland Hts .

@@98562357 @2762357/ <h> Killin it at Your Next Kickoff Meeting <h> How to Run a- Successful Graphic Design Kickoff Meeting <p> Any great project starts with a great kick-off meeting . For this reason , designers must know what it takes to participate in a successful one , including how to dress , look , act and express themselves . Today , were sharing some tips we share with young designers about kicking a** in kick-off meetings . We hope they help you , as well . <p> 1 . Be Prepared . A designer must read through the proposal , creative brief and do research on the client . You must come across like you KNOW about the project . If a client tells a sales person all about their business , then the designer comes in and asks all the same questions the client is going to get angry and feel like were not communicating internally ! This is a bad way to start a project off ! <p> 2 . Have a list of questions ready to go before the meeting . Whether you 're selling or having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of questions . Coming up with good questions on the spot is hard . Hopefully , as you do your research and read through the creative brief some questions will come to mind . Fortunately , Go Media has been doing this for some time , so we do have a boilerplate document filled with common questions . So , we never have to go in cold , but this is no excuse to not do research . The more detailed your questions , the more it will show the client you give a damn and will help your design process . This is your BEST OPPORTUNITY to start brainstorming design ideas and to pick the customers brain about what they want . So , take this opportunity and do it RIGHT because its easier to get your designs right in the first place instead of having the client displeased and have to do them again ! <p> 3 . Make them like you ! This is a VERY powerful design tool . Did you know that if your clients like you , they are more likely to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get a client to like you ? Be friendly . Look for opportunities to connect with them on common interests . If you like fishing and they like fishing and that comes up during the meeting awesome talk about fishing for a while ! Tell a joke . Show them pictures of your kids whatever it takes . Get the client on your side ! <p> 4 . Match the clients body language and energy . This relates somewhat to the previous item . You want to make your clients comfortable ! A great way to do that is to match their personality . If they are stiff and all business , you should be too . If they 're laid back and want to talk about their kids for an hour do it . If they talk fast and have high energy , you should talk fast and have high energy . <p> 5 . Watch your own body language ! You are subtly communicating to your clients based on your body language . Are you focused on them or staring off into space ? Are you biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouching in your chair ? Sit upright , be alert and LISTEN CAREFULLY . Your body language should be saying : " I care about you ! I am alert and listening intently . THIS is important to me . " <p> 6 . Dress the part. - Show your client that you care and kick it up a notch for the kick-off . This is just another way to show your client that you have an interest in their project . <p> 7 . Take detailed notes . Unless you have a photographic memory , you 're sure to forget something was discussed . Even hand-written notes are unreliable . If you do prefer to hand-write notes go straight to your desk after the meeting and transcribe them onto your computer . <p> After the kick-off meeting is done , do n't  forget to sincerely thank your client for their time . Throughout your working relationship , continue to connect with them and show them you care , carrying these tips with you even if you 're not face-to-face with your client . Good luck everyone ! 17219 @qwx877219 17218 @qwx877218 17225 @qwx877225

Hitting it off immediately , they quickly discovered they had much in common . - States Artman , " Weve got family in the same small town outside of Pittsburgh , we had been to a number of the same local music events - " and more importantly , we both knew that a little hard work goes a long way . As a photographer and a designer looking at a pretty uninviting job market , it seemed almost natural to just start doing something fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , would n't I be better off making no money doing something I 'm really passionate about ? ' " <p> Noah Purdy and Michael Artman <p> One crazy idea turned into another and soon , Purdy and Artmans brilliant plan unfolded : The Rustbelt Almanac , a quarterly magazine about the industrious people of their region . - A nod to Americas sprawling Rust Belt , an area stretching from the Northeast across the Midwest , and into parts of the Upper South , is inherent not only in the title , but also the theme of their publication . - Artman characterizes their community by its work ethic : industrious people who " value hard work and are n't  afraid to take risks to do the things they love to do . " <p> But where to start ? The two immediately began brainstorming about what and whom to feature in their first issue . " There are so many great things going on in the region that it was admittedly hard to decide on what to feature in our inaugural pages . " <p> Enter Brandon Rike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January a particularly cold day in January with wind chills below zero . Brandon Rike was kind enough to bring us in out of the cold and tell us his story over some nice warm lattes . He was the second person we interviewed , and the timing couldnt have been better . That guy is one of the most passionate artists weve ever met . The amount of work he gets done in a single day is impressive , and his drive certainly kept us inspired in the coming months . " <p> Brandon Rike / Fiks <p> They also found Pittsburgh based company Fiks:Reflective , who manufactures passive safety gear for cyclists , and does so with style . The rest fell in line reports Artman , " Weve got grocery store owners , musicians , photographers , and even folks who recently opened a new brewery . So yeah , there really is something for everyone in the first issue . These are people that value hard work and are n't  afraid to take risks to do the things they love to do . These are stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be shared . " <p> These industrious makers from their community whom they featured not only gave them great content , but wonderful support as well . - This backing from- the community , as well as from family , friends and artists all over the country , who came together to fully fund Rustbelt Almanac- through Kickstarter , was huge , stresses Artman . " We think folks in the community are just excited to see us out there shining the spotlight on people who deserve recognition for their hard work . So in that regard , we 've been blessed and have avoided a lot of stress . Relatively speaking , the ride has been a lot smoother than it really should have been . " <p> A spotlight on the Rust Belt region is due too , because of the opportunity it gave Artman and Purdy. - Compared to bigger cities New York , L.A. , Altman feels " the opportunities that await driven individuals is unparalleled . So many media outlets- focus on the dilapidation , but what we really have is opportunity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or renovate an old storefront for the fraction of what it would cost in say , New York City you 've got that much more money left over to fund the things that actually matter . " <p> Artman continues , " Beyond that , as more people open businesses in these cities , you get a lot of camaraderie . If you and your neighbor both opened up shop within the past few years , its like , were in this together ' . Competition goes right out the window . No one is going to visit a neighborhood with one business in it . Helping your neighbors succeed brings more people around , and the more people , the better . The sense of community that this resurgence is fostering is fantastic . " <p> Like any new venture , they ran into some challenges . " Admittedly neither of us knew the first thing about independent publishing , " reports Artman , and- " from delays on shipping supplies , to ruining entire rolls of film , to trying to find financially viable methods to manage our subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run into any issues that are insurmountable , and that 's mainly thanks to all the great people we 've met through this process . Almost every time we hit a snag , someone is willing to jump in and say " Hey , I 've dealt with this issue before , let 's solve it together . " <p> So now that- Issue 1 , is out in the world , on coffee tables and design studios like Go Media , what can we expect ? What are the challenges involved with a print publication like Rustbelt Almanac in the age of the iPad , when major titles like Newsweek and SPIN are choosing to stop their print editions ? - Artman and Purdy are n't  worried , stating simply , " We definitely do n't believe print is anywhere close to dead . " <p> Although they do offer a digital copy of their publication , they are focusing on the hard copy of Rustbelt Almanac because they believe in the content . " Plenty of publications suggest the shift to digital is because people do n't  buy magazines anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more advertising than content , either . Maybe its not so much that people do n't  like printed goods . Maybe its that printed goods just are n't  as good as they used to be . I 've read plenty of studies that say consumers still prefer physical media . How accurate those studies are remains to be seen , anything can be skewed one way or the other . However , the cost of producing digital media is near zero . From a business standpoint , it is hard not to go that direction . " <p> Call them sentimental , but Purdy and Artman really value the hard copy . - Adds Artman , " Thirty years from now , when our kids or grandkids are sitting around asking what life was like in 2013 , well have to rely on our senile old minds to tell mis-remembered stories . Gone are the days of handing down your 100 year old pocket watch , or pulling some old polaroids out of a shoebox . All we know is that we prefer holding something physical in our hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rustbelt Almanac , we value longevity . Its not even about tradition in any romantic sense . Its simply a fact print lasts longer . Its kind of depressing living in a throw-away culture where every two years you toss your computer or phone or tablet in favor of the latest and greatest . Technology changes too fast , and its far too easy to accept that everything on your hard drive is expendable . " <p> Continues Artman , " We want to make a product that is going to sit on people 's bookshelves . So years down the road when the paper is nice and aged , and the inks have begun to fade , you can open the magazine , and read the stories that your iPad 15 has long forgot . " 17220 @qwx877220

@@98562367 @2762367/ <h> 14 Free Scatter Brushes &amp; How-to <p> I was screen spying on Go Medias Chris Comella as he was working on a Smashing Pumpkins design in which the dense black typography was exploding shards in every direction . He placed every particle by hand ( and it shows ) . I wondered if scatter brushes could be used to get a similar effect . <p> Sometimes I get the feeling that Scatter Brushes do n't  get enough attention in Illustrator . They are actually a pretty powerful tool , especially if you 're trying to achieve a complicated look that could take awhile to make by hand . <p> So here are 14 free brushes , but let 's first take a look at the anatomy of a scatter brush . A new Scatter Brush starts with any vector object you think would look cool scattered along a path . For simplicitys sake , let 's assume this is a circle with a black fill and no stroke . Drag this circle onto the brushes panel and choose " New Scatter Brush " from the available options . <p> You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting these options , it is best to have a sample stroke on your artboard and the " preview " box checked so you can immediately see the effects of your changes . <p> All of these major options have a drop-down menu to the right that selects how the parameter will react . The default setting is " fixed " . The remaining options are Random , Pressure , Stylus Wheel , Tilt , Bearing , and Rotation . A little explanation on these options first . <h> Parameter Settings <p> 1 . Random : Creates a brush that varies randomly within a defined range . Now you 'll see two sliders instead of one , and the brush reacts randomly along the path between that range . If you do n't  have a wacom , then you 're going to have to settle for Random settings for variety . ( Also , get your Wacom set-up properly by following this guide ) Otherwise , check out all these ways to get some more expression out of your Scatter Brushes:2 . Pressure : Creates a brush that varies in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting is really only useful with the Size parameter , and can give really confusing results when used with other parameters.3 . Stylus wheel : This one is pretty confusing . From what I understand it changes the diameter of the brush in relation to the stylus wheel on a digital pen . Does anybody have a Wacom with a scroll wheel ? Am I missing something ? I would just stay away from this setting.4 . Tilt : Creates a brush that varies in response to the angle of tilt between your Wacom and the tablet surface.5 . Bearing : Very cool ! This setting is great to use with the rotation parameter , and varies the brush based on where the tip of the brush is pointing.6 . Rotation : Also a good option to use with the Rotation parameter , it varies the brush based on how you are twisting the wacom pen along the z axis . <p> Ok , on to the parameters themselves . <h> Parameters <p> 1 . Size controls the size of objects along the stroke.2 . Spacing controls how much space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much space there is between objects perpendicular to the path.4 . Rotation controls how the objects are oriented relative to the page or the path . <p> I usually start settings each to random and with ranges similar to the screenshot below . Then I go back and experiment with the pressure and tilt settings for the Wacom . <p> Okay , let 's get back to creating your Scatter Brush . A good first attempt at getting the settings right is to set all parameters to Random and a medium range . How does that look ? The two parameters that I find need the most fine tuning are Size and Spacing . If your scatter brush looks too thin , try moving the range of sizes higher and moving the range of spacing lower . <p> In the free download there are 14 Scatter Brushes to get you started . One of coolest brushes in the freebie is a splatter brush , which allows you to paint a splatter along a path ; that 's a lot of control . You 'll also find circles , shards , sticks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included is the little particle explosion from the preview image made up entirely of the scatter brushes in the freebie . <p> Double click the brushes to see each ones settings . The way I have them is just a starting point go ahead and customize them to your own style . You might be surprised how different a brush can look with a few changes to those sliders . <p> When trying to make something crazy with scatter brushes my best advice is to layer , layer , layer . For the preview image I laid down a bed of dark colored brushes , then some white ones on top , then some more dark . I 'm sure you 'll come up with something cooler and show it off in our User Showcase. 17223 @qwx877223

This is a great way to avoid buster , " aka " bad , clients . Our deposit is tied to our contract , so by paying the deposit , the clients have agreed to our terms . We suggest that you also hold off work until a contract has been signed . This not only protects both parties , but gives both of you a feeling of trust as you move forward . <p> If you 're not getting paid , stop working . <p> Clients get busy and forget to pay now and then . When this happens , well just simply resend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email . This is also a wonderful opportunity to check-in with the client and ask how they like how the work you are creating ! <p> We have , unfortunately , had to stop working on projects for a short time when a client has been repeatedly late with their payments .

@@98562371 @2762371/ <h> Print Technique : Reflecting on Strike-Through Varnish <p> When most of us want to add additional flair to our print project , we automatically look for elaborate finishing processes to help us accomplish this , forgetting that a well-designed spot varnish can really take the perception of quality and design up a few notches . Unfortunately , most people look to spot UV to hit this mark , since its immediately recognizable based on its high-gloss , wet-look appearance . <h> Spot UVs Dirty Little Secret <p> While spot UV truly does produce a beautiful product , its sort of like the Las Vegas of the print world .. all the glamor and glitz , with lots of dirty little secrets .

First , the dull/matte strike-through varnish is put down with a traditional printing plate in the areas that are to stay matte . At the end of our presses , an overall flood of our gloss aqueous coating is applied . <p> As it cures , the gloss coating is dulled down in the areas where the strike-through matte varnish had been applied . Also , since were using a traditional printing plate in a standard print unit on our press , we can achieve as much detail as we want . Otherwise , you have to cut a coating blanket specifically for the areas where you want glossy , and that blanket can only be used for that press run or project . <p> When designing for this , remember that , because its a water-based setup , the contrast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the varnish design on a darker , solid-color background will ensure you get the maximum amount of visual appeal out of this process . <h> Get The Guides <p> For more info on how to setup your spot varnish files , download the PDF of your preference :

And in case you 'd like to find me on the web , you can read my tutorials on PSDTUTS or see more of my work on my Behance portfolio . <h> Introduction <p> In this tutorial , the dreamweavers at Go Media ( Clevelands small business website designers ) are- going to create a 3D Typography based design . All the elements will revolve around the centerpiece and theme : dreaming . The word will dictate the entire layout and control the space by allowing everything else to emerge from within . The trees will grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the word and overshadow the glowing moon . <p> Dreaming often takes you to different places and unites bits and pieces of your memory . It basically takes you to a whole new world , but that is usually made up of real elements . We 'll illustrate this by making everything float in mid air , as if suspended in time , yet maintain realism by using common elements of nature . <p> Naturally , people dream at night , so the overall lighting will be dark and predominated by a cold color palette : cyan and lime green . <p> Also , the typography should have a classic , storytelling look ; one that would complete the eerie atmosphere . <p> Feel free to download the PSD at the bottom of the post that contains the final image . Now that we 've planned everything , let 's begin . <h> Create the 3D text <p> The first thing to do is get this free font called Storybook . It 's a font that fits our context well , and that will look well with 3D decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the first letter of your word and give it this color : 4C3F38 . <p> Now add a 3D effect by going to Effect &gt; 3D &gt; Extrude &amp; Bevel . Play around with the settings yourself to get the angle , lighting and form you want . You can recreate my treatment by using the same settings . Do n't forget to use a Complex 2 ' Bevel . <p> Once you finish the first letter , repeat the process on the remaining letters . The only modifications you should make are to alter the position . Then copy ( Ctrl+C ) each individual letter and paste ( Ctrl+V ) them in Photoshop one at a time . Once you try pasting them , you 'll be prompted to choose a method of importing . Choose the Smart Object ' Option . By doing this you can make simple adjustments at all times to the Illustrator file right inside Photoshop by double clicking the layer icon . <p> Position the letters onto an empty Photoshop canvas . I 'm working at a rather large resolution of approximately 6300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background layer with this color : 17151d . <p> At this point we 'll begin stylizing the letters . Get the Magic Wand Tool ( W ) and make a selection of the letter 's foreground . Right click , select Make Work Path and specify a tolerance level of 1,5 . <p> Now that it 's a work path , we 'll fill it with a color by going to Layer &gt; New Fill Layer &gt; Solid Color . Fill it with white . The path should now be a vector shape . Double click on its layer and give it a bevel . Use the settings shown in the image below and choose the highlight color ( 94aa53 ) and shadow color ( 6c6f64 ) . <p> It 's now time to create a pattern that will cover the front of each letter . I 'm using a Go Media vector freebie : Seamless Swirls . Go on and download it if you have n't already , and open the provided Illustrator file . Change its color to this : 94aa52 and copy ( Ctrl+C ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 235 x 235 px ) and fill the background color with another color : ebe77f . To make it into o a pattern go to Edit &gt; Define Pattern . Your new pattern will be saved in the pattern set that is currently opened . <p> Now that you 've created the pattern , you need to add the pattern to the face of the letter . Double click on the white shape 's layer and add a Layer Style : Pattern Overlay . Your newly created pattern should already be selected . <p> One last touch is a Gradient Map Adjustment Layer that we 'll place on top of the letter 's body . While having the layer selected , go to Layer &gt; New Adjustment Layer &gt; Gradient Map . Then play around with the colors until you get a similar result . My colors , from left to right are : d8c67f , 94aa53 , 262628 , and 141416 . Make sure that the Adjustment Layer Applies only to the letter . To do this , make it a clipping mask for the letter layer by holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now copy the layer style of the letter face and duplicate the Gradient Map . Apply these effects to the remaining letters . <h> Draw the scenery <p> The text is now finished . Let 's add the trees and foliage . This technique I 'm about to show you is what I have developed for myself . It reduces complex imagery to simple shape . A simple splatter , when grouped in a pattern begins to take a certain role , thus resembling an element of nature . You may find it useful or dull , but it 's what we 'll use for this design . <p> All you need is a standard Photoshop round brush and a mouse . Choose one using your Brush Tool ( B ) and input the settings found in the images below . <p> Now that your brush settings are all ready , begin painting a tree . It 's important to know that you should n't create the whole tree with the same brush settings . There is one adjustment you need to make along the way . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see a setting we 're using : Fade . This fades out your brush depending on how much you put in the adjacent field . A Fade set at 100 will end faster than one set at 250 . You can use whatever settings you find appropriate . I used 100 for the trunk , 150 for extensions of the trunk , and 250 for thick branches . As you increase the fade , reduce the brush size at the same time . <p> Continue using this technique in creating the rest of the trees and draw some roots too . Reduce the size considerably for the thin branches and add even more fading when necessary . <p> It 's time for foliage . Prepare a separate brush using these settings . <p> Now begin painting . Begin with a larger size using this green : 94aa53 . In a layer underneath , with a smaller sized brush , paint with a darker green : 55612f . Again over the light green layer , use the same color ( 94aa53 ) with an even smaller size . For highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with this yellow : e3e07d . Here is an image you can use as a reference in creating your own trees . <p> I drew my inspiration from acacia trees , while coming up with the shape of the trunk and volume of the foliage . <p> Following the branches as a reference , draw away ! <p> Add more nature elements now . I added a mountain and a moon . They will give depth to the image , and prevent the composition from being scarce . Use the pen tool ( P ) and create them as vector shapes . <p> Make the mountain fade out on the bottom . An easy way to do it would be to create a new layer on top , clip it to the mountain layer and paint with a large soft brush with the background color . I also added a glow on the moon . To add one yourself , add a layer style : Outer Glow . Keep the standard color , increase its size and reduce the opacity to 25% . <p> Some more improvements include adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadows that stretch across the face of the letters . You can create those in the same way " clip a new layer to the one you want darkened and paint with a soft brush using a dark color . This applies to the mountain , trees and roots . Use a sharp brush to draw the tree shadow though . <h> Finalize the design <p> In order to complete the artistic feel of this design , add this texture to your canvas . Simply paste it on a new layer , over all the other ones . Set the layer 's blending mode to Linear Burn and its opacity to 30% . <p> Now invert the texture ( Ctrl+I ) and change its hue by going to Image &gt; Adjustments &gt; Hue and Saturation . Change the hue to 153 and saturation to -73 . <p> One last touch " add the watercolor texture inside the mountain and moon , once more , with clipping masks . Put their layers on Overlay ( Mountain ) and Multiply ( Moon ) . Adjust the opacity . <p> And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of a kind , dream design . <p> Hey Designers , make sure to check out our- Arsenal Membership , which hooks you up with our huge product library for only $15 per month .

@@98562415 @2762415/ <h> Vintage Typography Tutorial <h> " Historiaster " <p> To illustrate the word " Historiaster " with the meaning of the word reflected in the design . The meaning of the word Historiater is a petty or contemptible historian , and my idea is to create a petty ( yet respectable ) attempt to recreate the vintage type treatments . <h> Research <p> As the idea is to make a petty remake of a classic styling of a historic lettering , its paramount to remain faithful to the styling of the period . The International Association of Mater Penmen , Engrosser and Teachers of Handwriting ( or IAMPETH for short ) has a collection of scanned rare books on penmanship and engrossing in their online collection that is free to the public . <p> One book in particular called The New Zanerian Alphabet has fantastic type specimens within it and we shall use a couple specimens from the book as the starting points for this piece . <h> Sketch <p> From those two specimen you can create a rough composition in Photoshop by cutting and pasting each letter together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched out a rough of the composition to resolve the details and tighten everything . There is some legibility issues with the capital H and the lower case t . <p> A quick preview to the client and she recommended adopting some of the stylistic approach of the Sanborn Insurance Maps for the background . I quite like the look of this particular design for St. Joseph Missouri . <p> Ok , with references collected , were ready to jump on the computer . <h> Step 1 <p> Open up a New document ( G+N ) on Illustrator and Place ( File&gt;Place ) the reference image and change that layer setting using the option menu from the layer panel into template . Create another layer and call it " Type Build " , this is where well construct the letters and general storing area for elements that we want to keep but remain hidden . <p> Open up the ruler bars ( G+R ) and place some guides over the top and bottom of the letters to help us trace the letters . <h> Step 2 <p> Start with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter O and give it a round corners effect through the menu **26;1266;TOOLONG Corners and give it a value of 2mm in this case . <p> *quick tip : You can give similar commands through the Appearance panel Fx option , and you can turn effects on and off here* <p> Draw a couple of small circles with the Ellipse tool ( L ) and with the line tool ( ) draw a line between the centre of the two circles and set it 1.5 pt , now we roughly have the letter O. Make a copy of this letter by dragging and holding the option+shift key . Expand the line and the rectangle on one of the Os youve just created using the menu Object&gt;Expand and place it over the letter S here and draw a diagonal line using the line tool again to create the letter S and expand these line as well . <p> *quick tip : set up your keyboard shortcuts so menu commands are just a multi button press away to increase productivity . Expand is a command that I often use so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the middle line by selecting it and using the Erase tool ( shit+E ) . Tidy up the anchor points between the corresponding diagonal and vertical lines using the direct selection key(A) , once you 've done that select all the white elements and click Unite in the Pathfinder panel then create compound path out of them ( G+8 ) <p> Select both the white and red elements and click minus front on the pathfinder menu to create the basic shape of the S. Copy this across by dragging and holding the option and shift key . <h> Step 4 <p> Select one of the Ss and give it a rounded corner effect **26;1294;TOOLONG corners ( or through the Appearance panel ) and give it a radius value of 1 mm and click ok . Expand this appearance Object&gt;Expand Appearance . <p> Select the other S that has n't  had the effect applied to it and with Erase tool ( shift+E ) erase its middle section by selecting it , holding option and dragging the selection you want to erase . Once you 're done select both Ss and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape on top of the other . Select them both and click Unite on the Pathfinder panel . <h> Step 5 <p> With the Pen tool draw up some accents on the tips of the letter S , the best thing about this is that if you add a rectangle on one side and delete the the accent Ive just made and unite them using the Pathfinder menu I would get a letter a and e by simply reflecting them using the reflect tool ( O ) . <h> Step 6 <p> Copy another one of those rectangles with the Rounded Corners effect applied to them and place it over the i and expand its appearance Object&gt;Expand Appearance in the menu . Using the direct selection tool ( A ) select all the points on the right hand side and drag it over to the left . Draw a circle right on top of it and you 've got the letter i . <p> Note : I have to say at this point that its within the designers personal preference to add character to each of their letters . Each letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to alter any elements and can justify it then feel free . <h> Step 7 <p> My solution to solve the problem of making the letter t legible is to work within the reference and add elements together . In my research folder I also came across another reference that has a solution that I 'm quite happy with . <p> Draw a rectangle that corresponds with the letter is stem and copy that over to the letter t . Trace the ascender and descender of the letter using the Pen tool and combine them with the rectangle that we drew just before . <p> Grab one of the rounded rectangles and copy it across , make sure that they are touching and combine them using the Pathfinder menu . Draw another rectangle above them and click Minus front on the Pathfinder Menu . <p> Now rotate that shape and combine all of the elements together . I added some extra points to give it a bit of character , once you 're happy combine everything using the Pathfinder Menu . <h> Step 8 <p> Copy the stem of the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pen tool trace the letter . <p> Copy the resulting shape ( G+C ) and delete a part of it using the Eraser tool ( Shift+E ) , Offset the remainder shape with 0.5mm value . <p> Select the result and the stem and subtract the shape using the Minus Front button on the Pathfinder menu , Paste in front ( G+F ) the original shape . Use the eraser tool ( shift+E ) and delete a point , and combine everything using the Pathfinder Unite option . <h> Step 9 <p> Combine all the letters to create istoriaster in the Artboard in your desired size , set the kerning here and give them a white fill and a black stroke colour ( D ) . Set the align stroke setting on the outside , the corner settings on round , and the stroke 3pt . <p> Group everything and give it a flag effect Effects&gt;Warp&gt;Flag with the value on -16 . Save your file if you have n't . <h> Step 10 <p> I wanted to create a more detailed filigree ornament so I printed the reference of the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil and pens making sure that all the lines joined together . I scanned the sketch at 300 dpi and seeing the result in context I was n't too happy with the H because it looked like a lower case h . <p> Open the drawing in Photoshop and select the white area using the magic wand tool ( W ) you should be able to select the entire white area all at once . Create a mask layer from the selection , and paint using the the brush tool all the parts that you want to mask with black and in white to reveal . <p> Click and hold option on the layer mask and create a new colour fill with a grey colour , move the masked sketch layer to the top and set it to multiply . Create another layer and call it shading , option click the fill layer mask and with a soft brush draw the shading using shades of grey and black at 50% opacity . <p> You should end up with something like this , save the file as a tiff and place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H ornament . <h> Step 11 <p> Create a new Layer called main H , I used a typeface by Arthur Vanson through Letterhead Fonts called Hindlewood as reference . Create a new calligraphic brush through the Brush the window with the below settings . <p> Start with loose brush strokes to get the feel of the shape making sure that it fits with Filagree ornament , once you feel confident tidy up the lines or retrace it with a Pen tool as Ive done here . <h> Step 12 <p> Select certain points and Copy it ( G+C ) and Paste it in front ( G+F ) and delete the unnecessary points but keep the ones that would flow into the next shape . Reduce the stroke weight on the bottom curls to 0.25 pt to suggest some foreshortening and expand everything **25;1322;TOOLONG . <p> After that Simplify the paths to make it manageable through **26;1349;TOOLONG and tidy up the shapes . Copy the entire Shape ( G+C ) , Paste it to Front ( G+F ) , Expand Appearance , and Combine it all using the Pathfinder Unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back ( Shift+G+ ) once you 're done . <p> Once you 're happy with everything give it the default appearance ( D ) and change the stroke to .2 pt , give it a custom grey gradient and position it accordingly to suggest the light and shade . <h> Step 13 <p> With the rectangle tool ( M ) option click the art board and create a 5x5mm square . Rotate it 90 degrees and copy the shapes using the squares and the line tool create these two patterns . Group them separately to have a long one and a short one . Make copies of these patterns and create an Envelope Mesh ( option+G+M ) with these settings . <p> Manipulate the Mesh by skewing it using the Free Transform Tool ( E ) , click the middle right handle of the bounding box and then hold both G and option together . Then use the Direct Selection Tool ( A ) and the Convert Anchor Point Tool to wrap the patterns around the corresponding individual shapes that make up the capital H. <p> You can modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Mesh by clicking the Envelope Mesh Dialog . I made one of the vertical lines thicker in this case to further suggest foreshortening . You can also expand the Mesh altogether ( Object&gt;Envelope Distort&gt;Expand ) you can then manually adjust the shapes therein . <p> Once you 're happy with how everything looks , Copy ( G+C ) individual shape that Meshes are wrapped around and Paste it in front ( G+F ) and send it to the front ( Shift+G+ ) . Select the shape above and the Mesh and make a Clipping Mask ( G+7 ) . Repeat the process to mask all the Meshes and group everything together . <h> Step 14 <p> Hide the H layer and open up the H ornament layer , Copy ( G+C ) that placed document and Paste it in front ( GF ) . Click Live Trace and set it with the following settings , click Expand , convert it to compound path ( G+8 ) , send the result to the back ( Shift+G+ ) and fill it with red . You should be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 <p> Open up the H main layer again and extract the black filled H that we sent to the back a couple of steps back and copy it ( G+C ) . Lock the H main layer and select the placed tiff file and create a mask layer through the Transparency panel . Double click the blank area on the right of the preview area and your selection should disappear which is what is supposed to happen . <p> Draw a white rectangle that should cover the image and your image would reappear . Paste to the front ( G+F ) the black filled H that we copied earlier and create a compound path out of it ( G+8 ) . <p> Go back to the H ornament layer by clicking on the left preview window on the Transparency panel , select the vector tracing of the filigree and Copy it ( G+C ) to take to the Clipping Mask . <p> Head back to the clipping mask and Paste to the front ( G+F ) the filigree vector tracing , send the black filled H to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Filigree shape and click Divide on the Pathfinder Panel which will cut the shapes into sections . Ungroup the result and select the sections you wish to reveal by deleting them . After you 're happy with everything change the results the fill to black . You should have the following result where the vine seems like its curling through the H , once you 're happy hide the ornament layer . <h> Step 16 <p> Create another layer called " Drop Shadow " Copy the silhouette of the H and the istoriaster text into this layer using the ( G+C and G+F ) commands so it is placed directly where it is on the other layers and re lock their respective layers . Expand the appearance of the istoriaster and combine everything using the Pathfinder panels unite button . <p> Select the the entire Historiaster text and duplicate it using the Transform dialog ( Shift+G+M ) , enter the following values and click copy . <p> Select both shapes and create a blend ( G+option+B ) , with the blend tool ( W ) hold option and click the blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Object&gt;Blend&gt;Blend Options and enter the following . Go to the menu command **25;1377;TOOLONG then use the Unite command through the Pathfinder panel . <h> Step 17 <p> Let 's clean up this vector shape as there should be ragged edges . With the Lasso tool ( Q ) select the unnecessary points and then remove the points with the menu command Object&gt;Path&gt;Remove Anchor Points . <p> *quick tip : set a keyboard shortcut for the Remove Anchor Points command . Ive got ( G+Shift+option+0 ) on my computer , you can set it to your own preference* <p> These are the areas that you want to concentrate on , once you 're happy with the result turn on H main layer and the istoriaster layer to see whether you 're happy with the result . <h> Step 18 <p> Draw two horizontal lines on top of the shape we 've just created and create a blend ( G+option+B ) . Use the blend tool ( W ) to prompt the Blend dialog box again to select specified amount and enter 250 . <p> Prompt the Move dialog box ( G+shift+M ) and enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result to prompt the Blend Setting Dialog and reduce the amount to 200 . Repeat the steps and set the blend amount to 150 . <h> Step 19 <p> Turn on the H main layer again and select the H silhouette shape in the back and give it a white stroke , a 3 pt stroke width , and Align Stroke to the outside . <p> Turn on the H ornament again to grab the filigree silhouette shape . Keep it selected and drag it to the Drop Shadow Layer on the Layer Panel . Fill it white and add a white stroke with a 2 pt Stroke Width and set the Align Stroke to Outside . <h> Step 20 <p> Create a new Layer called " Flourish " and draw a rectangle behind the H. Fill the Rectangle in red and give it a Round Corners Effect ( **26;1404;TOOLONG Corners ) give it a 50 mm radius . Keep the rounded rectangle selected , right **27;1432;TOOLONG enter the following values and click copy . <p> Open up the Brushes Library menu on the Brush Panel by clicking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rectangles 2 brush . <p> Select the outer rounded rectangle and Expand its appearance , delete right horizontal path and create the following using the Pen tool and draw a circle to create this shape . <h> Step 21 <p> Select the inner rounded rectangle and prompt the scale dialog box ( right **27;1461;TOOLONG ) to create another rounded rectangle at 94% and click copy . Select both rectangles and create a blend ( G+option+B ) between the two , I 've put 5 steps on the Blend option dialog . At this point you can manipulate shapes to get the right spacing between them , once you 're happy Expand the appearance so you have the rounded rectangles permanently applied to the shapes . Expand the blend ( **25;1490;TOOLONG ) once you 're satisfied with everything . <p> Expand the outer most rounded rectangle and Expand its appearance . Give it a black stoke and your desired stroke width . Combine the ends using the Pen tool and create the following . <p> Delete the right horizontal path of the the inner rectangles and create these shapes . Try to correspond with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pen tool and Ellipse tool create these shapes that were referenced from the Sanborn Insurance maps . <h> Step 22 <p> Create a vertical line using the Linte tool ( ) and in the Stroke panel select a width profile 1 . Give the line a Zig Zag Effect Effect&gt;Distort &amp; Transform&gt;Zig Zag with the following settings . Draw up this shape using the Spiral tool , Ellipse tool , and the Pen tool . Expand both results and group them together . <p> Draw a circle below the group and use it as a reference point to rotate 90 degree and copy the drawn objects . Rotate the result another 45 degrees . Create a tear shape by manipulating a circle and rotate it the same way and group everything together and give it a white stroke with the Corner setting set to Round and the Align Stroke setting set to Outside . Place this object on top of the red spiral we just made . <p> Create accents on the other end of the rounded rectangle shapes as well using the Pen tool , Spiral tool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a series of objects using the Line tool ( ) and the rectangle tool ( M ) , give it a white stroke and group it all together . Place it between the and the Drop shadow layer . <h> Step 23 <p> Turn on the istoriaster layer and select the text . Open up the Offset Path dialog box Object&gt;Path&gt;Offset Path and enter the following settings . Cut ( G+X ) and Paste in front ( G+F ) the result and create a Compound Path ( G+8 ) . <p> Give it a linear Gradient Fill and adjust it accordingly using the Gradient Tool ( G ) . Once you 're happy with the result give it a Grain effect ( **26;1517;TOOLONG ) with the following settings and set the Transparency setting to Multiply . <p> Give the same effect to the gradient fills on the H main Layer . <h> Step 24 <p> Go to the Flourish layer and draw a horizontal line and use the rotate tool by holding option clicking the lowest anchor point . Give it a 6 degree value and click copy , repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( G+G ) . <p> Use the rotate tool ( R ) again and give it a 3 degree rotation and click copy .

This Photoshop action will reset your color swatches back to the default black/white foreground/background colors , do a " Select All " on your image , then copy to a new layer via the Cut feature ( which gives you a nice white background layer ) and then reduces the rough sketch layer to 20% opacity . Finally , a new blank layer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I like to work on transparent layers when working on sketches in Photoshop so parts of the sketch can be easily copied , pasted , or cut without having to worry about the background white . I do however like to have the white background behind all the transparent layers so everything appears normal when sketching . <p> - <h> Step 4 : Sketch Prep Results <p> The result of running the " sketch prep " action . Note the new layers in the Layers palette . <p> - <h> Step 5 : Refine The Sketch " Drawing In Photoshop <p> Next I start working on refining my rough sketch on the new blank layer . I do all my sketching in Photoshop using a Wacom Intuos4 graphics tablet . I highly recommend investing in a professional-quality graphics tablet if you are doing graphics work on your computer . You 'll also note in this screen shot that I have used the Free Rotate feature in Photoshop CS4 , which allows you to freely rotate the canvas on the fly while you are working with a document . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are working on your drawing . <p> I always work by using a separate layer for any distinctive part of a drawing , even with a single character . This allows me to resize , distort and reposition elements of the character in Photoshop to get the right proportions and design down . <p> This is why I do not spend much time with paper on pencil ; what I do on paper is just enough to get the basic idea worked out . <p> - <h> Step 6 : More Refining Using the Free Transform Tool <p> Here you can see that I sketched the body of the bird , but decided I did n't  like the head-to-body proportions . Because the body sketch was created on a separate layer , I only need to hit Command-T to enable Free Transform , which allows me to rotate and scale the layer , as well as skew the layer ( which I am doing in the screenshot ) by holding the Command key while clicking on a control handle while in Free Transform mode . <p> - <h> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Free Transform mode on the head layer to rotate and move down the head closer to the body . <p> - <h> Step 8 : New Sketch <p> Here we have an entire new body , and an entire new approach to the character . I decided as I was working on this that I was n't keen on having the character standing , as I did n't  like how the wings were looking just flat at his sides . <p> Sketching directly into Photoshop using the Wacom graphics tablet , I quickly worked up a new body , wings and feet . You can see here how much I utilize as many features of Photoshop as I can when working on my sketches . While all of this could be done without graphics software , I like to put my tools to work for me . <p> - <h> Step 9 : Group Your Layers <p> Here I am grouping all the layers of the sketch so far into a Layer Group folder , for easy management . I want to keep the layers separate , but also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Layers palette . Grouping the layers also allows me to reduce the opacity or apply other layer effects to all the layers within the Layer Group as a whole . <p> Note how many layers I am using , even for this fairly simple character . By keeping all the elements on separate layers , and working on copies of layers , I never have to waste time to go back and re-draw anything . Better safe than sorry . RAM is cheap and if I want I can flatten or delete all the layers once I have my finished sketch . <p> - <h> Step 10 : Create The Final Clean Sketch <p> Here I create a new empty layer outside the previously grouped layer folder , to work on refining the line work in preparation for the vector art stage . <p> - <h> Step 11 : Final Sketch- <p> The final cleaned up line art . This artwork will be used as a template in Illustrator when creating the vector art . <p> - <h> Step 12 : Create Your Illustrator Document <p> Now we move over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialog box , and I have some custom starting documents that are set up the way I like to work " CMYK mode with the units of measurement set to " points " . Points work best for me as far as increasing strokes and nudging objects . <p> - <h> Step 13 : Place Your Sketch As A Template In Illustrator <p> Next , the Photoshop sketch will be placed into Illustrator as a template for use as a , well , template . The sketch created in Photoshop will be placed and used to trace the vector paths in Illustrator . <p> Go to the File menu , and scroll down to the " Place " command . <p> - <h> Step 14 : Check the Template Checkbox <p> Navigate to the folder where your sketch is saved . Be sure the check the " Template " checkbox . This will place your Placed Image on a new layer , dim it to 50% opacity and lock the layer for you , all automatically . The dark bezel you see around the dialog box is the OS X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - <h> Step 15 : Work In Outline Mode <p> Next , switch to Outline Mode . Outline Mode is like a wireframe mode , where your vector paths will only show up as lines , and no color fills or strokes will appear . This helps in being able to see your sketch template as you work . <p> - <h> Step 16 : Create The Vector Paths Using The Pen Tool <p> Since we worked on the sketch at 200 dpi , we have plenty of resolution to zoom in on the details to create our vector art . <p> You can see here that the final line art sketch was created with the vector art in mind . Nothing was left to the imagination at the final line art sketch stage , so when the vectors are created you do not have to figure out what needs created . At this stage its mostly a matter of tracing the outlines . <p> I use the Pen tool 99% of the time when working on the line art , and I create all my vector art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating the vector art by hand allow you to keep the number of anchor points to the minimum , by doing so it also keeps the lines nice and fluid , allowing curves to flow and blend into each other . This results in a much sleeker final illustration . <p> You 'll also notice that I do not use the Calligraphic Brush tools . In essence I actually trace the line art as if they were shapes . Primarily this is done to give me much more control of the tapering thickness of the line art , which I just can not achieve using a uniform tapered calligraphic brush ( believe me , I have tried ) . <p> - <h> Step 17 : Quickly Create Smooth Compound Curves <p> Here is a nice time-saver : if you look closely in the screenshots , you 'll notice I am not dragging out the arcs in the curved areas as I encounter them along the line , but rather adding a central point to the line after the fact . <p> The key here is that each " corner " is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I go back and add a central point between two " corners " , that anchor point had control points added and is technically a very , very wide curve . <p> By switching temporarily to the Direct Selection tool by holding down the Command key ( note that the Direct Selection tool must be the last selection tool used before you switch to the Pen tool for this to work ) , I can then quickly reposition the newly-added anchor point and snug it up to the arc/curve in the line art template sketch . This technique is much easier than dragging it out while you create and trying to approximate the proper length the control handles should be . <h> Step 18 : Basic Vector Shapes Complete <p> Here , most of the line art vectors have been created . Notice the eyes were created as full circles , as was the bulk of the body . Its much easier to get a consistent , flowing line by creating even the obscured areas , and then erasing those obscured areas later . <p> - <h> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preview mode , so you can see how the artwork is looking with the filled in areas . All the overlapping , obscured line work is more obvious here . At this stage its probably a good idea to save a copy of the line art layer for backup , in case you need these full shapes later on . <p> - <h> Step 20 : Erase Overlapping Shape Areas <p> To eliminate the unwanted obscured areas of the rear eyeball , select all the shapes comprising the rear eyeball ( outline , pupil and highlight ) , then switch to the Eraser tool ( Illustrator CS3 &amp; CS4 only ) . If objects are selected , the Eraser tool will handily only affect ( erase ) the selected objects . <p> - <h> Step 21 : Final Line Art Complete <p> Here the areas of the eye behind the beak were also erased . Continue to do this for all necessary objects . <p> - <h> Step 22 : Create The Flat Color <p> No , we are n't  turning the bird into a flying purple people eater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the final colors , so I know to choose proper colors and to also make sure all the objects using the same color are using a Global swatch . Using Global swatches allows me to edit the swatch , and have all the colors using that swatch in the artwork updated at once . <p> All the color areas were created on a new layer , underneath the line art layer . This way , the line art sits on top and the color shapes are underneath and on a separate layer . This allows for more flexibility when adding shading later . <p> Another method of creating the flat color shapes is by using Illustrators Pathfinder -&gt; Unite feature on a copy of the line art , and then releasing the resulting compound path so you can select each interior shape and recolor as desired . Running the Offset Path feature with 1 or 2 pixels for the offset to add a bit of overlap could also be done to ensure there are no gaps where the filled areas meet the line art . Place this layer below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration " this alternate method works great in some cases and not so great in other situations depending on the structure of your vector art file . <p> - <h> Step 23 : Select Same Colors <p> Here I am consolidating all my " bird body " colors by first selecting the purple head shape , and then going to the Select menu , then to the " Same " submenu , and finally selecting " Fill Color " . What I am doing here is selecting one color , then automatically having Illustrator select all the other objects using the same color . <p> - <h> Step 24 : Create Global Colors <p> I then go to the Swatches panel and click on the " New Swatch " icon , which opens up the above dialog box . For now I leave the color as-is , but the important thing here is to make sure the " Global " checkbox is selected ( it will not be selected by default ) . <p> Once I have done this for all the colors in the bird , I can then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swatches panel and tweak the colors to preference . <p> - <h> Step 25 : Final Color Complete <p> The final colors . <p> - <h> Step 26 : Prep And Add Shading <p> Next step is to add the shading . Create a new layer , and then target the layer by clicking the small circle on the right hand side of the layer in the Layers palette . You can tell the layer has been targeted by the outline seen around the circle . <p> By targeting the layer , we can then apply a Blend Mode to the layer , and this blend mode will affect all the objects on the layer . This saves us time from having to set blend modes and opacities for each object on the layer individually. - I am setting the Blend mode via the ( new to CS4 ) Appearance palette . <p> For the shading , set the blend mode to Multiply , and then also reduce the opacity to 40% . <p> Youll notice , if you look back at the Layer target that the circle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Blend mode has been applied . <p> Now we can just create flat color shapes on this layer , and let the layer effect give us the desired results . Typically the Multiply blend mode will allow you to use the same exact color you used for the flat color as the shading color . Sometimes however you may need to create a new swatch and darken it up with a bit more K ( Black ) . <p> Note : if you are using a version of Illustrator without transparency ( versions 8 and lower ) , you 'll need to just create a flat color for the shading and skip the steps above . <p> Hopefully my thought process behind the separating of the line art and the flat color on separate layers is making more sense now . With the shading layer sandwiched between the two , this allows us to have much more flexibility and also not have to worry as much about precision since the line art layer sits above all the other layers . <p> Continue to add all your desired shading . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we are going to go back and tweak our line art , which we can see better in the overall final artwork with the color and shading applied . <p> In the screenshot you 'll see that my earlier tip about hand creating your vectors and keeping your anchor points to a minimum comes into play here , making it much easier to grab just a single anchor point and tweak and refine the line art where necessary . <p> - <h> Step 28 : Duplicate Your Art With Multiple Artboards <p> Typically the artwork would pretty much be done at this point , however while I was looking at this artwork I realized I did not like the size of the birds beak in proportion to his head . Just as the name " Twitter " has a bit of a " cute " ring to it , and after looking at the color art I realized a smaller beak on the bird would give it a younger , more cute feel . <p> Illustrator CS4 now has a " multiple artboards " feature , which I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original art on its own artboard within the same document . <p> This is a great example of why I like to create the elements of the artwork as full shapes as opposed to just the visible lines . Making size revisions like this is much easier . Unfortunately , I did not create the artwork this way ( or already erased the parts which were full shapes ) and I did n't  save a copy of my line art layer as I recommended earlier in this tutorial . I will thus need to go back and edit the line art manually . This is easily done since I hand-created all the vectors in this artwork , as opposed to using the Live Trace feature . Live Trace ends up creating too may stray vector points , and cleaning up and smoothing out the paths takes more time than just hand-creating your vectors from the start . <p> On a side-note , this is also a good example of being able to step back and look at your artwork objectively , even at the final stages . Ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the vector art stage " but never let that stop you from evaluating your creations and making sure they are achieving the goals they are intended to reach . <p> - <h> Step 29 : Beak Tweaking <p> Here I have selected all the vector objects comprising the beak , and resizing them . Next , I needed to go back and rework the line art for the head to allow for the resized beak . Again , had I created the head shape as a full circle , much of this editing would be unnecessary . <p> - <h> Step 30 : The Final Character Art <p> The final reworked art . I think you 'll agree the smaller beak is working much better . <p> - <h> Step 31 : Add The Background Elements <p> Since the end use for this project is an icon one can use on their website or blog to indicate a persons Twitter account link , I wanted the mascot to be enclosed in a rectangular icon , and also to distinguish the bird as a Twitter bird , I added the chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Voila ! The final artwork is complete , and ready for use to tell the world you 're using Twitter. - The final artwork is then exported to desired formats for use on the web . The final Twitter bird artwork files can be downloaded here , and the ZIP archive contains a CS4 version , as well as a CS1 version of the Illustrator file . Also included are three sizes of PNG icons for use wherever you need em ! <p> Obviously , there are some extra steps in the tutorial above , especially the parts where I reworked the art at the end . Instead of showing the ideal method , I wanted to give a real-world example , warts and all . I believe by showing the errors , it helps explains why the artwork is created as it is " one can see how easily an illustration can be tweaked at the end of the project if need be , by using a smart process from the start . <p> I would also encourage you to not use this tutorial as a " bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a stepping stone .

@@98562478 @2762478/ <h> How to Fully Customize Your Camo Texture Pack for Exceptional Results <h> How to Use Camo Textures <p> Hi , I 'm James Field , a freelance designer specializing in graphics for sports-fashion apparel . I- have created a Trend Camos Texture Pack based on recent research into upcoming and current design trends and increasing requests from clients . I 'm going to show how they can be used and- customized for your specific needs . I 'm using Adobe Illustrator CC , but this technique has been working in all versions since I started designing around eight years ago , so you should be OK- with whatever release you have . <p> THE PRODUCT I 'm referring to the Trend Camos Texture Pack that I put together for Arsenal . The pack contains x15 different- fully repeating camouflage patterns inspired by the latest sports-fashion trends developing on- the street . There 's something for guys and girls and many can work for both . All are already- available as swatches for immediate use in the colors I have chosen but can be easily adjusted , - combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . As a bonus , I have- supplied three fully repeating textures that can be layered to create distressed versions or used- in your other projects on their own . The final camo in the pack is provided as layered TIFF files- that can be colored and used directly within illustrator as this works best for the more- complicated distorted look . <p> HOW TO USE : THE BASICS There are a number of files supplied and the easiest way to use the camos right out of the pack- is to open the main document showcasing all of the designs together . <p> On each page you can see the individual camo patterns applied as both a grayscale and full- color swatch . These can be found by name in your Swatches panel . To use these swatches directly- in your work , you will need to save a library . This way , it can be opened in other documents whenever- you need . Simply click the Panel Menu Icon in the top right corner of the Swatches panel and- select Save Swatch Library as AI to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When working in a new document , you can open your Swatches panel , click the Panel- Menu Icon in top-right corner , then follow Open Swatch Library &gt; User Defined and select thelibrary you just saved . To apply them , you can now select an object and choose a camo pattern- from the Swatches panel to fill it with . <p> Often some quick adjustments are required to get things looking as you want them , so I 'll go- through some of the most simple but important techniques . Firstly , the scale of the camo pattern- filling the TREND CAMOS text in my example is a little too large to effectively see the extent of- the pattern . To change it , select the object and double-click the Scale tool in the Tools Panel to- bring up a number of Scale options . To adjust only the scale of the pattern and not the object- itself , make sure to deselect the Transform Objects check box . In my example I have chosen to- reduce uniformly to 60% and left the Preview check box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show you how to rotate patterns . In my example , I have filled the outlined text and the- background rectangle in the same camo pattern , but using different colors . To- increase the contrast between the two , I selected the rectangle object , then double-clicked the Rotate tool in- the Tools panel to bring up the Rotate options . Again , deselecting Transform Objects allows movement of only the pattern inside . <p> Finally , it can be very useful to move the position of the camo pattern to exactly where it is- needed within an object . In my third example below , there are no light colored shapes on theword TREND , but I would like there to be some . After selecting the outlined TREND text object , - go to Object &gt; Transform &gt; TransformEach to bring up a more comprehensive set of Scale , Rotation and Movement options . To move just the pattern , deselect the Transform Object check box- as before and with the Preview box checked , go ahead and adjust the Horizontal andVertical sliders as required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further and customize the individual camos to more exacting- specifications , then you can find each of the patterns ready to work with in their own individual- documents . Opening any of these files you will see an artboard on the left with the original- elements used to make the pattern . The rectangular guidelines are provided to show the- boundaries of the tile area . Below this are the camo pattern shapes that you can recolor and- below those are a rectangular background that can also be colored . Importantly , there is a- second clear ( no fill , no outline ) rectangle at the very back that is the exact same size/shape as the- guidelines that are used to define the pattern tile area . This MUST be left as it is and not- grouped together with the other elements . The key to updating the camo patterns for yourself is- to leave that clear rectangle alone , and to make the same changes to elements on all sides . <p> The most straightforward way to recolor the pattern is to select an individual element then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects that same shade and apply your own new color. - Continue to do this until you have your own color scheme created . In many cases , the camo- shapes have been left intact so you can go in and change , add , or remove individual pieces to- further adjust the look of the camo . However , always remember to make sure any elements- overlapping the guidelines are also updated on their opposite sides in order to maintain the fully repeating visual . When you 're happy with the look of your pattern , select the entire camo ( make- sure to include that clear rectangle at the very back ) and drag directly into your swatches panel. - You should now see a new swatch created in the panel that can be applied to objects . <p> Provided with the Trend Camos are a set of three fully repeating bonus textures that can also be- introduced into your camo patterns . Open that file and select the one ( or more ) that you want to- use . Next , select and copy , then paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your camo , you should resize and align to the guidelines and recolor to fit your scheme . To make an- effective distressed look , use the same color as your background rectangle , then once again- drag everything directly into your swatches panel . <p> NEXT STEPSThis is just the start of what can be achieved with the contents of the Trend Camos Pack . You- can combine them , adjust them , resize , and recolor to fit your project as needed . As my firstever tutorial , I hope everything was easy to follow and you found the info to be useful . If you- have any questions or would like to see more , please get in touch and I 'll do my best to help- out ! I hope you enjoy using the Trend Camos Pack and I look forward to receiving your feedback . 17219 @qwx877219 17218 @qwx877218 17225 @qwx877225

@@98562480 @2762480/ <h> PhotoKeys for iPhone <p> PhotoKeys for iPhone iTunes App Store link is an interesting app . In short , it turns your iPhone into a small touch screen to access the Photoshop tool palette " Move , Marquee , Lasso , Magic Wand and so on " as well as other common functions such as Copy , Paste , Undo , Save , etc . You get the idea . <p> Let 's get the first question out of the way : why ? Well , I can see a few situations making this app useful : laptop users and graphics tablet users who do n't  sit hunched slavishly over their Wacom all day ( like I do ) . Many times I have been using my Wacom with my MacBook , and lurching back over to the keyboard to swap tools with the keyboard can ruin the creative flow . Yeah , I 'm a keyboard junkie . <p> After downloading the app to your iPhone , you 'll need to install server software on your Mac or PC ( Mac version " using Photoshop CS4 " tested for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course useless unless you 've purchased the $4.99 iPhone app as well . Also , you 'll need to have your iPhone set up to access the same local wi-fi network as the computer you are running Photoshop on . After installing , Mac users will find a new item in their menubar , and I assume PC users will find a new icon in their taskbar tray . Without configuring anything , and also without relaunching Photoshop , PhotoKeys sprung to action without a hitch . <p> Tapping tools in PhotoKeys resulted in an instantaneous switch within Photoshop . Impressive . <p> The tool icons on the Tools screen are reminiscient enough of the Photoshop analogs that even a casual Photoshop user will have no trouble determining which button does what . At first raw glance , the Edit screen was less intuitive as far as which buttons performed which actions . Some were obvious enough , but others not so much . I jumped in to this demo without reading any documentation to see how far I could get without needing to do so . I like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a getting started guide . <p> The third screen " Arrows " is basically a giant set of arrow key buttons . I found a bit of a lag when tapping the arrows repeatedly . The Arrows screen offers three modes : Nudge , Move and Clone . All worked as expected by their names , albeit the lag mentioned above . The lag seems to be more pronounced by a repeated tapping of the arrow keys as opposed to just holding down the direction you want to move the layer . Also , I could n't really determine a difference between the speed or distance of the Nudge versus the Move mode " both seemed too slow to me . Also , one needs to already have the Move tool selected , and there is no way to activate the Move tool from the Arrows screen . I think a Move tool button on this screen would be a welcome and handy addition . <p> One thing that as a Photoshop CS4 user I have come to love is the " Spring-Loaded Keys " feature . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only switch tools using single-letter keys on the keyboard ( M for Move tool , B for the Brush tool and so on ) , but also to temporarily access these tools by holding down the respective key . Just as the Spacebar for time immemorial has allowed you to access the Hand tool and then bounce right back to the previous tool you were using , now all tools have that feature " just hold down the key , as opposed to tapping it to do so . A tap with still switch to the tool if desired . An extremely handy new feature in Photoshop CS4 . Unfortunately , PhotoKeys does not offer any such functionality . I 'm not sure if this is even feasible in PhotoKeys , but for me it would be a must-have . <p> PhotoKeys also seems to only offer the " standard " tool and edit set of Photoshop " in other words , the tools that are most common with most versions of Photoshop . You wo n't find new CS4 tools , such as my fave " the Rotate View tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar " at the top of the iPhone window . this is probably my favorite feature , as it gives one instant gesture-based access to the Zoom tool at any time . It works smoothly and flawlessly . Very cool . <p> As someone who primarily works in Photoshop on a desktop computer extensively using keyboard shortcuts , I 'm not sure PhotoKeys fits into my particular workflow . That said , the execution of this app is impressive and well-done . If anything in this review caught your attention as useful or handy for your workflow , I 'd have to say PhotoKeys would be a worthwhile purchase .

Many makers have found incredible success selling their wares there . But creating , curating , customizing and maintaining a successful shop is an art all its own . <p> We wanted to know what it takes to rise above the rest . So we chatted with featured artists Anastasia Gerali , owner of shop Love from Cyprus , Kayla Jurgens of Fox and the Fawn , and Marissa Mele of Maroozi to tell us how they have managed to succeeded . <h> - <h> When you 're ready to start your shop , just go for it . <p> Start making products and getting them ready to sell . If you get hung up on the little things like a logo , business cards , etc. , you 'll miss the point of starting your shop which is to earn money by selling products you make . I 've seen a lot of businesses think that they need to have every little business thing ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business you need to make sales . With time the other things will fall in place and hopefully you 'll have some capital to spend on all the business things you need . Marissa , Maroozi <h> Focus on photography <p> When you 're ready to put your products up online , make sure that you have the best pictures possible . People make their decisions on the quality of your product photos , so you might want to invest in a good camera or do some photo editing to get high quality photos . Take photos of your product from different angles , do a closeup shot , include a photo of your product packaging . Each Etsy listing can have five photos included , so use all of them . I 'd also recommend targeting keywords in your Etsy listing title , description and tags . Use Googles Keyword Planner Tool- to research keywords related to your product . I 'd also use Etsys search bar to see what word people are using to search for products like yours . The Etsy Help page has a lot of great resources for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips and tricks for their platform . Marissa , Maroozi <p> Photography is key when you are selling products online . The less photoshopping you can do , the better . You want to be true to your customer about what they are purchasing , and the picture is just as important as an accurate description . For styling your photo , choose a style which is easy for you to maintain when photographing new products . Use natural lighting wherever possible , and use a style or visual language that represents your brand and product . If you are a goth brand , do n't  photograph your leather studded belts on a girl wearing a pink lace dress walking a poodle . Your brand language has to be consistent in all you images. - Anastasia , Love from Cyprus <h> Create something beautiful for your fans- and constantly improve based on feeback <p> I try my best to create a product that is really beautiful , and am constantly improving my quality based on my buyers feedback . Most of my sales are repeat buyers , and as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing customer , than trying to get new customers constantly . My aim is to create a long term relationship with my lovers ( that 's what I call my customers / followers ) and keep creating things that I love to share . I am a real person , and not a cog in a big-brand machine . I am one woman running my business , designing , posting , replying to emails . I do n't  hide this from my lovers and I think a lot of them are young women that identify with me and my style . Anastasia , Love from Cyprus <h> Get pricing right from the start . <p> Really do your research , know how much your product costs you , and price it right , after researching the market too . I unfortunately did not know much about pricing , and was also insecure to price my products fairly . This left me in debt , and also left my early customers upset when I raised my prices . Be clear about your goals . Do you want to make a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be wholesaling your products too , as this will also affect your pricing. - Anastasia , Love from Cyprus <h> Do n't  take things too personally . <p> Sometimes you may get an angry email from a customer , but you need to understand that online shoppers sometimes forget that designer/makers are normally one person multi tasking all the different roles of a small business. - Anastasia , Love from Cyprus <h> Do n't  be too over protective of your work . <p> In every industry there will be people that copy you , hopefully badly . The challenge is to stay ahead , make sure you are offering more value and stay true to your vision . By default , nothing we do or see is ever a first any more . For everything you 've done , or created , there is someone else in the world who may have thought of or made the same thing . Its a case of which came first , the chicken or the egg ? Keep creating , keep evolving and time will weed out the weaker links. - Anastasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community markets <p> I do n't  pay for advertising because I simply do n't  have a big enough budget to compete with larger retailers and brands . I use social media to promote my brand . It also gives my lovers the opportunity to interact with me and tell me what they like ( and do n't  like ) . I use Instagram , but this is not to say its ideal for everyone . Do your research and use the channels that your target market are using . Maybe LinkedIn or Twitter is better for you if your target is business professional , or Snapchat if they are teens. - - Anastasia , Love from Cyprus <p> Flea Markets and Craft Fairs are a great way to get your name out there in your local community . Social media platforms are another great place to market your business . I use Instagram and Pinterest for my business marketing , but I 'm not afraid to use my own personal platforms to get the word out about my business and products . I would choose your social media platforms wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they try to be on every platform and that just is n't sustainable . You 'll end up doing an ok job on many platforms instead of a great job on just one or two . My Instagram is my main platform where I 'm actively posting and Pinterest is my secondary platform . If you check out my Instagram , you 'll see that it is n't just photos about my products . I am my business . Its just me running it and most likely when you start out , it will just be you too . Because of that , I have chosen to use my business page to post not only about what I 'm making , but also about me . I 'm a yogi so I connect with my tribe on Instagram . I 've found that I do n't  have to actively sell on my Instagram in order to get sales . People will buy from you because they know you and like you . Do n't  be afraid to let people see the person behind the business . Especially in the handmade market , people want to connect with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . Marissa , Maroozi <h> Add that personal touch . <p> It is all about the perceived value of your product . If I just shipped my product with no insert and no gift bag , its just a product in an envelope . The person wont be excited when they open their package . As you can see in the picture below , receiving a package like this is much nicer and prettier . The little touches make all the difference . I also include handwritten thank you notes to thank my customers for choosing my Etsy Shop , - I also include a coupon code for them to use on any future orders and a gentle request to write a review if they feel so inclined . Marissa , Maroozi <h> Lay out your policies so there is no confusion . <p> Make sure that your Shop Policies are completely filled out and that you explain everything fully . Each of your Etsy listings will also have a section to put in your processing times for fulfilling your orders . Make sure to be as accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business days , but if for some reason I 'm out-of-town or its a custom or bulk order and I need more time to complete the order , I make sure to notify the buyer immediately and let them know when I will be shipping out their items . Communication is key when you 're selling online . The moment I get an order from Etsy ( which if you get the Etsy Sellers app on your phone , you will hear a little cash register " cha-ching " sound ) , I send the customer a message letting them know that I got their order and that I have begun working on it . I also let them know to keep a lookout for a shipping confirmation email which will let them track their package . You can buy and print your shipping labels right through Etsy and this will automatically trigger a shipping email to your customer with their tracking number . Respond as quickly as you can to a customer and thank them for their order . Unfortunately , once you put that package in the mail , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any issues or hiccups but from time-to-time you will . I actively watch the package as it is on its way to my customer . If I see that it might be delayed , I message the customer and let them know that I have my eye on their package and if need be I will contact USPS to see what the status is . Etsy also allows you to offer shipping upgrades- like Priority and Express which buyers can choose for an added fee in the checkout process . This is a nice option for customers who need their items quickly . Marissa , Maroozi <h> Stay true to who you were when you started your company . <p> I think a key to success is to stay true . Stay true to yourself , your style , and your business model you wanted from the start. - - Kayla , Fox and the Fawn <h> Do n't  compare yourself to others . <p> Do n't  compare yourself to others .

@@98562487 @2762487/ <h> WebP : Googles New Web Image Format <p> To improve on the compression that JPEG provides , we used an image compressor based on the VP8 codec that Google open-sourced in May 2010 . We applied the techniques from VP8 video intra frame coding to push the envelope in still image coding . We also adapted a very lightweight container based on RIFF . While this container format contributes a minimal overhead of only 20 bytes per image , it is extensible to allow authors to save meta-data they would like to store . <p> While the benefits of a VP8 based image format were clear in theory , we needed to test them in the real world . In order to gauge the effectiveness of our efforts , we randomly picked about 1,000,000 images from the web ( mostly JPEGs and some PNGs and GIFs ) and re-encoded them to WebP without perceptibly compromising visual quality . This resulted in an average 39% reduction in file size . We expect that developers will achieve in practice even better file size reduction with WebP when starting from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Google says that an alpha transparency layer is coming soon to the format , which will give it PNG-style transparency . Oddly , the conversion tool is only currently available for Linux users ! <p> The surface claim here is that Google wants to modernize compressed image formats for use on the web , to make downloading webpages and images faster . Obviously , as an advertising company the faster a page loads , the quicker you see their ads . <p> Seeing as how the format is Open Source , I cant really see any downside to Google being the originator of the format . The GIF format ran into issues since it was patented , which led to the development of the PNG format . The patent on the GIF format has since expired , according to Wikipedia . <p> The real question is this : will it be adopted , and how widespread will the adoption be ? The first step is for browsers to support the format , then those who create images . Will the major graphics software developers support WebP , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using a command-line prompt to convert images is not going to help the adoption rate . <p> Some independent graphics software developers have already jumped on the WebP bandwagon . Pixelmator has already started adding WebP support to their software . But I think itll take seeing WebP support in software that is more widespread across the graphics and web industry before we will see any widespread support . Yes , I am talking about Photoshop and Illustrator . <p> So as creative types , I 'm curious what our readers think of the new format , and how likely you think you 'll be to use the new format if/when Adobe and the like start supporting it . Will the file size savings be worth moving over to a new format , one that may present compatibility issues at the outset when sharing files with others without support for the format in their software ? <p> Is the file size saving something that concerns you as a graphic designer or a web developer ?

It does n't  just tell you the company 's name ; it helps to give you an idea of the style , tone and personality of the brand behind it . The way in which a logo is designed can affect how the company is perceived " even on a very subtle level " and great designers can make use of that brilliantly . <p> I 've always been impressed by logos that manage to create an elegant , stylish and retro look . A vintage style logo can be such a difficult style to pull off , and usually involves a tremendous amount of work around getting the typography just right . This is where hand-drawn scripts come in really well , as retro logos often make use of custom , hand-written lettering " or heavily adapted typefaces .

Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect can help to add a nostalgic air to a design . <p> I 've collected some of my favourite examples of logo designs that all make use of a vintage or retro effect , and have a touch of elegance to them as a result .

This document should give the designer precise information about the brands values and the brands promises to the consumer . It should establish the level of change desired by the client from their current packaging . ( evolutionary vs revolutionary ) General information about the target consumers demographic as well as any relevant lifestyle details should be included . It needs to establish the communication hierarchy and desired messaging as well as identify the characteristics of the product that make it special and unique in its market . Without having this information clearly stated at the onset of the design process , the project will most likely run into problems . <h> Analysis Paralysis <p> Good research is essential to developing great packaging , but its not the be-all and end-all of the designers decision making process . It should serve as a tool in making your choices , but it should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that research is n't perfect , and it can be influenced by unforeseen factors . Sometimes a new , innovative idea may not test well with focus groups . You must encourage a client that a smart design that shakes up the competition may be exactly what their brand needs . Convince the client that as a designer you possess the correct insight and understanding of the target consumer better than a randomly selected focus group of non-designers . <h> Avoid Parity <p> Parity is the degree of similarity between two competitors packaging within a particular product genre . Avoid parity at all costs . Its a proven fact that innovative and unique packaging can boost a products sales even if nothing about the actual product has changed . How are you going to help a company achieve greater sales if their product looks exactly the same as the product next to it on the shelf ? In this way , parity is a death punch to profits . The point is to get a product to pop off the shelves , not to camouflage it . <h> Be Proactive <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current trends to what is next . A designer must help the client understand this concept . Do n't  be afraid to try something new and different . Again , its clear and measurable that good packaging can improve a products sales . We must not wait for the competition to take the next step , we must beat them to the finish line . Be innovative ! <h> Production is Key <p> Having a good relationship and good communication with the production artists that are working on the packaging is something that should never be overlooked . They should be involved in the process early and often . This can help a designer avoid serious mistakes due to printing and packaging limitations . Not only that , but the production artists often have great ideas that can take a packaging project from good to great . Find a person you are comfortable with and trust their expertise .

@@98562555 @2762555/ <h> A Showcase of Creatively Redesigned Movie Posters <p> Being a designer is a never-ending quest . Designers must constantly improve and expand their skills , as trends in design are always changing . Like any art susceptible to the whims of fashion , design reflects the tastes , values and concerns of a certain point in time , and as such it never sits still for too long . <p> Of course , professional work will allow the designer to hone and build their skills , but in this economy , paid work can be hard to find . That is why designers often create design samples both to give clients an idea of their style and to continue to practice their art . This practice has obvious benefits , but creating logos and websites in a vacuum has a less obvious drawback . It does not require collaboration or interpretation of ideas on the part of the designer . <p> One way many designers are addressing this issue is by redesigning movie posters . Designing movie posters can often more accurately show a designer 's thought process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its iconic imagery or memorable lines . It forces the designer to create something that reflects their aesthetic but requires that aesthetic to be adapted to someone else 's already established creation . This is a much more realistic process than drawing a visual pun and deciding the kind of company that might like it , and it also results in a product that can be enjoyed by fans of design and fans of the film equally . <p> Below is a showcase of creative redesigned movie posters that illustrates just how entertaining and challenging this practice can be . <h> Fight Club <h> The Shining <h> The Evil Dead <h> Ghostbusters <h> Amelie <h> Jurassic Park <h> Return of the Jedi <h> Reservoir Dogs <h> Nosferatu , Frankenstein &amp; The Wolfman <h> Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas <p> Have you found any creatively redesigned movie posters that deserve a mention ?

This is not the end-all , be-all way of doing things . We will try to make what is normally a long and detailed process of creating commercial art into a simple and easy-to-follow guide . We encourage your use of artistic license and creative vision to make high quality work for your clients . <p> I wrote a brief tutorial on Apparel Design roughly a year ago for Go Media , the source for web development in Cleveland and it received a lot of good response . But its a bit outdated now . Weve done lots more apparel work , including stuff for Avenged Sevenfold , Red Hot Chili Peppers , Evanescence , Atticus Clothing , Strhess Clothing , and tons more notable bands and clothing companies . <p> Needless to say , we 've learned a lot about what 's hot in todays " underground " fashion market . And when I say underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your local Hot Topic or Pac Sun and you 're going to see some great apparel graphics . And this tutorial will show you just how its done . <p> Everything you see in Hot Topic or Pac Sun these days features some combination of skulls , flourishes , splatters , and miscellaneous grunge effects . Why ? Do n't  ask me , but I 'm sure its got something to do with the recent rise of popular screamo , metalcore , and hardcore bands into the mainstream . With bands like Avenged Sevenfold and My Chemical Romance paving the way for that ultra sceneXcore aesthetic . Which can look ultra lame if done bad , but hella cool if done right . And I 'll show you how its done right . <h> Before You Begin <p> How do you make all those flourishes , splatters , and other design elements ? Well , some do it by hand and draw their own flourishes , wings , skulls , etc . But what most t-shirt designers are doing these days is using stock design elements and clip art . Old floral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that cool look without actually doing a lot of custom work . <p> We at Go Media prefer to create our own elements . But to make it easy on you , we 've created a bunch of stock vector elements for you to get started right now . Weve created custom shapes to destroy and beat up your designs at the highest quality possible . And just about every trendy element today is covered such as wings , crests , tech shapes and more . And they 're freakin cheap as hell . So if you want to skip the hard part and go straight to designing kick-ass apparel graphics , then check out our kick ass stock vector packages for that ultra sceneXcore aesthetic ! <h> On With the Tutorial ! <p> You 'll need these : Photoshop Illustrator CS2 <p> So with that said , let 's get on with the tutorial ! First you need to open up Photoshop and Illustrator , as you 'll be using both . Mostly Illustrator . So get that Pen Tool ready ! <p> 1 . ) You need to decide what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what YOU want . Your client should give you some ideas . But I find that quite a few just want something " dark " and " scary . " So that 's what well give them . <p> 2 . ) Come up with an original idea ! Youll be tempted to use skulls or other typical dark imagery , but you really should try to come up with something new . If you want to sell shirts however , skulls are so trendy right now it might make you some cash . Skulls never seem to go out of style . In fact , they are becoming " pop " ular if you know what I mean . Little girlie skull underwear , etc . But anyway , think of an original concept and go with that . That 's the best way . <p> 3 . ) Get out your sketchbook or open up Firefox . Once you have an idea , start sketching around . For those who ca n't draw , search the internet for a stock photo . Or take your own photos , whichever works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so manipulating stock photos is always an option . I 'd draw something in this tutorial , but I 'll save that lesson for another time . For the sake of this tutorial let 's stick to photos . We can make that work ! <p> 4 . ) Find a photo . I found this one . It helps a lot if you find an image that 's fairly large . Preferably over 1500 pixels . I just searched Google images for this one . Now some may ask about copyright laws and whatnot . For the sake of this tutorial , its just learning . But if you want to use these images in your client projects , then its always good to ask the owner of the photo . But most times you can get away with it if you are manipulating it beyond comparison which is what we are planning to do . And I 'm only using a snapshot of a wrecked auto . If you are worried about it , then purchase a stock photo or take your own photos . I use stock photos because I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So here 's the one I found : <p> 5 . Cut out the image you want to use . Copy the image and paste it into a new Photoshop document of the same size . Use the Pen Tool and create a path around your image . After you are done , right click and " make selection . " Select the inverse and press delete . <p> 6 . ) Convert it to 3 colors . Here are the steps . I 've created an action to make this easier <p> Make a new layer name it " highlights " . From the Select Menu : Select ++-+ Color Range ++-+ Highlights ( this selects all the light parts of your image ) Fill the selection with White ( Press " D " to reset the colors to black and white , and the press " Ctrl+Backspace " to fill your selection with white . ) Make another new layer name it " shadows " From the Select Menu : Select ++-+ Color Range ++-+ Shadows ( this selects all the dark parts of your image ) Fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name it " midtones " Fill the entire layer with a grey color Ctrl+Click on the LAYER with the original photo you cut out to make a selection around it . Select ++-+ Inverse Select each layer and press delete . You are now deleting any extra color or pixels outside of the object you cut out . <p> You should end up with something like this : <p> 7 . ) Live Trace ( Vectorize ) each of those layers . This is where we take this into Illustrator . And the newest version CS2 has a handy tool called Live Trace . This will save you lots of time ! Open Adobe Illustrator and make a new document if you have n't already . Here are the steps to do this : <p> In Photoshop , select the " Highlights " layer and press Ctrl+I to invert it . You should have just made it black . Now with that layer selected , click on your art ( not the layer ) and physically drag your art ( not the layer ! ) to your Illustrator button on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Illustrator window is active ) . With the mouse button still down , you should see a little + plus sign next to your cursor . You should now be able to drop your art onto the artboard . Release the mouse button and your " highlights " layer should drop right into your empty Illustrator document . <p> ( Note : If you are having trouble with this , try copying and pasting it in . Or saving out a JPG of your highlights layer and " placing " it into your Illustrator document ) <p> In Illustrator , select what you just dragged in and click Object ++-+ Live Trace ++-+ Make and Expand ( default settings for Live Trace are fine ) . You will get something like this : <p> After you Live Trace something , it will have created a group of vector shapes out of both the black and the white parts of your image . Right click and ungroup it . Draw a big dark grey square around your shape and send it to the back . This will be your background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white shapes . Click on a white shape . With a white shape selected , click Select ++-+ Same ++-+ Fill Color . Press Delete . You are removing all of the white shapes and you are leaving just the black ones . Select all the black shapes and change their fill color to white . You should now see the " highlights " portion of your art now in vector form ! <p> Go back into Photoshop and drag the " shadows " layer over to Illustrator and do the same thing you did for the white layer . Except keep its color black . Go back into Photoshop and select your " midtones " layer . Use brightness and contrast to get your layer to look black . Now drag it into Illustrator and repeat the same steps as you did with the " highlights " and " shadows " layer . Except make this one grey . Now put the grey shape in behind the white and black layer . You should end up with this in Illustrator : <p> 8 . ) Add more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traced and converted to three colors , you can now start adding more design elements . So for this tutorial , well use some of the design elements in the Go Media Vector Packs . You can use your own design elements or you can purchase our vector packs . <p> Now this is the point where I begin to experiment with different shapes , different arrangements , etc . Just use your imagination . In our vector packs , you 'll find a large amount of different elements that you can be creative with . <p> 9 . ) I just flipped around the design and started choosing colors . <p> 10 . ) Added some miscellaneous shapes to give the design some direction and motion . I put them behind the car . <p> 11 . ) Opened up our Splatter Set from our Vector Packs <p> 12 . ) Added a few splatters in the background . <p> 13 . ) Used our destroy set to blend things in and add some dirt to my design <p> 14 . ) I used a skull from our Skull Vector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Add some flourishes ! <p> 16 . ) I drew some random curvy lines with the Pen Tool . <p> 17 . ) Used another vector piece from our Tree Set ( not yet released ) . <p> 18 . ) Added the text <p> So to get to this point , you need to just play around with your design elements and arrange them in a way that satisfies you . This particular example was a concept I did for a band called A Wilhelm Scream . I highly recommend them ! <p> Once your design is done , its best to mock it up on a shirt for your client so they can get a good idea of how it will look when printed . <h> Conclusion : <p> Part of being a graphic designer in todays time , is all about finding resources and using them to your advantage . There are plenty of stock vector packs and other elements out there for those of you who have trouble or simply do n't  want to create them yourself . I admit that it takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sometimes want things quickly and do not want to pay for you to create these kinds of things yourself . And that 's why stock photos and vector art have become such a hot commodity these days . <p> There comes a time when clients will prefer you create completely original artwork and we love those jobs . We wish we could get more of those ! And we will come up with original artwork or illustration and mix in our design elements for a really cool look . <p> So its fairly easy to get a high-end looking piece of apparel pretty quickly with these kinds of resources at your fingertips . Thanks for reading the tutorial and I hope you learned some new things . If you have any questions , feel free to ask . I am sure I may have skipped a few things here and there that I take for granted . Thanks ! 17224 @qwx877224

It can look great on a mock up , but when the printer looks at the design sometimes it can not be printed like you are thinking due to size , print location , etcso I feel it is important for the designers to have an understanding of what type of media the design will be going on and design accordingly . <h> What are your plans for the future of Disciple ? <p> In the future , I plan to branch out more into the wholesale markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Technological advancements of the 20th century especially have revolutionized the process to the point where few people are willing to engage with their work in such an involved way as with block printing . With this tutorial , I 'd like to help people reacquaint themselves with the organic pleasures of custom , handmade artwork . <p> This traditional printing technique is extremely versatile . It can be used for anything from business cards , to posters , to T-shirts , to swing tags . Whether you work for a small clothing company or whether you 're a freelance designer , being familiar with block printing is a great way to refine your style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and design I wanted to develop a tutorial that highlighted small businesses , specifically in the clothing industry . The goal was to give my work a vintage flair using distinctive elements of illustration and typography . So , without further adieu let 's get started : <h> Step 1 : Concept <p> It should go without saying that you must have an idea before beginning any work . Because I am focusing on swing tags , which are used primarily for labeling clothing , Ive come up with a fictional company that specializes in hand-stretched , quality leather shoes for both men and women . This company is called Sole Mate Co . <h> Step 2 : Sketches <p> I have created two illustrations for the purposes of this project . I wanted the front of the swing tag to feature the name of the company with the back containing a custom image of a shoe , one that could potentially be used in other promotional materials . - The size of the design is critical since mine will be fairly intricate , it needs to be on the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalized your sketches , you will need to gather the necessary materials . Most of these items can be found at any craft store or hardware store . <p> Speedball makes a wonderful kit for block printing that includes all the essentials listed above . - Unit price $20.00 <h> Step 4 : Transferring the Design <p> Using tracing paper , draw over your final design , making sure to correct any lines that may have been skewed during your sketching process . Once you 've finished tracing , take the paper and place it IN REVERSE on the linoleum block . Transfer the drawing by firmly holding the design in place and rubbing the back of the paper with either a bone folder or the scissors handle . ( You can also use your hand ) . The transfer may not come out perfectly , so be sure to draw over any lines that do n't come out clearly . <h> Step 5 : Carving <p> Use the chisel to carve all the negative space away " basically everything you do n't  want to be printed . This should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  carve away the wrong section is to use a marker to indicate which areas should be cut off. - TAKE YOUR TIME " taking your time during this stage is essential . Put on your headphones and just focus on what exactly you are cutting away . <p> Also , be careful ! Always carve away from your hand . Remember that larger chisel tips should be used for larger areas and smaller tips should be used for detailing . The amount of pressure you should apply depends on what blocks you use . Some are very stiff , which requires more pressure . I 'm using 4 soft linoleum blocks . They 're easy to cut and put less strain on the hand . <h> Step 6 : Prepare Your Surface <p> I 'm printing on cardstock which has been cut , dyed ( with black tea ) , bent , and stressed . In order to get a more vintage feel , you can sand down the edges with either an automatic sander or just a regular piece of sandpaper . <h> Step 7 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this size does not require a ton of ink , I 'm applying just enough ink to coat the brayer. - Next , take your brayer/roller and roll the ink using a horizontal and vertical motion . Get a thick amount of ink on the entire surface of the roller . Finally , roll the block . Because this is a relief print , only the protruding surfaces will have ink on them . <h> Step 8 : Print ! <p> Apply the block to the surface of the paper . The first print will have an excess amount of ink on it ; do n't  worry , every time you print , the ink will show up less and less . Some prints will be more even than others . Re-ink your brayer as desired . <h> Conclusion : <p> Congratulations ! You have just made a custom block print . Punch small holes and attach string for final presentation . This design can be used as many times as necessary for a wide variety of things . I hope this tutorial was informative and enjoyable .

@@98562586 @2762586/ <h> Become a Master Designer : Rule Four : Spacing Is Your Friend <p> Sorry for the long delay in releasing this latest installment of Seven Easy Principles to Becoming a Master Designer . We have been slammed here at Go Media and I literally havent been able to touch anything except paying projects for the past two months . Enough complaining . On with the show ! <p> This lesson is all about layout and spacing . One mistake I see young designers make frequently is that they cram everything too close together . They try to put too much content in too small of a space . Space is your friend ! Space does many things for you . It makes your copy easier to read . Space makes your over-all composition easier on the eyes of the audience . And space also makes your design look elegant . You 're telling the audience : " were so rich we can afford to use this entire poster to communicate this one little message . " <p> So , there is a basic strategy for the layout ( spacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE ONE . What I mean is have a plan . Have a system . This is the first thing . Unless your GOAL is to make the entire layout look random , you 're going to need a plan . This is usually accomplished with a grid . The grid can be any style you want . But you need to have an underlying system to what you 're about to do . Here are a few examples of different grids , just so you can get a sense of how different or unique your grid can be . <p> Now , here is some of the same content laid out three different ways : two with a grid and one without . As you 'll see , each grid still leaves you with a lot of layout options . Having no grid can result in chaos . <p> These first images show a fairly traditional grid . The lines are perfectly vertical and horizontal . They are dispersed at regular intervals . <p> This second grid is similar to the first one with one simple change I have slanted the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the container that holds the logo at the top . You can see how a minor change can result in some really cool results . <p> This last example has no grid . Spacing is random . Now , I obviously really messed this up to make a point . This particular piece does not have much content , so even messed up it really does n't  look THAT bad . But the more content you have , the more important it becomes to be working with a system of organization ! <p> I know you 're asking yourself : " Does he REALLY make a grid before he lays out every single design ? " Well , no , I do n't  . But understanding the method behind proper layout WITH A GRID will eventually allow you to design WITHOUT A GRID ( The grid will just be in your mind . You 'll visualize it on the page , but wont spend the time to set one up . ) <p> So , what does this grid teach us ? <p> 1 . Well , the most obvious answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , once again this is one of those basics that the novice will often times forget to do . Not every single item in the design lines up in one single file line , but things that should look like a group should be placed on the same grid line they should line up . *If you have never studied the Gestalt Principles of grouping , now would be a GREAT time to do a quick Google search and familiarize yourself with these concepts . They are critical to how you layout your design . <p> 2 . In addition to lining things up you want to space things at regular intervals . If you have three bullet points under a heading , you want to make sure the interval of space between each bullet point is the same . <p> 3 . Having ample space around your copy makes the copy easier to read . Here is an example of two designs one is spaced nicely away from the edge of the flyer and the photos , the second on is close to the edges of the flyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped and hard to read ? Answer = yes . Even though the second example has bigger text , it feels cramped and is harder to read . <p> You also want to avoid what is known as the " kiss . " No , this does not involve lips . A " kiss " is when two objects just barely touch . If , for instance , you have copy and a photo and they just barely touch . This is bad . Either give them a sufficient gap OR , make them overlap in a very obvious way . <p> Here is a close up of the fight flier here the web address just barely touches the horizontal background orange line . <p> Here is the same design with the web address pulled back away from that line . This is much better . <p> Or , if you need the room they can overlap . But I am going to make sure they are overlapping by a significant amount . Also just to insure that there is enough contrast between the web address and the background I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address really pops off the page . <p> And a quick aside if anyone out there needs a great workout , nutrition plan or a fitness assessment please visit www.hyperstrike.com ( Yes , they are one of our clients . And they truly have a GREAT service . ) <p> Now I know one problem many of you designers are having ( because I 've had this very problem myself ) : a client that wants you to cram 50 pages of content onto a single 8.5+11 inch flier . When you do your very best to layout all of this information in an organized way your client says : " Oh ! There 's enough room to put some more info on it ! Here is another 10 pages of content to cram on there ! " What do you do ? What do you do when a client keeps giving you too much content for too small of a space ? Well , this is a problem . And there is not necessarily an easy answer . My first piece of advice would be to try your very best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them aware that their audience wont even want to LOOK at an ad with this much content crammed into such a small space , let alone spend the time to try and read it . If the client wont listen to reason you may be stuck producing a horrible design . I 've had to do this . It sucks . If you have the time , you could also layout one version that is clean and ask him to take a survey of their friends and get more opinions . Unfortunately we frequently do n't  have that much time available to us . So , we do our best hang our heads low as we send the design to the printer . <p> One last little thing to be aware of is optical illusions . Huh ? How do optical illusions have anything to do with spacing ? As crazy as this sounds you need to be aware of optical illusions when you space your objects ! Sometime , due to optical illusions your proper spacing will LOOK like its off-center . A curving pattern in the background for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is simply off-center . <p> So , how do we compensate for these optical illusions ? Well you use your eye ; the same tool that is telling you it looks wrong , will be the tool you 'll use to correct for the optical illusion . <p> Making a correction for optical illusions is known as " best appearance . " Its not necessarily correct , but its what LOOKS correct . <p> So , always take one last look at your composition and make sure everything looks right . <p> I guess those are my pearls of wisdom concerning spacing .

@@98562590 @2762590/ <h> Color Management in Adobe Photoshop <p> This is the first part of a comprehensive detailed series of posts guiding you through the image editing process step by step from profiling your display and managing your color space and settings , to profiling your printer and preparing your work for print , to saving and distributing your work on the web . <p> The primary purpose of profiled color management is to achieve a good match of an image color between all devices involved in an image editing workflow , such as the camera display , the computer screen , and the printer . <h> Part One : Color Spaces <p> In Photoshop , the color management process begins with reading the profiled RGB color space of an image , and converting that to the current Photoshop RGB working space if it was using a different one . While editing a photo , the RGB workspace used in Photoshop is immediately converted to that of your monitor display so you 'd be able to view the colors correctly . And similarly , when you print out your images , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an RGB to CMYK color conversion of a known printer profile takes place . <p> Thus , being aware of your color space is a very important aspect , especially if you intend for your work to be distributed through digital or print media . If you 're spending all your time and energy making sure your images look good , might as well invest a little time and go the extra mile to ensure they look good to others as well . <p> An image that looks like the above in Photoshop , would look similar to the image below in printout if sent straight to the printer without any kind of color management <h> Choosing an RGB work space <p> In order to make up your mind on which RGB color space you should use , I 'm going to give you a brief description explaining the difference between various color spaces . Rule of thumb though , it is better to stick to your decided workspace throughout your work . <p> So let 's take a look at the different , most popular RGB color spaces : <p> sRGB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This standard space is endorsed by many hardware and software manufacturers , and is becoming the default color space for many scanners , low-end printers , and software applications . Ideal space for web work , but not recommended for prepress print out work because of its limited color gamut which causes color clipping when converted to CMYK . <p> Adobe RGB ( 1998 ) <p> Adobe RGB ( 1998 ) was developed by Adobe Systems . It is a fairly large gamut ( range of RGB colors ) that covers most of the CMYK color space , but by using RGB colors on devices such as computer monitors . It is a popular color space to go with for printing and reproduction since it offers a suitable RGB to CMYK conversion . <p> ProPhoto RGB <p> ProPhoto RGB space has the advantage of preserving the full gamut of raw images when converting to RGB , and providing better tonal separation than most other RGB color spaces . This color space is particularly suited for output devices such as digital dye sub and inkjet photo printers , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " ROMM RGB " . <p> Apple RGB <p> Apple RGB Reflects the characteristics of the average MAC OS monitor , and is used by a variety of desktop publishing applications , including Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and earlier since it was the same as the monitors color space . Use this space for files you plan to display on MAC OS monitors or for working with desktop legacy application files . <p> In general , a good thing to keep in mind is that large color gamut or space lead to posterization , which is the conversion of a continuous gradation of tones to several regions of fewer tones , with abrupt changes from one tone to another . Whereas small color gamut lead to clipping , which is blown-out highlights or dark areas in an image . <h> Conclusion <p> Different digital devices have different output characteristics , and unless you tune your work to match those of your destination media you 're most likely to end up with an endless number of versions of your same piece of work most , if not all , of which look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure homogeneity of your work , you should initially decide on a color space that best suits your needs depending on publishing and distribution means of your work , and go with that . <p> The next step and probably the most important one in the color management chain would be calibrating and profiling your input and output devices . <p> Well guide you through that in the next post in this series .

You can skip this step if you already have some vector images you want to use or will create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to show how the Arsenal vectors can be used in a professional poster design and get results rather quickly . <p> The benefit of using our premade vector elements from the Arsenal is that it saves you time and can help you achieve pro results . You can create an entire design with them or use them as accents or embellishments to your own design . For me , as someone who takes pride in creating my own illustrations , I use Arsenal stuff if it helps me get my point across or solves a design problem . <h> Step 3 : Create the Background Pattern <p> Open up the Propaganda Patterns vector pack that you downloaded from Set 18 . After you 're done oohing and ahhing at the really cool patterns , choose the one in the upper left hand corner and press Ctrl+C to copy it to your clipboard . <p> Next go back to your original poster document and press Ctrl+V to paste it . You might have to enlarge it just a tad . Next , drag the pattern into your swatch panel to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's exactly the same size as your artboard . Should be 11+17 . Give it a cream color like #EFEACE . Then copy and paste in front ( Ctrl+F ) . Now with that still selected , click on your new pattern fill swatch . This will apply the repeating pattern to your entire shape ! If for some reason it does n't  work , you might have applied it to the stroke instead of the fill color . <h> Step 4 : Find an Iconic Centerpiece <p> Open up the Mythology Vector Pack from Set 18 and choose one that you think looks like an iconic centerpiece . I chose the seahorse because I think its got a moody look that 's perfect for a vintage poster design . Pick one , then copy and paste it into your poster document . <p> Place the seahorse ( or whatever image you chose ) into the upper part of the poster and resize it to fit . With the object still selected , use your align toolbar to center it horizontally ( make sure align to artboard is checked ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't suggest using 100% black here because the idea is to keep the colors in good harmony with each other and the dark brown adds a little richness and cohesiveness with the background . <h> Step 5 : Create the Type Lockup <p> This part can best be described by using some typographic principles that I 've learned over the years . First of all , choose a typeface for your headline . In this tutorial I chose Knockout FullFlyweight by HF&amp;J . I could have chose ANY typeface , but I was going for iconic , clean , simple , minimalist , bold , and classy . Give all your text the same brown color as your iconic centerpiece . <p> One cool trick to make your headline standout ( and help with creating type lockups ) is to " bar off " your type . This simply means adding horizontal bars on the top and bottom of your type . The thickness should be somewhat similar to the thickness of your type . <p> Next , choose an accent font . For this tutorial I chose Mercury Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arsenal " text . Another good one could have Hellenic Wide . <p> And lastly , choose a third typeface one that 's a good contrast from your headline . If your headline is thin , try going for a normal or extended typeface . Gotham Bold is always a safe choice . <h> Step 6 : Accent your Centerpiece <p> The poster is looking good already . Good typography goes a long way . You do n't  always have to add more to make it look cool , remember that . However , I want to make the poster a little more visually interesting as well as get an additional color in there . Remember the message and meaning of your design before you go adding in vector elements willy nilly . If you do n't  have a good reason for adding it , you probably should n't . Less is usually better . However , in this poster , its job is to show off some of the versatility of the new Vector Set and it would n't be doing its job by only showing off two of the seven packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our packs in this poster without cluttering things up . For this purpose I went to the trusty " Infographix " vector pack . The charts , bars , graphs , lines and circles are GREAT for abstract backgrounds or accent pieces . Open it up and choose one that you feel fits best . In my case , I chose the one on the lower left . It would look fantastic behind my seahorse . <p> After you choose , center it in your poster right behind the seahorse . Give it a dark orange color like #876527 . Looking good . <h> Step 7 : Add a Pop of Color <p> I want to add a " pop " of color to complete my visual centerpiece . In this case I wanted to create some very simple wings behind the seahorse . I colored them a muted pink that I would tell a screen printer to print with a metallic ink . Or it would be cool to get a deep impression from a letterpress on that infographic element in the background . But that 's a different discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own custom wings . These are easy to create , so if you 're a beginner it might be fun to try your hand at this . Watch the video above to see how I did it . <h> Step 8 : Create a unique edge and a border <p> To make this poster more unique , I created a unique edge at the bottom . Honestly I cant think of a reason why I did this other than it just makes the poster a little different . Using the pen tool , create an organic and smooth shape and color it white . <p> And finally , let 's add a border to the poster to complete the look . Just create a box exactly the same size as your background ( 11+17 ) . Give it a 20pt stroke aligned to the inside and NO fill . <p> Once you 've done that , save out your image ! File&gt;Export export as a JPG at 300 DPI . RGB color is fine for this . You can call yourself done at this point , but I want to show you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects in Photoshop <p> Open up your newly saved image in Photoshop . First were going to add an overall grain to the image using some photographic textures . I 'm using a scan of an old magazine ad , but there are plenty of good ones online . <p> Put this on top of your image and set the blending mode to " screen " so you make the dark parts transparent . See my video tutorial at the top of this post to see this effect in more detail . <p> And finally , add some dust and dirt . You can set the blending modes of these to " multiply " to make the light parts transparent . <p> here 's your final image ! <h> Step 10 : Mock it Up ! <p> To help really put this poster into context , why not mock it up like a real poster ? We sell some really cool Poster Mockup Templates made for showing a " real-world " context of your images . Of course , nothing beats an actual photograph of your printed design , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paste your image into the " your art " layer of this template and the white color layer is the only color visible . And since the poster has a white border , you might want to unlock the background group and fill the background layer with a grey color . <p> Youll have to scale , distort , and possibly warp your image using the Free Transform controls ( Ctrl+T ) to help position your poster correctly for best results . The end result here is that it looks as realistic as possible . Is this a photograph of the printed poster ? Who knows ! ? <h> Youre Done ! <p> You now should have a firm grasp on how to create a professional and iconic poster design using mostly elements from Vector Set 18 . And hopefully you were inspired to create your own posters using other vectors or your own original illustrations . In fact , I 'd love to see them ! <p> In case you missed it , or want to review , consider watching the video : <h> Show off your results <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to post your images you 've created using Arsenal vectors , textures , fonts , etc .

@@98562592 @2762592/ <h> Creating Sagittarius in Photoshop <h> Tutorial Details <h> Resources : <h> Step 1 <p> Let 's start by opening a new file with a size of 1000x1500px with a resolution of 300ppi ( pixels per inch ) . <h> Step 2 <p> Next , open the stock images we 've downloaded . As you can see below , I positioned the stock images so you could have an idea of what well be creating . As you can see below , the Archers elbow is missing , Fig. a , so I used another stock photo then cut the area I only needed , Fig. b . <h> Step 3 <p> The next procedure is to remove the areas/backgrounds we do n't  need . For this step I used the Pen tool ( P ) to define a path all around the outline of each components of our image . Once the path has been defined , press right-click then select Make Selection from the pop-up menu . Do this procedure for the rest of our images . <p> The final product should look like as shown below . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings of our images to make it look as one . For this process , you can use Hue/Saturation , Levels and Vibrance to correct the colors of each component . This process is all trial and error so patience is needed , do n't  hesitate to experiment . I recommend to use the Archers body as the reference color tone for the Horses body and Arm extension to follow . The main goal for this step is to set the color tones of each components as close as possible . <h> Step 5 <p> Next is to make the connection of the Archers body to the Horses body . For this step I used the Brush tool ( B ) to paint the connection . I sample the color to be used from the Archers body then started to paint the missing parts . Using some shadings and highlights , I defined the archers abdominal muscles and the lower bones of the ribs . This step is only the primary procedure for the connection , further digital painting will be done in later steps . <h> Step 6 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Using the Patch tool ( J ) , select a small area of line we want to remove , Fig. a . After that , drag the selection and you will see the selected area change showing a preview of the area to be sampled , Fig. b . Use the areas close to the line as reference for the sample for the selected areas . Do this step until no trace of the line is to be seen , Fig. c . The final product is shown below . <h> Step 7 <p> Next is to extend the strap for the bow case . To do this , just select the Pen tool ( P ) then make a shape just like as shown in Fig. a . Next , using the Brush tool ( B ) , paint the selected area using the colors sampled from the original strap , Fig. b . Remember to apply a subtle drop shadow for the strap . The final effect should look like Fig. c . <h> Step 8 <p> After that , let 's extend the bow . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area just like as shown in Fig. a . Once selected , press Ctrl/Cmd+C to copy the selection . Place the copied selection on to the top portion of the bow , then press Ctrl/Cmd+T to rotate the selection just like as shown , in Fig.b . Do this also for the bottom part of the bow . Finally , do this procedure again for the second set of extension for the bow . Make sure to erase some parts of both edges to make it rounded , Fig. c . <h> Step 9 <p> Next step is to add the string/rope for our bow . To do this , using the Pen tool ( P ) , define a path just like as shown in Fig. a . After that press right-click then select Stroke Path from the pop-up menu , Fig. a-1 . From there , select the Brush as the tool of reference for the stroke , Fig. a-2 . Make sure that the Brush settings is set to a Hardness of 100% , Size of 3px and color# 000000 prior to doing the path . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strings layer Layer Style menu , then follow the indicated values as shown in Fig. b-1 . Finally , using the Pen tool ( P ) or Brush tool ( B ) , make the dropshadow for the string . <h> Step 10 <p> After all the process we 've made , we have to Merge all the layers that composes our Archer . But before you do it , I suggest you to duplicate all the layers first before merging , then group it into a folder , then hide it for the mean time . This will be our main backup just in case we want to change something later . <p> Once merged , change its Levels ( Ctrl/Cmd+L ) and Hue/Saturation ( Ctrl/Cmd+U ) settings with the given values indicated below . <h> Step 11 <p> Let 's now prepare the background of our subject . First , open the files Mountain.jpg . Like what I did in Fig. a , I only used a certain part of the image . Next , open the Ground.jpg then press Ctrl/Cmd+T to activate the resizing handles . Distort the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hue/Saturation setting of the Ground with the values indicated in Fig. c . Finally , using a soft , midsize brush with color #000000 , paint the areas indicated in Fig. d . <p> The final effect should look like as shown in Fig. e , here the merged layer of the Archer is placed . <h> Step 12 <p> The next step is to add the ground shadow of our Archer . This step is easy for you only need to use a soft , midsized brush set to an Opacity level of 50% and color #000000 . Brush the areas indicated below paying close attention to details . Make sure that the closer a part is positioned in reference to the ground , the shadow is more darker , and as you go away from the ground you decrease the opacity for the shadow . <h> Step 13 <p> Next using the Brush settings indicated below , paint the hair of the Archer as well as the tail part of the Horse . While brushing , try to use different shades of blacks and greys , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Step 14 <p> Our image looks flat , to fix this we need to add a couple of different shadings and highlights to emphasize the body contour of our Archer . Before we start , we first need to know the position of our " light source " which , in this case , is right above of our subject . <p> Knowing that , let 's start our digital painting process ! <h> Step 15 <p> Well start our process by adding some shadings . Based on our light source , I indicated the areas needed to be painted with different shades of blacks and browns . For this step , I recommend you to use a soft , mid-sized brush with an Opacity level of only about 2-10% . The process is all up to you . You could follow the original dark shades/areas of our image then just enhance it . <h> Step 16 <p> Next , after doing some shadings , let 's add some highlights . Using the same brush settings we used for the shade , but know using different color tones close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enhance the shadings we 've made . In this step , make sure to site the areas that needed to be emphasized or enhanced , such us the roundness of the Archers head , his arms , the horses chest , thigh , and neck to name a few . <p> Before we added the shadings and highlights , the image looks flat , but now some areas look as if their popping out . <h> Step 17 <p> Next step is to add a series of color enhancement thatll set the mood of our image and make the image look as one . First , add a new layer then , using the Paint Bucket tool ( G ) , fill the entire layer with color #462d00 . Next , set its Blending Mode to Overlay then decrease its Opacity level to 30% . <h> Step 18 <p> Next , like what we did in Step 17 , add a new layer then fill it with color #004a6d . Set its Blend Mode to Color Dodge . This step made our subject glow in a fantasy kind of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save a JPEG file of our work . Once saved , open the JPEG file then place it directly above our " work layers " then go to Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur then change its value to about 1.3 pixels , just like as shown in Fig. a . Next , using a soft , small size Eraser with an Opacity of about 50% , erase the areas indicated in Fig. b . This step will add a subtle glow for our subject thus creating a fantasy-like environment . <p> The final effect should look as shown below . <h> Step 21 <p> Next , I did some further enhancement for the highlights we 've made earlier but know doing it above the color enhancement layers we 've made . For this step , use a soft , small brush with an Opacity level of about 25% and color #ffffff . <h> Step 22 <p> Next , using a small brush of about 3px , paint the areas indicated in red with color #ffffff . This will emphasize the fold of the bandanna in his head and enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next is to add a subtle cast of shadows of our subject . To do this , using the Brush tool ( B ) set to a size of about 90px with hardness value of about 26% , paint the areas indicated in red with color #000000 . Finally , decrease its opacity level to 45% . <h> Step 24 <p> Next , we need to add a color overlay to make our image warmer . To do this , add a new layer then , using the Paint Bucket tool ( G ) , fill the entire layer with color #ff9600 . Go to its Blend Mode settings then change it to Overlay . Finally , decrease the layers Opacity level to about 32% . <h> Step 25 <p> Lastly , to complete our creation , I added a subtle sunlight cast from the upper-right corner of our image . To do this , using a hard , small brush , paint small dots like as shown below . <p> After that , press Ctrl/Cmd+T to transform our selection . I distorted it like as shown below , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner then spreading all out to the lower-left corner of our image . <p> Hi , my name is Patrick Lopez and I 'm a freelance artist here in the Philippines .

@@98562595 @2762595/ <h> Fear of Making Money <p> This post was originally written on my personal blog Maker/Mistaker and I thought I should repost it here . <p> A while back I was having a conversation with a friend of mine- Danielle Harper . We were discussing a lot of things that affect us as entrepreneurs . One of those was money . Danielle was describing a criticism she received but defended herself by saying , " and I did n't  even make any money on it . " <p> I stopped her right there because what she said made me realize something . She defended herself by reminding me that she did n't  make money . Why ? <p> So why did she resort to the " but I did n't  make money " defense ? I notice this a lot with the people I surround myself with . Grown adults who grew up on punk rock that never quite fit into the system . The whole DIY movement is sort of a fuck-you to capitalism and corporate greed . There 's a certain badge of honor doing things yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Ill Just Do it Myself <p> In your teens and early twenties , you are filled with hope and determination . You have enough courage to start your own business and start making money doing your own thing . Maybe you tried to get a job but could n't and were like , " fuck it " Ill just do it myself . Maybe you made an amazing product or had an brilliant idea nobody ever thought of before . Maybe you created something people admired and loved . <p> You knew you had to charge money for whatever it was , but you secretly hated that part of the business . You loved the creation . You loved the work . I cant tell you how many times I 've heard really talented artists say , " I cant believe I get paid to do this shit . " As if their talents are somehow worthless and clients and customers are fools for paying them . How much more self-deprecating can you get ? <h> Fear of Greed <p> The thing is , we seem to have this underlying fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does it lead to becoming that big fat greedy bastard we imagined when we were younger ? Are we afraid of- becoming the man ? - We do n't  want to be seen by our peers as motivated by money . Being motivated by money is the ultimate evil , right ? Well , that 's what we told ourselves . <p> Ever since I started Weapons of Mass Creation Fest , there have been many conversations about money . I heard from people who thought we were rolling in the dough with our $35 ticket price . Ill be first to admit I was quick to defend myself with how broke we were and how much we sacrificed . " Hey look , we are doing this for the love of the music and art ! " That- was- the truth , we did love it . We just needed enough money to cover our costs . And guess what we got ? Just enough money to cover our costs . Danielle said the same about her businesses . <p> It can be scary imagining yourself earning money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've seen so many people abuse it . You 're scared of what you might do with that money and power . <h> Fear of Criticism <p> Why are we so afraid of making money ? Is it because you can no longer be immune to criticism ? You cant fail if you 're not making money right ? There 's an assumption if you 're doing anything related to music and art that any hint of commercialism taints the true intentions of the artist . An artist often does not want to be regarded as having compromised his artistic integrity to make a buck . - Once you 're making a buck , you have customers . Customers who feel that you are now working for them and that they 're always right . You now opening yourself up to critique and criticisms and that can be hard to accept . <h> Altruism and Sacrifice <p> We all want to do good ; to change the world . We all feel that we were granted some special ability to affect the world in our own unique way . We judge ourselves and each other by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . Sacrifice is just another measuring stick to compare fellow humans with . Are you better if you sacrifice more for a greater good of the team or humanity ? <p> Being selfless or altruistic is admired . Its sometimes like a competition to see who can struggle the hardest and earn the least . Have you ever told someone a story of your hardship only to hear someone else one-up you ? " You think you 've got it bad , let me tell you ! " <h> Change Your Perspective About Money <p> Sometimes we are afraid of other people feeling insecure around us . If we happen to become successful , were afraid its going to make our closest friends jealous and insecure and even hate us . Until we change our perspective on money were going to treat it like poison . Until we stop judging what others do with their money , we will forever be judged with what we do with ours . 17224 @qwx877224

I started working on this project doing designs every day . Eventually people started blogging my stuff . It got kind of , I do n't  know , it got on some big graphic design blogs . I started getting some work from it . Did some work for Wired recently . I got some recognition from that project just a personal project . <p> GoMediazine:Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magazine . <p> GoMediazine:Wait , did you say Paste ? ! <p> Mark Weaver : Paste . <p> GoMediazine:Oh , I love that magazine . <p> Mark Weaver : Oh really , I used to work there .

They do all the NBA , NASCAR all that stuff . Georgia Music Hall Fame , I did some work for . <p> GoMediazine:So , what was your favorite project ? <p> Mark Weaver : Definitely Wired , because recently they asked me to do an illustration , just whatever I wanted as long as it had the date in there . So it was really open ended and really fun . <p> GoMediazine:So why did you come to the Weapon of Mass Creation campaign ? <p> Mark Weaver : I just thought it was a really cool idea , and some good exposure to get my name out there . Seemed like a fun thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design resources ? <p> Mark Weaver : Well , a lot of the stuff I do is based on public domain images . I take a lot of different images &amp; create something new out of them , kind of like a collage style .

I mean , I 've always had a love for drawing . Started drawing at an early age . It was just a natural path for me to go in that direction to do illustration &amp; design . Its not something I really chose . It was natural to do . <p> GoMediazine:I would doodle on the side of my math homework . <p> Mark Weaver : Yea , I 'd rather be drawing ! <p> GoMediazine:What is your ideal project ? <p> Mark Weaver : Oh man .

Or ? <p> GoMediazine:You know , you could name artists , or just whatever inspires you ? <p> Mark Weaver : I would have to say Stanley Kubrick is kind of a big inspiration for me . Just , the way he shoots film . Everything is very structured &amp; precise &amp; really clean . I feel inspired by his work and I try to emulate that in my work . Especially 2001 A Space Odyssey " , which is like my favorite movie . <p> GoMediazine:Your work has a nostalgic vibe to it , what draws you in that direction ? <p> GoMediazine:Lately there seems to be an abundance of people latching on to the style of **33;1812;TOOLONG .

@@98562608 @2762608/ <h> Design Project Management Software Debate : Basecamp VS . Podio Part 1 <h> What 's the Best Project Management Software for design firms ? <h> Part 1 . <p> There 's a cool new kid on the Project Management block , and her name is Podio . Podio has been receiving a lot of attention from our industry lately . Creative professionals are wondering if Podio has what it takes to unseat the old guard . That old guard being , you guessed it , Basecamp. - In this two part series , well discuss how these two stack up . Why ? Because Go Media- has been a Basecamp consumer- for nearly a decade . And we just may have started to hang out with someone new . Which is the best project management software for our needs ? Yours ? <p> Before I get started with our review , please note this is Basecamp VS . Podio within- the context of design &amp; creative service professional workflows . Therefore , this ca n't be considered definitive , because other industries will have different needs and some of those needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are the findings at the time of writing this . We do n't  retroactively go back and edit our articles when new features are added . If you 're from the future and find a discrepancy , please share it with the community by leaving a comment . Also , most of us have worked in Basecamp already . So I 'm not going to scrutinize it as much as " the new kid " . <h> Topics Well Cover <h> Part 2 ( Coming Soon ! ) <p> File Management <p> API &amp; Third-Party Integration <p> Automation <p> Pricing <p> Vendor Support <p> Conclusion <h> Learning Curve &amp; Usability <h> Basecamp <p> For most intents , the ease of use has been the defining factor in- Basecamps success . Basecamp did an impeccable job of implementing a User Interface which hides the more advanced technology , allowing newbies to dive right in . When you found yourself wanting more , it usually just takes hovering over a subtle label and , voila , Basecamp DOES do that . <p> Basecamp did a superb job making their interfaces clean , straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from traditional Word Processing , while elevating the UI with well designed controls , typeface selection and sizes . The information design and layout were clearly well-thought-out for maximum usability . Nearly every text field can be edited right on the spot . Basecamp truly set the bar for software-as-a-service through web applications with their attention to speed and prolific use of AJAX . <h> Podio <p> Not unlike Basecamp , Podio is indeed clean and uses AJAX to the max . The usability comparison pretty much stops there . I do n't  mean to elude Podio is a usability failure ; not by any means . But- Podio definitely has a much steeper learning curve when compared to Basecamp because of how it is built for flexibility . The core of Podio is an application builder where you design ( or import from the Podio community ) your very own " Apps " . Podio apps are actually more like templates. - You can design your app using unlimited fields , such as Text , Categories , Dates , Application Relationships , Contacts , a variety of numerical fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 different field types to choose from . <p> Once you 've created your Apps in Podio , then you can get to work . The Podio UI &amp; UX offer a lot of controls , some of which can be confusing . Apps are created under " Workspaces " which are discreetly tucked away in the corner . Its a tad off putting if you jump around Workspaces constantly . I suppose its a lot- like Basecamps Account- switcher mixed with their Projects , but the rationale- for Podio Workspaces is more centered around the perspective of traditional business departments . In that sense , Podio Workspaces make more sense than Basecamp Accounts if your company is indeed operating more than one department . <p> The biggest UI/UX complaint is Podios strange representation of " Contacts " . They have what they consider Podio Users or Members which are your team users/collaborators , but they label them Contacts and mix them with what they call " Workspace Contacts " which are NOT Podio Users , but rather a basic sort of contact address book . More on Contacts later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning curve as well . Podio did an excellent job with AJAX throughout their app , but did n't  keep those same standards here . Although powerful , it can be a tad jarring to navigate the different Views &amp; Reports and then effectively save them appropriately . This is an awesome feature . Basecamps filtering/reporting is nearly non-existent , Podios is just a bit convoluted . <h> Who has the edge in Usability ? Basecamp . <h> Task Management <h> Basecamp <p> Tasks are referred to as To-dos in Basecamp . There 's a " Your open to-dos " feature which gives you a birds eye view on everything ahead . Its easy to delegate to-dos to your colleagues . You can even assign to-dos to your clients . <p> To-dos can be expanded to reveal notification settings and attach files . Notifications are associated with email alerts . You can drag &amp; drop to re-order them . <h> - Podio <p> Tasks have been put at the forefront of Podio . If you 're reading this article , you obviously- know from experience , - project management starts and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global Task view gives you a birds eye into- your tasks- across all Podio Workspaces . This has an advantage over- Basecamp if we try to consider Workspaces analogous to Basecamp Accounts . In Basecamp , you would need to navigate across Accounts to truly see all of your tasks . <p> Reminders , files , labels , hierarchy and inline editing is essentially comparable to Basecamp . The only noteworthy addition in Podio is Task Comment Threads and Descriptions . These two more robust fields really improve the collaboration and accountability factor . Basecamp " Discussions " pickup where Todos leave off , but alas it is a separate feature . And we all know , in project management , system fragmentation is the mother of human error . <p> There 's also a sort of All Tasks view where you can see all of the tasks across an entire Podio Workspace . Its under the Activity logs little wrench icon . <h> Who has the Task Management edge ? Podio . <h> Project Management with your Team <h> Basecamp <p> We have to give credit , where credit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simplicity is , well NOT simple . The brilliant folks behind Basecamp managed to boil- down the process- of project management into its very basic , fundamental parts . They made it so easy to do , - and left out their opinions about how to do it , in such a concise way ; virtually any type of organization can effectively put Basecamp into their workflow . Its a cinch to on-board your team , delegate tasks , have discussions , share resources and stay organized with Basecamp . <p> You can absolutely manage the vast majority of projects using Basecamp . Its a veritable collaboration and communication hub which , at the end of the day , is the crux of teamwork . These screenshots say it all . <h> Podio <p> Podio can indeed do almost- everything Basecamp can , in its own way . Keep in mind , this only happens after you- contend with the learning curve . Once you have your " Project Management " app created , it could easily cover the same fundamentals . Discussions leave a lot to be desired ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , files , due dates and team collaboration are all- well accommodated . After the learning curve , Podios amazing flexibility with custom apps can be a huge advantage over Basecamp depending on your organizations needs and ability to manage the tools . Podio Reports &amp; Views are also very advanced . That said , it might be clutter- for many particularly smaller firms . <h> Who has the Project Management with your Team edge ? - Podio , by a slim margin for features &amp; flexibility . <h> Project Management with your Clients <h> - Basecamp <p> Basecamp has clearly made- outward facing client engagement a priority in its application . You can easily bring a client into their project , giving them nearly all the same tools as your team and without an additional fee to make them a " user " . Basecamp is very easy for a client to sign up with and their client invitation emails and entry points make it easy to get the hang of. - You can control what clients gain access to and can see , down to a granular level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients into collaborating with us on a platform in the fashion of how we each work , is never a given . Most- clients really only want to deal with us through email . Basecamp has a tremendous advantage over Podio with their Discussion threads . Discussions do not require the client to become a Basecamp user . You can simply loop a client into an email conversation which is routed through Basecamp Discussions . The email correspondence is automatically parsed and mapped to the appropriate senders Basecamp profile whether or not they ever login . <p> Basecamp has the advantage of being a market leader , making it much easier to bring a client into the fold because they likely already have an account . <h> Podio <p> I mentioned , earlier , the convoluted " Contacts " model Podio uses . The weirdness does n't  stop- there . They have what they refer to as " External Users " which are Contacts or clients , or something- like that . These are different from Workspace Contacts , which are a more powerful means to organize your clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Users are mixed in with your team , which can be very annoying . Podio claims to be working on streamlining all the Contacts nonsense , but right now it leaves a lot to be desired . <p> Inviting- External Users into Podio is a higher bar because of the learning curve with Workspaces and how Views are designed . It is not intuitive for the lay person and they do n't  have market share to rest on their laurels . This topic is probably THE Achilless Heel for Podio right now . <p> That said , you can indeed share a Podio App item in several ways with the outside world . <p> Invited users will still have to contend with Podios learning curve . Being the new kid on the block will hinder clients willingness to take the time to sign-up . <p> Trying to loop non-Podio users into a Podio workflow is nearly impossible . They have nothing adequately competing with- Basecamp Discussions . There 's a 3rd party service called Globimail , but Podios API wont allow proper Email threading where senders are accurately cited . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Email Integration topic . <h> Who has the- Project Management With Your Clients edge ? - Basecamp . <h> Proofs &amp; Client Reviews <p> Seeing as this is a review geared toward creative professionals , a very common need is the ability to collect feedback on images or graphic designs . Its very useful to have that feedback recorded directly alongside the files , so you can cross-reference every detail . This feature is an easy comparison . <h> Basecamp <p> Has it going on . <h> Podio <p> Does n't  . <p> That might not be completely fair . Obviously Podio has a file manager and files can be shared with users . In fact , the file manager rivals some of the best Ive seen in the SAAS segment . <h> Calendar Integration <p> Calendars are tricky business in project management . They can easily become overwhelmed if you start putting every little task onto them . Another common problem is when you try to squeeze projects which span an extended period of time over them . You often end up with what you 'll see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an innovative UI solution to this problem . <h> Basecamp <p> Likely thanks to its maturity , the Basecamp calendar covers just about every usage scenario you could think of . Events are easy to create , invite users to , and edit . Deadlines , events and to-dos can all be assigned to a calendar . Basecamp creates a unique calendar for each project and gives you the ability to create and share even more . This gives you a nice way to divvy up assignments and toggle what you 're looking at . We all know how busy looking a calendar layout can become when managing several projects . <p> Color label each of the multiple Basecamp calendars . Calendars can be shared outside of Basecamp using the iCal XML feed format . <p> You can invite internal and external contributors to a calendar . This can be a great way to share deliverables &amp; milestones with a client . <p> Aside from the inline ease of use Basecamp is known for , their integration with the famous Basecamp Discussion threads can be spawned from just about any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a ways to go with their calendar . It works well for what it does , but far from as feature rich as Basecamps . What you see is pretty much what you get . It offers iCal sharing , gives you pretty common usability features . There 's no inline ( ajax ) editing like in Basecamp . You 'll leave the calendar to try and edit something . But its clean and covers the basics . <p> One nice feature differentiating from Basecamps is the ability to sort of mute a project from the calendar . You do this at the project level , which is a different paradigm from Basecamp . In Basecamp , you would toggle a project calendar view , similar to how it works in Googles . Because Podio does n't  spawn unique calendars for each project , this is fundamentally different , but at least useful in its context . <p> Another setting to toggle what you 're looking at , on the single- Podio calendar , is how events &amp; tasks relate to you . This is neat , because it let 's you silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is useful for Producers who might not need to be actionable on a project until a certain phase is complete or for Art Directors who want the birds eye in one place but maybe not muddying up their own calendar . <h> At this juncture , we have to give the- Calendar Integration edge to : Basecamp <h> Email Integration <p> Despite the futurists whove proclaimed the looming demise of email , email continues to be a- cornerstone in- the modern business system . Sure , some innovations have tried to replace email . Asana- and Slack come to mind . The challenge with such an ambitious goal ; most businesses do n't  operate in a bubble . Most businesses rely on a lot of interactions with a lot of stakeholders , namely other businesses , consumers and vendors , to successfully serve those stakeholders . If you 're reading this , you know how difficult it is to get your clients to adopt YOUR system . Your clients have their own operations to be concerned with . They 're not going to make a substantial effort to accommodate yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to cut to the chase , Basecamp does this better than anyone out there . <h> Basecamp <p> Project activity email notification controls , check . You can be very granular with who 's notified and with what . <p> You can also control your own . Set an email which might even be different than that of your account . <p> Basecamp recently added a Gmail support feature where a link to the item is automatically shown . <p> We talked about Basecamp Discussions - earlier . One of the most powerful and useful features is the ability to loop a non-user into the thread . This means a client or customer does n't  need to ever signup and into Basecamp to be a part of their project conversation . Any adopter of Basecamp knows how incredibly useful it can be to keep correspondence within the context of a project . Basecamp clearly agrees and makes it incredibly easy . <h> Podio <p> Podios email integration is a bit of a mixed bag . There are some unique and excellent features which align to- its tremendous flexibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community scratching their heads . <p> Podio notifications are reliable and work well . The settings are quite- pragmatic . <p> Podios remarkable flexibility is at the core of its value . You can essentially design your " apps " to suit your workflow . They did a fantastic job aligning an Email to App feature where you can map emails sent to Podio to automatically create items in your custom app . This is one of the stronger email integration features in the topic . <p> Podio also offers features similar to Basecamps Email In . You can email to a unique Podio addresses for Apps , Items and a few other features like Messages and even a Facebook like Status . <p> The area Ive seen the most complaints about Podio is its lack of Email integration for actual conversation threading . You know , what email is designed for . Yes , you can indeed rope non-users into becoming " External Users " where they can learn how to use Podio and you can try to get clients into your workflow . I 'm beating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Basecamp Discussions for non-users . Its so bad , a third party developer took it upon himself to create a product called Globimail . Globimail does the best they can to try and help add decent email threading into Podio . Its pretty rough , but were thankful for their service to the community . <h> This one is lights out . The Email Integration winner is clearly : Basecamp <h> Part 1 Wrap Up <p> " The Edge " by the numbers , Basecamp : 5 . Podio : 2 . Is Basecamp running away with this ? Maybe . Check back soon for Part 2 of this review . Well update the links in this post when its ready- or you can find it on the zines homepage. 
@@98562610 @2762610/ <h> The Making of the TweetBacks Logo <p> So around 4:30 pm yesterday , I had originally planned to catch up on my emails and starred items in my Outlook . I had been meaning to do that for a few days now . However , that did n't  happen . Such is the case just about every day , I was easily distracted by something more urgent that I had not planned for in advance . What I will tell you is one of the strange coincidences that you 'll find working as a designer these days . <p> Around midday , multiple twitter friends posted about this new wordpress plugin called " Tweetbacks " so I checked it out and thought it was quite a nifty idea . The plugin basically adds " trackbacks " to your post from people who link your post on twitter . And it also tracks all the people that ReTweet it too . The plugin was created by Dan Zarrella in response to a Mashable article about how Twitter will change blog design in 2009 . I followed Dan on twitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a few suggestions . He gave me his AIM screen name and we chatted about how it could be improved . He asked me if I would be interested in doing the logo for him . I said of course ! <p> Normally , when I design a logo for someone , I try to get inside their business and see what it is THEY see ; what they envision . I have them write me some points about their target market and all that . But when I asked Dan those questions , he simply said " you are the expert at that stuff . " So then I looked at the time and it was nearing 5:00 pm . I had only 1 hour left in the work day and I decided not to make this a big production . I just wanted to bang out something quick and send it off to him . I already had the idea he wanted a classic " cartoony " twitter bird with a symbol that stood for " TweetBacks . " <p> This meant that I had to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explaining in any detail what they stood for . And this was n't your typical paying job . I was doing it as a favor in support of the plugin and he was going to credit us for the design and link to our site . So , I opened up Illustrator and started putting some stuff together . I knew that the way WordPress displayed trackbacks was with the characters surrounding the link like that . So I was going to do a spin off of that . <p> I decided to use curly braces and make the dots sort of form a smile to add to the friendliness and social nature of Twitter . I chose the typeface Mercury Bold for my .. because I just love the way it makes those curly braces . <p> The bird was just a few vector shapes pieced together and the color scheme was taken from the blue twitter bird he already had on his site . <p> I surrounded the artwork with a square box to make it more iconic that could fit well anywhere . At first it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second color , just in case he wanted to build a dedicated website around TweetBacks in the future , he could pull from my secondary color to accent various parts on the site . So the second color turned into a grassy hill under the blue sky . <p> And I chose the font Mrs. Eaves Petite Caps for the word " TweetBacks " because it fit nice under the square . I had the idea of using a solid serif typeface the whole time , so I did n't  put a whole lot of thinking behind it , other than it looked nice . <p> In the meantime , while I worked on his logo , Dan was busy wrangling lots of big blogs to post about it . He told me ProBlogger posted it and he was scheduled on Smashing Magazine the following day . I had better act quick if I wanted to get this logo up on his site for maximum exposure ! So I saved out a proof and sent it off . <p> He loved it immediately ! Whew , no revisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works as office manager here , was just about ready to go . Dan said he Mashable was going to post about TweetBacks and he needed a black and white version of the logo . So I went back into Illustrator and made both a grayscale and black and white version and send the vector files off to Dan . It was 6:20 pm and Kim was patiently waiting for me . Thanks Kim ! <p> So later that night I checked Dans blog and he had posted the logo and gave credit to Go Media as planned . So , that 's how a crazy logo design process can work sometimes . It was needed in an absolute hurry and he wanted something cool and sophisticated that represented his plugin well . It was my pleasure to be able to offer him my idea and carry it out . I like how it came out and I 'm really excited to see it being used . 17224 @qwx877224 
@@98562611 @2762611/ <h> Creating a Fantasy World <p> Intro : We often dream of living in a fantasy land . Creating such a fantasy in Photoshop is really great fun . In this tutorial we will be creating an imaginary world where we will be covering interesting topics such as the use of two point prospective , utilizing references for a better result , new and advanced tools of Photoshop CS5 , and a few additional tips for image manipulation . <p> Preview : <h> Tutorial Details : <p> Program : Adobe Photoshop CS5 <p> Difficulty : Beginner , Intermediate <p> Estimated Completion Time : 1hr <h> Resources : <p> Open a new canvas in Photoshop with Width=2560 , Height=1440 . Then , draw a rough sketch of the set that we are going to create . This sketch will be assist us during the process of analyzing components that we will be creating during this tutorial . <p> Step 2 : <p> Import the image of the model onto the canvas- and place the model to the right side of the canvas as shown . <p> 1 ) Now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask around the empty portion as shown using the Selection Tool ( M ) . <p> 2 ) In this step we will be using the new Fill tool with the Content-Aware option available in Photoshop CS5 and above . The Content-Aware option can intelligently clone the selected area by referencing the surroundings . <p> Hold Shift+Backspace to open the Fill Tool , then set Use dropdown to Content-Aware , press OK , and within few seconds you can see the magic of this great feature . <p> 3 ) After the Content-Aware/Fill finishes it 's work you may find a few overlaps as indicated in the image . In order to cover these errors select the Clone Stamp Tool(S) and make sure the errors are perfectly covered . <p> Step 3 : <p> According to the sketch we drew in the first step , we need to place few elements behind the model . Hence create a selection around the model using the Pen Tool(P) . Then separate the selection into a new layer by pressing Ctrl+J . <p> Step 4 : <p> Now import the image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( V ) and transform the image to fit the prospective were working with in our main file . <p> Step 5 : <p> The original pyramids are in the color of the desert sand . But here , the location is similar to a white desert ; hence , we must change the pyramids to the color of our image . <p> 1 ) With the pyramids layer selected go to **29;1847;TOOLONG and White ( Alt+Ctrl+Shift+B ) and set the values as shown . <p> 2 ) Now brighten the pyramids by setting the Exposure levels to Exposure=+0.52 , Offset=+0.0673 and Gamma Correction=1.00 . <p> 3 ) In this step , observation plays a key role . Open the Curves(Ctrl+M) and color-correct the pyramids by referring the sand color carefully . The result of the curves should be as shown . <p> Step 6 : <p> In this image the pyramids are located far from the model , hence they should be blurred in order to accurately emulate the depth of field in the image . <p> With the pyramid ' layer selected add a Gaussian **31;1878;TOOLONG Blur ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any huge structure is seen from a far distance , the base appears to be mixed-up with the color of the surroundings , making it almost invisible . Check the following image for reference ( Thanks , iStockPhoto ) . <p> Now , by using the Eye Dropper Tool , select the color of the sky just above the horizon and paint the base of the pyramid as shown using the Soft Brush(B) . <p> Step 8 : <p> Adhering to perspective is very important while working on Matte Painting or Set Extension . It makes our work easier in placing an image or creating an object which fits perfectly with the perspective of the main image . <p> 1 ) Select the Line Tool(U) to draw the prospective lines . For this image we will be using two point prospective , hence make two points on the horizon and draw the prospective lines as shown . <p> 2 ) In this step we will be creating the outline of the flying triangles . Draw two inclined lines as shown from the vertical line that we drew in the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using the Pen Tool(P) create a selection in the shape as shown within the triangle and paint the left side of the triangle with the color #f1f2f6 . The reason for using this color is because this part of the triangle is exposed to sun , and we want to match the lighting . <p> 2 ) The right side part of the triangle depicts the slightly shaded part of the triangle , hence paint it with the color #cdd2da . <p> 3 ) Now add some shadows to the triangle as shown to provide more depth to it . <p> Step10 : <p> 1 ) To create the frame for the triangle , select the image of the bamboo stick from it 's original image . Cut the stick out and place it in a new layer . <p> 2 ) Turn the image into Black and White by using **29;1911;TOOLONG and White and set the values as shown . <p> 3 ) Now import the image of the bamboo onto the working canvas and place it as shown using the Move Tool . Duplicate the bamboo image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vertical line using the Line Tool to represent the size of the second triangle , then draw the prospective lines to it as shown . Following this method can limit the number of lines to be drawn for the prospective and make it easy to concentrate on the required area . <p> Step12 : <p> Repeat the 8th and 9th steps to complete the second triangle . <p> Step13 : <p> 1 ) To create a flag on the top of the second triangle , create a mask in the shape of a randomly waving flag as shown using the Pen Tool ( P ) . Then fill the selection with color . We liked red , but feel free to get crazy and choose something else . <p> 2 ) Creating the shadows to the flag can give a natural depth for folds . Using the pen tool create a mask as shown and shade the masked area using the Soft Round Brush with black colour . <p> 3 ) Similarly , follow the previous steps and complete the shading of the flag as shown . <p> Step14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated on the model . Since the second triangle appears to be far from the model it should be blurred in order to maintain the depth of field . Add a Gaussian Blur of radius 1.8px to the second triangle . <p> Step15 : <p> The flying triangles are not stationary and thus should be given some Motion blur to indicate the movement . To get this effect , create a mask on the left edge of the triangle as shown and set the Feather Radius of the mask to 14px . <p> Then add a Motion Blur ( **25;1942;TOOLONG Blur ) of Distance 17px and set the angle to -4 . <p> Step 16 : <p> Repeat Step 15 to the flag to make the flag look as if it is moving with the turbulence of wind . <p> Step 17 : <p> Repeat Steps 14 and 15 for the first triangle . But , since this triangle is closer to the model , the Gaussian blur should be 0.8px . <p> Step 18 : <p> Duplicate the second triangle without the flag and place them as shown according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value with the increase in distance of the triangle from the model . <p> Step 19 : <p> In this step we will be using an advanced , yet easy way to cut an image with fine detail using the newly updated Refine option in CS5 . <p> 1 ) Import the image of the desert plant that we are going to place on the left side corner of the image as illustrated in the sketch . Then by using the Lasso Tool ( L ) select a rough mask around the plant . <p> 2 ) Now open the Refine Edge ( Alt+Ctrl+R ) , and paint the selected area using the Refine Radius Tool to get a quality result .

@@98562617 @2762617/ <h> 3D Typography in Photoshop <h> Introduction <p> In this tutorial we are going to go over various techniques you may have seen before , as well as a bulk of techniques that may be new to you . After you have completed this intense walk though , I assure you will be able to explore even more new ways of creating typefaces as well as other types of ideas . Inspired by the work of Nelson Balaban as well as my own , I decided to re-create an old piece of mine using the techniques I am about to show . The completion of this effect will probably take around 8 hours collectively ; however , once learned , the process shall be pretty easy and fast to replicate . Even though it is extensive , nevertheless it will be very fun and insightful . The final effect is shown below . Alright , let 's do this fellas ! <h> Let 's Get Started <p> We shall start out by choosing a typeface that appeals to us the most . Personally , I love the new blocky typefaces we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them at myfonts , or look at the free ones at fontstruct ( pretty amazing free fonts ) . <p> The typeface I have chosen for the image above ( MOD ) can be found here.This font is created by a great typographer named Svetoslav Simov . You may have noticed my font is very distinct from the actual MOD font created by Simov , due to modifications I made to the lettering in illustrator . We can now open up illustrator and load in any document size . The size of the document does not matter at this moment because we will be importing the finished illustration into Photoshop as a Smart Object . <h> Step 1 Setup <p> Alrighty then . After we have chosen our preferred typeface , we shall proceed by expanding the text . This will make it an editable path . We will also load in the swatch file provided or choose to create our own unique color scheme . If you do n't  know how to expand the typeface or load swatches , take look below . <h> Step 2 Extrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swatches , we shall proceed with the handy extrusion tool located in the Effect Menu&gt;3D&gt;Extrude &amp; Bevel . Normally we would want to extrude the whole entire phrase or word in one instance ; however , we want to give life to the text by not making it seem so generic . For that we must extrude every single letter by itself , giving each different vanishing points . This will in end , make the letters seem like they are playing off each other and give life to the finished product . <p> This process involves working with multiple paths ; therefore , we want to keep our work flow very smooth by creating a very organized Layer structure in Illustrator . Take a look ( below ) at how I go about organizing my layers and sublayers . Having all of these vector objects scattered all over the place can become cumbersome . I immediately moved each letter into its own layer and also added sublayers for extra effects that I knew I was going to add along the way . <p> What we want to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting a letter individually and hitting Crtl+C to copy , then Ctrl+ F to paste in front . For now we will hide the copies of the letters . Using the original letter , we shall now apply the- Extrude &amp; Bevel effect . <p> Ok , so this is where the whole technique becomes a bit more involved . Take the instanced letter you have hidden , and we will perform Alt+SHIFT+Ctrl+E . This command will load any last filter/Effect we have applied to the previous object . This saves us the hassle of going through the Effect menu and manually clicking on Extrude &amp; Bevel again and again . <p> NOTE : This handy command will preserve ALL the attributes entered for the last object this effect has been added to . THIS IS WHAT WE WANT because we will do the same to the instanced letter but well now add a closed cap extrusion rather than an opened one . Look Below . <p> Repeat this process we have described so far to the remaining letters . Remember- to keep everything as organized as possible " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing . This is were organization plays a big role . Take the time now to organize everything now if you have not done so . <h> Step 3 Expansion <p> Hanging in there ? Good ! because now it gets super tricky . Youll have to work hard to get this cool effect . Ready ? <p> So , you might ask , why did we make two copies of each letter and why did we extrude them differently ? Guess what , your questions are answered in this step . I 'm going to explain this very thoroughly to the best of my ability so try to follow along . <p> We are going to now hide all the letters besides the N ( If you chose to create a different word , you will now proceed to hide all the letters except the beginning one ) . Next , hide the EMPTY CAP extrusion of the N. This will leave us with the OPEN CAP N which was originally the first copy we placed in front and made the second extrusion to . <p> Now we will expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and leave the " CAP " . Note , since we have already expanded the typeface and added an effect to it , in order to make it a workable path , we must expand it once more . We will notice that now the expand option is grayed out . This is fine . We shall use the expand appearance option right below it Object&gt;Expand Appearance . <p> When expanded , we shall see that illustrator will created a group of different things that make up the Effect . To ungroup the expanded objects and to make it easier to located the shapes we want to keep or get rid of , we are going to : Expand the layer with the newly expanded extrusion ! This is why turning the blend steps is key . The more blend steps we have , the more shapes we will have to work with . This will create a hassle undoubtedly . <p> Ungroup all of the new objects by selecting the extruded shape and hitting Shift+Ctrl+G three times <p> Find the shape that pertains to the cap ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layer ) <p> Delete everything below the cap <p> Add any of the green and blue gradients to the cap <p> Turn down the opacity of the N cap to about 50-56% <p> Once these sub steps are completed , you should have an image like the one shown below . <p> Now when we delete all the unnecessary objects pertaining to the capped extrusion , we can see right through the inside of the letter when the opacity is turned down . <h> Step 4 Expanding Empty Extrusion <p> First , we expand the empty N so that it will give us more flexibility and creativity when adjusting the colors and transparencies of the sides . <p> Now that we have completed the expansion process of the N , we are about to do the same to the empty capped N. Hide the Cap layer and select the empty N. Again , go to the Object menu and select Expand Appearance : Object&gt;Expand Appearance . Now it gets tricky . It is best to follow the pictures so that you can get a better sense of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N , and ungrouped all of the objects , we want to start joining our corresponding paths together . <p> I will explain the basic theory around this . Let 's start with the far right side of the N. Essentially what we want to create is a continuous shape that resembles a particular side . If we were to apply a color the sides of the N , it would look weird and incoherent . This is because of the blend steps . You see , the extrusion tool uses an algorithm that applies gradients to the extruded edges to create depth , so when expanded ( remember , the expansion tool makes everything that is being expanded COMPLETELY EDITABLE ) , the blend steps themselves become individual objects . So now , if we where to select the right or any side of the N , we would only select 1 of the shapes that create the whole entire side . For clearer understanding , follow the pictures . <p> Now watch what I do exactly below when I join the paths . <p> So basically , what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side as well as the curve , navigating to the pathfinder tool located , Window&gt;Pathfinder or Shift+Ctrl+F9 , then using the Add to shape Area command within the pathfinder tool to join the end . Notice How I immediately click the expand button after I join the paths in the pathfinder floating menu . This allows me to make the new shape directly editable . Now I can add a continuous gradient throughout the sides . Essentially , this is what we want to do to every single side of the N. <p> Continue with step 4 and do what I have shown , to all of the sides . Just watch below as I go through and do it myself . <p> NOTE : When viewing the mini gifs shown above , do n't  be alarmed by the color applied . The gradients look like they are separated into three parts . This looks that way because of the compression rate I used on the Gif files . <p> You might notice that sometimes when I joined the paths together they suddenly disappeared . This is because when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers . This is no problem . After joining them , and they disappear , all we have to do is locate the layer/group they are in ; expand that corresponding layer and locate the clipping mask . Delete this clipping mask and watch at amazement as your object re-appears . Now we can choose what ever color we desire . Do n't  be confined to what I do . This is the part where everything gets fun for you . This is were you start being creative and adding colors AND transparencies you think will look nice . <h> Step 5 Modifying the other Letters <p> You will have two choices now . You can either go ahead and repeat steps 2 , 3 and 4 to each letter , or you can start adding your effects to your newly created letter . If you decide to apply this effect to all the letters now , your letters should resemble something like the image below . When you are done with this , let 's meet at step 6 . <h> Step 6 Get Creative <p> Ok , so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are finally- going to have some - fun with this process . This is the part of the tutorial were your creativity is welcomed most . You can say this is the post work in Illustrator . I cant really teach creativity or give you a specific guide on how to think artistically for yourself ; however , I can show you some of the techniques I used and teach you how to utilize resources to the best of your ability . <p> Now we are going to want to hide all the letters and work on just one at a time . With the caps selected , let 's play around with the opacities , blend modes and strokes . One thing I particularly like to do is mess around with dashed lines . To achieve this effect we create a stroke , expand the stroke options and check dashed line . We can now set the length of the dashed line . I tend to keep the settings low and thin to get a notebook effect . <p> Next , duplicate the cap N , keeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delete the N and keep the stroke . Enlarge the newly expanded stroke and add a gradient you like . Do this as many times you want to create variety . <p> The expanded selection should look like this and now we can apply a gradient . <p> Continue experimenting with this until you are pleased . <p> Let 's create circles , add any gradients we like and set blend modes to multiply . Create these separate elements in different sub-layers in order to keep them organized . <p> Now watch carefully as I create opacity masks to achieve nice fading effects . I 'm basically making a shape , choosing a color I like , then creating another shape on top of it with a black and white gradient that serves as the opacity mask <p> Continue this process over and over again to create unique designs . Do n't  just use circles , also experiment with other geometry . Also try variations of radial and linear gradients for the opacity masks to create distinct fading effects . <p> Now we will create variations of white spheres and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth . <p> Apply the Blur and experiment with the Transparency settings as well as Opacity to blend it in better . <p> Now when you are satisfied with what you have , let 's get a little bit more creative . Let 's add some patterns behind the letter . You can come up with your own pattern , search the freebie section of Go Medias Vector Packs and use those available patterns , check out Vecteezy for more elements or you can browse the awesome Arsenal collection Go Media offers . Once you have decided what you want , place a sublayer at the end of the N Main layer and place the pattern inside it . <p> Let 's add some more spizzaz to our design by taking advantage of Go Medias free brush pack . We can now use strokes with the shapes provided in the free brush pack to create intricate background designs . Mess ground with expansion and gradient to get the desired effect . <p> Now that we are done with the N letter , we can repeat all of the steps above to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye candy should look like this . <p> We are now ready for some handy dandy post work in Photoshop . Save your work and proceed to the next step . <h> Step 7 Post Work <p> Let 's use a drag selection to copy all of our elements in Illustrator . We need to make sure none of our layers/sublayers are locked , or the finished product will look weird and incomplete inside of photoshop . Press Ctrl + V or Edit&gt;Paste . An import dialog box should pop out in photoshop . We shall choose Smart object , that way all vectors are preserved . <p> NOTE : Transparencies are not transferable from Illustrator to Photoshop due to the difference in Blend Modes . In order to preserve the transparencies , you will have to import the text effect with a background from Illustrator . However , If you know how to import the imagery from Illustrator to Photoshop with corresponding transparencies , do share with us your method . I have often tried to export my image from Illustrator as a PNG then import it back into Photoshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think adobe should keep the algorithm for transparency modes in all of their products the same for better compatibility between software packages . <p> Now that we have our work imported , we shall look for Nebula stock imagery to give our Fruity text a futuristic feel . I used these stocks : Nebula 1 , Nebula 2 , and D.A . Moonchilde . With Moonchilde stock , make sure you credit her properly as she gives specific instructions on how her stock may or may not be used . I will not be covering too much texturing in this tutorial b/c I find that this text effect stands out better on a calm n subtle background . Of course you can go crazy and add as many textures and images as you want , but that 's your forte . <p> Now that we have our text properly imported and our stock images chosen , we will begin by creating a vignette around the text . To do so , let 's create a huge eclipse selection but let 's keep it within the canvas . Inverse our selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w/e color is desired , Let 's apply a Gaussian Blur to it with Maximum settings , and let 's turn down the opacity to about 35% and now we have a nice looking vignette . <p> Now we want to add a shadow underneath the Letters to give the image more depth . <p> Let 's give the shadow layer a Gaussian Blur effect of about 25.2 pixels and then let 's decrease its opacity to about 57% so that it does n't  look over saturated in black . Essentially we want a soft area shadow . <p> Let 's some Diamond shapes . We will use the rectangle Marquee tool to create a square selection by holding shift and dragging along the canvas . Let 's right click selection and choose Transform Selection , hold shift to snap rotation to 45 degrees , then rotate once . Use the paint bucket to fill the selection with white or whatever color you prefer . <p> Give the rotated square a gradient overlay of your liking . <p> With the marching ants/selection still active around the square , choose the marquee tool again and move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click , Transform Selection and stretch the selection out . <p> With selection in place , we will apply a Ctrl+Alt+D command or simply **27;1969;TOOLONG , and choose a radius of about 50 pixels . Hit apply then press delete . This create a smooth fading effect inside of the square/diamond . <p> Repeat this effect to your liking with same or different shapes . Its always good to take risks and try new ideas . <p> Now let 's add some nice glows to the background by creating 3 circles with different colors . <p> To make them glow , we will now add a Gaussian Blur Effect and play with opacities . <p> Finally , we will finish the piece by adding a subtitle below the word . I chose typeface , you can go with w/e you desire . We will give it a nice gradient that plays off the main title . <p> Now we duplicate the Typeface layer by applying a Ctrl+D command . We will hide the Glow option but keep the gradient . Right click the layer and convert to Smart Object in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of the glow . This allows us to re-scale the position of the Typeface object anywhere without the gradient changing . Now we will apply a Gaussian Blur and set blending mode to Soft Light 100% . This will now act as our glow pass for the Typeface element . <p> Let 's add some motion blur to the typeface . Duplicate the Typeface layer once more . Again , disable the glow option but keep the gradient overlay . Convert to Smart Object and apply a Motion Blur . <h> Step 8 : HDR Effect <p> Technically , the design is complete . Personally , I like to give an HDR effect to all of my flyers and typographical based works . I do n't  use any expensive HDR image plugins out there , however when I get the money I will definitely get my hands on Topaz Adjust . It mimics what I basically do at the click of a button . This would definitely come in handy when tweaking something last minute . Oh well , I do n't  have it , but if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technique that would mimic the final output of this awesome filter . <p> So we will start out by exporting our file as a JPG image then re-importing it back into Photoshop . I like to do this rather than merging layers and or flattening my image , because I tend to save a lot . If I save while I have flattened the image I will lose everything I have worked on , layer wise . This is why I choose the Export JPEG option since it will flatten the image for me and preserve the 300 dpi or whatever setting I have it set to . You can also export to PDF , TIFF or whatever floats your boat . Just make sure the image is flattened . <p> Now we will duplicate the layer 4 times . Name one layer shadow , the other highlights , the other sharpen and the last isolation . Leave the BG layer locked as we will merge everything back to one layer when everything is done . <p> Hide all the layers but the shadow one . The go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . <p> We can now hide the shadow layer and un hide the Highlight Layer . We will now bring out the highlights . <p> Let 's hide the highlight layer . Now we want to isolate the shadows from the highlights and vice versa . To do this , we will use the isolation layer . We will give it a brightness and contrast adjustment found **34;2039;TOOLONG and Contrast . <p> Using the isolation layer , we will extract the highlights from the highlight layer and the shadows from the shadow layer . To do this use a Color range selection found Select&gt;Color Range . Select the black area and then click ok . Now inverse your selection and apply a feather range of about 25 . Delete your selection twice and now you have a layer with only shadows . <p> We will do the same concept with the highlight layer . Use the isolation layer as a map , use a select range option then click on the black area , instead of inversing the selection , leave it as is but feather it to about 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> Now we un hide both shadow and highlight layers and hide the isolation map layer . We shall now tweak the blend modes of these layers to create contrast . Make sure the highlight layer is above the shadow layer and the shadow layer is above the BG layer . The shadow layer should be set to Multiply with an opacity of 30% . The highlight layer should have full opacity of 100% with a blend mode of soft light . <p> NOTE : This technique tends to make the vignette very dark and saturated . To rid ourselves of this we will manually go in and choose a soft Eraser brush with an opacity of 40 and erase away until satisfied . <p> Last but certainly not least , we will add a High pass filter to our sharpen layer to create the HDR look . We will end by setting this layer to Linear light with an opacity of 46% . <p> These post-processing techniques will vary between the size , colors/brightness and contrast of your works . With that said we conclude this overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stocks I used as I am not the rightful owner who can re-distribute the stocks . However , I have provided the links above so that you can find them yourselves . I hope this tutorial was helpful and I hope to see this technique replicated and tweaked artistically .

If you want to go further , we wrote an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the process of creating the book . <p> This book came from Go Medias long standing history in the indie apparel community . Designer Jeff Finley was one of the original members of the site Emptees.com ( RIP ) and won the inaugural T-Shirt of the Year award as voted on by its members . Along with Jeff , we here at Go Media worked with a lot of bands both big and small on their merch .

Threads Not Dead the indie apparel movement is certainly alive and kicking and this book highlights not just Jeffs experiences , but lots of other talented artists who made it big . <p> The book shares advice on branding and making your business stand out .

The 52 Shades of Greed art directing team , Marc Scheff and Daniel Nyari , are NYC-based illustrators who wanted to create a unique- collaboration between illustrators of all stripes and levels of fame to say something important about the world . They believe that illustrators can be teachers engaged in politics and social welfare . They believe that we can become more than individuals and more than servants to other peoples ' messages . They- gathered an art team from all over the world to contribute to the 52 Shades of Greed project , and could not be more pleased with the result . <p> Go Media recently had the opportunity to converse with Daniel Nyari , one of the creators and Art Directors , about his project and we would like to share it with all of you , our readers . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired you to create it ? <p> Daniel Nyari : <p> First off , I 'm extremely happy and proud to claim that this was really a group effort from start to finish . <p> The Alternative Banking group needed some illustrations for a deck of cards they wanted to hand out on #S17 , their big anniversary day of action . The concept was that of a " stacked deck " where every card had a person , institution , or financial instrument that was doing more harm than good . They initially approached Marc Scheff to create several illustrations for it . <p> When he approached me to come on board , I did not know what to expect apart from possibly assisting with the design of the cards themselves . We began to speak in depth about what a great opportunity this was for us to get involved indirectly in the movement but more so what great potential this had if we approached it from a larger perspective . I threw out the idea of multiple artists working on these concepts . Now , keep in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thought of creating something that was inclusive of informative material but could also function as a collaborative art project between creatives across the world was too enticing . When we put the call out , the response was overwhelming . Suddenly the project became much bigger , and much more inspiring . <p> We decided to fundraise to pay for the production of the cards , and when we started talking about it we found a lot of folks who were interested in a story like this . It is a story with lots of angles . It is about Occupy , certainly , but it is also about collaboration between illustrators of all stripes and levels of fame to say something important about the world . It showcases artists as teachers who are engaged in politics and social welfare , much more than servants to other peoples messages . For us it is also about the incredibly inspiring process of coming together to create a unique and beautiful art object . We found ourselves called to reach out to more media sources and tell them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time was in just 1 week ! I am incredibly proud of our artists , and the Alternative Banking team , for stepping up so fast when it became clear we could do something great . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> Tell us a little about yourself and your co-creator Marc Scheff . <p> Daniel Nyari : <p> Marc is a New York based freelance Illustrator , Art Director , and- Entrepreneur- who loves making big work with lots of people . I am similarly a freelance Illustrator and Designer , originally from Romania , transplanted to Austria and finally New York City . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> How did you chose which artists to collaborate with and how was the curating process ? <p> Daniel Nyari : <p> Between Marc and myself we have a pretty wide network and were able to reach out to many of the people there for this project . We were fortunate to find this group who were willing to work with the crazy deadline , and the quality of the pieces just blew us away . We have no hesitation about immediately hiring any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> More importantly both Marc and I have experience in Web and Print Design , which allowed us to have total control of the project from start to finish and fully manage its branding and all aspects of our marketing . <p> The Alternative Banking Group was also extremely helpful in providing us with concepts and copy . We really had the right balance of professionals and the working hierarchy that allowed us to tackle this within the short time frame . <p> We also worked with a lot of experts and advisers including from RocketHub . One great tip we received was to create an internet event , and get all our networks to push the project and our hash tags all at once . Getting commitments from various news sources and big tweeters really helped get us moving . The internet rewards large , sudden changes in activity . So if we did a slow build , gathering momentum , we would not have received the attention we got . Occupy never trended on Twitter for exactly this reason , the slow buildup is n't rewarded . By creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly , we were able to create a buzz and buzzes tend to turn into roars . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> How has the response been since you showcased the project ? <p> Daniel Nyari : <p> It has been overwhelming to be honest . We reached our campaign goal within 48 hours and we are still going strong on RocketHub . We have offered dozens of enticing rewards that have really helped us raise the profile of the project . We do n't  want to give too much away but we are excited about the momentum we have picked up , largely because of the other doors it opens creatively . Suffice to say , we have so much more in store for everyone . 17221 @qwx877221 <p> Since Shepard Fairey 's iconic poster for Barack Obama , there seems to be much more of an importance for politicians to seek out good design for their branding and political flyers . What do you see for the future of relationships between politicians and designers and what sort of design trends do you see happening in the future for politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important step for branding as a major player in politics . We are all familiar with Obamas Logo . In the digital age , I think more politicians ( or their teams ) are more aware that their messages will travel not only by ears and tongue but also through visuals . Identity is a visual language the most important in immediately- identifying- who you are and what you stand for . In an age where we are over-saturated with imagery , having the right visual- representation- is crucial in making that first immediate impact . Depending on the quality of the image , you 're either sold or not or at least hooked enough to pursue the message . <p> The more integrated with social media campaigns become the more we are exposed to their visual representation so we will be seeing far more specialized branding . I would n't be surprised if campaigns begin to hire illustrators and designers to come up with strategic designs . That certainly has the potential to be a game-changer for us all , wont it ? 17220 @qwx877220

Can you explain your relationship with Alamo and how you got started working for them ? Do you get paid to do these insane posters ? <p> Tyler Stout : I started working with them due to my friend Rob Jones , who is very involved with the Alamo as well as being a big-time poster artist himself . He was putting together a poster series for them and asked me to participate , and it started from there . <p> GoMediaZine : How does a typical project with the Alamo Theatre work ?

Do you do any other film poster work as a result ? <p> Tyler Stout : It has indeed changed my life , or certainly my career . I am able to do posters much more full time , though I still do quite a bit of freelance illustration/design stuff . It has brought me a lot of exposure and people interested in buying stuff from me . Plus I did the theatrical poster for Hell Ride , so that was nice . I 've had a few other film offers , but it 's really hard to do a poster for a film you have n't seen yet .

Let 's seethe movie I 'm doing it forI can tell you it 's a movie I really enjoyed and came out much more recently , so not 1980s like most of my film choices . <p> GoMediaZine : When doing a film poster based on an existing film , do you worry about copyright or getting in some sort of trouble ? How do you handle this ? Especially when you 're selling prints with the films titles and actors likenesses on it . <p> Tyler Stout : I actually mostly do all those through the Alamo , so they take care of all that , they have a longstanding relationship with a lot of people in Hollywood and get the rights / permission to make these promotional things , so that keeps me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's all with the bands permission , otherwise I could get in trouble .

I 've done some indie work and am hustling to get exposure , but have you got any advice for someone trying to break in ? Weve done work for a local theatre , but they do n't  seem as open to custom illustrated posters like the Alamo is . Their reply is that they get official posters from the distributor and they are required to use those . Also , they have no budget for " extra " stuff like illustration , posters , or other creative/art projects . Your thoughts ? <p> Tyler Stout : That is a tricky one . The Alamo has obviously made a name for themselves in that they are a unique movie experience , more Hollywood type movies premier there than anywhere else and people in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other theaters would take a more business minded approach I would guess , youd need to find a more independently owned one , a smaller one I suppose . I have n't tried it so I am not 100% sure . The stuff I do wouldnt work for pretty much any other theater . Possibly film festivals , those would be pretty film based while not necessarily need to be okd by theater owners etc . Also , creating posters that feel film oriented but are n't  actually for a specific film is an option , I obviously take a lot from exploitation posters , so if I was starting out I could do a promotional piece that felt like those posters while not actually being for any film . I think if people create good work they are bound to get noticed . Or they could just luck into it like me . <p> GoMediaZine : Besides these film posters , what other work are you proud of ?

Is there a niche or industry you want to break into or any people you really look up to ? <p> Tyler Stout : I really look up to people that can paint , like Drew Struzan or Reynold Brown , but I have tried painting and I 'm rubbish .

Well , since we 've ( finally ? ) passed the extreme grunge trend , resources for subtle worn effects are what 's awesome . Believe it or not , quality ones are not always easy to find . Anyways . One of the ways to get some subtle grunge effects is to use these film textures . They will bring you three things at once : <p> grain , from the film itself ( 100% analog awesomeness ) <p> dust , because we love anything that will make that clean , digital feel disappear <p> speckles , to make things look less perfect <p> The other cool thing that comes with a film texture is a light effect of some sort .

Play with levels <p> This is the crucial step . What we want is to isolate these white speckles , hairs , and pieces of dust present on the film .

Besides the basic PSD , AI , EPS and INDD , this also includes RAW Camera files for photographers , Premier files for the video guys , and Audition files for recording engineers . But since this is a graphic design blog , were going to focus on managing vector and raster design files . <p> Why use Adobe Bridge ? <p> Well , if you frequently find yourself hunting around for a design resource you KNOW is somewhere under C : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file to find the right flourish Adobe Bridge can come to the rescue and speed up your work flow . Especially if you 're designing on a Windows machine , Adobe Bridge will help you spend less time hunting around for the right file , and more time designing . <p> Note : For Mac users , many of the cooler features of bridge are part of OSX , and where OSX does n't  cut it , here is a free EPS preview plug-in for quick look . <p> Pros : <p> 1 . Thumbnails and previews of every kind of Adobe file ! Vector , PSD , etc 2 . Powerful ways to get to your stuff using metadata and smart search 3 . Tight Integration with CS3 <p> Cons : <p> 1 . Eats RAM for breakfast 2 . Teaching the old dog new tricks to get any real benefit from Adobe Bridge you 're going to have to change your workflow and habits . <p> What it does ( and does n't  do ) <p> Does : <p> Adobe Bridge can show thumbnails and previews of every kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! Additionally , Bridge reads and writes detailed metadata such as Keywords , Ratings , aspect ratio , file properties and more , has intuitive searching that behaves just like iTunes Smart Playlists . You can even save " Collections " which are essentially playlists of design files built from your keywords and other metadata . Adobe Bridge can also stack and group files , which is useful when you have saved five different variations of a design , or have a group of similar photographs . Adobe Bridge can save a lot of time by batch renaming files . Finally , Adobe Bridge can control and sync color settings across all Adobe CS3 Apps . <p> Typically either the Content panel or the preview panel takes up most of the view . <p> *Hidden here in the filter menu is a tiny , and very useful , button . It flattens the view . So , if you have a folder with subfolders for example : Stock Vector Go Media Stock Vector Set1 , Set2 , Set3 , etc then clicking this button will show the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge Stars As another of the many comparisons to iTunes , star ratings in Adobe Bridge work just like you 'd expect they rate your design files just like iTunes rates your tunes . Youve got 6 levels of rating : 0 through 5 stars . You can star files quickly without leaving the keyboard by using ctrl+1-5 while having a file selected . Another cool shortcut is ctrl+ , and ctrl+. to raise and lower the rating of an existing file . <p> Labels Labels are similar to stars , except they do n't  have a rank and are associated with a specific meaning and a color . You can use Adobes default labels or define exactly what you want each one to mean . Labels can be very useful for managing Client folders and designating files as " proof " , " revision " or " final " . Youve got 5 spaces to create custom labels go get organizing ! <p> To customize your labels , hit ctrl+K to get to preferences , and then choose " labels " in the side panel . Once you decide what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeling process by using ctrl+ 6-9 to apply your first 4 new custom labels . Strangely , the last label does not have a shortcut key . <p> You do n't  have to stop at your files when labeling labels work on folders too ! I 've used this feature to speed up browsing . I can mark a folder as " Final " , and not even have to open it up and examine the AI files inside . <p> Keywords Keywords are a really powerful organizational feature inside of Bridge , but it will take a little effort on your part to really get any benefit from them . Keywords are like genres in iTunes since they describe the contents of the selected file with broad categories . They can be anything from " Birthday " to " Grunge " or " Cleveland " . Keywords can be nested in Bridge , making them even more powerful . Check out the screenshot of my keywords panel to see what I mean . <p> here 's a trick on how to quickly get your keyword panel set up : stick your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your level 1 keywords separated by a semicolon . In my case it would look like this : Color ; Design Ingredients ; Events ; Objects ; People ; Places ; Source ; Style . When you 're done typing hit the plus ( + ) sign to the right to add your keywords . Use the same process to add sub keywords , only this time hit the button with the plus sign and the arrow . <p> Keywords are best used in conjunction with the filter panel . At first , the filter panel and the Keyword panel seem so similar that it could be confusing . ( The Keyword panel writes keyword metadata to files . The Filter panel well , filters , by the clicked keyword and shows only matching files ) . <p> Smart Search Again , I really like Bridges search feature because it feels like familiar old iTunes . Ctrl+F brings up the search box . You can define criteria from any piece of metadata , and then qualifies the search with familiar restraints such as " contains " , " does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add as many criteria as you like and define how they interact ; the search can return a query matching all criteria , or any criteria . <p> Collections Collections are Playlists without the head banging . If you have a search that you find yourself doing over and over , just save it as a collection . A collection is a virtual folder that will execute the search when double clicked pretty cool if you 've made good use of star ratings , labels and keywords ! <p> Stacks Stacks are folders on the go or for the sake of maintaining the analogy albums . You can right click any number of similar files and choose Stack &gt; Group as Stack . You can see what stacks look like in the screen shot and notice the number in the upper left hand corner showing how many files are in the stack . <p> Tooling around in Bridge <p> Live Trace multiple files at once right from bridge A useful tool , especially if you need to select from a bunch of different sketches to live trace at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you 're like us its always running in the background anyway . <p> here 's how to do it : Select the raster or PSD file that you want to live trace Point to Tools &gt; Illustrator &gt; Live Trace <p> Place design ingredients into Photoshop , Illustrator , or InDesign right from bridge . Select files that you want to drop into your design and point to File &gt; Place . Its an easy and fast way to put Flourishes and stock images into a file in a few clicks . Bridge will handle any number of files in different formats . <p> Syncing Color Management Across all Adobe Apps Point to Edit &gt; Creative Suite Color Settings . Select a color setting from the list , and click Apply . Now you can be sure that you 've got the same settings in each program . <p> Bonus RoundOrganizing and Rating Color Profiles Here is a little Easter egg to wrap up the post : if you 've spent any time on Adobe Kuler and downloaded a few color profiles , you might just find this tip handy . Adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings , labels , and keywords . Finally a way to find " Granny Smith Apple " when I need it ! <p> Well , thanks for reading and I hope you found a reason to dust off Bridge for a spin . If you have any questions or frustrations about Bridge , let me know in the comments and I 'll try to find the answer ! Of course if you have tips of your own , please , do share ! 17223 @qwx877223

@@98562646 @2762646/ <h> The Characteristics of Excellent Website Design : Experts Weigh In <p> Comments Off on The Characteristics of Excellent Website Design : Experts Weigh In <h> The Characteristics of Excellent Web Design <p> Options for building a website are plentiful , but finding a team to deliver a creative custom solution on time and on budget is not easy . Here at Cleveland based graphic and web design firm , Go Media , we take great pride in our reliability , delivering robust websites that function flawlessly . Were passionate about creating excellent web design and know it when we see it . As our own web developer Dave Romsey simply states , " In my opinion , excellent web design allows the content of the site to be consumed as effortlessly as possible . " <p> But how do we know that were creating it ? And how do we know it when we see it ? Today some of my favorite web- developers are answering the question , " What are the characteristics of excellent web design to you ? " <p> Enjoy the advice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes for a good website ? That 's such a loaded question " the answer will vary wildly depending on who the website has been designed for . Add to that the countless facets inherent to the concept of " good " and we 're headed down one heck of a rabbit hole . But I suppose that leads us to the best all-encompassing answer we can give you . <p> In our opinion , a great website " or any interactive experience for that matter " thoughtfully takes into account the goals and needs of the final user from both a functional and emotional standpoint . <p> At One Design we underline the last part of that statement , emphasizing the importance of emotion in every interactive experience . Our users are humans , and humans have an innate need to connect . The strongest interactive experiences understand and embrace this . Technology that winks back at us " often at the most unexpected moments " defines the difference between tools we own and products we covet . It 's the wink that leads to conversations about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and fierce loyalty at the end of the day . A wink is the difference between a good interactive experience and a great one . <p> Websites have been changing so rapidly . They get reinvented every year . However , the core traits of a perfect website rarely change . In addition to a great design , the following will set apart a website : <p> Great question . For us , excellent web design should put the user first . Most importantly , we design to convert visitors . The site should clearly establish " who they are " and " what the user can do " . - Using white space , color , and other visual elements , we can direct attention to calls to action or other focal points . Of course , good design only gets us so far . Images and copy , optimized for the web , is going to draw the user further down the funnel . It needs to all work together . And , obviously , it is a must to support multiple screen sizes so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious on todays web would have to be responsive design &amp; development . Taking a mobile first or desktop first approach to the design is n't as important as simply taking the time to implement both . I wont get into the nuances of more breakpoints , although taking advantage and considering more will get you closer to a mark of excellence . To at least be a good design , you should have a design for primary and secondary menu systems , the content above the fold , below the fold and the footer of the homepage , all for mobile and desktop . If you want to achieve excellence , you 'll take time to consider responsive breakpoint design for key interior pages and for general defaults as well . We realize this is a lot of work . Fortunately , there are excellent responsive frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap and Zurbs Foundation which provide a ton of the heavy lifting on the development front . They also offer tremendous resources to help guide you along the way . <p> Excellent web design begins with the capability to captivate the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand to serve a purpose . When websites interact with an audience meaningfully , the design- encourages users to take action and- leaves a lasting impression . <p> An excellent website design starts before you dive into Photoshop . Its all about making sure you 're understand the content , the goals of the site , and the way a user should be interacting with the site . Start with sketches or wireframes . Sit down with the client to talk about how the site should work , not just about how it should look . <p> An excellent website design : <p> Provides the best presentation for the content that we have , not the content we wish we had . <p> Makes it clear what route a user should take to access the content that they 're looking for . <p> Remembers that not every user comes in through the home page . <p> Can be easily understood and accessed without the need of a 1900px-wide monitor . <p> Web design , like social media , needs to be a conversation between you and your audience . A successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user-experience and accessibility . Design is different from art . Its about creating a solution . <p> One of the most important things that- makes top notch web design is clean and easy user interface . There have been so many times when a user , including myself , gets confused on how the site works or where the call out buttons are . One way to solve that issue is bright colored buttons and hierarchy font size and colors . Using the right technology and updated current design style is also important . Mainly using fonts that reflect the site . For example , if the site is about selling military clothing , like- Battlefield Collection , - we analyzed who the target audience is and then decided upon using large bold fonts , as their majority of the user will be age of 40 plus . <p> Using icons and heavy visual such as images and banner help creates a visual flavor . It also entices the customer to be engaged . Great use of visuals from our line of work is- Laura Jayne . It highlights the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to use with a little BAM of visuals and eye candy will get you a top notch web design . <p> Responsive website is the new mantra ; it is important that the usage of elements like Bootstrap and fonts are done effectively . As websites are used across multiple channels today , ensure sure that the fonts comply to the Google fonts and the framework aligns with HTML5 <p> In effect , the design starts with the homepage but it is essential that you maintain the language and feel across all the pages .

If you 're interested in challenging yourself in the photography arena , I recommend learning to love your images SOOC ( straight out of camera ) . Others may disagree on this , especially anyone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely one photographers opinion . Feel free to decide what is best for you , but for the purposes of this post I will be sharing tips to create the best image SOOC . Cool ? <h> 1st tip Read your manual <p> Seems obvious , does n't  it ? Your camera comes with a manual , so perhaps it contains some helpful information ? Yet , for some reason it took me quite a while to actually crack that sucker open . Why ? It might have something to do with my tendency to avoid directions of any kind . If something looks simple enough I will try to put it together on my own or I will try to figure it out without consulting the directions ( and no , I am not a dude ) . <p> Here are some important basics that you can learn in your manual ( I will talk about these items in additional posts ) : <p> Aperture , f-stop settings <p> Shutter speed <p> ISO <p> White balance <p> Focal points <p> Each of these items can really help you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images . <p> In my case , much of what I had learned when shooting with film transferred over to digital . However , my figure it out ability reached its limit and I could n't learn anymore just by playing with my DSLR . I decided it was time to turn to my manual to discover the best way to white balance my images ( this is one area that is very different in digital v. film ) . Once I spent the time learning how my specific camera handles white balancing , I was once again excited to see what she ( my Canon 50D ) could do . In my experience , this was one important step in the process of being happy with my SOOC images . When you get to that point with your images , any post processing is minimal . The images I included here were shot in full sunlight with the ISO set at 200 and the f-stop set at 18 . The white balance and exposure were spot on , so the only post processing I performed was slight hue/saturation and curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in the next post , so bring on the questions ! <p> What have you done to improve your knowledge of your camera ? Is your manual your best friend ? Or are you still trying to figure out how to get out of auto mode ? Let 's chat ! 
@@98562661 @2762661/ <h> Erika Simmons : Ghost In The Machine <p> Erika Simmons Ghost in the Machine series is an imaginative approach to image creation/illustration . The concept of incorporating elements of the subject matter as the medium is a great example of thinking outside the box . The use of the cassette tape forces the viewer to envision the process , which thus incorporates an element of the passage of time " intrinsic to the experience of music " into the artwork . The idea of introducing the element of time into musician-themed artwork has echoes of Denny Dents " performance portraits " . <h> Tell us a little about yourself <p> I 'm a 25 year-old woman who lives in Georgia . I am a self-taught artist . I try to focus on using found materials , or donated materials . A lot of my supplies come from places like Goodwill . <p> I try to make things that showcase some idea , through simply cutting up and re-arranging the pieces of everyday items , like cassettes , old books , or even credit cards .

Most creative people I know ( myself included ) felt like they get in the zone after midnight . All is still and quiet and you can finally focus on your work . And if you 're not working , you 're doing- something- until the wee hours of the morning . If you 're like most night owls , you dread getting up in the morning . <p> That was certainly me . My wife too . Over time our bed time kept getting pushed back later and later because there was always " something to do " that we just had to do . We werent tired and going to bed felt like giving up on the day . <h> A Night Owl No More <p> I have been getting up at least one hour earlier for over a month now . In fact , the past two weeks I 've been getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night owl in me would ask , " Why- the fuck- would you ever get up before you- have- to ? " <p> This getting up early habit has led to a month-long streak of wonderful habits including exercise , walking , meditation , mindfulness , journaling , and reading to name a few . Each of those has tremendous benefits on their own . <p> Those are all things I never " had time for " no matter how many extra hours I stayed up . Typically , staying up extra hours just meant more time on the computer . Am I right ? <h> If I Could Only Get Up Early <p> I did n't  have the ambition to do all those things at first . All I started with was a desire to get up early- just because . If I can regularly do that , then I 'll fill it with things to do Im sure . So I started- small- with just the cue ( or trigger ) , routine , and reward system to get my ass out of bed . Something I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Alarm goes off.Routine : - Get out of bed , crawl to couch.Reward : - Cup of coffee while I watched TV on my laptop . <p> I made sure to add this to- my Lift habits- so I could keep track . This worked great until the very next day when I forgot to set my alarm and woke up late . Dammit . I woke up early the following morning to get back on track . Then it was the weekend ; which of course I slept in and stopped caring about my goal . Then I read- The Miracle Morning- and that changed everything . <p> The book stressed how its totally ok to be as simple and small as you need to be . The author even described how you can do the Miracle Morning routine in just six minutes ! Who does n't  have time for that ? <p> The book refreshed my inspiration on meditation and personal development . I started following Hals suggested routine of waking up , chugging a glass of water , sitting in silence for five minutes , doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out and eventually started customizing it to suit my needs . <h> My Morning Routine <p> I use the- AM Routine app- to help me stay on track . You set your desired end time ( like when you have to leave for work ) and you add habits with time estimates to your routine . It will calculate exactly when the built-in alarm should go off to give you enough time to do your routine . It even has a handy dashboard to show you what task you should be on , how much time is left , and what 's coming up next . This is brilliant for those foggy mornings . You do n't  have to think at all ! <p> 6:30 AM : alarm goes off. - My phone is across the room and I have to get up to turn it off . This prevents me from snoozing . <p> So that 's my routine . Sometimes for breakfast I 'll make a chocolate- super-food smoothie that I got from The Miracle Morning book , so I sip it throughout my routine . I 'm getting a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up . I 'm adding in 10 minutes of writing in my blog and slowly eliminating my TV watching time .

Just do as little as possible so you can check it off and feel good about it . Small wins are the only way you 'll feel motivated to keep going . <p> Do something pleasurable. - For me that was watching a new episode of a tv series . It could be video games . Think of how you felt on Christmas morning as a kid , you could n't wait to jump out of bed .

You need to build up a routine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . For me , this means turning off my alarm clock , unplugging my iPhone charger and stumbling over to my dresser where I have my morning routine outfit already ready in my top drawer . Plan out your entire morning routine in advance so you do n't  have to make any decisions in the morning . Even a zombie can do it ! <p> Set things out the night before. - I wear the same shorts and shirt every day . Deciding what to wear is hard when you 're groggy . Even my breakfast smoothie is created the night before . The glass for my morning water is always in the same place . It requires no thinking to get going . This is key ! <p> Focus on personal development . Do not work ! - Resist the temptation to check email or social media . Do not start working on a project right away without first spending time working on your own personal development . You have the rest of the day to worry about checking stuff off your to-do list .

Not so much a tutorial on how to create the artwork , but rather how to tackle all of the logistical details . This installment features Go Medias Adam Wagner . <h> The Project : <p> The indie coffee shop liked your WordPress design so much that they have asked you to design their corporate identity . They do n't  have a huge budget , but are interested in experimenting with different printing techniques and on different papers . They 're also going to use this logo on their site . <h> The Solution : <p> When designing an identity for a business , I usually do not start on any of the print or web based material until the system is established . However , this situation is somewhat unique in that I would have already designed collateral material , the WordPress design , before I created the identity system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first step would be to have a consultation with the client about their business . I would find out as much as I could about how the business functions and what their business does , who their customers are , who are their competitors , what their future plans for the business were , and why their business matters . In general I would just collect as much information as possible about the company . In this instance , a lot of this information would probably have already been collected in preparation for the WordPress site design . <p> Concepts <p> Next , I would brainstorm and try to come up with some interesting concepts for the identity . These could be informed by the way the company operates , what their name is , or their specific industry as well as numerous other aspects of their business . I would narrow the ideas down until I had one to three directions to explore further . <p> Sketches <p> The next step would be to start doing some rough sketches of the various logo concepts . I typically like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each box I sketch a unique mark based on the concept . The most important thing when sketching logos is to never erase . Even if you make a huge mistake , just move to the next box or section of page and keep sketching . This process helps you get as many ideas out on the page and let 's you weed through the bad ones and refine the good ones until you have a few really solid directions . Sometimes I find something interesting in forty sketches and sometimes it takes many more to hit on something interesting . <p> Refine your sketches digitally <p> When I have my sketches narrowed down , I then scan the pages into Illustrator and begin roughing out the shapes . At this point I may have a more developed idea in my head as to how the mark is going to come together , or it may come together naturally as I am working on it . I also start thinking about pairing faces for the mark if I have n't drawn a custom treatment for the logo . <p> Present logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point that I am satisfied with , I would propose the concept to the client . We would begin the revision process , if necessary , and refine the mark until we are both satisfied with the outcome . In this case the end result would probably be a one color logo , because the client has a tight budget and needs something that will work both on the web and in print . <p> Expand the identity <p> With the logo being finished , I would then move on to the creation of all the collateral material . In this case it would probably involve menus , table top cards , cup sleeves , cups , parchment paper , take away bags , and environmental graphics . The most important thing to remember when designing these items is that they are all part of the system and should relate to the feel and tone of the branding and the logo . Since a lot of waste is involved in the daily functioning of a coffee shop , from an environmental standpoint , I would seek out sustainable materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the entire design and review process with the client until all the materials were completed and approved . <p> Double check everything <p> Before I sent anything to print , I would review the website and make sure that it is totally integrated with the system I created for the rest of the store 's branding and graphics . If there were any inconsistencies , I would correct them before there was a costly printing mistake . After everything looked great , I would pass the final proofs by the client for approval . If everything went well , I would send it all to print . Do n't forget to ask the printer for proofs , and check them carefully to make sure there are no mistakes or things that need to be changed . When the project is done being printed , make sure to ask for samples to add to your portfolio . <p> Send files <p> After all the printing was complete and the project was fully paid off , I would send the client all the final files for everything in the identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note as well to let them know that you appreciate the opportunity to work on their project . 17223 @qwx877223

Today , I 'd love to start a " new " series of posts about inspiration to talk about one of the great collaborative design efforts currently going on in the design community ( no , its not the Weapons of Mass Creation Fest ) . Today , I 'm going to talk about The state mottos project . <h> What the heck is The state mottos project ? <p> About 50 and 50 <p> 50 and 50 is a collective , curated project where fifty designers are invited to represent their state by illustrating its motto . <p> This project was initiated by Dan Cassaro , aka Young Jerks .

Could you give us some background info about the project , how it came to life and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that the idea for this project was born out of a trip taken almost 2 years ago . My girlfriend and I took a road trip to California on a whim 2 summers ago . We did n't  know each other and essentially our first date was a 2 week trip in an RV that week rented , driving around Northern California and panning for gold . We have been taking trips across the country to various places since , trying to see as much of the country as we can . We recently purchased a camper of our own ( seen below ) and have plans to work out of the back of it while traveling this summer . <p> I began noticing the mottos on signs when we crossed the borders to different states and was very taken with them . The original plan was to do type treatments for all of them myself , but I eventually scrapped the idea , thinking it would be better to have it be a collaboration with all the people from the different states . It helped to vary the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> GMZ : Could you give more info about the various directions and/or constraints you gave to the designers that worked on the project ? <p> Dan Cassaro : The direction was really simple . I gave everyone the sizes and the 2 colors and told them to go for it . I did n't  want to have to do too much art directing so the easiest way to do that was to just pick people whose work I knew i already loved . Its really an awesome team of some of the best young ( ish ? ) designers working right now . The colors were chosen to unify the project , and for obvious reasons , had to be red , white , and blue . I wanted to make them subtle though , did n't  want to hit people over the head with a bald eagle or whatever . <h> Massachusetts <h> North Carolina <h> Nevada <h> New York <h> Tennessee <h> Do n't  leave now , there 's more ! <p> Do n't  forget , there are many more to be seen on the 50 and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the ones Dan provided material for , part personal ( and quick ) selection .

@@98562680 @2762680/ <h> Just Got Some Negative Feedback ? here 's How to Turn It Into a Positive . <p> If there is one thing we can fortunately- joke about among our fellow- designers , its the negative feedback we receive from our clients . <p> After all , these references are all over the web and who ca n't relate to these ? ( All images by- http : //sharpsuits.net/ ) <p> Sometimes , behind the laughter , the feedback does- sting . How can we turn this into a positive ? Here are some suggestions from our Project Manager , Suzanne Naftanel , - who has absorbed some negative feedback for our team a time or two <p> Schedule a face-to-face meeting . If at all possible , schedule a face-to-face feedback meeting versus having your client communicate their feedback via email. - This not only breeds increased and more clear communication , but develops a more trusting designer/client relationship overall . This is a perfect opportunity to get on the same page with your client again and show them how much you are invested in getting it right , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he/she was hoping for that they are missing and- the honest details about what they were opposed to about this round . Make sure your whole team is scheduled for this meeting and ready to listen to whatever message your client has to deliver . <p> Reflect , Validate . When a client provides negative feedback on a design project , make sure you and the team are really tuned into the conversation . If you are face to face ( or on a conference call ) , take this opportunity to rephrase back to them what you 've heard and give them the opportunity to confirm or correct the statements . Simultaneously validate their feelings and opinion . Ensure you are both on the same page so that the work you are doing in the future is reflective of this conversation . You are working to make their design dreams come true , so do your due diligence to listen , really hear them and show them that you can take action on their desires . That being said , you are the design professional , - so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is stellar . <p> Check your ego at the door . Your client wants their design project to be perfect . Their focus is n't you , but instead the project and getting it to where it needs to be . So , let 's focus on that . Do n't  hung up on the negative feedback or take this personally , because its not about you , who you are or what you 're worth . We all know you 're awesome . <p> Explain the process , improve yours . When you 're working through the design process , gently- remind the client that the creative process has just begun , or is still happening . In fact , there may be more rounds to come . Encourage them to consider that there 's still room for exploring further designs . Excite them about the possibilities , then knock them out with a killer next round . <p> Internally , use this opportunity to improve your process . Was their something you missed during the kick-off a series of questions you should have asked the client that would have made you better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Meet with your team and review . You can only benefit as a result . <p> Check-in and show em love . If your client is feeling as if your last round was less than theyd dreamed of , - make a point to follow up with the client once the next round of proofs are presented by the designer/team to ensure they 're on the right track and feeling taken care of . <p> Acknowledge which feedback is / which clients are worth keeping . Having said all of this , some feedback is just plain mean and crappy . Over the past 15 years , we have only come across only a few truly rude clients . Unfortunately they 're out there and fortunately were a lot better at sniffing them out now . Clients- who dole out hurtful , unactionable feedback and can not have a decent- conversation are n't  worthy of your time . <p> Anyone else who gives feedback that makes you grow should be seen as a- teacher .

@@98562682 @2762682/ <p> At Go Media , our Cleveland typography design experts know that typeface selection and arrangement is as defining to an overall brand as use of images , color or abstract graphics . As our design team can explain , the difference between good- typography and so-so typography is that one looks polished and professional , - while the other tends to look slapped together in Microsoft Word . <p> Think of it this way : Most information these days is delivered via written word , and attention spans are shrinking . In- order to be truly compelling , the- way- your copy- looks matters just as much as what it says. - When a business is careful and consistent with their typeface design , it can be extremely effective in building brand loyalty . <p> Typography design is about more than simply choosing a font . It 's about the arrangement of all typographical elements in the design . For example : <p> Visual hierarchy <p> Contrast <p> Grid <p> White space <p> Font choice <p> Font Size <p> Kerning <p> Sometimes people wonder why we even need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existence . What 's wrong with just going with a- simple- Times or Helvetica font with standard spacing ? The answer is- we don't- necessarily need new fonts , the same way we probably do n't need new designs for furniture or clothing . But people seek different styles for a myriad of reasons - to set themselves apart , to go along with a trend or to find something that is a better fit . <p> In terms of branding , you recognize the importance of carefully choosing the best colors , the right tone and the precise words . Typography is another important element of the design process . <p> And just like the design of furniture or clothing , typography is a matter of blending art with science . It needs to be functional as much as it needs to be attractive . Consideration of your- audience and your purpose is paramount . For example , some typeface designs - just like styles on the runway - are limited to a few scenarios when you want to make an evocative , - splashy statement . But- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle . <p> Quality typography design- not only makes the words more visually appealing , it can make them easier to read . Both of these elements help to ensure your message is delivered - and that 's ultimately what you want . <p> We have heard the argument that , " If I do n't recognize the difference between fonts , my customers/clients wo n't either . " But that actually is n't true . Let 's say , for example , you choose to go with a basic Microsoft Word default typography setting . That in itself is a choice in typography , and it communicates the message that , " This is a typical office document . " Maybe that 's exactly your goal . But chances are when you are working with a graphic designer on logo design , menu design , packaging design , web design or other elements , you want something more . <p> And that does n't necessarily mean it has to be wild or very obvious . Think of it like going to a movie . The average person- taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every movement of the camera , every edit , every angle or even the music playing low in the background . A good director puts you in that moment so that you simply experience it without being acutely aware of those details . It 's the same way with good typography design : The average person will have a certain reaction to it , without fully considering how every aspect of the typography design plays into it . <p> A growing body of typography research suggests that when it is good , typography actually makes people frown- less ! - Researchers from Microsoft and MIT concluded in The Aesthetics of Reading that good typography - symmetrical , clear and well-spaced - actually put people in better mood after reading it . <p> In short , here 's why you need typography design : <p> It 's an inevitable and essential part of your design - even if you do n't put much effort into it . You might as well make sure it 's working for you . <p> It expresses your personality and helps to clarify your identity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts your professionalism on display . <p> It 's a critical part of communication . <p> Our Cleveland graphic design team will take great care in crafting custom typography designs with your brand , message and specific audience in mind .

@@98562684 @2762684/ <h> Interview with Illustrator Godmachine <p> GoMediazine : Let 's start with the usual questions : tell us about yourself , what Godmachine is all about and where you 're from . <p> Godmachine : I am from Wales in the UK and have been designing T-shirts for about 2 years now . I studied Graphic Communication as a mature student and was terrible at it ; I just cant see the subtleties needed for clever design . Luckily for me the Lowbrow world has reared its beautiful head . <p> GoMediazine : When did you get started ? Ive read that you 're self educated , so did you always draw or just pick it up one day and it stuck ? Did you always know drawing was how you 'd earn a living or did a light bulb go on one day ? <p> Godmachine : I have always drawn- I think I was even better at 8 years old than I am now , if I remember rightly . I pursued drawing as an interest up until the age of work . I was never brought up to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dad was a fitter , brother is an electrician , granddad was a minor . I was always taught that I needed a trade . I was always taking courses like media studies etc between and during jobs , but never really had a clear idea of what I wanted to do . I never stopped doodling though and was always making images and it was n't until my wife bought me a canvas and told me to paint that I actually thought about it as a way to make a living . As time went on more and more paintings were made and sold and I finally got a PC just as the Merch boom started and it all fell into place . <p> GoMediazine:Theres a lot- of debate about the value ( and incredibly high cost ) of art education . Coming from an illustration program myself , I feel like the guidance was at times valuable but anyone who spends 4 years drawing all day every day is going to get better , and you could just as well do this out of your house and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an artist ? <p> Godmachine : I am certainly not going to dissuade anyone that wants to study to not take that opportunity . I do n't  want to sound like an ass but I do think you are right ; if you take every opportunity to draw , read books on drawing , study peoples techniques , ask questions , try new things.why would you need to go to University ? I feel though a Uni course would make you a more rounded artist in that it would force you to look at things you may have no interest in . I feel there are weaknesses , too many to mention , that I will not get round to working on for a long time as I am always busy with work now . I wish I could take time off to de-learn and start again sometimes , do some real life studies , get messy with paints again . You would n't really get that opportunity if you were working- but in Uni you could . With the advent and ease of the internet , there really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say more than anything else you should have a burning desire to draw/create/study , with that they could put you on an island with a crayon and you would develop your skills . So its a bit of both really . <p> GoMediazine:I read in another interview with you that you do n't  keep a sketchbook because you 're always near a computer . Do you sketch on the computer or is it all finished work ? Does this allow you to get down more ideas or is it an obstacle ? Care to share any samples with us ? <p> Godmachine : I just bought two sketch books today hahah . I realised last week that my work station is full of scraps of paper with non-sensicle doodles all over them . I am using sketch books not for sketches , but for ideas , I see things , think of something , grab a piece of paper and doodle on it and then pin it to my work board . Where was I getting these pieces of paper ? I was ripping them out of an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of me- I cant have them hidden in a book- they are no good to me there . Sketching on computer is good for me but not great- I cant work on that sketch on the toilet ( let 's face it all good ideas are created there , see flux capacitor ) or on the train . I will send you a sketch but you wo n't believe it . Recently I was talking to a few artists , including Dan Mumford about concept sketches and when we compared them we saw that we were all quite horrific at sketching . I think its because what we see is not what you see on that paper , artists have an image in the mind and use the doodle as a quick reference and guide . I think I get more ideas using my scraps of paper , and soon , my sexy new sketch books ( -3.00 off ebay ) . <p> GoMediazine:Do you have any recurring themes in your doodles , you know , eyeballs , zombies , etc ? <p> Godmachine : Yes . all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anger , skulls , gore , blood , eyeballs , I love them all . <p> GoMediazine:Do you keep any type of reference library ? <p> Godmachine : I have an extensive library of books for reference and inspiration , I love that a lot of it wont be found on the web . I used to work at a second hand book shop during Uni and amassed a great collection . Ca n't stop buying books . I also have a folder of hands on the desktop from photos I took . <p> GoMediazine:What is your typical process from start to finish ? How many revisions does it typically take for you to get to a place where you 're happy ? <p> Godmachine : I start by collecting ideas from various places , getting inspired- usually takes a day or two , then the scrap of paper doodle . Then I sketch it into photoshop and layer after layer I define what I am doing and where it is going . From actual initial PS sketch to finished piece it usually takes me about 10 hours over 2 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother in law , adam , bought me a coffee machine recently and That gets fired up first , I call it The First Four Black Sabbath Albums , not the names of the albums , but exactly that the first four .. . As for revisions I tend not to do any unless the client really want me too and then we refer to the contract to see how many we are allowing . We usually hit it first time , I can only really think of 2 times that it was completely the wrong image , and that was all totally my fault as I wanted to get these ideas out and there really was no explaining them , just had to do themBut Usually its just a case of a few tweeks . I wish I had enough time to revise each piece over and over again , I am always able to pick holes and see new things . <p> GoMediazine:How have your tools changed from when you started until now ? Has moving to digital changed the way you work or your style ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I loved that dirty strained feel it gave lines , like it was made by a weak , i 'll , disturbed person . Then it was marker pen and acrylics . Then back to pen , this time ; fine-line . Then finally a tablet . It totally affects your work and your style . I see loads of people buying tablets now and seeing they all look the same . I asked Ray Frenden , the artist that showed me how to use a tablet the same question and he replied that sadly your work and style will someway always be influenced by your tools . It is bad in that a lot of people look the same now . It has n't  affected my style as I remember it , but it has helped me achieve the style I was always aiming for . And recently I am learning to make it look more like pen and getting more courage to get back to my old ways . <p> GoMediazine:Whats the biggest hurdle for you in working digital ? <p> Godmachine : It will never be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Frenden who is a constant source of knowledge and inspiration for me recently blogged that his MAC pro , Citiq tablet , umpteen programs are all easily trumped by an $8 brush on a piece of paper . I would say the biggest hurdle I have is it not being real untill they are flogging it on a t-shirt/poster/deck . Or that my computer strains with file size or process power . Other than that I am more than happy with it , so is the Mrs as it means less paint being flicked about the house . Some people think the splats thing is like a trend for me or something , but I been flicking paint about for over 12 years now , my painting reflect that . <p> GoMediazine:I wanted to avoid asking you the obligatory influences question , but do I detect some Ed Roth showing through in addition to the skate art flavor to your style ? <p> Godmachine : I only found out who Ed Big Daddy Roth was a year ago , so I cant say he has been a direct influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and definitely through the skate culture . All the usual suspects are my influence and I will not give the usual obligatory reply . I will say though that I am avoiding doing that style these days and have been for a while . My aims , as I grow in skills and confidence is to leave that behind completely and concentrate on a lot more serious or darker style of art work- more Marvel than Phillips . I do n't  post much of it though as it seems to influence too many people too quickly , I will do when this comes out though and you will see for yourselves . <p> GoMediazine:Do you have ideas floating about that you use when a client comes around , or is it client first and then idea ? <p> Godmachine : I have loads of ideas floating about in my head . But usually the client has some ideas as to what they want . The problem with doing my own thing for clients is that its not always in the same vein of my last piece- I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly a client will want what you have already done- why wouldnt they though . I had a phone conversation with a client a while back about some of my ideas I wanted to produce for him and he knocked them all down giving some reasons.Then months later I saw all my ideas had been produced . I do n't  know if this was intentional and was probably a subconscious thingbut then againSo sometimes it works for us when a client gives me full reign and other times it is not a good ideawe find a way though . very rarely has someone requested a job that I have thought of- no one is that twisted . <p> GoMediazine:When you work are you a no distractions kind of guy , or are you watching your favorite movie for the 12,000th time ? <p> Godmachine : I am totally distracted . When I first started I could work 8 hours solid and was producing one design a day easy , but it was killing me . Now I am all about distractions , social networking makes it easy for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TED which is great and i really enjoy learning new things about philosophy and science . I also like listening to the radio . Twitter too ! I love twitter . I can be sketching away and be thinking of something then lean over and spew some verbal detritus into the world , wipe my brain clean and carry on sketching . If you like anti-religious stuff , cats or work related rants feel free to come follow me on twitter @godmachineuk . <p> GoMediazine:Are there other areas of art you want to branch out to , or things you do today that youd like to evolve ? <p> Godmachine : I want to get back into painting one day , but mostly I would like to be in a position to be the one that applies my design to things . I would like to be the one who decides where the print goes , how big it goes and what it goes on . Maybe open my own clothing label one day , but then I know how much work is involved that is not designing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bad gig ? Sometimes people just want you to be a physical extension of Photoshop . Has that changed how you select clients ? / <p> Godmachine : I am writting a load of rules for myself , among them is such things like do not compare yourself to others and so on , but one of them is select only jobs that inspire you- even if you are without work . I think I am getting to the stage now where I am fearful of churning out work that is n't my best . My aims have always been ( and I think I got the idea from a designer called Collison Theory ) that each piece you design should be better than the last and that you are only as good as your last piece . Having that attitude early on was what I suspect got me here today . I have had to walk away from a bad gig though , some clients give bad art direction , and I have learnt that they do n't  always want new and amazing they just want something and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am glad to say there have only been 2- have always ended up with below par work by some other artist- that at least makes me feel better about sticking to my guns . Next year will see me only taking on jobs that inspire me and test me- and in between I will practice and create work that I like to see . <p> GoMediazine:Do you have any recent favorite projects or anything coming up you 're excited about ? <p> Godmachine : I have been aiming to work with more doom metal bands lately and more skateboard companies . I do enjoy working with smaller companies as they seem to want to take more risks with work which is fair enough as their risks are smaller , but oddly its the bigger companies that come back months later asking for the same stuff they turned down . The money is n't as great- but at least I am happy with what I am producing , and I know that if you do it for the money you wo n't get as far as you want . <p> GoMediazine:What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the rotation ? <p> Godmachine : Big Business ! just cant get enough , I had a dream last night and woke up singing it . I have Palehorse to thank for turning me on to them . Also film soundtracks/scores ; Moon , The Dark Knight , Lost Highway , Solaris , Twin Peaks . <p> GoMediazine:Who are some of your favorite illustrators working today ? <p> Godmachine : I hate answering these things as I am lucky enough to call some of the greatest artists I know friends- albeit efriends , they are still good genuine people and have helped me unconditionally . The reason I hate these things is because with my sieve like mind I will always leave someone out . And to say one is to leave the other out . <p> GoMediazine:So tell me about this Weedeater shirt .

This tee among the others in the similar vein were the ones I produced when I nearly quit . I was sick of doing Jim phillipsy stuff for clients and just wanted to make my own stuff . It was at this point when I discovered Brian Morris and he blew me away with his unapologetic work- it was like seeing the artistic equivelent of a fuck you . It may well be that , this was n't his intention , is not how he sees his work and is not what other people see .

He is an expert in Drupal , which I am totally not familar with . He intrigued me when he told me that the majority of the bands on Sonys record label are powered by Drupal . Drupal is basically an open source CMS , and I was interested in learning more about it . So that 's why he s writing this tutorial for us . You can learn along with me ! <h> Set Up Our Document <p> Open up a new Illustrator document at 1160px width by 950px height . For Units choose Pixels . Under the Advanced dropdown choose Color Mode : RGB , Raster Effects : Sceen ( 72pi ) , and Preview Mode : Pixel . Now let 's get our workspace setup for working on the web . Turn on your grid by going to View &gt; Show Grid or ( Command/Ctrl + Quote Mark ) . Now set up the size of your grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Dialogue Box set up the Gridline Every : 1px and Subdivisions : 1 . This will create a 1px grid . Now go to View &gt; Snap to Grid ( Command/Ctrl + Shift + Quote Mark ) . This means when you draw your elements they will snap to exact pixel measurements on the grid . <h> Design Our Background <p> Now let 's start creating our background . Draw a box the same size as our document 1160px width by 950px high and fill it with a dark brown gradient . Next create another box starting at the upper left hand corner of the document and make it stretch the entire width of the document 1160px and down about 110px in height . Now fill it with your choice of color . I chose a bright lime green gradient . Now create our highlight where the two documents meet . Draw two 1160px wide by 1px tall boxes . The top one make a dark brown and the bottom one make a light brown . <p> The image below shows what your highlight should look like at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall page composition should look like as we are getting started . <h> Set Up Our Basic Website Layout <p> Draw some Vertical Guides to set up our main content area . Turn on your Rulers ( Command/Ctrl + R ) and pull your guides from the left . Place a Guide at 100px and a guide at 1060px . This gives us a layout space of 960px . Now draw our Header Box in between these guides with a Rounded Rectangle 960px wide and 160px high . Fill it with a dark brown gradient of your choice . Place it 40px from the top of the document . Now draw our Primary Navigation Box with the rounded rectangle tool . Fill it with the same dark brown gradient . Make it 960px wide by 30px high and about 15px below the header . <p> No let 's drop a couple more guides in for our content area . Drop a verticle guide at 740px and another at 760px Next well draw our Main Content area on the left . Draw a rounded rectangle in between the guides with a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . That leave 20px of space . Now let 's create our Sidebar Content . Draw another rounded rectangle in between the right guides . Make it 300px wide by 610px high . I made this box the same gradient green as the top background of our doc . <p> Here is a trick for using gradients within flexible content areas . Try to figure out what the smallest possible amount of content there will be on the site for either column . Then make sure your gradient breaks to a solid color before that point . This will avoid some ugly color change when used in really small content . This is because we are going to be making flexible boxes for our content and we will cut our boxes up and put them back together . Basically we will be cutting off the tops and bottoms of our boxes and then putting them back together . The middle area will be a solid color . You can see here that I 'm guessing that locating the left dark brown color in the gradient at a Location of 90% will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will need to be tested when we get to the coding stage . <p> That 's it for our basic setup . You can see a shot of the results below . We have some space at the bottom to put our footer information . <h> Adding Some Arsenal Branding for the " GoBand " Header <p> From the Texture Pack Sample well be starting with the file named oddshot15.jpg . Go ahead and place the photo into our doc . Now select the Header with our Direct Select Tool ( V ) . With the Header selected place a guide in the center . Then select our photo and move it over to the right over our header . Make sure the left edge lines up with the center guide . Hold down the Shift Key and drag the size of the photo down until the right side is a little larger than the right guide . Now keep the photo selected and go to Object &gt; Transform &gt; Reflect . Select Axis &gt; Vertical and hit Copy . Now line up the flipped photo copy on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it matches the positioning of the right copy . Your results so far should look something like below . <p> Now select both halves of the photo and cut it by going to Edit &gt; Cut or ( Command/Ctrl + X ) . Select the Header and paste the photos in place behind the header by going to Edit &gt; Paste in Back or ( Command/Ctrl + B ) . Now Select the Header again and copy it Edit &gt; Copy or ( Command/Ctrl + C ) as we will need this in our clipboard for just a moment . Keep the header selected , hold down the shift key and select each of the photos as well . Go to Object &gt; Clipping Mask &gt; Make or ( Command/Ctrl + 7 ) . We still have our Header shape in our clipboard so let 's go to Edit &gt; Paste in Front or ( Command/Ctrl + F ) . Keep this header shape selected and in the Transparency Palette set the drop down to Multiply and change the brown at the top of the gradient to a lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now from the Go Media Vector Pack Sample open up vectorsample.eps in Illustrator . Select the right half of the wings shown in the file below . <p> Place it in the upper left hand corner of your Header . Flip a copy of it and place it in the upper right hand corner of the Header . With both of the wings selected grab the Eyedropper Tool ( I ) and take a sample from the Header shape we just manipulated . This will apply the Gradient of that shape to the wings and it will apply the Multiply as well . Now select the Header shape again . Copy and Paste In Front . Keep it selected hold down Shift and select each of the wings . Create a Clipping Mask . This will only show the portion of the wings that is within the header and hide the excess . You still have the Header shape in your clipboard so Paste in Front again just to make the header a little darker . Below are our results so far . <p> Now we are going to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placing our main branding image of the GoBand . The elements below from the vectorsample.eps file and the wings we already used are all the elements we will need for this tutorial . Go ahead and paste a copy of them to the side of your working space . <p> Now we are going to use the Architecture above to add more interest to the center area of the header . I placed one large copy in the center and two smaller copies on each side and gave them a solid dark brown color . The large copy escapes a little from our header space to add more depth . See the results below . <p> Next use a font of your choice and create the band name GoBand . I used TImes New Roman Bold . I set the font at 38px . Next create our center angle by placing the wings behind the right most Sexy figure ( Copy and Paste a Copy outside the work space for later ) . Do the same thing for the other Sexy figure ( though we do n't  need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure small and flip it placing it evenly above the text . Work with it until you get something similar to the image below . Then select all the Sexy Figures , Text , and Wings then in the Pathfinder Palette click Add to Shape Area , see image below .. This combines the figures into to one live shape . It can be undone though if you need to later on . I like that flexibility . Then give it a matching green gradient . I set the gradient at a 90 degree angle . <p> Now to finish off our header add some texture . Grab a copy of the Destroy grunge texture and color it the same brown as the Architecture we used earlier . I rotated , changed the size , moved around multiple copies , and even lowered the transparency of some of the Destroy textures until I got a look that felt right . You should go through a similar process . Just manipulate multiple copies of the Destroy grunge texture until it has a worn look your happy with . See our headers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole header and and a to scale shot of the center . Of course your results may differ some based on your experimentations . <h> Designing the Primary Navigation Area <p> First we are going to add some texture to the Primary Navigation Bar background . Grab the Destroy texture and manipulate the height so it is about 28px high . I left the color black , but gave it a transparency of 60 percent . Then make multiple copies of it and place it across the navigation bar . Below is a close up of some of the texture after being applied . <p> Below you will see the pieces that need to be created next . This is zoomed in almost 400 percent . First is our home button , which I 'll show you how to make quickly in just a moment . The bars in the middle are actually 1px wide each . This is how you achieve the effect of a highlight and a shadow between each button . There is first a 1px wide gradient with a light gray at the bottom . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dark brown shadow . The rest of the button backgrounds are a simple box with a dark brown to a light brown gradient . <p> Take a copy of the Primary Navigation Background and drag it off to the side of your working document . To make the Active Background for the Home button I used the Knife Tool , pictured below in the floating tools palette . Its an underused tool . Probably because its finicky . It might take a couple passes to get a straight line . Unfortunately , holding down the shift button does n't  keep it in a straight line . You have to make sure the you have the object your about to cut selected for it to work . When you have the Knife Tool selected you can hold down ( Command/Ctrl ) to get the Active Select Tool . After cutting out your Active Home Button give it a bright green to dark brown gradient . I used a -60 angle on the gradient to put the highlight in the upper left hand corner . <p> Now take these pieces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text I used a slightly brighter green for the active button . I also copied the entire Primary Navigation Bar background and pasted it in front . Gave it a fill of none and a 1px wide black stroke . Now we have our Primary Navigation Bar design complete . Let 's move on to the body . <h> Designing Our Main Content Area and Sidebar <p> Well start by placing some guides . In our Main Content area and in our Sidebar Content area we will have 20px of padding . So place verticle guides at 120px mark , 720px mark , 780px mark , and 1040px mark . Now we are going to place our main photos . We used these photos ( LONG ... and LONG ... ) from istockphoto.com , but feel free to use any band photos you like . <p> Draw a Rectangle 408px wide by 265px high . Line it up to our 120px mark guide and give a bit of room for a header above it . Copy it into the clip board . Then use the rectangle as a Clipping Mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the image and give it a fill of none and a stroke of 1px with a bright green border . As seen in the image below Align Stroke to Inside . Now repeat this process for your smaller drummer photo . Its dimensions are 178px wide by 265px high . <p> Now we are going to layout the text . I used a significant amount of Lorem Ipsum . The site http : //www.lipsum.com is the one I use to get the dummy text from . For the body text use a Sans-Serif Font and for the Headings use a Serif Font . I also added a 600px wide horizontal line below the photos . <p> Now we are going to focus on the sidebar . This will be real quick because its mostly text and some horizontal lines . The only other element is to scale down a copy of the main image of the logo until it is about 12px wide . We are going to use this for our list bullets in the sidebar . Turn it dark brown . Use a Serif Font for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists . <h> Those Last Few Details and Then the Files Out The Door to the Client <p> We are going to add some details to give the file just a little more authenticity . Let 's add our copyright to the footer . To insert the copyright symbol you use the Glyphs palette . Go to Type &gt; Glphs . Make sure you place your cursor where you want the copyright symbol to go . Once you 've found the copyright symbol in the Glyphs Palette double click it and it will place it in your footer . <p> All web designers build up a collection of widgets and icons they use in their design work . Feel free to use your own search icon and stylize your text input box . Were adding these elements above the header . We also want to indicate that there is space available for additional links . <p> Now let 's draw a box that fills our entire document workspace of 1160px wide by 950px high . Now with that box selected go to Object &gt; Crop Area &gt; Make . Let 's get that file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ File &gt; Save For Web &amp; Devices . On the right choose JPEG with a setting of Very HIgh , which gives us a conservative 80 percent quality and hit Save . Now Send the file via email to your client . View the final results below . In the next tutorial we will review slicing this design to get it ready for coding . 17224 @qwx877224

Armed with Amsterdam paints , Posca pens and Sharpies , Jon can be found at the spot where art and improvisation collide . On any given day , you can find Burgerman on the streets of New York City , doodling , drawing and delighting in art and life . - Recent works including- Hot Girls and Hot Dogs , Tumblr Girls , - and I Want To Eat Myself illustrate a sense of humor and talent as sprawling as his imagination . <p> I chatted with Burgerman , of whom I am a huge fan , about life , craft and the adventure of art . <h> Comfort Kills Creativity <p> Burgerman recalls with fond memories his studies of Fine Art at University , where he was encouraged to create without limitation . Experimenting with different forms of media , Burgerman integrated performance based art into his vocabulary . <p> " When I graduated , laden with debt and little idea what I was going to do with my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be quick to make and cheap . Some of this work was performance based . As my art career started to pick up I dropped out of working with my friends on events and performances . I 've always liked the immediacy of live work and its something I 've retained through-out my career . I consider my murals and drawings live works and performances even if there 's not an audience around to see them . The artwork being a documentation of the creative act . " <p> " Recently , for a few years with my band Anxieteam and some works I 've done on my own , I 've purposely put live action and intervention into my practice . Live work , be it a performance , a mural , a talk , a workshop or a gig all require some degree of improvisation and fast reflexes , the great and awful thing about the moment , is not knowing what might happen next . This is equally good and bad for the performer and audience and invites a special degree of excitement to the event . <p> I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . " <p> Comfort is the killer of creativity ! <p> Live works invite participation ( although it can be unwelcome participation at times ) and that connection can be really interesting . You can never really predict what people will come- out with , and that can be an adventure all of its own . Comfort is the killer of creativity ! " <p> " If I 'm not having fun overall with a project , the project will no doubt suffer as a result . I cant help that , it just shows in the work . When I 'm inspired and have great energy the work benefits . I 'm in a super lucky position where my work , my job is fun . I 'm in that position because I tried as hard as I could to make it happen . There 's plenty of- room for improvement , of course , but I want to have fun and live a fun life , as much is possible . " <p> " Play is a bit of a gamble . When you play you 're not 100% certain of the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve whatever it is you want to achieve , it could be a defined goal or just the act of playing . I have this in my work . When I draw there 's a number of limitations such as paper size , pen , ink , time , surface etc . I then do everything I can to achieve my invented goal . During the act of play obstacles may arise or unpredicted ferret events may- occur . Maybe you spill your paint , or someone calls your phone and interrupts you . Perhaps you run out of a certain colour , maybe you smudge a line , or the paper reacts to the ink in a certain way - Who knows , often its pretty subtle things , but they all influence the work , and you adapt and navigate around them . The game starts to change as you play it. - I like playing , there 's no guarantee of a particular outcome , there 's always the chance of surprises and disappointments . " <p> Passion and play has n't  come about easily , Burgerman admits . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  become an artist to earn money . <p> " The competition to be successful in the arts is really tough . You face many years without any sort of guaranteed income . - And even if you get some sort of critical acclaim that does n't  mean you 'll be financially any better off . So one hurdle is paying your way . Do n't  become an artist to earn money . " <p> " It can be tough carrying on when you feel like you 're not advancing . I feel this all the time but the only solution is to keep going . You become stronger because of it . You have to push yourself . Its exactly like exercising . Each time you have to go a little further or lift a little more weight to eventually push on to the next level . " <p> The reward for pushing is the way Burgerman feels every time pen or brush touches paper . <p> How does it feel , I asked ? - Burgerman answers quite vividly . <p> " The great Kurt Vonnegut wrote in a forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt beautiful , as opposed to when he was going about his day to day life . I think when I 'm drawing and completely submerged within that process I feel weightless and transparent and happy . I cease to be a body , flesh and blood and grease and kneecaps , I feel like a lovely perfume emanating above a flower bed . " <p> Now that , my friends , is an adventure . <p> Jons Burgerman shares : - Supplies I Use <p> Amsterdam paints- I use these for quick , fast painting and even have used them on walls and the pavement in Manhattan . <p> Edding I like these little pens , perfect for stowing away in your pockets for drawings on the go . <p> Krink Krink go on anything , leaving a heavy , thick , gooey trail where-ever they go .

@@98562690 @2762690/ <h> 4 Lessons In Minimalism <p> Because minimalism is so spare and simple , it 's a common misconception that it would be easy to do it well . But if you really take a look at why good minimalist designs make such an impact , you come to realize that a sophisticated use of the style takes even more experience and understanding that the most maximal of designs . <p> The layout and aesthetic choices should all be made so that the content shines and the user experience is clear and simple . At its core , minimalism puts a premium on communicating ideas and creating experiences in the simplest way possible . Take the minimal music quiz as an example ; not only is the layout minimal in design , so is the imagery that accompanies it . Every part of the site demonstrates how interesting and versatile simplicity can be . It looks effortless , but in order to pull it off , you need to make sure that you 've learned these essential lessons : <h> 1 . Simple does n't  mean easy or plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing characteristics of minimalism is the idea that the end result is the product of just as much ( or often more ) thought than any other type of aesthetic . But the truth is that refining a concept down to a visually pleasing and multifunctional minimum takes a lot of work . This process is what enhances the effectiveness of the visual and interactive experience , and what makes minimalism such an important style to learn more about . <p> For example , it 's the smallest details used in Teacake 's site that make it such a pleasure to interact with . There are several uses of a flat , round elements , which a user will subconsciously but quickly learn are indicators of interactive possibilities . There 's the scroll to top indicator that pops up with just enough emphasis on the right-hand corner to take note of it without it disturbing your experience . There are the buttons for revealing and hiding further information about each project , and the arrows for scanning other images . They are all immediately understandable , and their sleek design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus where it needs to go . <p> Similarly , simplicity should be used to highlight the innate purpose or elements of the design . For example , take a look at this uniform quiz . Designs like these do n't  need to be complex to communicate their message . <h> 2 . Designs should be cohesive and tell a story . <p> Despite the recent popularity and many advantages of minimalism , no one should just jump on the bandwagon because they want their designs to be on trend . Minimalism is n't the best idea for every type of site or target audience ; the choice needs to be made based on practicalities as well as trends . This is why there are so many design portfolios , specialized eCommerce sites , and blogs that are done in the minimalist style . Because their topics are usually restricted and visually engaging , and their audiences are often more attuned to aesthetics than the average user , it makes sense to choose minimalism for these types of sites . <p> Apart from being simply the right choice for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's used to tell a story . This interest in giving an overarching experience is probably why so many minimalist sites use same-page scrolling effects , rather than breaking up their content into multiple pages . By creating a consistent experience throughout the site , businesses like the Josh Cohen School of Music make their products or services ( along with their company ) feel more specialized , personal , and appealing . <h> 3 . Focus on the user experience and the design will follow . <p> You 've already seen a few examples of minimalist sites that have a very unified color scheme , which shows up in the use of a consistent color on all objects of interest , like logos , links , and rollovers . Code ComputerLove is no exception ; a bright persimmon color is used to highlight every important piece of information throughout the site . The large fields of the color that pop up to identify a grid of rollovers make for a particularly eye-catching and satisfying user experience . The reason why this example and many other minimalist sites often put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a wonderful user experience ; there are no other bright hues to distract users from the goals the site wants them to achieve . But it 's a welcome side effect that the site also benefits aesthetically from these restricted color choices . <h> 4 . Achieve a balance of alignment and contrast . <p> Although the previous lesson shows what makes the solid backbone of a good minimalist design , sometimes a little more spark is needed to really ignite the design . Often it 's as simple as adding great imagery or type ( or both ) into your layout . But the best minimalist designs would look great even if these dramatic effects were stripped away . <p> Take a website like Peter Hook and the History of Joy Division ; it is completely monochromatic , and has utterly simple typography and iconography . But the layout achieves a wonderful balance of historical and modern elements , in the textured background and serif typeface and the flat icons and line treatments . And the contrast between black and white and large and small elements is quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site draws you in and makes you want to explore . <p> With all the advantages that well-executed minimalism can confer on the right kind of website or portfolio , it 's no surprise that the style has exploded in popularity of late . The design community should look forward to seeing work that really pushes the envelope and continues to make the web a more robust and mature medium .

@@98562701 @2762701/ <h> Things I 'm Excited for at WMC Fest 2K14 <p> Hello Go Media Faithful ! here 's a blog post comin to you straight from Weapons of Mass Creation Fest speaker coordinator extraordinaire Margot Harrington of Pitch Union Design . She originally published the blog post you see below on her lovely blog here . We loved it so much that we asked if we could share it here on the Zine . Margot is so sweet that she , of course , said YES YES YES ! <p> Enjoy ! Heather , here at Go Media <h> Things I 'm Excited for at WMC Fest 2K14 by Margot Harrington <p> Why hello there , first blog post of 2014 ! What have I been doing , besides not publishing stuff on the internet for 8 months ? Aside from- participating in a tech summit at the White House- ( yes , - that- White House ) on the prevention of campus sexual assault , I 've honestly been enjoying keeping a lower profile for awhile . Because it 's safe and easy and I 've been able to maintain steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the same as growing it . And not making writing a priority is all excuses disguising a rip-roaring case of impostor syndrome . Am I over this ? Am I cured ? If not forever , at least for now being able to type these words indicates yes . And I have to thank- WMC Fest- as a major factor in this development . <p> Illustration by Mary Kate McDevitt <p> Happening in precisely one month , in Cleveland , this 'll be my third consecutive year being involved in this event . The first time I went , I gave my first major public talk and to this day it 's still the best talk I 've ever written and- this post about it- is still receiving regular traffic . Last year , going as an attendee was magical for other reasons , namely how awesome it is to be on the sidelines rooting for my creative friends on stage . I do n't think people give that support role enough credit . Without it there would be no festival to speak of . And this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as co-host with my comrade- Stewart Scott-Curran . We also curated the speaker line-up as well , which we 've been planning since January . It 's been a pleasure and an honor to have this role . I ca n't wait to see this all happen again IRL . <p> Here 's some specific things I 'm excited for this year : <p> + Beyond single speaker talks , we 've put together two panel discussions and a formal debate . This 'll guarantee some legit Real TalkG about the race , gender , and class issues in the creative/larger world . Our moderators are pros and will ensure the discourse is balanced and productive . They will give us all clear take aways to build more equality in our day to day lives . <p> + I made a- WMC inspired Spotify playlist ! With songs that either talk about Ohio , the Midwest , or by groups who are from Ohio/Cleveland . There 's also a few songs from bands playing the festival this year , as well as some random summertime jams that are good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't join us this year , you can enjoy this in spirit of the event ! <p> + This is a given , but seeing old friends &amp; colleagues from previous years , as well as meeting a slew of new folks . I have n't subjected this to rigorous intellectual testing , but I 'd wager WMC Fest has much a higher rate of return attendees over other similar design or creative conference which says a lot about the programming and the vibe . Events like this do something a little different for everyone , so it 's hard to define what the result will be for you . But , if my own experience is any indication , there will be cumulative results . Might be a bit of surprise what they are exactly , but regardless , they will be awesome . <p> + Another difference is that all of the events are in one location , which makes for a more immersive experience than other conferences . Obviously , I 'd love for the whole- world- to come to the talks and panels , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' N Roll Hall of Fame ( recommend this , it 's insane ! ) or Great Lakes Brewing Co. , or the charming Ohio City Farmer 's Market , get it done . There 's also locally owned coffee shop , Gypsy Beans , two doors to the left of the theater which 'll more than satisfy the joe fiends out there . <p> + Other things I 'm hoping to squeeze in if I can : a visit to the historic Cleveland Public Library , which is across the street from the swanky Hyatt Regency which is also a historical landmark . Also : Cleveland 's Museum of Contemporary Art ! ! They are showing an exhibition on graphic design legend and one of my hugest design influences , - Sister Corita Kent- in August . <p> So , will I see you there ? I sure hope so . And , even if you wo n't be able to make it and you 're reading this anyway I 'd be thrilled if you said so . Just knowing that this transmission has made its way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am the head honcho around here . Pitch Design Union makes websites , books , brands , &amp; custom lettering , some of which are shown here . Sometimes I make art &amp; sometimes I teach . I believe in discourse , inclusion , sincerity , &amp; hard work .
