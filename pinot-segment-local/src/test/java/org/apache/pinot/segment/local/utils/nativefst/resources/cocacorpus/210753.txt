@@74693866 @3393866/ <h> How to Form a Corporation and Follow Governance Requirements <p> A simple search of " governance documents " on Google will result in various corporations with multitudes of different documents ( e.g. , " Certification of Incorporation , " " Code of Ethics , " " Audit Committee Charter " ) . For a young entrepreneur looking to form a corporation , these documents may seem overwhelming and may discourage a potential business from incorporating . The reality , however , is that the vast majority of corporations do not need most of these documents . <h> Large Corporations <p> It only gets complicated when a corporation becomes " large " where federal regulations begin to take effect . A simple way to know if your corporation is " large " is if your corporation is being publicly traded ( listed on a Stock Exchange or sold on an OTC market ) . As mentioned above , most corporations are closely-held ( not publicly sold ) and state law tends to have relaxed requirements to form a corporation to spur more business within the state . For almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely-held corporation . <h> Required vs . Needed <p> Before moving forward with the governance documents for an LLC , a distinction must be made between " required " governance document and " needed " governance documents . The " required " governance document entails the document that LLCs must have as mandated by state law . Without this document , the state may not recognize a business as an LLC . The " needed " governance document is not mandated by state law , but it is a document that every LLC should have to prevent future complications and possibly catastrophic lawsuits . Also to note , LLCs are generally required to file an annual ( or biennial ) report with the state . However , this article will not be addressing these reports . <h> Required Governance Document - Certificate of Incorporation <p> Every corporation requires a Certificate of Incorporation . The Certificate is essentially the corporation 's birth certificate and used as proof of a corporation 's existence within a state . The Certificate is issued by the state and requires a potential corporation to file its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary state fees ) . <p> The Articles of Incorporation sets forth the basic information of your business . Generally , states have minimal requirements for the Articles : ( 1 ) corporation 's name ; ( 2 ) corporation 's purpose ( " to engage in any lawful activity " ) ; ( 3 ) name and address of your corporation 's registered agent ( the entity who is authorized on the corporation 's behalf to accept delivery of certain legal documents ) ; and ( 4 ) stock information ( number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue , designation of classes of shares , and possibly the initial value of each share ) . Beyond these minimal requirements , the Articles will usually identify the incorporators of the corporation ( the person responsible for signing and filing the Articles ) . The Articles may also supply the number of directors and the names of the first directors . <p> Most , if not all , states have a standard Articles of Incorporation form that outlines the minimal requirements for the state . An applicant can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form to be incorporated . However , depending upon the complexities of your corporation ( e.g. , different class shares , particular election of directors , membership qualifications , indemnification provisions ) , the Articles may include these complexities , but the corporation can elect to include these special provisions within the Bylaws ( see below ) . A professional should be consulted when considering these special provisions.The Certificate must be kept with the registered agent . <h> Needed Governance Document - Bylaws <p> States do not require LLCs to file an operating agreement . In fact , a number of states do not even require the operating agreement to be in writing to be enforceable . However , the operating agreement may prove to be the most important governance document an LLC can have and so every LLC should have a written operating agreement . Due to the relaxed requirements for the Articles of Organization , some of the most important governing aspects of an LLC are left unwritten . Similar to the bylaws of a corporation , the operating agreement fills in these blanks . <p> The bylaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders ' and directors ' meetings are called and conducted , the formalities of shareholder voting , the qualifications of directors , the functions of board committees , and procedures for and limits on issuing and transferring shares . These provisions give structure on how the corporation is governed . Many bylaws contain indemnification provisions that may protect the directors , the officers , or both , as well as a severability clause that allows the bylaws to survive and be enforced even if a particular provision is held to be invalid . The bylaws must be consistent with the Articles of Incorporation and if any discrepancy arises , the Articles hold precedence . The bylaws can be amended as needed and the bylaws should specify the procedures for amendment . <h> Needed Governance Document - Minutes of Meetings <p> Every corporation is required to have annual meetings for both shareholders and directors . A corporation can also call special meetings for shareholders and directors . The activity that occurs during these meetings is recorded within the meeting 's minutes . The minutes are used as the official record for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the governance of a corporation , minutes should remain light . Only information of substance should be included , while extensive details on what was presented excluded . For more information on the meeting minutes , please refer to the comment of meeting minutes . <h> Committee Charters <p> For many corporations , the only governing board they will have ( or need ) is the Board of Directors . However , larger corporations may have specialized governing needs ( i.e. litigation and audit committees ) . Often these needs are federally mandated and so the board may formulate a committee of inside and outside directors to govern these committees . As a consequence , the corporation will create committee charters that in essence act as the committee 's bylaws . <h> Code of Ethics/Conduct <p> Beyond the governance documents listed above , the corporation may also communicate the expectations it has from the governing bodies ( directors and officers ) and from its employees . These expectations are generally spelled out in a code of ethics ( the expectations shareholders have upon the corporation and its governing body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporation has upon the employees ) . These documents are not necessary for smaller corporations ( where the shareholders , directors , and officers are the same people ) .

These fine details can sometimes be the deciding factor in choosing to become an LLC or a corporation . You may want to seek the advice of a lawyer or accountant ( be warned , not all lawyers and accountants will be up to date with all LLC laws ) to help you decide what business entity would best suit your needs . However , for many businesses , these fine details will not be a factor in deciding to become an LLC or a corporation , and so let 's look at the general differences between an LLC and a corporation . <h> Legal entity vs tax entity <p> Before going any further , a distinction between a legal entity ( LLC v. corporation ) and a tax entity ( sole proprietor / partnership vs . C-corporation v. S-corporation ) must be made . Often , new entrepreneurs get these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tax entity classification is simply the way the IRS ( and the state taxing board ) sees the business .

A corporation ( legal entity ) will be given a corporation ( C-corp or S-corp ) designation as a tax entity . However , an LLC ( legal entity ) has a choice on what tax identity it wants to have . An LLC can be seen as a sole proprietor / partnership , or as a C-corp , or as an S-corp ( there is no true LLC tax entity and so an LLC is seen as one of the traditional business designations instead ) . In this sense , an LLC has greater flexibility and can choose the tax identity that most benefits its members .

The S-corporation designation does allow flow through taxation ( no corporate tax ) , but there are certain requirements to qualify as an S-corp that may limit its utility to a business . Depending upon the circumstances of a corporation , it may have no choice but to be a C-corp and face double taxation . <p> An LLC , on the other hand , no matter its structure or organization , can choose how it wants to be taxed . By default , an LLC is treated as a " pass-through " entity ( single taxation ) , but can elect to be taxed as a C-corp or an S-corp ( if it qualifies ) . Although it may seem counter-intuitive to potential entrepreneurs to choose to be doubly taxed , for certain specific situations , filing the LLC as a C-corp tax designation will make financial sense . But for most , this will make no sense . <p> If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an LLC and S-corp are a bit more nuanced . Both an LLC and an S-corp has flow through taxation ( no double taxation ) . However , an LLC 's distribution of profits is subject to an employment tax , whereas an S-corp 's dividends are not . With careful planning , a small business can avoid significant employment taxes by electing to become an S-corp . Beyond the drawbacks of an S-corp mentioned below , there are other reasons ( i.e. a lot more paperwork ) that may deter a small business from taking this advantage . Consult a professional before making a decision on whether to be taxed as an LLC or S-corp . <h> Form an LLC or Corporation <h> Business Ownership <p> The owners of a corporation are the shareholders . The owners of an LLC are its members . Beyond the name differences , there are other substantial differences between the two . An LLC has complete freedom to distribute its ownership stake to its members without any regard to a member 's capital contribution to an LLC . This becomes important when profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have invested as much as another member , an LLC 's operating agreement may specify that all members receive an equal share of the profits . <p> A corporation can theoretically do the same by creating a unique stock class structure , but this is limited to C-corps . Unfortunately , a business that wants to be identified as an S-corp to avoid the double taxation can not create a unique stock class structure . As a pre-requisite , an S-corp must have a single class of stocks with its dividends distributed in proportion to a shareholders capital investment . Thus , in order for a corporation to create a unique stock class structure , it must be subject to the double taxation . <h> Business Operation <p> An LLC has a more centralized management structure . Any member may act as the LLC 's manager(s) and the LLC can elect to have no distinction between an owner and manager of the LLC . <p> A corporation must have a corporate structure with a Board of Directors handling the management responsibilities and the corporate officers handling the day-to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners of the corporation , but remain separated from the business decisions of the corporation ( except for approval of major corporate decisions ) and only retain the power to elect directors . However , individual shareholders can be elected as a director or appointed as an officer . <h> Legal Discrepancies <p> There are also certain legal concerns to consider when choosing between an LLC and a corporation . To help illustrate the difference between an LLC and a corporation , an LLC can be seen as the new kid on the block with the corporation as the old predictable senior citizen . The corporation classification has been around for centuries , but more importantly to our discussion , the corporate form has been a part of U.S. history from beyond its inception . This is important because this has allowed the corporate form to mature and develop to the point where the laws for corporations have , for the most part , become uniform . Courts have centuries of case law to look to see how to resolve a dispute involving corporations . Financial planners can be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will react . <p> Unfortunately , the same can not be said about LLCs . LLCs were first recognized in the 1970s . As the offspring of both the corporate and sole-proprietorship / partnership form , the LLC takes on the characteristics of both legal entities . As a consequence of being a " new " legal entity and having characteristics of both a corporation and partnership , states differ in their treatment of LLCs . Generally , states have similar LLC laws , but there are differences that may lead a particular business to choose to be an LLC in one state , but a corporation in another . In time , LLC laws will become more uniform throughout the United States and this point will become irrelevant . For most businesses , these discrepancies between LLC laws should not be a factor , but for the few , the discrepancies may be the deciding factor . <p> Although most people should be able to figure out what business form will best suit their needs , if one is not 100 percent sure , he or she should consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 
@@74693876 @3393876/ <h> Choosing the Right Entity <p> When deciding to start a business , you might wonder which kind of business you should form . Your business 's structure should be chosen based on your particular needs . When creating your business , you have four basic entity types you can choose to use . Each one has its advantages and disadvantages , based on what you sell , your business 's finances , and the number of owners the business will have . The Questions to ask yourself : What type of business do I run ? How many owners do I have ? What is my financial situation ? There is no one choice that suits every single business : Business owners have to select the structure that best fits their needs . Below we compare the most common business types you can form . <h> Sole Proprietorship <p> This is the simplest option of the four . Typically , when a business is starting out , the owner will not do much research into entity types , and this is the default option . Not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also simplifies the tax process come April . All the owner has to do is report its profits or losses on their personal tax record , and that is it . However , this simple structure means it is tied to your personal assets . That means that if the business fails , you could lose your personal property and savings to pay for any lingering debt . You also will likely have to pay a self-employment tax on any profits you make , which could mean having to pay the government a substantial portion of profits earned . <h> Partnership <p> A general partnership is a lot like a sole proprietorship ; if you are working with someone else , it is the default entity type for your business . But , like the sole proprietorship , a general partnership ties the business and personal assets of the partners together . If you choose , you could make a limited partnership as long as neither of the partners personally manages the affairs of the business . This lowers personal liability for business debts , but does not eliminate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , if your business is built around one . The lack of inherent protection with these entities means that if , for whatever reason , one partner chooses to walk away , they may take the idea with them and kill whatever business had been made . <h> Corporation <p> This is a very common entity type , though the paperwork and effort involved in the incorporation process may scare some small business owners away . However , by incorporating , you are greatly protecting your personal assets by creating a separate entity from yourself . This does make accounting a bit more complicated , but you pay taxes based on what you choose to pay yourself from the corporation , which could mean less money being given to Uncle Sam and more to help your business along . Any ideas your business is built around also becomes the property of the corporation , and not the owners . After you incorporate , you could also choose to elect an S-Corporation status . What this effectively does is tax the shareholders , instead of the income of the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could actually get similar benefits from another entity that is much easier to create ; the Limited Liability Company . <h> See our LLC and Corporation Packages <h> Limited Liability Company ( LLC ) <p> LLCs are very popular entity types because they give the owner , or owners , many more choices . Typically , owners can either opt for the tax structure of a corporation , in which the corporation 's income is taxed , or the pass-through structure of a partnership or a proprietorship , wherein personal income includes business profits and losses and is taxed accordingly . Some states have not changed their tax law to reflect the IRS 's ruling that this is allowed , so you should try and contact a professional from the state you are trying to form your company in . Whatever tax structure you choose , your personal assets are still afforded some protection if the business fails if you choose to form a LLC . <p> When choosing the entity type right for you , be sure to consider the future needs and situation of your company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said before , there are pro 's and con 's to each type , but if you consider them carefully , the best fitting entity will likely be clear . Before doing anything , it is wise to consult with a lawyer and an accountant to have your options clarified and questions answered .

But what are these reports , and what are they supposed to say ? Initial Reports <p> Initial reports are exactly what they sound like reports filed at the beginning of the formation of a Corporation or LLC , or shortly thereafter .

Ohio , for example , does not require any business entity to file an annual report , and LLCs are excused from filing in Delaware . Annual report can sometimes be a bit of a misnomer as well , as some states , like New York and Indiana , only want biennial- reports .

Think of your business ' credit score as a gauge for the reputation of your company . Among other factors , it reveals any sign of your business ' delinquent payments or bankruptcy , which could affect your chances of landing future business relationships . If your business has poor credit history , potential lenders or investors may not want to partner with your company because it would be considered a high risk endeavor . <h> So why is it important to build business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wo n't want to put a loan for your business in your name for liability reasons , as you could become responsible for your business ' debt . There is always a chance that your business could hit hard times , and if your business can not repay the loan , you do n't want that debt reflected on your own personal credit report . Not to mention in some extreme cases , the creditors could go after your personal assets if you filed the loan in your own name . Therefore it 's best to build business credit , and then apply for business loans with your company 's credit report instead . <p> The better your business credit the more financial opportunities your business will receive . For one , if your business has good credit history , lenders will be more likely to loan your business money .

You may not need extra money now , but what if sales drop next month ? Can you still pay your company 's rent ? Will you have enough money to cover your employees ' payroll ? If your business has already built good credit , then your business should have no trouble borrowing money during a financial bind . <h> How do you build business credit ? <p> Now that you understand the importance of good business credit , the following are just a few simple steps , which can help your business build credit . <p> 1 .

This tax number let 's your business create a business bank account . <p> 3 . Set up a Business Bank Account <p> You 'll need a business bank account in order to apply for a business loan , so your next step should be setting up at least one account for your company . <p> 4 . Register with Business Credit Bureaus <p> Your business entity and EIN also allow you to apply for credit file numbers with business credit bureaus . Many businesses register with Dun &amp; Bradstreet , which is the largest business credit bureau in the United States .

Whether that means creating a budget , cutting back on certain expenses , or setting up payment reminders , you should make paying bills on time a priority . Any delinquency in this area will negatively impact your business ' credit score , which will make it difficult for your business to attract lenders , partners , or investors in the future .

States are getting creative in taxing foreign corporations and are pushing the limits of what constitutes " business transactions " within a state , and so the definition of " business transactions " will be in flux and may be different depending on the state . For these reasons , it may be important to consult an attorney on whether a particular corporation will need to qualify or register as a foreign corporation .

@@74693888 @3393888/ <h> Why Incorporate ? <p> Choosing how a business is organized may be one of the most important decisions a business makes . Incorporation may be the wisest decision , but for some , it may be an unnecessary decision , and so each business should carefully assess the benefits ( and challenges ) of incorporation before moving forward . With that said , the greatest benefits to incorporation can be summarized into the 3Ls : Life , Liquidity , and Liability . Let 's start with Life . <h> Life <p> The best way to understand a corporation is to imagine it as a separate artificial person ( with limited rights and privileges ) . Incorporating a business is essentially creating that separate person thereby making the business separate from the owner ( in a sense , the business has a life of its own ) . As a separate entity , the corporation exists independent from the shareholders/owners and its employees . Regardless of what happens to the shareholders , or the directors , or the employees , the corporation itself continues to exist in perpetuity until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation . In a sole proprietorship or general partnership where the owner(s) is the business , what affects the owner may affect the business . Any personal debt or liability of an owner or partner allows the creditor(s) to pursue the assets of the business whether or not the debt or liability has any relation to the business itself . Furthermore , personal bankruptcy of an owner or partner will directly impact a business by opening up its assets to any creditors the owner or partner is liable to . By incorporating a business , the personal finances of an owner or partner remains separate from the finances of the corporation and allows the business to continue without disruption . In the event of an unfortunate death of an owner or partner , the business is generally dissolved regardless of the wishes of the owner or partner(s) . All of this could easily be avoided by incorporating the business as a separate entity . <h> Liquidity <p> As much as we believe that all owners of a business should remain forever committed to the success of the business , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the business . Regardless of the reasons for leaving the business , incorporation allows the free transferability of interest from one person to another . Generally in a partnership , a partner can not transfer his/her interest in a business to another without the express consent of all other partners . If a partner still decides to leave the partnership against the will of the other partners , the partnership is automatically dissolved . Incorporating a business removes this limitation by allowing shareholders/owners to freely transfer his/her interest to another without the unanimous consent of all other shareholders . Small businesses may see the restrictions against transferring shares as a good thing and may want to control how a shareholder may transfer his/her interest and to whom . Incorporation allows this flexibility as well . The free transferability of shares is a default rule , but by no means is it mandatory for all incorporated businesses . Businesses have the option to place restrictions on the transferability of certain shares and so even if this benefit of liquidity may be seen as a detriment to a business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of this option . More importantly , unlike a partnership , incorporation prevents the ability of a minority shareholder from dissolving a business without cause . <h> Liability <p> One of the greatest benefits for incorporation is its limited liability against the shareholders . As mentioned above , any debt or liability against a specific shareholder remains separate from the corporation . Likewise , the inverse is similarly true . Any debt or liability against a corporation does not open the doors of shareholders ' assets to the creditor(s) . The shareholder 's liability in any corporate debt or liability is limited to what the shareholder invested ( unless there is fraud ) . In a sole proprietorship or general partnership , the owner(s) and/or general partners remain completely liable to any debt or liability placed against the business . If a business is unable to pay a debt , the creditor can attack the assets of an owner or partner until the debt is satisfied . In a corporation , a creditor can only attack to the extent the shareholder invested into the corporation ( unless there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions without the risk of endangering the personal assets of its shareholders beyond what was invested . Risk is a necessary element to a successful business . Anything that minimizes the risk to investors makes the business more attractive , and so the limited liability of an incorporated business is quite valuable . <h> Taxes <p> The major detriment to incorporation is the taxes involved . In a sole proprietorship or partnership , the taxable income of the business flows directly to the owner and/or partners and are taxed based upon the individual 's income tax bracket . However , because the corporation is considered a separate entity , the taxable income of a corporation is taxed first under a corporate tax . If the corporation decides to distribute the remaining income to the shareholders , that income is taxed once more based upon the individual 's income tax bracket ( essentially , a double-taxation ) . The marginal tax rate for a corporation can be significantly higher than the marginal tax rate for a sole proprietorship . Although this characteristic of incorporation may deter a business from incorporating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the options given to a corporation by the states . Some options include incorporating as an S-corporation ( see below ) or filing as a Limited Liability Company ( LLC ) ( see below ) . These options allow the taxable income to flow directly to the shareholders/members without being taxed twice , while at the same time , maintaining the benefits of incorporation . The 3Ls are important benefits , but not the only benefits . There 's also something psychologically beneficial about incorporating that goes beyond the number crunching and legal issues involved . Incorporation may seem to be a daunting task , but it is also an exciting moment in the life of a business . First conceived through an idea , a business can be birthed at the point of incorporation . No longer will it simply be an idea or something intangible , but an actual and existing entity . Sometimes this psychological step of seeing the business as something real will further motivate and inspire you to bring greater success to your business . <h> Reduced Chance of Tax Audit <p> Sole proprietors tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self-prepared ) , and tend to under report revenue or over report deductions . For these reasons , the IRS has audited a much higher percentage of sole proprietor tax filings than corporate filings in recent years . In tax year 2006 , a Schedule C filer stood a 1 in 32 chance of being audited . For non-business filers , the odds were around 1 in 124 . This means that sole proprietors are significantly more likely to be audited . <h> Build Credibility <p> Distinguishing yourself from the competition by establishing a professional identity helps increase credibility with your customers . Most businesses choose to incorporate a business to prove their legitimacy to both customers and suppliers . Adding " INC. " or " LLC " after your business name gives you the credibility and professionalism that many customers are looking for . <p> You could file all the necessary incorporation documents yourself .

@@74693890 @3393890/ <h> The 5 Benefits of Freebies for Small Businesses <p> Today is National Donut Day and all throughout the country , the scent of glazed and sprinkled deliciousness is flooding our nostrils . These lighter than air confections are available from tasty donut shops like Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme for the low , low price of zero dollars today . As in , FREE ! On a Friday ? <p> Now wait just one minute . Why is today free donut day ? Why did companies decide June 3rd was the best day to give away free donuts ? And how late is my Dunkin open till again ? <p> National Donut Day is n't a day created by marketing pros or companies looking for more exposure for their products . The origins behind the day comes from the Salvation Army who used the concept of free goods to assist those in need in 1938 during the Great Depression . The donuts were also provided to soldiers fighting overseas . The Salvation Army established huts in France that offered helpful female volunteers who would offer writing supplies , sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . Definitely a plus , but transporting the baked goods from the huts to the front lines proved to be more difficult than it seemed ( imagine carrying dozens of pies long distances without a car and no way to keep them getting crushed ) Two volunteers thought up the idea of doing donuts instead and the idea struck gold : the soldiers loved the donuts and came in droves to visit the huts . <p> Today , donut shops honor the original fundraiser by giving away free donuts once a year . For all businesses big and small , its an tremendously successful tactic for generating both new business and ensuring the loyalty of regular customers . If you are debating on whether or not to incorporate freebies into your line of business , consider the 5 biggest benefits of doing so : <p> 1 ) Sample Products <p> Looking to try a new recipe or new formula on an old familiar product ? Need to share with the world your newest service ? Samples are the best way to go about doing so . A sample size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like what how it works or how it tastes , you 're sold and that product is coming home with you . Ever been to Costco or Sams Club ? These bulk warehouses are notorious for their samples of food and drink products sold under the same roof . It allows curious customers to try out foods that they might have otherwise overlooked or maybe not have purchased altogether because of the fear that it would n't have tasted the way they imagined . Trying out new products is harder than it looks sometimes , as many people are accustomed to what they already like so giving out sample products is a great way to test with the consumer and create a buzz . <p> And speaking of buzz <p> 2 ) Word of Mouth <p> Something free ? ! You do n't  even have to worry that there wont be any response- everyone loves the word free . There is no losing on this situation . If you have a solid product , give out the samples , and attract the customers , then most of your work is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those working within the company will recommend it to their family and friends . The domino effect is born after- great word of mouth travels like a wildfire . <p> 3 ) Reactions <p> Not every new product works out ( does Crystal Pepsi from the 90s ring a bell with anyone ? ) and this is to be expected . Disappointing ? Yes . Only distributing the product out in sample sizes and losing a smaller amount of money in the end result ? A lifesaver . Rather than invest all of your money into full-sized products that spend more time shelved than purchased and put into use , start with selling and sampling both trial and regular sizes . Offer coupon codes to consumers who used the product and are pleased with the results- this adds to the great word of mouth too ! <p> 4 ) They Do n't  Have to Happen Once <p> One-time freebies can also become a regular fixture . Many companies offer freebies and deals for birthdays and holidays all throughout the year . One of the best examples is the nationwide makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase and even gives consumers the opportunity to choose their own samples from a selected list . They also offer free sample items for birthdays , packaged deals during the holidays , and if you sign onto an email mailing list , frequent insider sales offers and promo codes . With the success of both the stores and the online website as proof , its evident that everyone likes free samples no matter what time of the year it is ! <p> 5 ) Building Trust in Customers <p> This is one of the hardest things a new company or in some cases , even a trusted brand can do . Customers are brand loyalists by nature . When we try a brand and it works and we like it , the transition to trying a new one is difficult . We need to be sold on why this new product can be better for us , what it can do to enrich our lives , and if it is something well want to share with others . Once trust is build , it is not shaken unless the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs create new products , sample them out , and get the word of mouth going . Great companies do all of this and listen . Listen to the needs and concerns of their consumer audience . To know that their concerns are being listened to and that change is in the process gives customers every reason to stay with the company and their products . 34788 @qwx654788

@@74693893 @3393893/ <h> Business Name vs Trademark <p> A business must register the name with the Secretary of State and , as long as it is distinguishable from any other business name within the state , the business will be recognized under that business name and no other business can use that name within that one state . A trademark on the other hand is not a name , but property . A trademark is generally used to brand a certain good or service and has a value in of itself . For example , imagine a well built car with no markings . <h> Is protecting my Name different from a trademark ? <p> There 's a short answer and a long answer to this question . Let 's start with the short answer . The business name is simply that , a name , a way to identify a business , entity , or individual . Due to the potential value of a trademark and the inherent property rights entailed within a trademark , the application for a trademark is much more complicated . Trademarks are registered under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months . The property rights of trademarks can be enforced by both the federal government and by the states . <p> Now for the long answer . The business name is limited to the state . States have differing laws on how different the name must be from other business names within the state . Some states have very loose laws and say the name has to be unique and easy to identify ( e.g. , filing of " Transamerica Airlines , Inc. " was acceptable even though the name " Trans-Americas Airlines , Inc. " was already in existence ) . Other states impose strict guidelines that restrict names from being " deceptively similar " to prevent unfair competition ( e.g. , filing of " Transamerica Airlines , Inc. " would be too similar to " Trans-Americas Airlines , Inc. " that would confuse consumers on which corporation is which ) . However , the business name does not need to be different from business names in other states . In fact , a corporation can do business in another state where its business name is being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( doing business as ) or Assumed Business Name or trade name ( depending on the state ) . Most important to the distinction between a business name and trademark is the fact that a corporation can conduct business with the same name of another existing business . Registering the business name with the Secretary of State merely protects that name from being used by another business within that state , but not in another state . <p> Trademarks , on the other hand , are property . Similar to any other tangible property , the owner of a trademark has the exclusive rights to the trademark and can prevent another individual from using the trademark . A trademark is also not limited to a business name but can also include a phrase , logo , symbol , design , image , or a combination of these elements . As mentioned above , this mark can not be similar to any other trademark . A mark can use the same words as another mark , as long as the marks are not deceptively similar . By simply changing the font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , the mark may be trademarked by the federal government ( e.g. , compare Apple , Inc. with Apple Corps Ltd . ) . However , the trademark can not tarnish the value of another trademark or blur the consumer 's perception of the trademark with another . Because trademarks include exclusive rights to the mark , the application process is more complicated . After applying to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , the trademark undergoes an examination period that can last over six months . Once all procedural and substantive issues are resolved , the trademark is then placed in a 30-day waiting period where third-parties have the opportunity to challenge the trademark through an Opposition Proceeding . If no challenge to the trademark is substantiated , the trademark is officially registered . Unlike copyrights and patents , trademarks have an unlimited lifespan . <h> How do i get a federal tax i 'd for my business ? <p> Generally , businesses need a Federal Tax I 'd number or an Employer Identification Number ( EIN ) to legally conduct business .

This application must be completed within one session so it is important that an applicant has all necessary information available at the time of application . <p> A third party is allowed to apply for an EIN , however that third party must be authorized by the business . If a sole proprietorship or general partnership , the sole proprietor or general partnership must authorize the third party to apply for an EIN . If a corporation , the corporation ( and not simply a shareholder ) must authorize the third party to apply for an EIN .

The answer is the procedure is fairly similar to what residents of the United States experience filing and that yes , there are a series of great benefits that come in doing so . 1 ) Limited Liability Companies ( " LLCs " ) are popular business structures for partnerships and individuals , due to the attractive tax and legal benefits , and personal liability protection that they afford . As a non-U.S . citizen , incorporating a business in the United States is generally similar to the procedure required for a U.S. resident . Because U.S. citizenship and residency are not necessary , non-U.S . citizens are welcome to start or expand on American soil without jumping through any more hoops than a U.S.-born business owner . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the state level " not the federal level " for both foreign nationals and U.S. citizens . The process will differ from state to state but is generally comprised of two steps : 1. ) applying to register in that specific state and 2. ) establishing a registered agent with a valid , physical address in the selected state . <p> 3 ) For foreign businesses , an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ( ITIN ) will satisfy the requirement that each business must have a taxpayer number . The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) issues these tax processing numbers to individuals who have to pay U.S. taxes but are not eligible for a Social Security number . Residents and non-resident aliens as well as foreign nationals fall into this category . <p> 4 ) To receive pass-through profit distributions , a foreign citizen may form a limited liability company . In contrast , all profit distributions ( called dividends ) made by a C corporation are subject to double taxation . ( Under US tax law , a nonresident alien may own shares in a C corporation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) For this reason , many foreign citizens form a limited liability company ( LLC ) instead of a C corporation . <p> 5 ) A foreign citizen may be a corporate officer and/or director , but may not work in the United States or receive a salary or compensation for services provided in the United States unless the foreign citizen has a work permit ( either a green card or a special visa ) issued by the United States . <p> 6 ) If you intend to open a bank account in your home country or if a local company or government office will require proof of the formation of your U.S. Corporation or LLC , you may need to have the company formation documents certified with an " Apostille " or " Certificate of Authentication " . An Apostille , which is an agreement between countries to accept each others documents ) is only available if your country is a member of the Hague Convention . 34788 @qwx654788

If an entrepreneur is planning on doing business using a name other than his or her own personal legal name , then he/she will probably need a DBA . Most states require a DBA prior to conducting business under a name other than the business name or one 's personal name . <h> What is a DBA ? <p> DBA stands for " Doing Business As . " A DBA is crucially used for banking purposes . Operating under a business name without setting up a DBA will make it impossible to issue and receive checks under the business name . For one thing , a business owner can not use his personal account and issue checks or receive checks under his business name . The second issue with this is that a business owner will be unable to open an account under his business name without first having a DBA . Business owners should plan ahead for these banking issues by getting their DBA filed prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Separate <p> In this way , the business owner is still connected to his business in that he may still receive checks under the name of his business but he will still be able to keep the two accounts separate , separating himself from the business entity . <h> How to use a DBA <p> The most common use of a DBA is probably by those who are sole proprietors . These are individual business owners who run their business themselves and have just hung out their shingle . Since most people in these circumstances use a business name other than their own name , it would be necessary to get a DBA . For example , if Mario wanted to open his own doughnut shop called " The Perfect Doughnut , " he would need to get a DBA that asserted it was Mario doing business as " The Perfect Doughnut . " This would allow Mario to receive checks made out to the " The Perfect Doughnut " and also sign checks under that name.DBAs can also be useful to corporations , LLCs , and other business entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names without having to form new organizations . In this way more formalized business entities that are seeking to branch out into other businesses or industries can do so without forming new corporations or LLCs . This can save money ( in the form of filing fees ) and time ( in the form of filing documents and maintaining the business entity throughout the year ) . For example , let 's say Mario decided to form Mario 's Tasty Treats , LLC and started a doughnut shop . Now he wants to start a sandwich shop too . Instead of starting a separate company for the sandwich shop , he can just file a DBA for Mario 's Tasty Treats , LLC doing business as " The Perfect Sandwich . " <h> Business Entity Benefits <p> Forming a business entity such as a corporation or LLC , along with a DBA provides excellent benefits for a business owner . It allows an owner to have liability protection for their personal assets , arrange taxation of their business in a way that is most beneficial for them , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Normally this would n't be that big of a deal , but business schools have a terrible habit of taking the most inoffensive , uninspired mission statements from major corporations and printing them out as an example to which our future- entrepreneurs- can aspire . <p> So many thoughts , such little creativity <p> So we decided to go through a list of multi-national companies and found four odd/funny/not all there upstairs mission statements to help future- entrepreneurs- reading our blog avoid being the butt of a small time business blogs jokes . <p> Dell : " To be the most successful computer company in the world at delivering the best customer experience in markets we serve . " <p> This one got a collective " Lol , what ? " from the Social Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business jargon and the word computer and then just let it all spill out into a nearly incomprehensible sentence . We understand what Dell is trying to say , that they want to be the top dogs of the computer world , a company that gives customers a technological experience that they simply can not get anywhere else . But the statement is so poorly constructed ! This is the statement that you 'll be using to represent your company , to give it direction please make sure that it makes sense . <p> Sony ( Europe ) : " Sony is committed to developing a wide range of innovative products and multimedia services that challenge the way consumers access and enjoy digital entertainment . By ensuring synergy between businesses within the organisation , Sony is constantly striving to create exciting new worlds of entertainment that can be experienced on a variety of different products . " <p> Ugh , synergy . Is there any business buzz word so widely hated and vilified ? Do n't  ever use the word synergy in your mission statement . It makes it sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the statement is actually pretty good . Its clear , understandable , and is a lofty goal Sony can aspire to . But the second half is just a white-hot mess of corporate nonsense . Exciting new worlds ? Really ? Avoid falling into the trap of playing up some kind of corporate culture that likely does not exist , and make sure your goals are always clear . <p> And never use the word synergy . Ever . <p> Enron : " Respect , Integrity , Communication and Excellence . " <p> Enrons statement was n't necessarily bad . It was a little silly , and very vague , but those four things were goals that could reasonably guide a businesss development . The reason were giving Enron a place on our list , however , is because they did n't  follow their mission statement . At all . Its hard to respect your customers and shareholders when you hide your debts and cost people their pensions and livelihoods . Your mission statement shouldnt just be a collection of nice sounding words . It should help guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company . <p> Hershey : " Undisputed Marketplace Leadership " <p> That 's it . Undisputed . Market . Leadership . That type of statement would fit better on a propaganda poster used to prop up a tottering military regime . Its clear , but its vague and leaves a bad taste in your mouth not the best affect when your flagship product is chocolate . Even if your goal is total market annihilation , you should n't make that your mission statement . How do you even achieve that ? Send a man named Slugworth to steal secrets from your competitors ? Make sure your mission statement actually relates to what you sell , and that it puts your company in a positive light . <p> Just remember that a good mission statement will not make up for a bad business plan .

If all of your ducks are in a row , opening up your own firm is like opening any other small business . You need a DBA name , and you have to apply for all of your local/state business and operating licenses .

PLLCs and LLPs are actually really similar the main difference is that a PLLC can usually be formed by only one person , while LLPs have to have at least two . Not every state recognizes PLLCs either , so if you are thinking about expanding , keep that in mind . <p> An accountant can also form Professional Corporations , but these are heavily regulated .

On the other hand , automated calculators , though plentiful and easily accessible , do not generate accurate values for an online business and should be avoided . <p> The Good : Marketing Automation There are certain technological inventions and innovations that appear throughout history and change everything . The printing press , the assembly line and alternative energy are just a few . But the internet has been perhaps the most transformative technology the internet has ever seen . Take for example the world of marketing in which traditional marketing strategies were expensive , time consuming and non-interactive .

It also allows for easier automation that can cut costs almost immediately . For example , Outbound is a piece of software that automates emails by tracking visitor activity on your website and emailing them pre-programmed emails based on what they do or do n't do . Say they start onboarding but do n't complete the process ; Outbound can send them an email automatically with further instructions or incentives for joining . <p> Hootsuite does the same but with social media by automating specific content to be shared on Facebook , tweeted on Twitter or placed elsewhere on social media .

One tempting way to discover what your online value is worth is to use an automated calculator , but this is never a good idea . Automated calculators will likely give you a value , but these calculators never generate the same value and they constantly undervalue your asset . More than anything else , they seem to be random number generators rather than actual tools with any utility .

For this reason , many experienced managers find it easy to change industries and still walk into top-level management positions . In fact , having management experience in multiple fields of work makes it easier for these individuals to enter a new field of employment . Understanding the central duties of a manager makes this possible . Therefore , if you want to be a top manager in your field of employment , then here are a few management skills you will need to develop along the way . <h> Know Your Team <p> The key to being an effective manager in any field boils down to having a firm grasp of the people you are managing .

When a manager is dismissive of the concerns raised by their people , this creates unnecessary tension , strife and will often lead to a breakdown in communication that compromises your teams productivity . Taking the time to take note of the concerns being raised by the people you manage will not only give you insight into the big picture , but it will also build your teams confidence in your competence as a manager .

If necessary , a top manager will expand their insights by pursuing the necessary education to make certain they will have genuine insight into how their given function within the industry they operate in is supposed to be executed . Consequently , receiving a masters in engineering management online , for example , will be just the ticket to helping you advance your management knowledge and skill in a field like engineering . <h> Conflict Resolution <p> No matter what company you work for , a top manager will always run into conflict somewhere along the way . As a top manager , you must be ready to be the foremost responsible adult in the situation , identify the parties in conflict and bring order to chaos before it has the opportunity to get out of hand .

This will give you the leverage to quickly eliminate any extraneous activities that produce unnecessary conflict within your teams members . <p> While there are many fields in which you can work , a top manager is someone who stands as a pillar of their department . From having good listening skills to developing the expertise to competently lead your team to success , your role as a top manager is to make sure your team is operating like a well-oiled machine . When you achieve these fundamental skills as a manager , then being a top manager in any field of work is a simple matter of carrying over the highly successful management skills you have learned and applying them to any industry in which you seek to be employed . <p> Kara Masterson is a freelance writer from Utah .

Today our guest poster Felicia Baratz discusses how businesses can enhance and build up their company relationships , no matter how different the dynamics may be . <p> Of the many struggles workers have with their jobs , Interdepartmental communication remains one of the major complaints expressed . For example , your billing department needs to talk with other departments to verify invoice information and pricing options on a regular basis . Without strong and consistent communication , you wo n't know about special arrangements made by the advertising department or fee waivers offered by the sales team . You can not accurately do your job without active communication between departments . <p> While interdepartmental contact remains an essential component of any company , it gets difficult to manage between different business dynamics but there are ways to enhance and build up company relationships that lead to the success of the business . <p> Schedule All-Hands Meetings <p> Sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide bits and pieces of information between departments , but subsisting off of this alone is not enough .

When departments work and communicate well together , - interdepartmental relationships stay strong . <p> Use File Sharing <p> As part of the assembly line technique , file sharing enables everyone to stay on the same page . As each department accesses files associated with the current project , communication improves . You can make changes or discuss issues before mistakes cost the company money . Additionally , file sharing prevents wasting time ; since the document is updated the instant one team member makes a change .

In the report , Churchill and Lewis claim that understanding the current progression of a business facilitates logical and effective strategizing . Although it 's now over 30 years old , this definitive article is often referenced today as a useful framework for defining and managing Small Medium Enterprise ( SME ) growth . Every business is unique and will therefore face different challenges ; however there are many typical stages which largely relate to the vast majority of SME 's . The comprehension of this structure can prove to be beneficial to business owners , allowing them to calculate both risk and sensible investment . <p> 1 ) - Existence <p> The vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its owner , although there may be one or two employees on a small staff helping out . It is imperative at this stage to gain and maintain a customer base , as many companies fail before they even have a tangible revenue stream . It is likely that there will be some start-up capital in place , but this can quickly run out . Many businesses also invest in the foundations of a long term strategy , before they have taken their first steps , which can be ultimately fatal . For example , I have seen a few small freight/shipping start-ups who invest in IT systems , resources and staff before they even have a client base to justify their outlay . <p> 2 ) - Survival <p> The primary motivation at this stage is simple ; survival at any cost . Survival equates to growth . The realization of the product or service , as originally intended , is vital at this stage . In order to grow , rather than merely sustain , the company must develop a service which differentiates itself from its competitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some success , risk and ambition will play a much more prominent role in the decision making process of what to do next . The company is now established , so there is the possibility of continued operation with only little investment . However , this can result in a loss of growth which will lead to profits plateauing . Many businesses remain at this stage , as there will be a sufficient revenue stream to operate comfortably . Although this may not satisfy the ambitions of the owner , who has two options at this stage : to separate themselves from the business to pursue other opportunities , or take advantage of the company 's recent success to keep driving in more growth . A detailed strategic plan of action , along with the implementation of effective systems , can largely define a businesses ' development . Reviewing the logistical operation of your business , departmental efficiency and IT systems is key . <p> 4 ) - Take-off <p> Rapid growth is key to this stage , but it 's a difficult thing to achieve while considering long-term sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside investor or carefully calculated debt . Risk is now on a larger scale since the company has proved to be successful . If the company has gone public and sought outside investment , then this might result in a relinquishment of control in certain areas . The owner must have competent and motivated managers in place , as the company will have far outgrown the ability to be run by a single person alone . However , this in turn means that the owner 's delegation skills now take on an even greater significance to ensure that all divisions of the company are performing well and are being led by strong leaders . <p> 5 ) - Resource Maturity <p> Spiralling growth can result in spiralling profits ; but it can result in new problems arising . The company will now have a certain amount of power within the market sector , which may be in the form of buying power or resources that can really drive profits . Many companies also stagnate at this level . Their size can lead to a negation of innovative thinking , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter this , the company may need to look for new revenue streams which can easily happen when they diversify their services . Ensuring that the company , as opposed to competitors , take advantage of market changes is vital . A continuation of growth enables long-term establishment within the market . <p> Compiling a general framework for small business growth might seem like an ineffective task , particularly given the unique nature of each individual business . However , I feel that elements of this structure can be applied to the majority of small businesses . Determining the stage of your business , planning development , and asking others that have had similar experiences can be hugely beneficial to SMEs . <p> Matt Everard is the Managing Director of Barrington Freight , a team of freight professionals with decades of experience in the shipping industry .

It 's certainly a bad idea for individuals and households to go heavily into debt , but borrowing is a vital tool for a growing business . So when is business debt advantageous , and how can you manage it most effectively ? <p> Sometimes it 's between business debt or equity . <p> If you wish to raise substantial funds , there 's a clear alternative to business debt , but it 's not a very attractive one . Instead of borrowing to power business growth , you can approach investors and sell them an equity stake . You will not have to account for any repayments , or pay any interest , but at the same time will dilute your stake in the company " which could prove hugely expensive if it becomes a runaway success . Further , you will have another stakeholder in the firm , who may have a different view of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future plans . <p> Funding growth through your cash flow can be slow and unpredictable . <p> Another way to fund growth without getting into business debt is via your cashflow . In simple terms , this means reinvesting any surplus cash after you have paid your staff and your bills . It 's an extremely reliable way of financing expansion , and once again avoids borrowing , but unless your cashflow is exceptionally positive can prove unreliable and frustratingly slow . <p> How business debt can make the difference : <p> However ambitious you are and however visionary your business plan , it can be virtually impossible to achieve swift , sustainable growth without a significant amount of cash on hand . By choosing to take on business debt , you can ensure you have the money you need to buy new equipment , hire new employees , move to new premises or serve new customers , who will require delivery of your product or service before they pay you . <p> In particular , business debt can be very advantageous for businesses operating in markets with significant economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy in bulk , you can cut your unit cost and make your prices more competitive " or alternatively increase your profit margin . <p> Finally , there are times when a borrowing facility is literally a lifesaver . A few late-paying clients can seriously damage your cashflow , and without being able to take on temporary business debt you may find yourself insolvent and potentially out of business . <p> When business debt can be damaging : <p> However , business debt can be dangerous too , and excessive borrowing has seen many businesses go to the wall . This can especially be the case for businesses that are growing fast " there 's a huge temptation to over-commit and take risks in order to fund new premises , plant and people , and if speculation does n't pay off or new customers do n't pay quickly the result can be disaster . <p> It 's also important to think long-term , as business debt could entail a financial commitment lasting a number of years . We are currently enjoying an unprecedented period of very low interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , significantly impacting the finances of businesses whose borrowings are subject to a variable rate . <p> You can also expect all borrowing to be expensive if your business represents a high risk . This can easily occur through no fault of your own , as some sectors are traditionally riskier than others , but if your firm has a poor credit history you are virtually guaranteed high rates of interest . It is also possible that you will be required to provide a personal guarantee- for the loan , meaning that if the business defaults you become personally liable for the business debt " up to and including your home . <p> Finally , even if you can afford to repay your loans , business debt can impact your cash flow for years to come . In other words , ensuring you have the cash you need now can prevent you from having cash on hand when you need it in the future . <p> So should you borrow or not ? <p> There 's no easy answer to this question : it depends entirely on your circumstances at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business forward without losing equity , but if you overreach yourself it can have serious consequences in the future .

While this type of fraud is usually unintentional , it can still harm a business 's bottom line . <p> Unless business owners are setting out with the intention of robbing the consumer , this type of fraud is usually caused by merchant errors and oversights . <p> Examples of merchant errors that are considered fraud include : Charging a card more than once for the same transaction Charging a transaction amount that differs from what the consumer agreed to Failing to issue credits and cancellations in a timely fashion Insufficiently describing the merchandise or services Not fully disclosing the policies and terms of service Merchants might think themselves blameless , but their actions cause more damage than they 're aware . Between 20% and 40% of an average merchant 's chargebacks are attributed to merchant error . <p> Threat #3 : Fraud Committed by Consumers <p> By far , the greatest risk businesses are exposed to comes from their very own customers . <p> Consumers are stealing from merchants , engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After participating in the purchase and authorizing the transaction , consumers turn around and dispute the validity of the credit card charge . <p> These fraudulent consumers will use any means necessary to file illegitimate chargebacks with the bank .

@@74693999 @3393999/ <h> The 5 Essential Elements of a Home Office <p> Is the corporate office a thing of the past ? For many modern workers , the answer is yes . Perhaps the most lifestyle-changing thing the internet has given us is the ability to work from home . More and more companies are employing telecommuters , which helps save with various overhead costs . Entrepreneurs , too , are choosing to work from their home offices rather than traditional cubicles . <p> For the past five and a half years I 've worked from home , and during that time I 've learned many lessons . But the one lesson that stands out above the rest : You need an organized and comfortable office , with the following five items that will make your home work life a whole lot easier . <p> 1 . Dual monitors <p> Your computer is your most valuable work tool . Without it telecommuting would n't be possible . Since you 're using it so heavily , you want to get the absolute most out of it . Adding a second monitor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space to spread out and organize yourself . Dual monitors also allow you to keep tabs on multiple items at once , so you do n't have to continually shuffle through them with a task manager . <p> The dual monitor solution is n't only for desktops . In fact , using a second monitor with a laptop will give you more screen real estate , much like a desktop , while still affording you the portability you need . <p> 2 . Spacious desk with drawers <p> If you 're going to store two monitors on your desk , chances are you 're going to need a larger than average desk to hold them on . What works best for me is a drafting table . They have plenty of surface room , and you can make all kinds of adjustments to them . <p> The only problem is that drafting tables do not contain drawers , which are essential for organizing and storing everyday items . You can , however , purchase stackable drawers and shelves to help you stay organized while using a drafting table . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of your day sitting down in a chair so it needs to be supportive and comfortable . If you buy a chair just because its cheap and not based off of how it feels , you will suffer all day long . Consider your office chair an investment in your productivity . You should look for a chair that has ample cushioning on the seat , a straight back for proper posture , and an adjustable height ( especially in the case of drafting tables ) . Arm rests are optional based on your preferences , but I have found that they get in the way more often than they add comfort . <p> 4 . Food and drink <p> Keeping drinks and your lunch within your office gives it the feel of a traditional office , and leads to greater productivity . Again , this comes from personal experience . I find work goes much better when I prepare my lunch ahead of time and store it in a mini fridge . We also installed a water purification system in our home , so I can get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . It saves time and allows me to focus on work , not food and drink . <p> 5 . A filing system <p> Paper files cant just be shoved into drawers . It gets too messy , and you 'll have a hard time locating documents when you need them . You do n't  need a big fancy ( and expensive ) filing cabinet though . You can simply get a file crate with hanging folders . Label them A-Z and file things in a way that you 'll find them easily . For instance , I file tax information under T , invoices under I , and credit card statements under C. <p> Do n't forget the files on your computer as well . Creating an organized filing system is key to finding things when you need them . While both Windows and Mac feature search options , if you do n't label your files properly you 'll have difficulty finding them .

To ensure that your business stays as financially lean as possible , take the following six tips into account when creating and establishing your company budget . <p> Cut Your Staffing Costs <p> Make sure that you retain the smallest staffing commitment needed to deliver on your business model . Taking on full-time staff is a serious financial and managerial decision , and commits you to paying salary even in periods when cash flow is poor . And while you can get away without paying yourself for a month , it is illegal to withhold salary from your staff .

Finding skilled and enthusiastic interns can be even better , as you can provide valuable work experience in return for their efforts . <p> Reduce Your Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to store inventory or house equipment . Offering telecommuting options with your staff is worth considering as well .

Some of the most reputable companies in the world , such as Sears and Citibank , now operate largely on telecommuting , and there is no reason that a small business should not follow suit . <p> Track Your Finances <p> It 's very difficult to reduce your overhead costs if you do n't  know what you are spending your money on and when you 're spending it . Choosing to work with an accountant not only enables you to maximize your tax savings and reduce the amount of money you pay out to the government , but can also ensure that you keep better track of your spending throughout the rest of the year .

You should also investigate the possibility of investing in order to make long-term savings , for example going green with technology such as solar panelling , the excess energy from which can often be sold back to energy companies . <p> Shop Online <p> Price comparison websites are not the only way in which the rise of e-commerce has helped to reduce your business overheads .

@@74694011 @3394011/ <h> Experts Weigh In : End of the Year Business Tips for 2013 <p> Here at MyCorporation , were busy prepping for the end of the year and looking forward to what 2014 will bring for small businesses and entrepreneurs . But while our prep involves helping to file delayed filings or incorporating or forming LLCs for small businesses , were curious to see how other companies are closing out 2013 . Today , we have 24 small business professionals giving us a look at what they 're working on for their brands and their biggest business tips on how to close out the end of the year ! <p> 1 . " Make a resolution to focus on one social media platform . Social media- is not going away and its time for small business to step up . " <p> 2 . " We are making sure all inventory is in stock and organized , all marketing materials ready to go and short lead press releases being sent to appropriate parties . We look forward to a successful holiday season ! " <p> 3 . " At year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested to hire us- during the year but did n't  . Many times companies find " use it or lose it- funds " on the books at the end of the year and if you hit the timing right , - they may just reopen the conversation where you left off before and have you- invoice them in December to get the found money off the books . Then you- can start the new year strong with motivated clients who will return your- calls fast since they have already paid you ! " <p> 4 . " Owners with lots of income in 2013 ( in the higher tax bracket ) should try to pull in expenses from 2014 by negotiating a discount from their vendors get the discount AND the tax savings . Put it on a short term cheap line of credit or 0% teaser credit card . If you have a low income and tax bracket in 2013 , business owners should try to pull in revenue by offering a deal to their customers to pay next year early and their customers get the tax savings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 . " What are your marketing plans for next year ? How about personal development plans ? In what areas are you or your business deficient in , and what will you do to gain those skills or excel in those areas ? My top performing clients have almost all already made big plans for 2014 . Do n't  fly by the seat of your pants , pilot the airplane ! " <p> 6 . " Be like David Letterman . Make a top 10 list for your business . Top 10 Things You Did Right , and Top 10 That Failed . Do it quickly and rattle off- the answers . You will be surprised how quickly this reviews your business- from the year and culls out what you do not want to carry into the next- year . " <p> 8 . " For some outdoor industry- businesses the winter months are the slow season where the rush of the- season gives way to the slower pace of the off season . For other merchants , - Thanksgiving through Christmas is the cash cow and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution against " resting " too much after the- season ends . It is tempting to say " I have earned a few weeks of down time " - but do n't  let it drag on too long . Use this slow time to plan your strategy- for the upcoming year . It is said that battles are won in the preparation- and when it comes to business a successful year fully depends upon the efforts we are- willing to make during our off seasons . " <p> 9 . " Take advantage of the sales momentum in the market . Whether or not you think your business has some degree of seasonality , nearly all businesses are affected by the end of the year sales boom . Consumer are in a holiday shopping mood and more open to opening their pocketbooks as a result , its imperative for a business take advantage of this consumer optimism. - Whether or not a business has a holiday specific sales drive , any company must somehow find a way to join the fray . Whether this means simply decorating for holidays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday specific sales drive , complete with special promotions , there are always ways to join the trend . " <p> 10 . " An interesting subject as we start the 4th Quarter might be a discussion about the conversation financial advisers and/or business owners should be having with CPAs and other tax advisers about how they can help their small business owner and affluent clients minimize and/or eliminate taxes. - As more and more small business owners and affluent clients turn to and trust their CPA for financial decisions , its becoming critical that financial advisers help the CPA address these issues . Its in the clients best interest that their adviser help them with these critical issues , and if the tax adviser is not well-versed or experienced in anything besides their core services of tax prep or financial statements , the client loses out . " <p> Kevin Stockton , Legacy Financial <p> 11 . " Go paperless . At the end of the year last year we implemented a document management system . It has vastly improved our ability to file and retrieve our reams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 . " Make sure your marketing efforts are showing a return on investment. - Tracking leads , sales , and developments from all marketing efforts will help these small businesses understand which approaches are working and which are not . This will also help them plan for the coming year and strategize according to the results and ROI they have seen for this past year , all providing invaluable knowledge on the path towards growth . " <p> 13 . " My favorite year end tip is for new business start-ups . Small businesses often forget that any expenses that are incurred before the first sale are called start-up costs. These costs can not be deducted until the business has their first sale . Then they are deducted over 15 years and you can elect to deduct the first $5,000 in the first year of business . Careful tax planning is needed in this area and many times it is in the taxpayers best interest to start the business sooner than later ( in 2013 ) . Many small businesses assume they can deduct all of their costs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tax laws for that deduction . " <p> 14 . " From a general perspective , I think many businesses make the mistake of winding down/almost writing off the month of December as a slow month. We pointedly make an extra effort and treat December just like any other month . In the same vein , we have our business New Year Resolutions session at the beginning of Q4 ( October ) and start executing immediately . Thinking about new initiatives in January usually means that most of Q1 has passed by before there is any traction . " <p> 15 . " Make sure you 're spending your time not only cultivating dollars , but relationships . Do n't  stay isolated in social media and stagnant in your clientele . Get out , mingle , meet other local business owners and start the process . Do n't  wait till you need someone to want to return your phone call . " <p> The Bizzy Biz <p> 16 . " Say thank you to your community and network ! - Authentically staying in touch with your community can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your community to share the progress- you have made this year . This will let your clients see more from behind the- curtain and engage them a bit more than a typical blog post might . Also , highlight- some of your clients successes and publicly congratulate them. - For your business network , write a more personal , semi-individual email- that includes one custom paragraph about the person to whom you are writing- and what theyve accomplished this year . In the body of the email thank- them for their support and share some of the progress you have made this- year . " <p> 17 . " My best tip for other small business owners is to focus and work on the business , rather than working in the business . Let employees do the day to day tasks , the business owner is the visionary who should guide the strategic decisions . " <p> 18 . " Out with the old , in with the new , right ? Our end of the year tip is all- about overhaul . This is the year that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence with a newly redone website and improved- social media presence. - Take out stale web content and- replace it with cutting edge material . Even if you just rephrase your- service offerings and biographies , a new spin can entice your clients , both- preexisting and future . " <p> 19 . " My best tip for small business owners is to do everything with- excellence . Be the best business owner you can be by providing exceptional- customer service . This will help you transition from a small business owner- to a business owner . " <p> 20 . " I think the end of the year is a good time to start fresh with new goals- and business tasks , such as re-creating your website if needed and reaching- out to new contacts that you 've been meaning to get in touch with to form- new meaningful business relationships . Think of New Years Resolutions that- you can complete now so that your business can be more successful in 2014. - That way when January rolls around you can watch your business soar to new- heights ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use this time to review our prior year- results and begin planning for the upcoming year . Our goal is to hit the- ground running come January 1st using the strategic planning we had- developed over the prior few months . Waiting until the new year to implement new ideas leaves us behind the curve . " <p> 22 . " Year end is a series of looking at the year in review , by month , by promotions , by sales , by expenses , and by goals. - Its the time to set monthly goals , expenses and budgets , sales , and promotions for next year . " <p> 23 . " Start making your New Years resolutions for the New Year at the- beginning of the 4th quarter the prior year . Itll give you more time to- think them through AND you 'll have some time to start prepping for them . The extra time will make you more committed to carrying them out ! " <p> 24 . " Have a good vision statement- prepared . A vision statement will serve as a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming months and years . At the end of the year , - see if you can check some items off . If not , you know what you 'll be working- on when the New Year rolls around . " 34788 @qwx654788

It 's like a rite of passage . You go to the vending machine to get your chocolate fix and buy a bag of Raisinets . You put your money in the machine but your candy gets stuck on its way out . <p> You 're bummed out . You were n't expecting this to happen . You 're faced with the decision of putting more money in the machine to get what you want " or calling some number to complain , ( do they ever answer ? ) knowing you will never get your money back . <p> Doesnt- it stink when you spend money and you do n't get what you pay for ? Or you have to pony up more money when you thought you- wouldnt- have to ? Especially if it 's for your business ! <p> First off , when you spend money in your business , think of it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . That way you will be in the mindset of getting a return on your money , which is really what you are paying for . <p> Let 's pretend you are considering hiring a marketing consultant to redo your whole brand . Here are 5 things you can do as a business owner to make sure you get what you set out to get in the first place . <p> Is the fee a one-time fee or will you pay as you go ? How much time does the fee cover ? One week , six months , 20 years or as long as it takes to get what you want ? It 's important to be really clear about the length of the engagement . That way , there will be no surprises . <p> Does the fee cover advice and implementation ? Sometimes you will get advice to do something , and then you will have to go implement the advice and pay again . For example , your marketing person may advise you to create a company brochure . But what if the fee did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to pay again . Total stinker . You would n't even get your Raisinets . <p> Rounds of edits . Most marketing plans include 2 or 3 rounds of edits . Find out the pricing for each additional round ( the 3rd or 4th ) . Use your edits wisely so you do n't have to spend extra money . <p> Communication updates . So many marketing people are highly creative and have amazing ideas . But occasionally they seem to fall off the face of earth and are nowhere to be found . Make sure your marketing person gives you weekly status updates , so you can track your progress . It 's the worst feeling in the world to pay for marketing , and get no status updates ! Try paying as you go for marketing help . That way the marketing person has skin in the game and will need to show up . <p> The scope of the project . You need to be clear on what you are specifically paying for . For example , if you are paying for a website design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it turns out that you need a Facebook business page , that will be more money . Just make a list of what you are paying for , so you can get what you pay for and stay on track . Wait a minute " do n't make a list . Ask your marketing person to give you a proposal and an outline of what you will get . <p> There you have it . No more marketing money getting stuck in the vending machine .

But even if you find a great firm with excellent contacts , you can not expect them to do all the heavy lifting for your companys PR ! Our current firm is wonderful , staffed with some of the nicest and hardest-working people weve ever met , but if we want to get the most for our PR dollar we have to step up our game as well . A good PR firm can get you great coverage , but you can spread the word even further if you take a few steps right from your office . <p> If you got an article published thanks to your PR people , or were featured in a story , do n't  just expect viewers to find it . Tweet it out , post it on Facebook spread awareness ! Taking a few minutes to plug a link that makes you look good is a no brainer , so remember to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> 2 .

Public relations is all about perception you want people to perceive you as an expert in your field , thus making your company look more trustworthy and respectable than your competitorss . <p> One of the easiest ways to ruin that is to fall back on cheap gimmicks . Weve heard about construction companies that would send crowbars with a business card to people they thought had client potential , and all you have to do is turn on the TV and wait for the commercials to see major corporations and local businesses alike trying to sell a product by acting like their customers are morons there 's one business in particular near our office that seems to think screaming their name over and over again will inspire some brand loyalty . <p> Your customers will know what you are up to , and they will probably choose a competitor over you because gimmicks nearly always insult intelligence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business simply for a cheap marketing stunt . If you want to stay in business in the long term , and create repeat clients , avoid these types of stunts at all costs . <p> 3 . Ask for criticism , not praise <p> You should be personally talking to your PR firm at least weekly so you know exactly what they are doing to help your company and to give your final approval on potential projects . But , before you hang up the phone after a meeting and go on your merry way , ask for some criticism . Chances are they will send you an e-mail with a little bit of praise- every time- you send something to them for final submission , but you need to know if they think you could be doing anything differently . Your PR firm will do its best work when the two of you are on the same page , but they may be a little apprehensive about critiquing a client . So open the door to criticism , and make sure to make the changes they recommend ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And , finally , make sure you send a few positive words their way once in a while too .

Also know as The Rice State and The Swamp State , South Carolinas official nickname comes from the state tree , the Sabal Palmetto , which distinguished itself during the revolutionary war . It was a fort made of Palmetto logs that repulsed the British fleet from Sullivans Island back in 1776 ! But South Carolina has a lot more to offer than strategically useful flora . Though it was hit hard by the recession , its strong agricultural heritage , and the states friendly attitude towards business , has really boosted its recovery . So what should South Carolinian entrepreneurs know about their state ? And what does it take to open up a business and incorporate in South Carolina ? <p> Are there any benefits to running a business in South Carolina ? Plenty ! South Carolina is actually one of the most business-friendly states in the USA . Thumbtack gave the state an A- in overall friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all states . It also makes sense to incorporate in South Carolina as the state boasts a low , 5% flat corporate income tax rate . Of course , South Carolina does all it can to help small businesses within the state . The South Carolinian Secretary of States office maintains a Small Business One-Stop Site- to help new entrepreneurs find and file for everything they need to get their business up and running , and the Department of Commerce is proud to offer multiple growth incentives to businesses with the state . <p> What do you need to do to start a business in South Carolina ? <p> Like all states , the first thing you 'll need to do business in South Carolina is a Doing Business As name . Anyone selling a product or service using a name other than their own is required to file a DBA name with the state . Depending on what your company does , you may also have to apply for a general business license , or a retail license , and you definitely have to register to pay South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants , insurance companies , and renovators- have to apply for a specialized business permit before opening up their doors . <p> How do you form an LLC or incorporate in South Carolina ?

All LLCs have to distinguish themselves as such by including Limited Liability Company , Limited Company , or an abbreviation of one of those two designators in their name . LLCs also need a registered agent and a physical address in the state . Once all of that is taken care you , you fill out your Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State and pay a fee . <p> Incorporating in South Carolina is a very similar process . You still need a designator in your corporations name , like Incorporated , or Inc. , as well as a registered agent and a physical street address .

Last week we kicked off the posts with a look at how to get started in accounting and this week . were exploring agriculture and the wide world of food operations , farming , and CSA ( community supported agriculture ) groups in it ! <p> What do you need to go into the agricultural industry ? <p> Every business is run a little differently than the next , but if you plan on making and/or selling food to the public you must have a food license . This license ensures that the food you 're growing , selling , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without this type of license in place , your business could face serious consequences . Additional licenses to know about include the retail food license ( for businesses selling food directly to the customer ) and a food processing plant license ( for wholesale use , meaning you can sell not only to the customer but to major grocery store chains and online ) . There are several rules in place for anyone in food operations to keep in mind before they can receive their license so be sure you meet all the requirements and personnel standards . <p> Outside of the food license , you 'll also need to apply for local/state business and operating licenses , get a DBA name in place if you plan to do business under a different name from your own , an EIN number if you want to hire anyone to help ( which you probably will want to do since working in agriculture is tough to handle alone ! ) , and a thorough five year business plan in place with a SWOT analysis in place for everything from the land to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entity should someone going into food operations form ? <p> Its very difficult to work in food as a solopreneur , so the most popular entity of choice here tends to be a general partnership or limited partnership . This is an especially ideal pick for anyone looking to make this kind of work as part of the family business . Partnerships allow two or more people to conduct business together and share the profits accordingly . Within a general partnership , this does n't  have to mean sharing with another person either , but rather , you may share with another entity like a corporation or LLC . Limited partnerships , on the other hand , mean there 's a general partner who controls business operations , and a limited partner who does n't  get to be as involved in the day-to-day as the general partner is , but does have a liability shield in place for any debts or claims made . <p> How healthy is the industry ? <p> Robust as ever , with a reported 3.2 farm operators working in the United States alone and 2.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% from 2007 !

@@74694049 @3394049/ <h> The 4 Benefits of Drop Shipping For an Online Store <p> Drop shipping is one of the many strategies that you can use to fulfill orders for an online store . It is a relatively simple strategy , but it has some real benefits to it . One of the biggest benefits is that you do n't have to keep nearly as much material in inventory which is extremely helpful as many online storefronts are run by one or two people out of their home . Their garage or a shed probably serves as their inventory space . This means that they may not have enough room to hold many items in stock , but drop shipping can eliminate that hindrance and make keeping inventory stocked much easier as well as provide the additional benefits to the home-based business . <p> Get to Market Fast <p> As Practical Ecommerce points out , having a drop shipping arrangement is a great way to make certain that you can get products to market faster . This is because you do n't have to wait for the items to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gamble on how many of those items you need to hold in stock to keep customers satisfied . You simply send the order to the manufacturer or a different warehouse and they 'll send the article out for you , with no risk involved . <p> Keep the Investment Low <p> Everybody in retail knows that inventory is the equivalent of loss . The same article points out the fact that drop shipping is a great way to reduce the amount of money you need to invest . If somebody is drop shipping items for you , they are taking the risk in owning those items , keeping them warehoused and so forth . All you have to do is market them and get people to buy which is a great way to make sure that you maximize your profit on every item . <p> Practical Growth Strategy <p> Online Business points out that many of the benefits of drop shipping are extremely practical all around when it comes to growing your business . If your online store grows to its maximum level , dictated by the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warehousing you can realistically handle , you may find yourself at something of an impasse as to how you keep the business afloat . <p> With drop shipping , when you want to add a product , there usually are n't any logistics involved with it . As long as the warehouse handles fulfilling the order for you , all you have to do is add an image and a description to your e-commerce establishment and make it available for purchase . That 's it " there 's nothing else to it ! Most of the time , businesses that wanted to expand would have to think about where they were going to store those items and that may actually make it completely impossible for them to add an item to their inventory . <p> No Special Storage <p> Depending upon what you sell , there may be special storage requirements .

@@74694051 @3394051/ <h> Canada Incorporation - Differences <p> Before comparing the choices between federal or provincial corporation , a non-Canadian business must consider if it wishes to conduct business in Canada as a subsidiary or a branch . If your business intends to conduct business only in Canada , then proceed to the discussion of whether to incorporate federally or provincially . <h> Subsidiary or Branch ? <p> This question is only relevant if your Canadian business is an extension of your non-Canadian corporation . If your business is only in Canada , then proceed to the next section <p> As an extension to your business , you must decide whether your Canadian business will be a subsidiary or a branch . In general , a subsidiary is considered a separate entity which limits liability to only the subsidiary corporation , whereas a branch remains a part of the parent corporation , meaning liability is extended to the parent corporation . The drawback of a subsidiary is that as a separate entity , the finances of the subsidiary are separate from its parent thus preventing the parent corporation from absorbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . <p> A subsidiary requires a Canadian incorporation . A branch , on the other hand , does not . However , with any business , a branch must register its business with a province and obtain the necessary permits / licenses to conduct business ( please refer to the provincial governments for the specific forms and procedures for your business ) . If your business decides to become a subsidiary , then there may be other concerns to consider ( see below ) . <h> Federal or Provincial ? <p> Unlike the United States , Canadian corporations have the opportunity to be incorporated at the federal level . As with any business choice , there are pros and cons to deciding to incorporate federally . Although each business will have its own set of benefits and detriments to incorporating federally , below are the main concerns about incorporating either federally or provincially . <h> Corporate Name <p> Similar to the United States , the corporate name of the business must be dissimilar to another existing corporate name . On the provincial level , the corporate name must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due to the limited pool of corporate names , the approval period remains short and a potential corporation has a greater probability that its corporate name will be approved . Although the name may be approved within a province , this approval does not extend to other provinces , and so the corporate name may not be used in another province that has a similar corporate name registered within that province . However , under federal incorporation , an approved corporate name can be used throughout the nation without any further checks or approval . The process for approval of a corporate name will take longer under federal incorporation and so if time is of the essence , then federal incorporation may not be a good choice . Also , although federal incorporation allows the corporate name to be used throughout the nation , federal incorporation does not necessarily protect the name from being used by provincial corporations . Technically , a province can register a corporate name that may be similar to a federal corporation . In order to completely protect the name of a corporation ( whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Board of Directors <p> Federal incorporation requires that 25 percent of the board of directors to be composed of " Canadian residents " ( if less than four board members , then at least one director must be a " Canadian resident " ) . Provinces have differing board of directors ' residency requirements . Some provinces ( e.g. , British Columbia , Prince Edward Island ) have no residency requirements whereas other provinces ( e.g. , Ontario , Alberta ) require 25 percent of the board of directors to be composed of " Canadian residents " ( if less than four board members , then at least one director must be a " Canadian resident " ) . Whether or not a corporation will have a Canadian resident as a director may help determine whether to incorporate federally or provincially . <h> Shareholders Rights <p> Shareholder rights are generally uniform throughout Canada , but there are some differences between federal corporation laws and provincial corporation laws . Some difference include squeeze-out transactions ( i.e. federal corporation law allows squeeze-outs , Ontario law remains silent on squeeze-outs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether public or not , to solicit proxies if it has more than 50 shareholders ; Ontario has no mandate ) . A potential corporation may want to consult a lawyer familiar with Canadian corporation law if shareholder rights are a major concern . <h> Legal Concerns ( Quebec ) <p> Beyond these main concerns , there are legal / logistical concerns unique to Canada . Although corporation law throughout Canada is similar to one another , Quebec presents certain logistical difficulty that may help deter potential corporations from registering in Quebec . Quebec remains immersed in its tradition and is the only province that has French as its official language which means all official documents must be in French . Also , Quebec is the only province that bases its law on the Napoleonic Codes ( civil law ) and not on the common law tradition of the federal Canadian government and other provinces ( and the United States ) . As mentioned above , the laws may be similar , but due to the different legal systems , procedural issues can become complicated . <h> Conclusion <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process in the United States . Although a business has the option of incorporating federally , most businesses are better suited incorporating provincially . Unless there is a high likelihood of doing business nationwide , the simplicity and speed of incorporating provincially is more desirable .

While vacation days and fringe benefits ( health insurance , stock options , employee discounts , et al ) are appealing lures , the heart of the employee experience occurs during business hours , as staff members interact with each other . <p> Good communication is square one for employers seeking to reinforce relationships with workers and it creeps in to every aspect of business operations . In many cases , communication mechanisms fall short on the job , leaving room for most companies to improve their standards and reduce the communication gap with employees . <p> Credibility and Communication <p> Credibility is an important area to focus on when it comes to influencing effective communication between employees and their superiors . When executed correctly , communication with workers reinforces trustworthiness for managers and other high-level employees . But if there is a deep communication gap between bosses and staff members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At its core , communication with employees is just sharing information , but it is also layered with influencing how employees perform .

@@74694065 @3394065/ <h> Corporation vs . LLC - Governance <p> Corporations and Limited Liability Companies are governed very differently . In fact , corporate governance has a reputation of being laden down by rules and restrictions , and corporate directors are thought to have to really work to keep the business in good standing with the state . Limited liability companies , on the other hand , are seen as being a lot easier to run - in fact , one of the main factors fueling the structure 's popularity seems to be how few governance requirements an LLC 's managing members have to deal with . However the truth is a bit more nuanced , and corporate governance may not be as difficult as people have been led to believe . <h> Corporate Governance <p> Google ' corporate governance ' and you 'll be swamped with results on the different documents you supposedly need to run a corporation . And , if your corporation becomes a multi-national behemoth , you very well may want to draft these documents . Running a small corporation , however , only requires a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate of incorporation , which will detail basic information on your business , like its address , its name , the name and address of its registered agent , and the corporation 's stock information . Many states have adopted a ' fill-in-the-blank ' template that they host on their website , so visit your state 's secretary of state or department of corporations and look around . Now , you can add special provisions onto your articles of incorporation if you wish , but at this stage doing that may not be the best idea . Most small businesses do just fine with the minimum requirements . <p> After you file your articles of incorporation , you will need to hold an initial meeting to elect corporate officers and adopt corporate bylaws - rules adopted and used to define certain functions of the corporation , like what corporate officers do , how meetings are called , and how shares will be issued and transferred . Again , most states have a template that you can use to get started and , as time goes on , you can amend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an annual meeting for the directors , and an annual meeting for the shareholders . The director 's meeting will be mainly concerned with agreeing on important business decisions and creating a plan to guide the business . The shareholder meeting must be announced in advance , and will be used to update everyone on how the business is doing and , if needed , hold elections . And , for every one of these meetings , someone will need to record the minutes . That does n't mean recording every , single detail - only items of substance , like when and where the meeting was , how many people attended , the agenda items , and a breakdown of the votes , should be recorded . Finally , nearly every state requires corporations to file a report , usually on an annual basis , with the same information that was given in the articles of incorporation , and to pay a fee . <h> Limited Liability Company Governance <p> The governance requirements placed on limited liability companies are comparatively light . Really , an LLC only needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLCs file this certificate with the state when they are formed and , like the articles of incorporation , it has to list some basic information on the LLC ; its name , address , registered agent information , purpose for formation , and whether it will be managed by one person , or by multiple people . LLCs usually also have to file an annual report , which lists the same information . And , really , that 's about it , unless you want to have an operating agreement in place . <p> An operating agreement is not required , but it is highly recommended , especially if the LLC will be run by multiple people . Like corporate bylaws , an operating agreement lists out the rules that direct how the LLC will be run . So the function of the managing members , how meetings will be called , tax and financial provisions , the allocations of profits , and the manner in which an LLC can be dissolved will all be laid out in the operating agreement . Basically , any governance requirements that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited liability company will be set by the operating agreement . <p> After reading the requirements placed on both structures , it may seem as though a limited liability company is much easier to run than a corporation . And , in some cases , it is . But a smaller corporation is actually fairly easy to govern , even with all of the requirements . Most meetings and filings only have to take place on an annual basis , and there is no reason these meetings have to stuffy affairs . Of course , if you just do n't want to deal with those requirements , you can file an LLC instead - just make sure you seriously consider drafting an operating agreement , just to codify how the LLC will be run . On occasion a lack of structure can be more infuriating than too much regulation .

@@74694067 @3394067/ <h> What 501(c) is right for your business ? <p> When people mention tax-exempt organizations , they are typically referring to 501(c)3 exempt groups . 501(c)3s are , by a large margin , the most popular type of tax-exempt entity . 74% of all 501(c)s are 501(c)3 - a qualification reserved for corporations and foundations that are religious , educational , charitable , or scientific in nature . Donations to 501(c)3 groups are tax deductible , and 501(c)3s are largely prohibited from becoming involved in politics . However , what few people realize is that there are actually 28 other types of organizations that can qualify for tax-exempt 501(c) status , though only ( c ) 3 and ( c ) 19 groups allow for tax-deductible donations . If you are thinking about forming your own tax-exempt organization or charity , be sure to look at every other 501(c) exemption . Many of the classifications are a bit obscure , but these five tax-exemption types after 501(c)3 are the most popular and will cover the most groups . <h> 501(c)5 : Labor , Agricultural and Horticultural Organizations <p> Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor , agricultural , and horticultural organizations boast some of the largest gross receipts and assets . Organizations that qualify for 501(c)5 status are tasked with bettering the lives of the laborers and farmers they represent , and as such must work for the mutual interest of all members , rather than in the interest of a select few . There are also some famous , and even some infamous , groups with 501(c)5 exemptions - Unite Here , the UAW , and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters all qualify as 501(c)5 organizations . <h> 501(c)7 : Social and Recreational Clubs <p> Social and Recreational clubs squeak into fourth place by only a few hundred entities . 501(c)7 's are organizations that are created for pleasure or recreation , and thus do not seek out profit . Most of the time , country clubs , college fraternities , and larger university societies seek 501(c)7 exemption . Again , the central purpose of the qualifying club has to be to benefit its members in some way . Since most of these clubs are member-funded , tax-exemption is granted to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social opportunities . <h> 501(c)8 : Fraternal Beneficiary Societies and Associations <p> Fraternal societies and associations that operate under a lodge or chapter system and offer a system of support to their members can qualify for 501(c)8 exemption . These groups are effectively run off of member fees and donations , and in return they provide insurance and other benefits to their members , the most common being sickness , accident , or death benefits . These benefits , however , can only be made available to members and their dependents - otherwise , the group 's tax-exempt status wo n't be recognized . <p> 501(c)6 status can be a bit tricky because the organizations it exempts are made up of profit-generating entities . 501(c)6 organizations are associations , leagues , and boards made up of businesses or business owners that come together to pursue a common interest . That interest , however , can not be profit-based . They have to prove that their purpose is the betterment of a particular trade or their wider community , and must act to further the interests of their members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football leagues as 501(c)6 eligible organizations - the NFL actually has a 501(c)6 exemption ! <p> 501(c)4 is the most popular exemption after 501(c)3 , and is also one of the most controversial exemptions because 501(c)4s can lobby for legislation . Now , 501(c)4s have to work to promote social welfare , but different groups have different ideas as to what sort of rules benefit society . ' Action ' organizations - the corporations and foundations that lobby for the legislation that benefits their wider mission - typically qualify for a 501(c)4 exemption , and do not have to list their donors publicly . However , before 501(c)4s are written off completely , it should pointed out that not all 501(c)4 exempt groups lobby . Volunteer fire stations , rotary clubs , and Kiwanis all qualify for 501(c)4 exemptions , and are largely apolitical . <p> Tax exemption is a touchy subject .

Research all of your options , and speak with an attorney or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you know exactly what type of exemption your group qualifies for , and what the state and federal tax agencies expect from you , running your 501(c) exempt group will be a lot easier .

@@74694074 @3394074/ <h> How to Incorporate Your Business in Another State <p> Sadly , there is no simple answer to this question . While some states offer incentives for businesses to incorporate within their borders , extra fees and paperwork could overshadow those benefits . Below is some information to help you make an educated decision about which state you should form your company in . <h> Where should you incorporate your business ? <p> If you have a physical business , as in an office space or building with employees , and your customers primarily come from the community you are located , then you are probably going to want to simply incorporate in your home state . Whenever a company does business within a single state , it has to register with the state government , which means paying the necessary taxes and filling out paperwork . Of course , if it is worth it , you can incorporate in another state and register as a foreign company in your home state . It really is all a matter of determining how much money and time you stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Remember that you will have to pay fees to conduct business as a foreign entity , so if your business is smaller , it could end up costing you quite a bit of money . The IRS , when tax time comes , also looks to where you do business , not where you are incorporated , and if they feel you are trying to avoid taxes , you could be hit with tax penalties . But a neat part of incorporating is that you are , in fact , creating a legal entity entirely separate from yourself . So that entity can move and live wherever it wants depending on what is best for it . <p> Typically , online businesses choose to incorporate in states that are deemed as " Tax Havens ; " Incorporating in Nevada or forming a business in Delaware are the two most commonly chosen solutions . This is because online businesses do not do business in just one area , and often try to sell to customers in a variety of states . Interstate taxation is limited , which is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a corporation still have to be paid at the rate established by the state in which the company was incorporated within . So incorporating in a state where these taxes are low , or non-existent , makes quite a bite of sense as it saves you money , which is always a good thing . Determine who your target consumer is , and if you will be selling your product to people outside of your incorporation state .

@@74694080 @3394080/ <h> S-Corporation 101 : What you need to know <p> With the tax season upon us , we 'd like to help she 'd some light on tax issues . Every Friday for the next several weeks we will discuss how the following tax considerations apply to different business entities . ( Look for the little piggies ! ) - The considerations are : <p> Pass through of gains <p> Pass through of losses <p> Transfer of assets to the entity , and <p> Transfer of assets from the entity <p> This week we 're going to cover the S-corporation . <p> What is an S-corp ? <p> For starters , an S-corporation starts just like a normal C-corporation . The letters ( S &amp; C ) are designations from subchapters of the IRS code . Most corporations are C corporations . An S corporation is a corporation that has made a special election to be taxed in a certain way . Because of this special treatment , there are additional rules and restrictions on top of the standard corporate law requirements . <p> The requirements unique to an S-Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have only one class of stock <p> Have no more than 100 shareholders <p> Shareholders must : be individuals , estates , or qualified trusts which consent to the election <p> The shareholders must be U.S. citizens <p> If you qualify based on the criteria above , the S-corp could be a good choice for you . These are general rules , and may or may not be applicable to your specific situation . Please consult a licensed advisor before making any decisions based on the following . <p> 1 . Pass through of Gains <p> With an S-corp election an entity can avoid the double taxation found with C-corporations . An S-corp passes gains through to the shareholders . Therefore , any profit of the corporation shows up on the shareholder 's personal income tax return . While the company does n't necessarily have to pay the money out to shareholders , the shareholder is still personally liable for the gains . Gains are distributed pro-rata ; in proportion to a shareholder 's ownership . <p> 2 . Pass through of Losses <p> An S-corp does allow shareholders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also distributed pro-rata . C-corporations are not able to pass losses through to shareholders . However , LLC 's are more flexible with the structure of how losses that are passed through . ( Check back later for more info ! ) <p> 3 . Transfer of assets to the entity <p> In this respect , an S-corp is treated just like a C-corp . Depending on the ownership percentages of the entity , a shareholder may be able to transfer assets to the corporation without triggering a taxable event . Generally , if you own 80% or more of the shares at the time of the transfer then it is not taxable . <p> 4 . Transfer of assets from the entity to shareholders <p> While a transfer of a corporate asset to a shareholder is a taxable event , gains or losses are passed through to that shareholder . This is different from a C-corp which would be taxed twice ( at the corporate and personal level ) . A transfer from an S-corp is only taxed once ; a tax for which the shareholder is responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self employed . In an S-corp , there are two streams of income to employee-owners : wages , and distributions . An owner of an S-corp is automatically deemed an employee and must be paid reasonable wages . Anything beyond reasonable can be taken as a distribution , and not subject to the 15% ( or higher ) employment taxes . This could possibly save a small business owner hundreds or thousands per year . <p> Also , do n't forget that the deadline is quickly approaching for S-corps ! <p> Now is a great time to gather your documents and head for your CPA or Attorney to make a difference before tax day , April 17th !

@@74694081 @3394081/ <h> Business Basics : Reinstating Your Business After Dissolution <p> We have talked a little bit about the different reports- that the state requires corporations and limited liability companies to file , but what happens if you forget to send your annual report in ? Or what if you find that you simply do n't  have the money to pay for- the franchise board tax , or- the filing fees associated with all of that regulatory paperwork ? Well , you may find your business placed in bad standing , branded with a non-compliant mark and , if you do n't  take any action to get back into good standing , your business could be involuntary dissolved . Over the years we have talked to a few business owners who were forced through the dissolution process , and often one of the first questions they ask is how do I reinstate my business after dissolution ? Luckily it is usually a straight-forward process , though it can get a bit expensive . <p> Get all of your ducks in a row ! Step 1 : Figure out why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly why you fell out of compliance an errant annual report , a misplaced notice from the government , a bounced check that was never replaced . However , if you genuinely have no idea why you fell out of compliance , you can contact your states secretary of state , or department of corporations , if your state has one , and simply ask why . Of course , if you do n't  want to deal with the wonderful world of government- bureaucracy , we are always happy to help identify the problem ! <p> Step 2 : Submit reinstatement forms to the state <p> After you figure out why your LLC or Corporation was dissolved , you need to find out what paperwork you need to send in to get back into good standing . If you merely forgot to file your annual report , the only paperwork you 'll probably have to file is the delinquent form and an application for reinstatement . Some states ask for a letter in lieu of the application though , so if/when you talk to your secretary of state , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you need to fill out . <p> Step 3 : Pay all outstanding fees <p> This is probably the worse step of them all , depending on the state you do business in . Some make the reinstatement process pretty cheap for example Montana , if a business fell out of good standing because it failed to file its annual report , simply asks for a $30-35 filing fee for the reinstatement , plus $30 dollars per delinquent annual report . California , on the other hand , will hit you with a $250 penalty on top of any other filing fees . It is a good idea to set aside a few hundred dollars for the reinstatement process no matter what state you are in , just so you know you can cover all of the necessary costs before starting . And , again , the office of your states secretary or its department of corporations should be able to give you a good idea about how much money you will owe . <p> Having your limited liability company or corporation dissolved by the state effectively ends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide , so you really want to - have the business reinstated as soon as possible . Also , if you neglected to pay franchise tax , note that the state will continue to hound you and your business if they feel they are owed money , and penalties will accrue if you do n't  send that money in . It is best , then , to simply bite the bullet , write out the check , and file the paperwork . That way you can focus on running your business and getting everything back up to speed . 34788 @qwx654788

@@74694091 @3394091/ <h> Corporation vs . LLC : Taxes <p> Taxes are unavoidable - as an entrepreneur , you are going to have to pay tax in one form or another , regardless of your business structure . However , your business 's tax burden could affect whether you choose to form a corporation or a limited liability company . Each structure has its own fiscal and legal benefits , but they are liable for different taxes and have different rules governing them . As taxes are an inevitable part of running a business , it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of the differences between how corporations and a limited liability companies are taxed . C-Corporations <h> C-Corporations <p> C-Corporations are your standard , run-of-the-mill corporate structure . When you file your articles of incorporation , the entity that you form will be , by default , a C-Corp . And standard corporations are a great legal structure - they separate your personal finances from the business 's debts , help protect you from lawsuits , and allow you to sell shares to raise investment capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means their personal social security and medicare withholdings are subject to the FICA tax rate of 7.65% - the self-employment rate for these withholdings , on the other hand , is set at 15.3% . Corporations are , however , subject to double taxation . When you form your corporation , you are creating a separate , legal entity , which is capable of earning income . As of writing , the federal government , along with 47 states and the District of Columbia , collect tax on corporate income . Then , on top of that tax , you have to pay personal income taxes on any wages you earn from running this business . There are some federal tax deductions that are only made available to corporations , but taken alone those are usually not enough to make it worth paying taxes twice . Happily , there are some ways for smaller corporations to avoid double taxation - one of the most popular methods is to elect S-Corp status . <h> S-Corporations <p> An S-Corp is a standard corporation that chooses to be taxed according to Subchapter S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essentially , this election allows the corporation to be taxed as a pass-through structure - annual income flows through the corporation , directly to the shareholders , who then go on to pay their income tax . The corporation and its shareholders avoid the issue of double taxation as the entity is basically taxed like a partnership , and they are able to avail of the FICA tax rate . There are , however , a few drawbacks to the S-Corp election . Only smaller corporations are eligible , meaning the corporation can not have more than 100 shareholders , and can only have one class of stock . Standard corporations must also elect to receive S-Corp status by the 15th day of the third month of the tax year , or they will be treated as a C-Corp . Some states also collect tax on S-Corp income - California , for example , charges a 1.5% tax on net income . <h> Limited Liability Companies <p> Limited Liability Companies have n't been around as long as corporations , but now outpace corporate formation by nearly two-to-one , largely thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liability Company is , by default , a pass-through structure which means no extra paperwork or elections are necessary .

If there are multiple members , then the LLC is taxed as a partnership . After the LLC determines its income , losses , deductions , and credits , each member receives a K-1 report , which informs them what portion of those gains and losses are theirs . The members then use that information to fill out their normal 1040 . Members of limited liability companies , however , are subject to the self-employment social security and medicare tax withholding of 15.6% , rather than the FICA rate that corporate directors/executives pay on their compensation .

@@74694103 @3394103/ <h> Getting Started With Business Licenses <p> Business licensing can be tricky since there are so many different types of licensing available . Essentially , a business license is a permit from the local or state government allowing you to do business within the borders of that locality . However , licensing requirements change depending on certain factors , like what city you do business in , the size of your company , and your industry . In fact , some businesses have to apply for and receive multiple permits , certifications , and licenses before they can even open their doors to the public . The first step in the process is figuring out what type of license you need . <h> Do you need a business license ? <p> The answer is yes . Nearly all local governments require that every business within the city or county apply for a basic ' business license ' and pay a fee . This is , effectively , a minimum tax levied against all of the business within a particular area - in fact some places even call this permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if you 're running a sole proprietorship out of your garage , you will still likely have to register and pay this tax . <p> If you are a retailer , your city or county will probably require that your business has a Sales and Use Tax permit . Even if the state you do business in does n't have a sales tax , your city or county might , so make sure you know what your tax obligations are before you open for business . On the other hand , if your business provides some sort of professional service , you will probably have to be licensed to provide that service , even if it is something that does n't initially appear to need a formal license in place like computer repair or marketing . Finally , if you are engaged in any sort of business that is overseen by a federal agency - commercial fishing , firearms , alcohol , aviation , etc. - you are going to need a federal permit as well . <p> Additionally , we recommend that you either take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Association maintains , or you contact a professional who will help you identify and apply for every license and permit you need . The last thing you want is to get hit with a fine , or be forced to closed , because you overlooked an important detail . <h> Where do you apply for one ? <p> Start from the city and work your way up . Bigger cities almost always have a myriad of business licenses and permits , so if you are in a major metropolitan area , the city 's website is a good place to start . If you are in a smaller town and/or your city does n't have a licensing bureau , go to the county level and see if you can find any information on licensing on the county website . After that , move up to the state government .

Luckily these fees are usually on the cheaper side , so you wo n't have to break the bank in order to renew . However , if you fail to renew your licenses and permits , you could get hit with a fee of hundreds , or even thousands , of dollars . As with all matters related to business maintenance , it is very important that you stay on top of all obligations and deadlines . <p> Along with applying for licensing , you are going to have to file plenty of other compliance documents , including an application for a DBA name , OSHA certification , zoning permits , and an EIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip through the cracks and assume your business will be fine for a bit without a few of these documents , it will wind up costing you a lot more than the time and money it would take to do everything properly .

A minority of states require you to publish a notice of your name with a local newspaper . One important thing to remember , your registered name has an expiration date , and so be sure to renew your name or else face losing the rights to the name . <h> Determining Whether Your Business Needs a DBA <p> There are many reasons why a business may want to file a DBA . For sole proprietors and partnerships , the legal name of their business is their personal name ( for partnerships , it is generally the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to use their personal name as their business name , a dba may be of some value . Although the legal name of the business is still under the owner 's personal name , the business being conducted can be under a dba ( i.e. advertising , branding , mailings , etc . ) . <p> Many states require a business to register their assumed or fictitious name with the state or local government to legally conduct business under that name . For the few states that do not require registration , it is still advantageous to register the assumed or fictitious name with the local government to give some ( albeit little ) legal protection to prevent others from using the name . Also , filing your DBA may allow you to open a business bank account under the business name . <p> For franchise owners , a DBA may be necessary to ensure that your business can be conducted under the franchise name . <p> For corporations or Limited Liability Companies that want to conduct multiple businesses under different names or prefer using a different business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to file a DBA . <h> Trademark/Legal Issues <p> Registering for a DBA does not give you full trademark protection and does not necessarily protect you from any liability for using your business name . Just because you register your DBA with the government does not prevent other businesses from using your business name . Most jurisdictions do not allow the registration of two of the same fictitious names , however , some jurisdiction do . Furthermore , the fact that you are able to register a DBA does not necessarily mean you are clear from any infringement violation . Unregistered trademarks ( trademarks that use the superscript , ) , as the name implies , are not registered with any government agency or office , and these trademarks still retain some property rights . A careless business owner may unintentionally find him or herself stuck in a lengthy lawsuit over the fictitious business name they thought was okay . To avoid this , careful research on whether your business name is being used in your geographic area ( and beyond ) should be made . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringe upon anybody 's rights , you may consider taking the next to completely protect your business name , registering your name as a trademark with the state or with the federal government ( if possible ) . 
@@74694110 @3394110/ <h> New Entrepreneur Check List <h> Our top 10 list of the most important items for any new startup business . <p> Every successful business starts out as an idea . That idea is like a seed - nurture it properly and it will grow into a successful small business , ignore it and it 'll lie dormant until someone else grows it instead . As a new entrepreneur , you 've taken the initiative to do something with your idea , and that is great ! If you 've never started a business before , you may have no clue where to start , or even what you have to file before you are even legally allowed to do business . To help new small business owners on their way to small business success , we 've put together a list of ten things you need as a new entrepreneur . <h> 1 . A ' Doing Business As ' ( DBA ) Name <p> If you want to sell a product or service under any name other than your own , you need a ' Doing Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has your name in it - i.e. John Smith 's Gardening - you still have to file for a DBA name . You 'll also need a DBA name if you 'd like to open a bank account for your business , or collect money under the business 's name . Luckily , filing for a DBA name is fairly easy , and usually cheap . First you need to run a search for the business name you 'd like to make sure no one else is using it . Once you know your name is available , all you usually have to do is register your DBA or fictitious business name with your state and pay a small filing fee . <h> 2 . Business Licenses <p> A business license is a government-issued permit that allows you to conduct business within a particular locality . Most cities will require new businesses to , at the very least , apply for a local license . However , many industries have to deal with extra regulation and licensing , so it is important that you apply for and receive every permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration has a very handy tool available to help businesses identify , and apply for , the licenses required by the city , county , state , and federal governments . <h> 3 . Insurance <p> Every business , no matter the size , needs at least some basic coverage . That means buying policies to cover property , liability , and worker 's compensation . A property policy will protect your office and essential business property like computers , office furniture , and inventory . General liability helps protect your business from lawsuits in the event that someone gets hurt on your property , or if one of your employees either hurts somebody or causes damage . Finally , worker 's compensation helps cover workers hurt on the job , and is actually a legal requirement set by most states once your business hires a certain number of people - usually three . Most insurance agencies actually sell composite policies , which have the basic coverage listed above , meant specifically for small businesses . <h> 4 . A Registered Agent <p> While not legally required as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should still have a registered agent . Your registered agent is the person , or in some cases the company , that will receive services of process in the event of a lawsuit . They are also usually the point of contact for the government when the state sends out renewal reminders . Anyone with a physical address in the state you do business in can be your registered agent , but because of the sensitivity of the documents delivered to your registered agent , it is better to go with a professional registered agent service . MyCorporation can help you find a registered agent . <h> Form an LLC or Corporation <h> 5 . Your Articles of Incorporation/Formation <p> You are taking a serious step in protecting yourself and your personal assets by incorporating or forming a limited liability company . Corporations and LLCs are separate , legal entities , and as such can hold , and are responsible for , their own debt . That means you wo n't lose your home , property , or savings if the business takes a tumble and is unable to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't be the target of any lawsuits . Forming a corporation or LLC takes a bit of time and costs money , but the protection a separate business structure affords you is priceless . Limited liability companies are formed with a Certificate or Article of Formation , run just like partnerships , and easier to maintain . Filing your Articles of Incorporation will create a corporation . Running a corporation is a bit more difficult , but the corporate structure does allow you to sell shares of the company and raise money through investments . <h> 6 . An Operating Agreement or Corporate Bylaws <p> Most states do not require corporations or LLCs to have a set of corporate bylaws or an operating agreement . However , it is important to clearly define how your business is run and governed . Limited liability companies are normally guided by an operating agreement . This agreement will describe the general functions of the LLC 's managers/members , the formalities of voting , the allocation of profit and loss , and special tax classifications , if any . Corporate bylaws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares are transferred , the rules of voting , and how to call meetings , as well as explaining the roles and responsibilities of corporate directors and officers . <h> 7 . Trademark and Copyright Protection <p> A trademark can be registered for any phrase , logo , design , image , or combination thereof , which is used in the open marketplace and does not already have a claimant . For example , when you create and use your business 's logo , you have an automatic right to that logo . That right , however , may not preclude other businesses from using that logo because it is difficult to enforce an unregistered trademark claim , especially across state lines . If you trademark a logo at the federal level , you are helping to ensure that no one else profits from your IP or branding . Copyright protection is meant for creative work , so if you have a particular jingle that is part of your branding , it may be wise to file for copyright protection as well . <h> 8 . An Online Presence <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those surveyed researched companies online before making a major purchase . If you want your business to succeed , you can not ignore the internet - end of story . That means , before opening your business , you need a domain name and a website . Now this website is going to be how you represent your business and your brand to everyone searching for your company , so it is vital that you invest in your website so it both looks good , and functions well . We also recommend that you start building your social presence once you launch your site , as social media is now one of the most powerful marketing tools available . <h> 9 . The Right Team <p> You are n't going to be able to do everything by yourself forever . Once business picks up and money begins to come in , you should start looking into hiring some help . But first you will need a Federal Employer Identification Number so the government can make sure you are withholding payroll taxes and abiding by labor laws . <h> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quickly going to find that a good calendar can really be the difference between staying organized and drowning in a flood of work . Your schedule is going to quickly fill up with meetings , marketing events , and other obligations that , while necessary , will drain your time . When you 're being pulled in nine different directions , it can be very easy to forget something like an annual renewal or a quarterly tax payment . However , miss too many filing deadlines , and your business could fall out of compliance . So buy an appointment book or some other sort of calendar and mark every , single important date . <p> A new company can avoid a few of the traditional trappings of business when first starting out . You can use a home office instead of renting another space . You can store inventory in your garage instead of in a warehouse . You can even use your website as your storefront in lieu of a brick-and-mortar location . But there are some things that you should n't skip over . Before opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business structure , and protect your brand by registering any trademarks or copyrights used to market your business . Make sure you comply with local , state , and federal regulations , and that you know what needs to be filed , and by when , to stay in compliance . And , finally , remember to enjoy yourself .

@@74694114 @3394114/ <h> How to Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada <p> We have all been told , from a very young age , that there is nothing certain in this world except for death and taxes . Death we can cover later , but taxes are a constant annoyance for small businesses . Each state has a different policy regarding taxes , and some make it their business to help business ; that is , they try to make their tax policy enticing for smaller business to found their companies within that state 's borders . <h> Incorporation Benefits <p> The state gets a job-producing entity , and small businesses get to keep their money . Many see this as a win-win , and certain states have taken steps to turn themselves into " corporate havens .

When looking to incorporate , the area in which you choose to do business should not be taken lightly . Two states , Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the top of your list . Delaware , despite being the second smallest state in terms of area and the fifth smallest in population size , is called home by sixty percent of Fortune 500 companies . <h> The Corporate Laws <p> This is not too surprising , though , if you know a bit about Delaware 's corporate laws . If you locate in Delaware and do not operate within the state , Delaware does not charge a corporate income tax . Even if you do operate within the state , your purchases are not subject to sales tax and any income is subject to a flat tax of 8.7% . The state maintains a Delaware Economic Development Office to help develop small business within state boundaries . Their website , http : //dedo.delaware.gov , is well maintained and contains links to nearly every source a small business would be interested in . The state provides funding schemes , gives guidance , and offers its support to any business that wants to establish within Delaware . But if the east coast is n't your cup of tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No inventory tax , no personal or corporate income tax , and low payroll taxes combined with a low cost of living means Nevada has become on of the most attractive states of incorporation in the country . While the amount of resources available to businesses wishing to incorporate within state lines is not as numerous as in Delaware , the low , or non-existent , tax rates may make the extra work involved with getting a business of the ground in Nevada well worth it . That is n't to say , however , that you are on your own . The Nevada Small Business Administration , in cooperation with the University of Nevada , Reno : College of Business , has an excellent online resource called the Nevada Small Business Development Center , which can be accessed at http : //nsbdc.org .

I can not stress how important it is to consider all of your options and consult with a professional before making a decision like this , but Delaware and Nevada are both consistently chosen as the home states for various businesses for a reason . Less money to the state means more for your business , and that increase in capital can mean the difference between failed and self-sustained ventures .

Separation of business and personal assets of the owners is critical . A Professional Corporation provides for the separation of these assets from other members of the professional group .

Owners pay personal income tax only on money they draw from the corporation in the form of salaries , bonuses , and the like . <p> An S-Corporation is a regular corporation that has elected S-Corporation tax status . Forming an S-Corporation let 's you enjoy the limited liability of a corporate shareholder but pay income taxes as if you were a sole proprietor or a partner . In an S-Corporation , all business profits " pass through " to the owners , who report them on their personal tax returns . The S-Corporation itself does not pay any income tax .

Examples of non-profit types might relate to the arts , charities , education , politics , religion , research , sports or some other endeavor . Under the Federal Tax Code Section 501(c) , a tax-exempt corporation can not pay dividends and , upon dissolution , must distribute its remaining assets to another nonprofit group . Read more about Non-Profit Corporations . <p> A benefit corporation is a corporation organized under a state 's general corporation law that has elected to become subject to benefit corporation statutory provisions .

Therefore , like a traditional for-profit corporation , a benefit corporation is an independent legal and tax entity , separate from the people who own , control and manage it .

The trick is to act natural which sometimes means using words , or text , that may not seem business-like such as emoticons . <p> While some may feel that emoticons are childish , the truth is that these simple smiley faces and winks tap into a core part of everyones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important as the appearance of language . A smile can get one much further than a spoken word in real life , so why not on paper or through an email ? <p> According to Lifehacker , facial expressions carry significant weight in conveying meaning and ensure that a message comes across as intended . The smile itself is perhaps the most important of all facial expressions . <p> " We know that smiling is a very powerful gesture ; we were doing a research study looking at different symbols , and the symbol that was rated with the highest positive emotional content was the smiley face , " Andrew Newberg , a researcher on the psychology of language , told Lifehacker , " The painting of the Mona Lisa is one particular example of that feeling of calmness . " <p> So the question remains : When are emoticons appropriate ? <p> Resumes <p> A resume is one of the most important and frequently discussed pieces of text-based communication in the business world . There is no set standard for what should or should n't be in one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumes should be written in . As such , knowing when to use a well-placed smiley face or emoticon in one can make one stand out in a positive light . As the popular saying goes , a picture is worth a thousand words . In the graphics industry , a simple text resume is far less likely to get noticed than one with color and a well-placed wink or " D-face . " <p> Interoffice email <p> While many business communications are formal in nature , internal emails and conversations are n't  always , making emoticons perfectly acceptable in day to day communications . Many people may choose not to use them , but there is no true social rule against it . A well-timed emote in a conversation can convey meaning that might otherwise be lost on a coworker , or ensure that someone realizes that a comment was said as a joke . <p> While this does n't  mean one can say things that could potentially get him or her fired and pass it off with a smiley face , it does help support clear communication in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that using emoticons in the professional space can be appropriate at any time , it just depends on the recipient of the message . Adding a smiley face to an invoice could push the point home that a small business owner was happy with the job done , while one in a company-wide email can be perfect for discussing a celebration or joyous event in an employees life , such as a birthday or marriage . Ultimately , this comes down to personal preference and whether or not the intended meaning will be appreciated by the recipient . <p> Chris Donaldson is a technology writer for Funmoods.com .

@@74694140 @3394140/ <h> Business Basics : Business Dissolution <p> Corporate dissolution can be a touchy topic since dissolution is associated with a business going under , but there are lots of reasons for a business to shut down . For example , you would n't want to keep paying fees and renewals for an LLC that was founded with a specific purpose , like building a housing tract , after that purpose is fulfilled . Nor would you expect an entrepreneur to balk at a particularly lucrative opportunity that would divert too much attention away from their original business . Whatever the reason , there may come a day when your corporation or limited liability company has to file their Articles of Dissolution and close down for good . If that day does come , you may find yourself wondering what else you have to do to finalize the dissolution . To help prepare our readers for any possible future , we decided to use a Business Basics post to outline what , exactly , has to be done during dissolution . <p> Vote on Dissolution Most states require that the managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the board of directors ( in the case of a corporation ) votes , and agrees , on dissolution . If the corporation is publicly traded , the shareholders will also have to vote and agree on dissolution . If you can not secure that vote , you will probably not be able to dissolve the business . Now , lawsuits can be filed to force dissolution , but these suits are rarely in the best interest of the directors , executives , or managing members . So when you start the dissolution process , make sure you can secure enough votes to get past this first hurdle . <p> File Your Articles of Dissolution- State requirements on what the articles of dissolution have to include vary , but for the most part the information is fairly standard . The corporation or LLC will have to provide its name , the date the dissolution will take effect , the reason for dissolution , and information on any legal actions pending , if any are . If your business is registered to do business in any other state , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination with those states . Otherwise it could be held liable for future annual reports and state fees , even though the business no longer exists . <p> Send Cancellations and Notices In addition to holding a shareholder vote , public corporations are required by most states to formally announce their intent to dissolve in a dissolution proposal . This proposal will usually name the corporation and have to have a statement confirming that the proposal was adopted by a majority vote . This proposal will also be made part of the public record . <p> All corporations must also file form 966 with the IRS within 30 days of filing their articles of dissolution . Some states will require corporations operating within their borders to have a tax clearance certificate before the dissolution is completed , so make sure you are square with the IRS ! <p> Distribute Assets When you dissolve you have to pay back the businesss creditors . If anything remains , you distribute the businesss assets to the owners based on the percentage of the company they own . In other words , corporations pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shareholders return their outstanding shares .

And so smaller corporations especially those with just a handful of shareholders often ask whether they really have to hold a meeting every , single year to effectively rubber-stamp the same board of directors and file their annual report . The answer , of course , is yes . Annual shareholder meetings are legally required for private and public corporations , regardless of size . But your annual meeting does n't  have to be a stodgy affair . In fact , one of the best parts about being a smaller corporation is the extra little bit of freedom you have in how these meetings are run . <p> Forget the Board Rooms and Offices <p> You have to set the date of your annual shareholder meeting in your bylaws , but the location is up to you .

But what if you run your business from home , as nearly half of all small business owners do ? Or what if you want your annual meeting to be a bit more enjoyable ? There 's absolutely nothing wrong with meeting at a restaurant , or around your kitchen table . In fact , we 've talked to plenty of CEOs who make their annual meeting a potluck ; the few shareholders they have all bring a dish , they sit down , do their formal meeting , and then spend the rest of the day eating and talking . Some states actually do- set a minimum for the number of shareholders that must be present , so hosting a more laid-back meeting can help ensure people do come . <p> Have the agenda laid out and ready to go <p> The chair can technically " wing " the meeting if they have a good idea as to what needs to be voted on . Normally these meetings are to appoint and/or remove directors , modify corporate bylaws , vote on shareholder initiatives , and approve transactions requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better idea to list out what , exactly , needs to be brought up so you can keep the formal part of the meeting as quick and easy as possible . Different states may also require different numbers of votes depending on the transaction sometimes a simple majority is not enough so planning this out let 's you know what numbers you actually need . <p> Keep your minutes light <p> You must keep the minutes of your annual meeting , but you do not have to transcribe every , single thing said . Note the date , time , and place of the meeting , take attendance , lay out the agenda , and record votes . If anything new is brought up during the meeting , make sure to note that as well . Otherwise , your minutes can effectively be a quick sketch of your annual meeting . Just make sure , - before everyone leaves , you pass around the minutes so everyone can review them . These- constitute an official document and its important they portray the meeting accurately . <p> Every corporation must host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why it has to be this dreaded , boring affair . Corporations , especially those with just a handful of shareholders , have a bit of leeway as to what the meeting will actually look like .

@@74694144 @3394144/ <h> LinkedIn Series Part 3 : Paid Advertising <p> LinkedIn is a very effective medium to increase customer acquisition , especially in the Business to Business market. - But with the different types of advertising , the bidding payment system , and a plethora of targeting opportunities , the advertisement choices on the platform can be a tad difficult to navigate . The key to understanding LinkedIn paid advertising is to know a great deal about your target audience . <p> Advertisements vs . Sponsored Updates vs . Direct Sponsored Content <p> There are three major ways to advertise your company on LinkedIn : display advertisements , sponsored updates , and direct sponsored content . Display advertisements are those that will be showed to your target audience but will not show on your company page . Most commonly , they are used to give a generic introduction to your company and they often include links to your company 's website . They require a 50 by 50 pixel photo , subject line of 25 characters or less , a description of only 75 characters or less and can include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only for decoration and the true value of your advertisement should come in your subject line and direct link . This type of advertisement is typically shown on the right hand side of the home page and does not blend in with the other content . Sponsored Updates , on the other hand , are company page updates that reach a much larger audience than usual . Instead of broad introductions , these are better suited for specific marketing campaigns about a specific product release or content creation . A great example of this was our recent post regarding our new YouTube video , #asktheintern . Lastly , direct sponsored content is the newest form of advertising on the platform and is very similar to the format of a sponsored update , except it does not show on your company page . The purpose of these is to advertise more natively on the platform . Like display advertisements , they should be broad and focus on getting the potential customer back to your own company website. - All are priced in the similar fashion with the advertiser able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement and the appropriate pricing will all depend on the product and size of your company . <p> Targeting Your Audience <p> LinkedIn advertising has a general affinity towards the B2B market . Regardless of type of advertisement , LinkedIn allows you to narrow down the potential audience by geography , company , job title , group , gender , and age. - LinkedIn only requires the geography filter , but the job title filter seems to be the second most used tag due to the nature of B2B marketing . For MyCorporation , we tend to focus on the entrepreneurs and business owners . Those groups are broad enough that it does n't significantly narrow the potential reach , yet specific enough to reach our target audience . <p> Managing Your Campaigns <p> Once you have chosen your advertisement and audience , it 's time to manage your campaign . LinkedIn recently came out with a new transformation to their campaign management tool . With a new look and design layout , you are able to easily look up different campaigns , as well as track the quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features on the new campaign manager is the ability to look at the demographics of those that clicked on the advertisement . This information is vital in understanding who you advertisements are appealing to and how to change your future campaigns to hit more of your target audience . <p> The world of LinkedIn advertisements can be overwhelming at first . Remember that the abundance of analytics for each of your campaigns is a great resource to identify potential areas of improvement . It may take some trial and error with the different types of advertisements and the different tags to narrow your audience , but many companies have had huge success in B2B marketing with the help of LinkedIn. 34788 @qwx654788

Customers are the ones who will be funding the majority of your business and will keep your doors open . Do n't  underestimate the value of knowing who your customers are and how to reach out to them . To get you on the right track , let 's look at how your business can better get to know its customers and connect over a wide range of media . <h> Provide Surveys <p> One popular method of collecting customer data is through customer satisfaction surveys . Rest assured , if you present your customers with the opportunity to tell you how they 're feeling , theyll let you know . Suddenly you 'll get an influx of new information , and from there you can look at trends . Maybe you thought customers werent coming because of slow lines at the register , but dozens of surveys are coming back saying that your store is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the priorities of your customers , and know how to address their needs . <h> Start an Online Dialogue <p> The internet is perhaps the best way to reach a wide array of people , and that can be crucial when trying to figure out who your customers are . Whether its starting a blog or running a virtual help desk , give your customers an opportunity to interact with you and your business . The comments section may be a dangerous area on many sites , but it can also be a forum for your customers to express themselves . If you 're worried about the price of outfitting your business with internet capability , do n't  be . Plenty of providers offer great internet and phone services , so do n't  miss out on this game-changing opportunity just because your pockets are n't  as deep as a Fortune 500 companies ( business.frontier.com ) . You 'll more than make it back when you 're accurately addressing the wants and needs of your customers . <h> Hold Events <p> While the internet can be an excellent way to connect with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people through face-to-face communication . Try holding an event where you 'll get to interact with customers , like a " get to know the team " event . Personalize it , and if it makes your job easier , feel free to toss in a related sale to help move some products while you 're interacting with your consumers . This will let you know your customers on a more personal level , and will also make them more likely to buy from you in the future . After all , everyone likes to buy from people they know , rather than from nameless faces . <p> There is a nearly infinite number of ways to connect with customers , but these three strategies are a good place to start . Connecting to your customers is essential if you want to optimize your marketing campaigns and ensure you 're reaching the right people , so do n't  be afraid to aim high . Customers are the driving force behind any industry , and the first step to succeeding is knowing who you 'll be selling to . <p> Eileen OShanassy is a freelance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She writes on a variety of topics and loves to research and write .

@@74694152 @3394152/ <p> We know that visual content can increase the amount of time users spend consuming content , but do you know why ? It 's all thanks to neuroscience , or the impact that certain marketing aspects have on the brain . For that reason , marketers have coined a new phrase : neuromarketing . <p> The short definition of neuromarketing is the use of neuroscience tools and theories to help businesses better understand consumers and attract their attention . Neuromarketing is a relatively new trend in the marketing universe , but it 's already shown some impressive advantages over traditional advertising techniques . If nothing else , it 's helped to close the gap between marketers and everyday customers . <p> Visual Marketing and Neurology <p> Much of neuromarketing is visual . The brain can actually process images 60,000 times faster than text , which often makes visual marketing aids more effective . There are a variety of reasons why visuals are so effective , but one of them is the impact of art on the developing brain .

Though text is essential for clearly getting the message across , the colors , aesthetics , graphics , and organization of imagery can evoke emotions in customers that can drive action and generate new leads . <p> Animation and the Progressive Reveal Hijacks the Attention <p> There 's something extremely alluring about animation . It could be the fact that animation always shows a unique perspective on life . People are drawn differently , colors tend to be brighter than real life , and the shading effectively draws the eye . <p> Perhaps even more alluring is the progressive reveal of animation . This occurs when the animation is drawn right in front of you . This kind of animation keeps the brain wanting more , psychologically forcing the viewer to watch the video or graphic in its entirety . <p> Animation is also great for creating visual metaphors , which helps the brain comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves metaphors , particularly when they 're illustrated with cartoon drawings and geometric shapes . It effectively grabs consumer interest and helps with things like recall and understanding . <p> Improved Visual Processing of Images on the Left <p> Lower level visual and sensory features are pretty important when it comes to neuromarketing . The tiniest changes to your packaging , an advertisement , your website , or a blog can make all the difference in gaining undivided attention from your customers . Neuromarketing research makes it possible to measure and quantify the effectiveness of these design changes . <p> One of the small changes is placing images to the left of the text instead of the right . Research shows that this performs better because it aids with the fluency of processing . Because we read left to right , it gives the mind an opportunity to take in the image first , and then read the text . Because the image has already been viewed , it 's easier for the reader to comprehend the text as they 're reading .

Though facts and information can help to push the decision over the edge , most people 's behavior is also driven by their sub consciousness . There 's something in the back of their mind that nudges them to feel one way or another about an issue . <p> This is where marketing comes in strong . Using aesthetics , color psychology , carefully placed images , and a lot of visuals , your advertisements and websites can give people the gut feelings and associations they need to make a decision in your favor . <p> Understanding neuromarketing is a tricky venture , but is well worth the effort you put in .

Many people think that an S-Corporation is a type of corporation , but really , an S-Corporation is a C-Corporation with an S-Corporation tax election . When the S-Corp tax election is made , the entity is telling the federal government that it would like to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation . This is often done to avoid taxation at the corporate level and then again when distributions are made ( at the individual level ) . <p> When the entity is taxed as a partnership , the corporation 's profits pass through the entity level and are taxed only at the shareholder level . There are specific requirements that must be met to qualify as an S-Corporation , so if this type of entity is of interest , you should make sure you qualify . <p> A large majority of our small business customers meet the following requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one class of stock <p> Maintain a maximum of 100 shareholders <p> Be comprised solely of shareholders who are individuals , estates or certain qualified trusts , who consent in writing to the S Corporation election <p> All shareholders must have a US Social Security Number <p> Corporate fiscal year ends December 31st <p> Failure to observe any of the above requirements could revoke your S Corporation status at any time .

Please consult your lawyer or CPA for details . <p> To qualify as an S Corporation in the present tax year , a " calendar year " corporation must timely file IRS Form 2553 with the IRS .

However , after the corporation has been formed , it may elect S Corporation status by submitting IRS form 2553 to the Internal Revenue Service ( in some cases a state filing is required as well ) . Once this filing is complete , the corporation is taxed like a partnership or sole proprietorship rather than as a separate entity . Thus , the income is " passed-through " to the shareholders for purposes of computing tax liability . Therefore , a shareholder 's individual tax returns will report the income or loss generated by an S-corporation . <p> To qualify as an S corporation , a corporation must timely file IRS Form 2553 with the IRS .

In most cases , corporations that would benefit from S Corporation status are those who plan on distributing the majority of earnings to its shareholders in the year those earnings are derived . Corporations who plan on retaining earnings for future investments in future tax years often choose the C Corporation because under the S Corporation , earnings will be taxed as if they were distributed to shareholders regardless of whether a distribution actually occurred or whether the corporation retained the earnings for future investment . <p> An S Corporation follows the same state formalities as does a C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees ) .

If , for any reason , shares are somehow sold or transferred ( even if by will , divorce , or other means ) to a shareholder who is a foreign national , the corporation will lose its S Corporation status and be treated as a C Corporation .

Either they stop by their accountant sometime in February to let them deal with the looming April deadline , or they frantically try to figure out what forms they have to fill out and whether or not the pencils they bought for their home office count as a business deduction . <p> Make a point to do a bit of that old book learnin and try to demystify the tax season . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice to look over what they filled out in those little boxes , it would probably do everyone good if we stopped treating taxes like theoretical physics . <p> Taxes will follow you wherever you go <p> Sadly , we do n't  have a video for this one , so you will have to use your best Kennedy impersonation and a little bit of imagination . <p> When some foolhardy Hollywood producers decide to film Radioactive Man in Springfield , Quimby makes sure that the town gets their fair share of the production budget . And then some.Director : covering his eyes Were shutting down production.Assistant : Yeah , well , we only have $1000 left anyway.Quimby : Uh , there 's a $1000 leaving town tax . <p> Uncle Sam is waiting at every restaurant , shop , and place of business with his hand out . Occasionally the state government locks him out in the cold , but typically local politicians are all lining up for their cut of spending dollars . <p> If you decide to take your tax return and buy a vacation , try enjoy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your destination of choice . Cities like Virginia Beach or Chicago are going to hit you where it hurts when you go out for dinner , and states like New York and Louisiana depend more on sales tax than on state tax for funding . <p> So , while the last thing you may want to think about after tax season is tax , we want to make sure you are n't  taking your return from Uncle Sam and handing it to someone like Diamond Joe Quimby . <p> And now that you 're done wasting time in Springfield , go do your taxes ! 34788 @qwx654788

Building a brand from scratch is easier , but it lacks the historic richness and recognition of a long established brand . Brands with history are already embedded in the public consciousness ; whether memories are bad or good , the presence of any memory can be a marketing boon . <p> The burden of a brand revivalist is to rewrite the memories and reputation , erasing negative connotations and associations by reinforcing good brand qualities and rolling out new , impressive features . Following are typical strategies to reviving any brand.Get a Second Opinion on Your Brandable Skills <p> Brands often fail due to the mismatch of skills of between brand and entrepreneur . Whether you are the original brand owner or the adoptive owner of a purchased and lagging brand , begin the reinvention by refocusing your identity . Get feedback from peers , former bosses , clients , professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your weaknesses . This can be done in individual interviews , emailed surveys or , preferably , in an all-day brand development conference . Be honest about how other professionals perceive your personality highlights and deficits . <p> Rather than forcing yourself to live up to a brand and , by extension , an impossible identity , tailor the new brand to fit who you are and your valuable traits . Let it be a distinct , custom brand that only you can present because it conforms to your experience , talents and skills . - In this way , the new brand identity is unique , memorable and in harmony with your identity . <p> There are situations , of course , when you need to completely change fields and markets ; in those cases , you might need to undergo training for new skills but these should not be so beyond your natural aptitude that you feel ill-prepared as the executive behind the brand . <p> Create a Legend <p> Once you have your identity , immortalize it .

Have a short-hand , pithy version of the story that can be used to influence your brand elements ; the image in the logo , the colors , the slogan should all pay homage to the themes and motifs in the legend . Do not make the narrative too personal ; the goal is tell the tale of how a brand , not your ego , got reborn . <p> Modify and Expand the Brand <p> Dead brands typically have a dearth of public interest , profit and innovation , generally because they failed to grow .

After you incorporate , your business has to pay a tax on any income that it earns , subject to the federal and state corporate income tax rates . On top of that , you still have to pay tax on income you earn from working for the corporation .

@@74694171 @3394171/ <h> Business Basics : Professional Corporations <p> Welcome to our weekly business basics post ! This week we decided to explore a specialized legal entity called a professional corporation ( PC ) . Now most of those who know a little bit about corporate law probably know that there are two , main types of corporations S-Corps , and C-Corps . But in addition to these , there are a few other specialized structures that are important to keep under the belt of a small business , like the professional corporation . <p> So what is a professional corporation ? Like with a regular corporation , converting a sole proprietorship or a partnership into a professional corporation turns the business into its own , - separate- legal entity . However , unlike a regular corporation , the owner of a business being turned into a professional corporation must be licensed to offer a specialized professional service . In other words , the owner of the would-be PC has to be a doctor , or lawyer , or accountant , or architect ; some sort of licensed profession . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like a standard corporation , a professional corporation provides a certain amount of protection for the- business- owner , or owners , as a PC can carry its own debt and liabilities . It is important to note that a PC does not protect an owner from being sued as a result of their own negligence a doctor that turns his or her practice into a PC , for example , can still be sued for malpractice . But if two doctors act as partners within a practice , forming a professional corporation can help protect one doctor from being liable for any judgement- received- from a lawsuit against the other doctor . So without that protection , one of the partners could be held accountable for the mistakes of the other one . Professional corporations , then , are very useful for any licensed professional running a practice with another licensed professional . <p> What do I have to do to form a professional corp ? <p> First , you must be licensed to provide whatever service your practice offers in the state you do business in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of incorporation , and the state licensing board will likely have to approve your articles of incorporation before you can move forward . Usually the licensing board will ask that the articles of incorporation bear special language and , depending on the state , PCs occasionally have to contend with certain laws after they are formed for example many states ask that a professional corporation designate itself as such by including PC or Professional Corporation in the name of the practice . <p> Professional corporations take a bit more effort to form , but are extremely useful for practices run by two or more licensed professionals . After all , the last thing you want is to have to pay lawsuit that resulted from the negligence of your- partner . And , like other corporations , a PC offers some protection from debtors looking to collect on a businesss liabilities .

@@74694172 @3394172/ <h> Member-Managed LLCs Versus Manager-Managed LLCs <p> Traditionally , - Limited Liability Companies are treated like partnerships . Two or more people get together , found a company , form an LLC , and then start running the business . But there 's more than one way to run an LLC . Member-Managed and Manager-Managed Limited Liability Companies are run very similarly , but there are also some key differences that anyone looking to form an LLC should know . <p> Member-Managed LLCs <p> Member-Managed LLCs are , by far , the more common choice . Each member of the limited liability company is treated as equal to every other member , and everyone shares responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the LLC . Limited liability companies became popular because of how simple they were to run in comparison to a corporation . Small business owners wanted the liability protection of a separate business entity , without having to jump through a ton of regulatory loopholes . A Member-Managed LLC does n't  have a separate level for management , like a board of directors , and is well-suited to small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with running the company . <p> Manager-Managed LLCs <p> Manager-Managed LLCs , on the other hand , are a bit more complicated to run . A Manager-Managed Limited Liability Company will have a board of managers , which is akin to a corporations board of directors . This board of managers is responsible for the direction and operations of the LLC , and have more control over the business than other members . <p> Delegating management can make sense in certain circumstances . Larger , more complex LLCs often name a board of managers simply because it would be way too difficult for all of the LLCs members to share management responsibilities . Manager-managed LLCs are also useful when a limited liability company has members that are n't  comfortable , or are n't  interested , in helping run the company . LLCs can also hire non-members to sit on the board of managers , opening up the possibility of bringing in outside talent without giving up a chunk of the business . <h> How do you choose a Member-Managed LLC or a Manager-Managed LLC ? <p> Most states actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be member or manager managed . So you check a box on your LLCs organizational forms , send them in , and then get ready to run the business according to whatever choice you made . <p> Whichever management structure you choose , though , you must remember to formally document that choice in your operating agreement . You will need to outline and define the rights and responsibilities of the members and , if you choose to have them , managers . Running a business without an operating agreement is a quick way to cause a rift , so clarify roles early on and make sure everyone knows what is expected from them . 34788 @qwx654788

@@74694176 @3394176/ <h> When Should I Incorporate ? <p> Timing is important . Incorporating too soon may result in paying unnecessary fees/taxes and filing reports which can take up time and money . Incorporating too late may open the door to unlimited liability . Fortunately , certain factors may help in determining when to incorporate . <h> Multiple Founders <p> As harmonious as any beginning may be , founders may inevitably reach a disagreement regarding the operation of a business , or worse yet , disagree about the initial investment promises made at the time of a business ' founding . To best avoid any disagreement or the potential dissolution of a business due to a disagreement between founders , incorporation may be a wise decision . With incorporation , founders are limited to the number of shares purchased and so any investment into a corporation is determined through the number of shares owned by the founder . Also , founders can transfer their shares without risking the dissolution of the business.Also , if property , particularly intellectual property , is involved in a business with multiple founders , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that property to the business and not to an individual founder . <h> Contract Agreements with 3rd Parties and Employees <p> Before making any agreement with a third-party , a business may want to consider to whom the business wants liability to the third-party . Prior to incorporation , liability flows to the owner(s) / partners for any agreement between the business and a third-party . This liability continues even if the business is subsequently incorporated . It does not matter when a disagreement occurred , but rather when the agreement was first made between the business and the third-party . For example , if an unincorporated business agrees to purchase some materials from a third-party , the owner(s) / partners of the unincorporated business are liable for that purchase agreement . Even if the business is incorporated at a later time , the owner(s) / partners remain liable to that purchase agreement . The same holds true for any employee hired prior to incorporation . For any employee hired prior to incorporation , liability falls upon the owner(s) / partners , but for any employee hired after incorporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a newly founded business , the owner(s) / partners should consider who should be liable to that employee , the owner(s) / partners or the business ? Third-parties also include customers . Although a business may have some good products / services it wants to sell , if sold prior to incorporation , liability flows directly to the owner(s) / partners . There are other considerations for determining when to incorporate , but the general rule for most businesses is once an idea is more than an idea , then a business should start thinking about incorporating . 
@@74694177 @3394177/ <h> Business Basics : Doing Business As Names <p> A Doing Business As name is one of the- most important parts of a business , but far too often we hear about businesses- choosing- to put off filing for a DBA until they are a bit more established . Unfortunately this leaves those companies open to all sorts of problems later on as a DBA name is needed for some of the most basic aspects of running a business ! But what exactly is a Doing Business As name ? And why do businesses need to file for one ? <p> What is a DBA Name ? <p> A doing business as name , or as it is sometimes known as a fictitious business name , is the name under which you do business . As a way to reduce fraud , most states require anyone who offers goods or services under a name other than their own to file for a DBA . Doing business as names are typically handled by the Secretary of State or department of corporations of whatever state the company does business in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even offer DBA name searches free of charge , ensuring that you are n't  wasting your time by filling out paperwork for a name that has already been claimed . <p> Why would a business need one ? <p> You are entitled to use your own name for your business if you want to , but any changes or additions to the name would require you to file for a DBA name . For instance , if our CEO Deborah Sweeney opened up a business that paints houses , she could call her business Deborah Sweeney. However , if she wanted to call it Deborah Sweeney Painting , she would have to file for a DBA name as Painting is not a part of her legal name . This might seem a bit silly but as mentioned before , this is largely a way to prevent fraud . As DBA laws are so important to a states anti-fraud efforts , you need a DBA name for some of the most rudimentary parts of running your business . Want to open a business bank account ? - Receive- checks written out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? Most states require companies to file for a DBA name before doing any of the above . And , if you do n't  complete the paperwork , you could be hit with some serious fines . <p> How do I file for a DBA name ? <p> Most states have a standardized form available on their website for filing a DBA name . Just head on over to the website for the state you do business in , find the Secretary of States page , ( in some cases , this may be the page for the department of corporations ) download a DBA form , fill it out , and send it in along with the required processing fee . Filing also usually involves either you or the state performing a DBA search before the paperwork is processed . And if you need a little extra help from professionals , we are always happy to help you file for a doing business as name as well ! <p> A doing business as name is extremely important , and it is best to file for one now before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company , only to find that you were actually using a business name that was already claimed . Running a business under an assumed name without filing for a DBA or fictitious name can also land you in hot water with the state and require you to pay a series of fines and penalties . This is definitely something you want to take care of early , so once you figure out what your business name is going to be , start the paperwork and file for a DBA name as soon as possible ! 34788 @qwx654788

Whether you 're opening an independent food truck , establishing a family-owned diner , or investing in a restaurant chain , there 's a wealth of options to choose from when starting up a restaurant .

Incorporating provides great benefits like saving money on taxes and protecting your personal assets with liability protection to keep the assets of the owner separate from that of the business .

Failing to do so can mean anything from competitor theft of your ideas to major and expensive security breaches that can lead to client lawsuits . <p> Not to worry however there are some key policies your small business can implement to completely protect their valuable information without breaking the bank in the process . <p> Limit Device and Account Access <p> The single most basic security policy of all is limit access to all storage , computing and online cloud based media like email servers and storage databases . You can do this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trusted employees or business partners . <p> Furthermore , the passwords that guard access to remote accounts like cloud servers , the business emails of clients and other online databases should only be shared with a select number of individuals and not given out to anyone else . <p> Enforce these policies carefully , make sure they 're understood by all employees and be sure to discipline any transgressions against access limitation rules by your workers . <p> Use Strong Passwords <p> Make sure that every computer , mobile device , data application , and company smartphone is protected by password protection through a login prompt or other login security feature . These passwords must be strong , at least 10 to 20 characters long and as full of random words as possible ( if you 're using passphrases ) or random characters ( for more classical passwords ) . <p> In the case of passphrases , the words should be truly random and amount to a phrase that makes no logical sense and is n't found in any book you know of , while in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consist of capital letters , lowercase letters , numbers and symbols all mixed together . Make sure your employees memorize these words and phrases instead of writing them down and leaving that information out for everyone to see . <p> Back Up Your Data <p> Your online , offline and server based data and client information should all be backed up to at least two different locations and regularly synched so that it stays updated . Ideally , you should use both physical media backup procedures through which you back information to external hard drives and regularly synchronize it on a weekly or monthly basis ; between synchronizations , store the hard drives themselves in a safe location away from your business offices . A good example of software you can use to help perform backup and regular syncing automatically for free is the site SynchbackFree which also offers a Pro system to pay to use . <p> Additionally , you should use cloud storage servers to automatically back up all computer files and sync them with each other on a regular basis .

SpiderOak.com offers double blind encryption , which prevents both third party intruders and the company itself from seeing what 's on your rented cloud storage servers due to encryption . <p> Use Anti Intrusion Software <p> As a final security policy , make sure that your computers themselves are protected by protective software . Your servers need to be protected by network based intrusion detection applications and your company 's website or sites protected by strong , highly secure hosting and your own Server security software package .

Other times , names are more important , especially if the name of your company came to you fairly early . Even Jones Plastics , if thought of early enough , can worm its way into your heart .

You should also be sure to register a domain using your business 's name so you can establish a clear web presence early on . <p> Even if you do everything right , sometimes things do go wrong . After all , you are dealing with the government , and when has that ever been easy ? Just keep in mind that until you get something for the state with your name stamped on it , everything is still in the air . So do n't rush those business cards to the printers just yet .

@@74694206 @3394206/ <h> What Goes into an Operating Agreement ? <p> Operating agreements are one of the most vital , and overlooked , tools in running a limited liability company . We 've actually covered operating agreements as part of our ABCs of MyCorp series , but we never delved into what an operating agreement should actually say . As a quick refresher , an operating agreement is essentially a document that defines how the LLC will be run , and the SBA recommends that every LLC draft one . The trouble is that only a couple of states , like Missouri and New York , legally require new LLCs to have an operating agreement . But without the rules , structure , and regulations an operating agreement provides , your LLC could be in serious trouble if partners disagree , a member wants to leave , or if the state starts questioning the validity of your LLC . Operating agreements are also pretty easy to draft and only need to cover a few key areas . <p> Ownership <p> By default , the portion of an LLCs profits , losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial investment . So if there is only one member , everything is 100% theirs , and if two partners invested equal amounts , then it is split 50-50 . If that works for your LLC , great ! Make a note of it and move onto the next section . However if , say , one member contributed the idea that the LLC is built on , but not as much money , they may still feel entitled to a higher percentage of the LLCs profits and assets . Discuss ownership rights with all of the members , and make sure everyone is okay with how profits , losses , and assets are divided . <p> Rights and Responsibilities <p> Hopefully , each of the LLCs initial members brings a unique talent or skill set to the table . For example , one member could be in charge of marketing , while another manages the office . You need to put any division of labor into your operating agreement so each member knows what is expected of them . You 'll also need a plan to settle disputes between members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in business decisions . <p> Joining and Leaving the LLC <p> Plan for the future when drafting your operating agreement there may come a time when a new member is sought out , or an old member chooses to leave . In some states , the loss of an initial member is actually enough to cause the automatic dissolution of the LLC . You 'll need a plan in place to deal with gaining and losing members . What is a leaving member entitled to ? How involved with the business should they remain ? What do new members get by joining up ? Will their initial investment determine their ownership of the LLCs profits , losses , and assets ? These are the sorts of questions you have to answer , or you could waste weeks arguing out the details after an old member leaves or a new one comes in . <p> Dissolution <p> If and when the day of an LLCs dissolution comes , you should have terms for that dissolution outlined in your operating agreement . You need to decide how assets will be divided after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual members are allowed to try and run their own business based on the idea behind the LLC . <p> Severability Provision <p> Finally , your operating agreement should have a severability provision this is normally standard legal boilerplate . It will just say that , if by chance a provision of the operating agreement runs contrary to state or federal law , all other aspects that are not contrary to the law should still survive . Otherwise , a small legal oversight could be enough to invalidate the entire agreement . <p> Ready to form your own LLC ? Need help drafting an operating agreement ?

In actuality , starting a business is far cheaper than these individuals realize . Of course the startup costs are dependent on the type of business you 're planning in terms of equipment and/or inventory . However , the initial paperwork to start your own corporation is quite nominal in comparison . <p> A C-Corporation is an entity that is taxed separately from those who set it up , such as owners and shareholders . It is regarded as a separate entity that can hold its own credit rating , liabilities and assets . Personal liens and debts can not influence a C-Corporations assets or bank accounts because it is its own entity owned by the shareholders and not the founding individual . <p> Why You Would Want a C-Corp <p> Forming a C-Corporation has many advantages that are ideal for businesses .

The corporation will continue to conduct business as normal and does n't  require the founding member to be a part of the staff . For example , Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985 although he was a founding member . Without his influence , Apple continued to conduct business . <p> One of the biggest reasons why many owners decide to form C-Corporations is to protect assets against personal debt . As a corporation is a separate entity and does not technically belong to the creator , personal debtors are unable to attach liens or garnish bank accounts from the business entity . For instance , child support owed by an employee of the corporation are paid from his or her wages not directly from the bank accounts of the C-Corp as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've decided to form the C-Corp , let 's establish what you 'll need .

If you 're planning on developing a corporation that is into retail or online sales , you will definitely need your sales tax I 'd commonly referred to as your " resellers license . " You 'll also need the Federal Employer Identification Number , Articles of Incorporation and possibly a corporate book that is optional . What 's first ? <p> 1 . Articles of Incorporation - The Articles of Incorporation are documents that prove the legality of your business entity . This form is the base of what your C-Corp will function under . Without it , you are unable to develop your corporation legally . Prior to completing this form , you will need to establish officers within the business .

Although there are various templates available for each state within the United States , each corporation is different and may add material pertaining to the companys primary focus of conducting itself . <p> 2 . Federal Employer Identification Number - The Federal Employer Identification Number is required in order to support your C-Corp . It is this number that is tied to your taxes as well as tracking should you need to hire employees .

You could be on the line for fees and penalties if you open your business without all of the correct documents . <p> Even if you are not required to obtain the tax I 'd for the type of business you are operating , its still a good idea to have the number .

These audits help uncover problems that might have otherwise gone unnoticed , stopping them from evolving into serious issues . Corporate audits are thus typically handled and paid for by the corporation being audited to help them spot those types of problems . But why do corporations need to complete internal audits ? And what exactly goes into an audit ? <p> What is a corporate audit ? Well , in a nutshell , a corporate audit is simply a close examination of the practices of a corporation . However , there are multiple things that can be audited . Financial records , business decisions , regular operations , safety compliance , management the list goes on and on . Publicly traded companies are also held to higher standards , and both internal and external auditors often- refer- back to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , which was passed in 2002 , when deciding whether or not a corporation is in compliance with the law . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation to perform an audit , and an external auditor is an agent paid for by some outside organization , like the government . <p> Why should corporations audit themselves ? <p> For publicly traded companies , internal auditing and reporting is required by law . The idea is that , if the CEO and board of directors are briefed on the findings of these audits , they can not claim ignorance of any wrongdoings and can act quickly to solve problems before they get out of hand . But beyond legal compliance , an internal audit also help keep those who run the company aware of how different parts of the corporation are running . Of course if your corporation is made up of only ten employees and you , you probably have a good idea of what is going on . But as the company grows and you are forced to narrow your focus to running the business , these internal audits help keep you on top everything . They can also be invaluable for risk management , especially if you are in an industry where employees could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing any business owner wants is to see their employees hurt , and safety audits help avoid accidents . <p> How do you perform an audit ? <p> If a corporation is big enough , there is typically an entire department , headed by a Chief Auditing Officer , that is dedicated to performing corporate audits . Smaller corporations , on the other hand , typically do not have the resources for an entire auditing department . Instead , they hire a single internal auditor to look over their records . Alternatively , they can contract an outside business to send in their own auditor , who then acts in the same way an internal auditor would . <p> What do you do if they find something ? <p> If the company is small enough , there should n't be very many findings in the audit report , and what is found should be easily fixed . However , larger corporations may wind up with a list of issues .

But even if your corporation is n't traded publicly , it is still a good idea to have an auditor come in and take a look at your company to help you manage risk and avoid the types of problems that could seriously impact the state of your business . 34788 @qwx654788

However , it does still have its place and can benefit a business in numerous ways , especially those who are new to running a company and start-ups . <p> As a quick refresher , minutes are notes recorded by an allocated individual , often a PA or secretary , in order to summarize what has been discussed at a meeting . Done correctly , they will highlight the meeting chronologically and succinctly , including important information such as event dates , deadlines , who said what , budget concerns and suggestions . <p> Why are minutes important ? <p> Minutes are important for a number of reasons . To begin with , it 's important to have a record of meetings that have taken place in order to act on information . Often , once out of the meeting , important information may be forgotten , so having that record gives everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has been discussed . For those employees who do n't attend the meeting , but will be working on some of the things discussed , it 's a valuable record to use as a starting point for carrying out their job . Further to this , it means that workers can effectively stay on track , with clear deadlines and definitions , without the need to ask others in the office or type up their own notes . <p> Minutes are also important for absent members of staff and as a tool to avoid arguments over who decided what and when . <p> How they can help avoid failure <p> Record keeping is an important aspect to every business and keeping minutes is just another instance of this . By looking back at previous meetings , managers can track the success of certain projects by seeing instantly what was discussed and imagined for each one . <p> Budgets can be examined to see where they can be improved , or when funds can be added to improve various aspects of the business and information from minutes can be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly overview , which has all of the necessary information included . <p> The performance of suppliers can be tracked too , using information such as when they were first used , how much budget was allocated and how they have performed any work for the company . This kind of information is invaluable for keeping tabs on suppliers and service providers to ensure the company is getting the best deal . <p> Communication <p> In business , another important factor is communication and this is where minutes really come into their own . Without minutes , everybody would be required to remember what happened during a meeting and non-attendant staff would receive a watered down version , often which will have changed from what actually happened . <p> Taking minutes and having a clear and concise overview of everything discussed in a meeting will make for a happier team , who are more productive . It also promotes effective collaboration as everyone is on the same page from the start . <p> Collaboration is a bit of a buzzword at the moment and this is because it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company that is just finding its feet , this is priceless , as a productive and happy team will always be an asset to any business . <p> This has recently been further confirmed by the introduction of social intranet where an office network has its own kind of social network , something on which minutes can easily be distributed and collaborated on with little fuss . <p> Minute taking has been an invaluable business tool for many years and should never be discounted because of advances in technology . By capturing an organization 's most important decisions , communicating them clearly and keeping a concise record , businesses can safeguard against any problems they may experience in the future . <p> Effective record-keeping , communication and productivity increase , budget tracking and the well-being of employees are all key take-out points that every new or small up and coming business should bear in mind and apply when it comes to a building a successful company . <p> Written by Ellie Boyd- Video and writing journalist for Payday Angels- A small company who are taking it upon themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We review other payday lenders- for example read our Payday UK review here .

@@74694230 @3394230/ <p> Computers are a necessary part of everyday life . Companies and individuals alike use them for nearly everything which changes the industry all the time . Tech support of ten years ago is completely different than tech support now , and IT companies need to adapt to the changes in order to stay relevant . <p> Three of the common mistakes that IT support companies make include : 1 . Ignoring the need for multiple technicians 2 . Refusing to modernize 3 . Putting the customer second Making these mistakes " or not " can be what makes or breaks your IT support company . <p> #1 Ignoring the Need for Multiple Technicians <p> This one is n't so much a mistake that tech support companies make , as it is a mistake that companies in other industries are making . Many companies have one or two IT professionals in house , on whom they can call when an issue arises . <p> While in house IT is a good idea for companies that can afford it , it does not provide a huge body of knowledge . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are investing in and training several technicians , so that each may learn from the others expertise . <p> Each individual has his or her own experience in solving technical problems , and as such the company with more well-trained technicians has an advantage over the company with just one or two engineers . Indeed , an IT company needs to avoid employing just one engineer who gained his knowledge a decade ago , and then has refused to learn new programs . This leads us to our next point . <p> #2 Refusing to Modernize <p> Even as technology changes so rapidly , some tech support companies are refusing to modernize the ways that they do business . An example is the way that many big name companies require multiple visits , multiple technicians , and even multiple parts providers to address one issue . <p> Sending more than one person for more than one visit costs people time and money that they do n't  want to spend . Most businesses depend on technology for their day to day operations so they cant afford to wait several days for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Companies that refuse to accept that they need to make repairs fast are on their way out , as smaller companies that are dedicated to rapid solutions move in on the market . In many cases , the reason that these companies take so long is because of an outdated supply chain that requires parts going from one person to another , following a sort of chain of command . This is neither necessary nor productive , and todays consumer does not put up with waiting around for solutions . <p> #3 Putting the Customer Second <p> In many ways , the first two mistakes lead into this one : putting the customer second . An IT support company that does not expand its body of knowledge or modernize its systems does so to the detriment of its customers . Indeed , when a company insists on sticking to antiquated processes is in effect putting customers behind the industrys perceived traditions . <p> Companies put customers second by not honoring appointment times , being difficult to reach , having long menu options on service phone calls and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important way that any company can put its customers first . <p> Putting the customer first makes the customer happy , and a happy customer is a loyal customer . Putting the customer second can adversely impact any companys bottom line , as it is 6-7 times more expensive to attract a new customer(link) LONG ... than it is to keep an existing one . For tech support franchise concepts , it is more affordable to spend the time training its technicians in good customer service , which helps retain customers . <p> Technology is changing so fast that it is difficult to keep up sometimes , but keep up you must . In the technical support industry , it is imperative to stay abreast of industry changes and adapt your company accordingly , at the risk of becoming obsolete . <p> Jeremy Thompson is a freelance writer and blogger .

This can take place between people 's desks , in the break room or in the hallways . Although workplace comradery is generally encouraged , how much chatter is too much ? What is the line between appropriate discussion and becoming a pair of chatty Kathy 's ? Before you strike up conversation , consider the following questions : <p> Would you want your boss to hear you ? <p> Sure , this seems like a no-brainer , however over time people tend to forget office etiquette 101 . You are at the office to earn a living and hopefully produce a stellar work product . Of course , this does not mean that you should conduct yourself as if you have a zipper for a mouth . Conversation is good ! However , make sure that you really think through what you are saying . Gossip about other coworkers , complaints about your manager or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your head . If you would n't want your boss to be a part of the conversation , mum 's the word . <p> Does this have anything to do with a fellow co-worker ? <p> As just mentioned , co-worker bashing at work is definitely a no-no . Of course , this is the real world and different personality types within the office may clash . However , think back to your high school days . Remember how each clique spent an ungodly amount of time gossiping about the other cliques ? Heavens to Betsy do n't revert to that ! ! An office is synonymous with professionalism. - Wait until you are home to tell your dog Spike about how Mary chews her gum too loudly or that Sam is always late . Finally , if you have a serious problem with a co-worker , speak to your manager .

Think about your office as one giant game of telephone . Per the game , what Sally tells Jim , and what Jim tells Taylor are not going to be the same . Chatter beware ! As with the mass e-mail , do n't assume that what is said between you and a co-worker will stay between you and the co-worker . Words can spread like wildfire , and you do n't want to be the one who lights the match . <p> Does the conversation pass the three minute rule ? <p> Although the office is primarily a place of business , establishing rapport with co-workers is important . You know the saying the family that plays together stays together ? The office that gets along moves along . Of course you want to hear about each other 's weekends , children and travel plans . Small talk does not qualify as office chatter . However , try to follow the three minute rule ; make sure you can wrap up the conversation around the three minute mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . However , chances are you will probably have several three minute conversations with your co-workers . Try to keep the recaps to a reasonable length . After all , you can always text , tweet or telephone your co-workers after hours and on the weekends to get the extended scoop . <p> Do n't be afraid to have fun or make friends at the office . Keep in mind the above questions and conduct yourself professionally . This will allow you to make friends while still performing at work , giving you the best of both worlds . 34788 @qwx654788

In 1977 , the IRS ruled that it would treat the very first LLC , a Wyoming-based oil company , as a partnership for tax purposes . That meant any money earned by the company would flow through it , directly to the members of the LLC . It was n't until 1988 , however , that the IRS chose to recognize all LLCs as partnerships , rather than corporations .

@@74694236 @3394236/ <h> How to Avoid Losing a Friend when You Become Business Partners <p> Many of life 's burdens big and small are lightened with a friend for support and this lesson has not been lost in business . If you 're thinking of starting a business with a friend or family member , you 're not alone . Some of the most enduring and positive American companies were founded by a couple of friends who had an idea . They did n't always have a lot of start-up cash , but they had each other . <p> UPS was started in 1907 by two teenagers with a single bicycle and a hundred dollars borrowed from a friend . Back then the U.S. Parcel Post was n't around and there was plenty of opportunity for the American Messenger Company of Seattle , Washington . <p> Ben and Jerry met in seventh-grade gym class in 1963 . A decade later , they took a five-dollar correspondence course in making ice cream . <p> In 1978 two 20-something friends , John and Rene pulled together $45,000 to open what started as SaferWay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on the friends they lived in the store and reportedly bathed using the hose disconnected from the dishwasher . <p> In fact , about half of all start-up businesses today are organized around a friendship and there are good reasons for this . Underlying a strong friendship is the expectation of a higher level of loyalty , sharing , and understanding that 's uncommon in many work environments . <p> The spreading of responsibility can alleviate the stress of starting a business and having a trusted partner to rely on in times of change can be a great help . Often , friends who create business partnerships share complementary skills and the business can thrive off the healthy working dynamic that would not be possible with a single business owner attempting to do everything alone . <p> If the friends have known each other for many years and perhaps even worked together in the past , their friendship may have already experienced its own share of problems , which can give the friends a perhaps unfair level of trust that the business partnership will be a success . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up friends and the friendship can be decimated in the aftermath of the business partnership . <h> 1 . Should you form a legal business partnership ? <p> The decision to create a business partnership with a friend is tempting , but there are many legal considerations to address before shaking on the deal . <p> A legal business partnership is very simply an unincorporated business relationship that is subject to regulations , taxes , and even government review ( depending on the industry ) . It 's also a less complicated way of getting a business on the ground quickly and so many partners opt to go this route . <p> Each partner contributes to all aspects of the business from making decisions , to profit sharing , to the burden of taxes ( spreading the responsibilities and sharing the stress ) . <p> Inclusion can be used as a powerful incentive to motivate exceptional contributors ( what better reward for dedication than the ability to become a founding member ? ) . <p> While a partnership agreement can be as loose or as detailed as the partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reviewed by an experienced , professional small business attorney to ensure that it does n't have gaps and that it will stand up in court should it need to . <h> 2 . The Types of Business Partnerships <p> Essentially , there are three types of business partnership agreements : <p> A general partnership which divides the profits , liabilities , and management duties equally across the partners or unequally using a defined percentage . <p> A limited partnership which allows partners to minimize their liability and input . An example of this types of partnership is a silent partnership where one partner is the money behind the business and the other assumes the responsibility of developing the business . <p> A joint venture partnership , which is essentially a general partnership that expires at a defined time limit or when a certain phase of development is completed . <h> 3 .

How to Know When it 's Time to Call it Quits <p> While a business partnership may make perfect sense for a start-up , there may come a time when business growth necessitates the dissolution of the partnership . Knowing when it 's time to call it quits is tricky but it 's a necessary step to address if the business is to continue to grow . The following are signs that it might be time for the partnership to end : <p> When the liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the number of partners gets unmanageable and the business is being run by committee ' . <p> When it 's time to woo venture capitalist investment in order to take the business to the next level . <p> In any of these situations , it may be time to incorporate the business instead and set aside the looser business partnership agreement . <p> In the end , a partnership should be between two people with common goals and of similar minds and a friendship should be a close relationship between two people who like doing things together . A well-defined business partnership is essential to keeping the partnership as well as the friendship running smoothly . If things in the partnership get cloudy or hostile , you can turn to the partnership agreement for guidance and keep your friendship solid . <p> Matt Faustman is the co-founder of- UpCounsel , the fastest growing online workplace for businesses to easily hire trusted business lawyers , corporate lawyers , patent lawyers and many other types of legal professionals .

Most people have undoubtedly heard of a non-profit before . You might even donate to one on a regular basis . But fewer know how , exactly , to go about creating a non-profit , or what the differences between a non-profit corporation and regular one are . <p> Just like with any other business , you need a plan to raise money in the non-profit world , that means fundraising and finding large sponsors . Who are your target donors ? What kind of budget do you expect to operate within ? Your mission and the answers to those questions will make up the beginnings of your non-profits business plan . Incorporating a non-profit is actually very similar to incorporating a regular business . You choose a business name , create bylaws , and file the articles of incorporation with the state you are going to operate in . You then hold an organizational meeting , choose the directors , adopt the bylaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running , you then apply for tax exempt status from the federal , state , and local governments . The IRS requires businesses seeking non-profit status to file Form 1023- and pay a fee . Some state and local governments also require their own forms , so make sure to check with your city hall and your Secretary of State or department of corporations . <p> Is running a non-profit different than running a regular corporation ? <p> A little bit . For one , the corporate mission will not be to earn as much money as possible , but rather to achieve some sort of charitable objective . The directors that run the non-profit are required to pursue the non-profits stated mission and guide the company based on fulfilling that mission . If the IRS finds that the corporation is not pursuing its mission , or if the business is involving itself directly in a candidates political campaign , the IRS could revoke 501(c) ( 3 ) status . A non-profit corporation is typically also a non-stock corporation , meaning there are no shareholders and , instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board to maintain more control over corporate activities , and keeps operations a bit more insular . <p> Non-profit corporations are a great way for a community , charity , or religiously minded- entrepreneur- or organization to pursue a social mission and positively impact the world . And , because this particularly type of non-profit organization is also a corporation , the rules and regulations for how to run it are fairly well known you need a board , you need to keep track meeting and minutes , and you need to be able to show you are pursuing your groups mission . The government also helps certain types of non-profits with grants and financial assistance , so it is possible to give a non-profit a very strong start .

Finding the key to what gets people to click on your site , or visit your storefront , is a feat not easily mastered by any business owner . To help ease that frustration , and get the ball rolling , here are six solid ways to generate leads both online and offline : <p> 1 . Search Your Circle <p> The best place to find business leads and referrals are in your circle of friends , family and colleagues . Talking to people is a good way to find a segway into talking about what you do and what you can offer . Beyond just getting names and email addresses for your leads database , you may learn some valuable insight about industry trends and other information.Sociable , not pushy , people are attractive .

Offer an Exchange <p> Offering an exchange is something that can be used both online and offline . Instead of handing on coupon codes as an afterthought , or with the hopes of future business , be upfront and get something in return . Exchanges build relevancy and purpose in the transaction , something that goes beyond random discounts or disassociated asking for business or referrals . Just be sure that you follow up with your end of the deal , as this encourages the other party to be just as faithful on their end . <p> 3 . Give Free Seminars and Classes <p> Another lead generating tactic that works both online and offline is to conduct free seminars , webinars or classes .

Offer Visitors a Freebie <p> - Everybody loves getting something for nothing , especially something valuable . A good and proven way to generate leads online is to offer a free e-book , product or discount code in exchange for contact information .

Our guest poster today is Sarah Holt from the Consulting Guru and shes dishing the best advice on how businesses can avoid freaking out and find their focus on the financial front . <p> Did you know that most businesses are in the red for at least a few years before they start to prosper ? Starting and running your own business can be one of the most challenging things youve ever done and from a financial standpoint , its easy to let the debt weight on your shoulders rule your mood .

Seek out positive influences if you feel like you 're lacking them . Better yet , connect with other fellow entrepreneurs and startup owners .

Not only can this visualization exercise give you a much-needed jolt of positive energy , it 's productive in terms of strategy . Once you put a finger on how you would like your professional life to be , it becomes easier to take steps toward making that a reality . <p> And keep in mind that your business is not alone where finances are concerned .

" Nefarious goals and bloody outcomes aside , what can we learn from him about effective business operations ? <p> 1 . Branding is in the details . The Godfather without strong branding would have been nothing more than a petty criminal with an annoying voice . Instead , he built a rock solid brand , a reputation that was paramount to his success . No detail went unnoticed in establishing his powerful presence , from his dark attire , to the mood lighting in his office , to the theatrical application of that gravelly mumble . In todays business environment , branding is the difference between being remembered and getting lost in the fray . A successful brand should be carefully crafted and bolstered with attention to detail similar to Corleone 's , including staff selection , wardrobe choices , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means getting to the point , clearly . Nobody walked away from a brush with Corleone wondering where they stood . The Godfather enunciated his plans and wishes , clearly , politely and efficiently . Even his long-distance messages , like that infamous severed stallion head , made his intentions clear , memorable and exquisitely persuasive . Every business person should aspire to this communication model , clear as blood on satin sheets ( but , of course , not so violent ) . <p> 3 . Trust of employees goes further than micromanagement . The Godfather trusted his staff to carry out his wishes without nagging them . He communicated how he wanted them to behave and the specific duties he expected . He gave them concise directions and allowed them to do their jobs . In exchange , they were loyal and content , even if you discount the fear factor . To craft a loyal and happy staff , managers should follow Corleones lead : gather a strong crew , lead them with authority and entrust them to independently carry out their duties . <p> 4. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of the movie , we learn a valuable lesson from Corleone when he tells a customer : " Why did n't  you come to me first ?

When you slip up and do n't treat customers with the loyalty they expect , then they might ask someone else for help the next time . <p> 5 . Borrowing is sometimes necessary to move forward . When asked for a favor , Corleone was a yes man . But he proffered his favors in a reciprocal spirit knowing he was building up credit for the future . If you overlook the eye-for-an-eye mentality , this is business brilliance .

All too often , this happens because the vendor did not implement some simple procedures . Follow these 5 steps and you can dramatically reduce the chances of not getting paid . <p> 1 . Create a Credit Application <p> Just like a bank , you need to collect information about your customer using a credit application . It can be a simple 1 page document to get basic identification information as well as permission to investigate their credit . Most companies use a 2 page application so they can establish legal terms with their customer to protect the vendor in case there are payment problems . You can find examples online by searching for credit application forms or templates or the free ebook Credit Application Handbook which has 20 samples . <p> 2 . Investigate Your Customer 's Creditworthiness <p> Run a business credit report to see if they have tax liens , judgments or a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cortera , CreditNet , Dun &amp; Bradstreet , Equifax , Experian , Kroll or Transunion . Subscription prices are as low as 3 cents per report . In addition , contact trade and bank references from the credit application to make sure your customer pays on time and has a reasonable bank balance . <p> 3 . Properly Document Your Transaction <p> Every order should be in writing with your customer 's verified business name . Prices , quantities , delivery dates and payment terms are required . Verbal or sloppy orders create opportunity for disputes or non-payment . Keep proofs of delivery until payment is received . <p> 4 . Establish And Follow Collection Procedures <p> Customers quickly learn who they do n't have to pay on time . Send accurate invoices immediately after shipping product or providing service . Get confirmation that your customer received the invoice . Follow up the day after a payment was due and not received . Determine how frequently you want to call , email or send letters regarding past due invoices and make sure these tasks get completed exactly on-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of collecting decline more than 1% per week . <p> 5 . Take Special Action When Invoices Are 75 Days Past Due <p> Something is wrong . If there is a dispute , make resolution a priority as time passage only makes it more difficult . If they are claiming cash flow problems , get enough information from your customer to decide if you should be patient or escalate matters . If they are ignoring you , that is n't going to change so send a final demand notice . <p> There is already a 26% chance an invoice wo n't be collected when it reaches 90 days past due . If your final demand did n't work , it is probably time to engage a reputable collection agency . Your customer has made it clear they wo n't pay until you take more aggressive action . Most agencies work on a contingency basis with rates from 10% to 25% . It 's better to get something than nothing , and if you wait too long it could be too late for the agency to be successful . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of Cure <p> Spending a few hours to set up your credit and collection procedures can make a huge difference in your cash flow and help avoid bad debt .

This week in business basics we answer a few of the most commonly questions we receive about corporate seals , and let you know if you should get one for your own corporation. - <p> What is a corporate seal ? <p> A corporate seal is essentially a signature for your business . When you incorporate , you turn your business into its own , legal entity . Since a corporation can not sign anything , a corporate seal is used to mark legal and official documentation . These days , most corporate seals are either rubber stamps or steel embossers , and are normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . <p> Do I need a corporate seal ? <p> No , most states do not distinguish between a corporate seal and a signature as long as the person signing the document has the authority to bind the corporation to a legal obligation , their signature can denote an official corporate act . So no state actually requires the use of a seal , though a handful do view sealed documents differently than signed ones . North Carolina , for example , extends the statute of limitations for breach of contract to ten years for sealed documents . <p> The only times most modern corporations actually use a corporate seal is when they issue stock certificates or execute deeds . And even in those two cases , it is becoming increasingly rare for a corporation to prefer their seal over a signature . <p> How do I get a corporate seal ? <p> States do not issue corporate seals you effectively have to design your own and then order an embosser . Most states require the seal to reveal the type of business entity using it , the entitys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can also have little embellishments like the date the company was founded , or the companys logo . Once you have a design , the corporation has to adopt it as its seal during its initial meeting , and give the authority to use the seal to whomever youd like to have that right in your company . <p> Now , while you are not legally obligated to have a corporate seal , it never hurts to have one on hand . A corporate seal- does instill a sense of authenticity in official documents , and acts as a mark of identity for your business . Some corporations also fight against stock counterfeiting by issuing certificates with both the corporate seal and presidents signature . The choice is yours , but if you do decide to order a seal , wed be happy to help you design and order one as part of your corporate kit . <p> If you have any questions about corporate seals , or anything else related to corporate compliance , feel free to leave a comment below , or just give us a call at 1-877-692-6772 ! 34788 @qwx654788

@@74694269 @3394269/ <h> Why Infographics Still Work <p> Infographics have been around forever . Yes , that 's an exaggeration , but it 's not that far off from the truth. - If you really think about it , they 've been around for tens of thousands of years . They 've become modernized recently and are extremely popular. - They work well for a number of reasons , primarily due to their accessible and visual-friendly incorporation of various graphs , charts and illustrated data . <p> In addition to still serving well as a useful way to present data , infographics remain an integral part of effective content marketing . Infographics have an indisputable tendency to go viral , which is a great way to effectively promote services , a business or a specific set of data . They also have a substantial leg-up on boring , text-heavy approaches trying to get the same points across . <p> And yet , there are a lot of people out there who hate infographics . Why ? Because more often than not they 're been completely misused , and tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from making one , though . Here are some areas to keep in mind when it comes to creating great infographics that work in your favor . <p> Infographics Tell Stories <p> One unique aspect of infographics is their potential to tell a story , one that can sympathize with the reader to get them on board with a particular sentiment or brand . Effective infographics have a specific concept that aligns with the infographics ' intent . For example , infographics showing the injury risks of playing football may follow a hypothetical player throughout his career , from pee-wee to retirement , as the risks for injury escalate . Showing scientific data along the way helps add some credibility as well . <p> Infographics also rely heavily on being effectively organized and consistent to get their points across . Ones that tell a story , use a visually striking style , apply clear marketing goals and execute these goals are more likely to go viral , or at the very least serve as useful content to their intended audience . The best infographics answer a question visually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user search all over the place to try and figure out what story is really being told . <p> Infographics Are Useful SEO Tools <p> As mentioned before , infographics have the great potential of going viral across social media outlets , since it is much easier to share images as opposed to lengthy blocks of text . Most re-posters will also link back to the infographics ' original source somewhere below the image , on it , or above it , resulting in a nice SEO-related boost for your business . Again , the better and easier to understand your infographic is , the chances of this happening have a better shot of increasing . If a person ca n't understand your infographic , they 're not going to share it . <p> Infographics Spice Up Press Releases <p> There are so many press releases put out every day that it 's hard for a new business to stand out from the crowd . Separating from the pack is made much easier when using infographics alongside a press release . Content marketers promoting a new business or platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infographics , so the potential and importance of the business is more evident to inquiring readers . <p> In infographics , comparative data can be particularly effective . For example , CJ Pony Parts just released this 2015 Mustang infographic , alongside a press release , which compares the muscle car 's impressive speeds to a Boeing 737 and a cheetah . It 's clean , clear , and highlights their product . Effectively integrating infographics and press releases , with useful comparative data like that may result in new clients and potentially even new investors . <p> Infographics Are Scientifically Proven to Work <p> According to Hubspot , 90% of information transmitted from the brain is visual . This means that infographics have a significant advantage when it comes to delivering content , meaning that the abundance of infographics should n't be surprising . Similarly to how content in an infographic is easily ingested by readers , companies also incorporate their logo into infographics to provide a sense of familiarity the next time readers consider their business . <p> Considering that infographics provide a unique way to tell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as useful press release add-ons and are scientifically proven to work , it 's easy to see why they are used as an effective tool in content marketing . Maybe one day holograms will be the most common way to illustrate data . For now , infographics remain king . Just make sure you do enough work to make your infographic stand out from the crowd . 
@@74694270 @3394270/ <p> The main reason behind why LLCs continue to be so popular seems to be the ease in which an entrepreneur can run an LLC , either by themselves or with a handful of other people . Limited Liability Companies do n't  require annual shareholder meetings , nor do they need meticulous notes on every debate that leads to a business decision . Corporations , on the other hand , can be a bit of a pain to run and have to contend with plenty of extra state regulations . But what sort of companies find dealing with those regulations worth the benefits of a corporate structure ? And what kind of businesses do better as limited liability companies ? <p> Typically , mom-and-pop shops , beauty/fitness businesses , and companies that provide business services all seem to do very well as limited liability companies because these sorts of companies are rarely interested in attracting investors . And , when you get right down to it , the best reason for choosing a corporate structure over a limited liability company is because you plan on trying to find investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip over any limited liability companies looking for capital a limited liability company can sell portions of itself in exchange for membership , and an operating agreement can be written up to accommodate outside investors and VC firms . However , corporations have been around for a lot longer than limited liability companies , and people are generally more comfortable with the corporate structure . <p> You give the corporation money , receive your share of the company , and that is that simple . It is also much , much easier for an investor to sell or trade a corporate share than it is for them to sell membership interest in an LLC . Because of that , most investors and firms will prefer to deal with corporations over LLCs . A small , local tire shop will probably not be interested in attracting outside investors . A high-tech firm starting up in Silicon Valley , on the other hand , will depend heavily on outside investment , and will thus want to incorporate . <p> Limited liability companies can convert into corporations , and if you find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to do just that .

@@74694276 @3394276/ <h> 5 Ways to Make Sure Customers Open Your Emails <p> Many of us spend a lot of time focused on how the wording in important emails affects the way they are received . From email marketing messages to business- inquiries- it 's important to ensure the emails we spend time writing are actually read . In order to have the best chance of getting customers to open and read an email , you 'll need to develop and use these five strategies to get your email seen . <h> 1 . Check Your Display Name <p> Your email display name is the most recognizable thing about your email , and catches the eye immediately when the recipient receives the email . In order to stick out from the message crowd in your crowded inbox , you must ensure your display name is set up correctly . <p> Always use your full name including your surname . <p> Avoid using generic mailboxes , email addresses or unhelpful From ' names in the sender name field . <p> Include a clear signature so that your recipient can easily check which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name . <h> 2 . Word the Subject Line Wisely <p> Along with the first paragraph of the email , your subject line is crucial in getting your recipient to act . A properly worded subject line has three purposes : <p> It grabs the reader 's attention within a split second . <p> It describes the action you want the reader to take . <p> It makes the message easier to refer back to , or search for . <p> When writing your subject line , try to accurately summarize your request and convey the importance of the email 's contents within as few characters as possible . A good way to do this is to ask a question in the subject , or start the email subject line with the action you want the reader to take ( for example , Reply needed : ' ) . You may also wish to refer to the recipient by name to give your email an extra personalized touch . <p> Many email clients also display the first sentence of the email as a preview . Use that sentence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avoid using any phrases that could potentially look like spam , or trigger an overzealous spam filter . The more specific your language , the better . <h> 3 . Use Smart Scheduling <p> Researchers have studied the best time to send emails , and have tracked response rates on each day of the week. - GetResponse studied 21 million messages and found that engagement was higher between 8-10 AM and 3-4 PM . Messages sent during those periods enjoyed a slightly higher open rate . <p> However , you do n't need to be an expert to understand the psychology behind this technique : simply focus on sending emails when you 're most likely to get the recipient 's undivided attention . <p> Look for patterns in your recipient 's emailing habits . If they tend to deal with all of their mail in the afternoon , that 's your best bet for a quick reply . <p> Do n't send emails when people are likely to have run out of steam . For example , some experts advise not sending emails on Thursday or Friday afternoon when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend . Figures from MarketingGum back this up ; they found that messages sent on a Thursday had the lowest open rate , and very few emails were opened on Friday afternoon . <p> There is an exception to the Thursday/ Friday rule . According to the same MarketingGum research , you may get a good response on a Thursday or Friday if the contents of your email relate to a weekend task . <p> You 'll need to take into account any timezone differences in order to get maximum engagement at the right time of day . <h> 4 . Do n't Send Any Further Emails Yet <p> The key is to make the task of opening , reading and responding to a message as quick and easy as possible . Sometimes you may feel that you missed an important piece of information and need to send a second email to update the recipient . If you can avoid this , it is better to wait until the recipient has replied to your first email . Too many urgent ' emails can dilute the attention given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can confuse the recipient and make it difficult for them to decide which message is most important . <h> 5 . Keep Up the Conversation <p> Once your recipient has responded , return the favor . If their email requires a response , send it as soon as you 're able to . Not only will this reinforce your reputation as a good communicator , it will inspire confidence in your recipient . They 'll know that you 're reliable and quick to respond to their questions so , in return , they 'll be more likely to respond to yours right away . 34788 @qwx654788

@@74694283 @3394283/ <h> Working at Home : What They Never Tell You . <p> Employees used to see the option of working from home as some sort of gift , bestowed by the management for hard work and sacrifice . A day at home meant a day of sleeping in , watching trashy tv and , maybe , calling in with a made up list of all the things you accomplished while at home . Then the next day you pay for your twenty-four hours of debauchery by making up all the work you missed , cursing yourself for not actually doing anything while at home . <p> That 's no longer the case . Thanks to the wonders of online hyper-connectivity , now your boss can actually check in with you at any time , be it through e-mail or Skype , and ask to see exactly what you 've been doing all day . And , sadly , watching a Maury marathon and making a chocolate shake does n't  count as work . Despite this , many people still see the option of working at home as the easier route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice quiet corner , away from distractions so you can get some work done and let things rest at that . But there are some things that people just do n't  warn you about <p> Doing your job from home is n't just about being able to go to work without pants . <p> 1 . The fact that people are going to want to see your face . Remember when I said your boss or manager may end up Skyping you throughout the day ? Well that means you are going to have to show yourself to other people , which also means you should probably take a shower and get dressed . I know , I know you thought you could wear your sweatpants and Team Building Exercise 99 shirt all day . The last thing you want is to look like you just woke up when you get a random call from your office . <p> Also , this means making sure you have a good spot for receiving Skype calls . Is your floor covered in pizza boxes and clothes ? Well , then you better make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner and a nice , clean wall and set up shop there . Whoever ends up calling in probably holds steadfast to the old image of an employee lazing around all day at home on the companys dollar , so make sure it does n't  look like that 's all you did . <p> 2 . You are going to have to prove you are actually doing work , which may mean working harder . Life is n't fair . Even if you do the same amount of work at home as you do in the office , management may still think you are lazing around all day at home . This is especially true if you regularly work from home like I said , the old stereotypes are hard to shake . And it is up to you to prove that you are a hard worker , regardless of the setting . That means taking on extra tasks , finishing work early , and making sure to consistently update your office about what you are doing . <p> You may be able to avoid morning traffic but in turn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are plenty of employees out there who would love the opportunity to work at home , so you are not only fighting against those normally gunning for your job , you are fighting against people who would do anything to never have to drive on the freeway during rush hour again . And that is a strong motivator . <p> 3 . You 're going to miss the office , or at least the free coffee . Remember when you looked in the mirror and said you 'd give anything to get away from all that gossip , bickering and noise in the office ? Well , I 'm sorry to report that you will miss that noise after a while . Human beings are social creatures , and though we get upset when our coworkers ignore us or refuse to turn down their music , we still like to be around other people . <p> You may soon find yourself looking forward to the check-ins from work , staring longingly at your Skype window , hoping someone will call you . Or , at the very least , you 'll start e-mailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a much more regular basis than you ever thought possible. - Plus you 'll now have to pay for all that coffee you drink , and when the pot is empty you 'll always be the one who has to refill it . <p> So while working at home can be very enjoyable , you should not treat the opportunity like a chance for a vacation . You still need to get dressed and work hard , even when there is n't a manager looking over your shoulder . So the next time you are angrily stewing over office life , remember that some things , like work , are simply inescapable . 34788 @qwx654788 
@@74694284 @3394284/ <h> Business Basics : How to Start a Non-Profit Corporation <p> We have written on non-profit corporations before , but as we only dedicated a sliver of a paragraph to how you actually form a non-profit , we felt the topic was worth revisiting . A non-profit corporation is a great way to fulfill a philanthropic pursuit , and if you are looking at dedicating your life to charity , then running a non-profit may be right up your alley . Forming a non-profit corporation is actually very similar to forming a regular corporation . <p> Step 1 . Find a business name <p> Your non-profit is going to need a name just like with any other standard corporation . That name needs to be unique and , typically , has to include the a designator like Corporation or Incorporated , though not all states require that . <p> After you 've confirmed that your corporate name is available , you have to actually form the corporation by filing what is normally known as your Articles of Incorporation . The forms usually are n't  too complicated , and normally just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its registered agent , and its directors , as well as the corporations purpose for existing . <p> Step 3 . Write your mission statement and bylaws <p> The first part of this step is very , very important because your mission statement is one the key documents that the IRS and state tax agencies will review when determining whether or not to grant the corporation non-profit status . What do you hope to accomplish with your non-profit ? Who do you want to help ? What sort of a vision do you have ? - You need solid answers to those questions before you ever begin to raise money . Along with your mission statement , you should draft corporate bylaws . Though not normally legally required , they will be the set of rules that guide how your non-profit is run , so they are important to have . <p> Step 4 . Hold an organizational meeting <p> Once your Articles of Incorporation are filed , you should hold an initial organizational meeting to appoint corporate officers and any new directors to the board . This initial meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets its annual budget . You must also keep minutes for this , and every subsequent , meeting as the IRS or state tax agency may wish to review them . <p> Step 5 . File for tax-exempt status <p> Finally , once your articles are filed , your boards are set , and your bylaws adopted , you file for non-profit status with the state and federal governments . The IRS requires would-be non-profits to file Form 1023 and pay a fee , after which the agency will review the company and decide whether or not to grant tax-exempt status . The form is very detailed , and requires that you disclose all compensatory arrangements and answer a series of questions . Some states also require their own forms before exempting corporations from state taxes , so check with your secretary of state or department of corporations to see whether or not Form 1023 covers your state . 34788 @qwx654788

@@74694295 @3394295/ <h> The Recipe for Baking a Strategic SEO Cake for Business <p> Most business owners are well aware of what content marketing is . Fresh , engaging content attracts people to your website by encouraging search engines to index it . When users search for information online , your content comes up according to the most relevant search results . With online marketing , the focus has always been on keywords , specifically the words and phrases people enter into search engines to find you online . Although these keywords are important , the means of targeting these terms has evolved . One reason for this change is the way Google delivers search results using context and user intent , rather than relying on just phrases and keywords for everything . <p> Understanding Contextual Links <p> Contextual links are links that you insert into specific words and phrases found in your webpage content . Once a user clicks on the linked keywords , they send them to another website . Contextual links differ from regular links because you use targeted keywords from the actual content of your website , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to send your visitors . <p> Google considers contextual links within your page content to be natural , which gives you ten times the chance of ranking higher in its search engine . Regular links usually show up separately , on the website sidebar or footer . Contextual links are also embedded within your content , and Google prefers them , considering them unique and giving them greater weight . The result is a higher Google PageRank ( PR ) and Search Engine Results Page ranking ( SERP ranking ) , which attracts more visitors , expanding your reach . <p> Think Like Google <p> Google produces search results based on user intent , the main goal of the search , in conjunction with keyword or phrases , which enables the site to implement a variety of algorithms to deliver the best results . Keep these features in mind when creating contextual links : <p> Auto Complete " When a person starts to type into Google search , it will attempt to finish your phrase for you based on previous searches . This is useful to both the searcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test your keywords and key phrases in order to fine tune your content strategy . <p> Local Results " Once you sign into your Google account , Google looks at your computer 's IP location , and provides results based on where you are . For example , if you do a search for car washes , it will list the ones in your local area . <p> Did You Mean " When people type into a search engine , they often misspell words or letters . To offset this , Google offers alternative suggestions to help them find what they are looking for intuitively . <p> Knowledge Graph " Google 's Knowledge Graph is an ever-growing collection of data that includes images , videos , maps , facts and statistics . This information can help you discover what Google associates with the terms you and your visitors are using . The goal of Knowledge Graph is to help people research topics quicker and more in depth with ease . <p> Google Analytics " Although there is a slight learning curve when setting it up , Google Analytics provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of attracting and retaining visitors . <p> The Importance of Intent <p> When you create your SEO strategy , consider the content and keywords in your website in regards to the intentions of your visitors . Next , take your visitor 's intent , and use it contextually in your content to target your audience even further in their search results . <p> For example , let 's say you run a business that remodels bathrooms . The first thing you want to do is create a list of common keywords and phrases related to what you do i.e. bathrooms , custom bathrooms , and bathroom design . But do n't want to stop there go a step further and consider the words and phrases that match your user 's intent . Match context with content to identify effective content ideas by answering the following questions : <p> Who is my target audience ? <p> What are their problems and needs ? <p> Why are they searching for my website ? <p> Where are they located ? <p> Which of my services do my visitors inquire about the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three basic types of content that are contextual-link friendly : <p> Sales-Centric " This is content you can use to increase sales and conversion rates , such as information about a new product or the announcement of a sale or special promotion . <p> Give and Take " Use this content to ask visitors to provide contact information in exchange for a free email newsletter or special webinar . <p> Remember , when you create contextual links , use keywords that are relevant to your articles , your website , and where your contextual link points to . They must look natural where they sit in your content , so Google will give them the highest ranking possible . One way to determine if your contextual keywords are effective is to look at site ranking reports . According to Posirank.com , a top SEO reseller , site ranking reports can provide invaluable insight to how your marketing efforts are working for your company . By using analytical tools like site ranking reports and Google Analytics , you can avoid practicing SEO like tossing darts blindly at a dartboard , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keyword stuffing , SEO tricks and duplicate content . The smart computer users of today know the difference between relevant content and those that contain nothing but meaningless fluff . Be sure to create content that attracts your target audience , instead of sending them rushing to find the exit button . Give them the information they seek and want to share , and your content will continue to work for your brand for a very long time to come . <p> Andrew Johnson is a longtime business owner and online entrepreneur .

That protection , however , is limited , which means that your mark could be used somewhere else in the country or , depending on how far apart the two parties are , the same state . The extent to which you can pursue litigation for trademark infringement is also limited , unless you register . To make matters worse for those who forgo registration , the United States typically prefers a first-to-file system , rather than a first-to-use , meaning if someone beats you to the USPTO , they may be able to claim the mark as their own as they registered it first . <p> Registered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not have to register a copyright there is an international understanding of an artists natural right to own their work .

You are , after all , afforded some protection for unregistered intellectual properties , and pursuing registration can be costly and time-consuming .

As much as he was worried about copycats stealing his idea , he needed to prove to Y Combinator ( a startup funding company for digital entrepreneurs ) that the concept could succeed .

Positive beliefs are good as they reinforce a sense of self-worth and will ultimately help you build the confidence that you need to be successful . <p> Negative beliefs on the other hand hamper progress and should not be entertained .

If the members of the team hit their marks , then success is going to be in abundance for the entire team . But if one team member is unable to uphold their responsibilities , that requires everyone else to work even harder . <p> While this competitive drive can sometimes be exactly what a business needs to grow , the fierce- competition that comes with working in sales can sometimes lead to a loss in motivation among its team members . Seeing the same person always surpass their sales goals can be disheartening to other members who are having a hard time hitting the mark . That is why keeping your entire sales team motivated matters so that everyone can continue to do their best and keep the company moving forward . <p> Create a Positive Team Atmosphere <p> Sales can often be perceived as a dog eat dog world where it 's every man , or woman , for themselves . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't work for everyone . A great way to keep all of your sales members motivated is by implementing a solid team atmosphere where everyone knows their role and what they can bring to the team . Keep it friendly with plenty of feedback provided . Even on the best sports teams , the star players ca n't win every time without the input of other members . The more that the team can be cohesive , the more likely your business will be successful . <p> Be Willing To Listen <p> Some teams work great with very little micromanagement . Others , however , still need input , whether it 's accolades or feedback . Even if your preferred management style differs from your team , it 's important that you are able to listen and find out exactly what makes them strive to their best . You can also utilize the team as a whole for better conversation and listening practices . For example , the leaders of the team can give pointers on how to succeed , and those still training can learn from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another are the ones that work well as a whole and find ways to make things work better for everyone involved . <p> Give Them the Right Tools <p> Nobody likes working in an atmosphere where they feel as if they are destined to fail , no matter how well they do . That is why it is your responsibility to give your sales team the right tools that they need to succeed . Be sure to utilize a variety of tools that will help with sales and offer training courses and other resources that people can partake in if they want to increase their individual skill sets.Reward Them Well No matter what resources you offer , for some people it 's simply going to come down to the brass tacks : compensation and incentives . If you want your sales team to stay motivated and competitive , you need to provide them rewards " whether its money or bonuses " and recognize their efforts . Give your team a goal with an incentive included for reaching it and they will stay motivated to get there . <p> Be Consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your team puts in , but they should also remain consistent . Nobody wants to work for a sales competition that they do n't know if they 'll be rewarded the same every time . Employees will be hesitant to push themselves harder if they do n't think the reward is worth it , or if they simply are uncertain of what the reward is all together . <p> With enough time and the right practices , you can keep your sales team motivated and continuing to aid to the success of your company in the long run . <p> Robert Cordray is a freelance writer for Income.com and expert in business and finances .

There is a strong assumption that MBA students are trained too generally and that they lack decision making skills from a lack of real world experience . Can they be trusted when left unattended with helping to run your business ? These are undeserved and unfounded assumptions as MBAs bring real value to small businesses . <p> The EMBA Advantage <p> If you 're willing to hire from within your company , you can pay for your employees MBA program . EMBA programs allow your employee to work while attending school .

By using proper judgment when deciding on sending your employee for training , you could end up with a loyal worker that becomes core to your operations long term <p> Better Communication <p> A popular connotation is that MBA graduates have a lot of " book smarts , " but lack any real-world experience and communication skills .

@@74694313 @3394313/ <h> How to Manage a Business that 's Open 24/7 <p> Businesses that operate 24 hours a day tend to have their own unique operation structure and vary from one type of business to the next . But when you do n't have a set closing time in place , how can you handle issues that come up that 9-5 companies do n't face ? Here 's how to keep your business running smoothly from the AM to PM with the following tips ! <p> 1 ) Have a manager you can trust <p> A responsible team member you trust should be delegated as being in charge for each shift in the schedule . Be sure that each supervisor is properly trained , understands what tasks must be done on their assigned shift , and knows how to delegate out duties accordingly to the rest of the team . <p> 2 ) Be fair with employees <p> If you do n't have one or two people who prefer the overnight shift , scheduling can get tough . Rotating shifts is usually the fairest way to work , but switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful overnight shift is to offer employees an incentive to work it . Monetary incentives usually get the best results , but survey your employees first to find out what they want . If you run a repair business that is open 24/7 , like Advanced Roofing Company , the best option may be to have someone on call at night . This way you can still meet the customers emergency needs , but everyone can just take turns being in charge of the late night calls once a week or so . If you must have someone work the graveyard shift every night full time , try hiring someone specifically for that position so that the terms and hours are agreed upon in advance . <p> 3 ) Have a plan for sick leave <p> Businesses that are open twenty-four hours a day need a plan in place when someone calls out sick . Nursing homes and hospitals tend to hire several employees on a per diem basis . In other words , they only work when someone calls out sick or goes out on scheduled days off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts with little notice , so have a plan or a list of employees willing to work graveyard shifts worked out in advance . <p> 4 ) Communicate <p> A lack of communication among employees and management is , unfortunately , very common . One way to curtail problems is to put a communication log in place so that employees and management alike know what everyone is working on . You also need to make sure that you regularly schedule staff meetings . Use this time to take suggestions from your employees on how to improve business and the work shifts . <p> 5 ) Stay on Schedule <p> Just because you operate 24 hours a day , does n't  mean you can skip tasks that most businesses do at closing time . Have a schedule in place for any cleaning or sanitation that needs to be completed , as well as cashing out registers . By doing this , you 'll ensure that you stay on top of daily tasks and do n't  get behind or overwhelmed . Divide tasks for shifts so that one team is n't doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy during the night , for example , have the bulk of the cleaning and organizing done during that time . <p> Businesses that operate 24/7 are special in that their problems are much different than a business that is open for even twelve hours a day .

The- flexibility of working from my home has been phenomenal , but after working- almost 20 years for someone else , I realize that an office environment- works well for me , even if using co-working space . While I can work- virtually anywhere , I am more productive outside of my home and it allows- me to maintain a divider between home and work life . If I had to do it all- over again , I would have invested in some sort of shared or office space- after developing proof of concept in order to maintain the boundary and be- able to turn completely off at times .

If I had to do it over again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea just how difficult it was going to be and the first people we ended up going with just were not able to do what we needed .

" I 'd think I 'd spend more time considering what I could do or make that could- be repeated and scaled up to generate more revenue at the same rate of- production . Its important not only to see increases in revenue but also to- have something attractive to a buyer when it comes time to exit the- business . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of the recession , and grew- rapidly . My business partner and I had to master all skills quickly , and- wear all hats at all times . It was from this experience that we learned the- skills necessary to manage a fast-paced company in a demanding industry , - and to be highly successful while doing it . Looking back , there are- certainly things I would do differently . The past 6 years have been a- learning experience and we have significantly improved the way things work , - which ultimately correlates to how successful we 've been , and why we have- been continuing to grow ever since we began . " <p> 8 . " Instead of wasting months on development , planning and validation , I would- have figured out the shortest path to my customer , execute on that path and- get my first customer . Learn from my experience , listen to the feedback and- rinse and repeat . " <p> 10 . " If I was starting my business over again , I 've have taken steps to get good- people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoestring ( and a- broken one at that ) , I originally had to do everything myself . The thrift- that made it possible for me to survive and then thrive in the beginning , - quickly became a hindrance when I delayed hiring people who could do any- number of specific tasks easier , cheaper and far better than I could . " <p> 12 . " I 've been in business for over 5 years , and if there was one thing that I would have done differently it would have been to hire salespeople earlier on . I had been doing all of the sales and production in the early days , and by hiring salespeople sooner I would have saved myself HOURS of stress and been able to grow faster . " <p> 14 . " When I first started my business , I should have done a lot more research- into the legal aspects of owning a business . Corporate entities , taxing , - state of incorporation , etc . A DBA just does n't  cut it . I took the steps- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I needed- to pay attention to the most important thing , running my business . Doing- paperwork instead of servicing your customers taught me a major lesson , try- to eliminate business hurtles by researching and planning out ahead of time . " <p> 15 . " I would have begun to build a team of people that I could trust early on and delegate tasks according to strengths and expertise . Running your business as a one woman show is limiting , daunting and leads to burnout . " <p> 16 . " Looking back , I would have tried to get an investor involved so I had more backing financially for marketing . There are a lot of free ways to get your product out there but sometimes nothing can replace good old fashioned paid marketing . " <p> 17 . " I wouldve carefully watched and monitored my cash flow . When we started , - we just assumed business would improve every year and there would be excess- to put away and pay everything off . 10 years later , post recession , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter in the- beginning , we wouldve weathered the economic downturn and probably- continued to grow our practice while doing so . " <p> - Dr. Susan Lowery , Owner , C.H.I.R.O. Health Center , PC <p> 18 . " I have been an entrepreneur for slightly over 10 years now . I have enjoyed the good , the bad and the extreme ugly of being a business owner . One thing I would have done differently when I started out would have been to effectively vet who I picked to handle my accounting . In addition , I would have also been more involved in that area of my business as much as I was in growing my business and providing excellent service to my clients . Failure to do this in the beginning created challenges years later . Lessons learned . " <p> 19 . " As entrepreneurs its easy to feel like we need to do everything ourselves , but how preposterous is that ? I am dreadful at a lot of things , and- talented in a meaningful few . If I could go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I possibly could to build the strength of the company , - even if that meant eating a bit more Ramen than anyone ever should . " <p> 21 . " Many things I would change but #1 is in regards to hiring . The team you- build is critical and you leverage for success since you cant do it all- alone . Some of my initial hires were value detractors instead of additions. - I was smart enough to make everyone ( including myself ) a contractor to- start with so it was relatively easy to break off . The other mistake I made- was not breaking off as soon as I realized they were not a good fit. - Lesson learned : Hire slow , fire fast ! I have an amazing team now . " <p> 22 . " I would have published a how-to book sooner and also created a product . Automation is key to business growth and development . Those selling a service have to work in the business much longer than those selling a product/good . Due to social media and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story that has not been told or share overly used tips . Timing is everything in business . First to the market in either category ( good/service ) gains . " <p> 23 . " What I would have done differently is start out adopting the motto we have- now : People Before Profit. - Oftentimes business owners focus too much attention of turning a profit , - which can quickly get you off track . But the key to success is pretty simple : focus on the people first- and the profits will come. - Its the same business model Starbucks , Southwest Airlines and other- successful companies have . Its our model too ! " <p> 24 . " If I had to do it over again I would have allowed more of- myself to be expressed in my business instead of trying to fit in in my- industry . I am a small business owner but early on I attempted to take on- the persona of a corporation from the verbiage on my website , the suits I- wore ( although Im more comfortable in jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a couple of years but once I realized that it was more- stressful to pretend to be something I was n't instead of being myself my- income , influence and peace of mind all increased 100 fold . " <p> 26 . " The one thing I would have done differently is said yes more often. - Lots of missed opportunities and not always about the money . Said- yes more often to lunch and coffee , because you never know where a- conversation may lead to a new contact , business , or another lunch with- more interesting people . Now I say yes more often than not because- someone obviously values your company and the conversations can be- great . " <p> 27 . " Over the last 4 years of my business we have mastered marketing and lead generation . If I could do it again , I would have started this in year 2 and not year 12 . This would have allowed me to build my sales team faster . " <p> 28 . " The main thing I would have done differently is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , and that has been important . Every day , week , - month of advantage makes a difference in the fast-moving- software-as-a-service business . " <p> 29 . " My biggest regret is focusing on perfection instead of just getting to- market. - As a founder , you want to carry out your vision exactly as it appears in- your thoughtful mind which means spending countless hours focusing- on trivial details and trying to implement everything you think you know- about business. - The only way to truly perfect your vision is to try it and test it with- your customers . Otherwise , you 're just guessing . " <p> 30 . " We would have re-thought our website . We used outsourced technology for- far too long . If your website is or delivers on a core part of your- customer value proposition , you need to own engineering in-house . This- allows you to be responsive , flexible and constantly iterate your product- to meet the demands of your customers . " <p> 31 . " My biggest regret is not getting rid of weak people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business . I knew in my gut they were not up to- snuff but out of loyalty to them I let them hang around much longer than- they should have . It would have been better for everyone to let them go as- soon as the signs were there . They became more insecure and threatened as- we grew which was not productive for the team . As soon as I let them go , the- culture got stronger and the bar higher . A-Team people like to be- surrounded by other stars . It is true that you should hire slowly and fire- quickly . I did not make that mistake again later on so learned it well the- first time . Lesson learned ! " <p> 32 . " I was originally a co-founder of Solid Cactus , a company which I sold in 2009 to the Web.com Group , a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq ( WWWW ) . When times started getting tough in late 2008 , I did not respond quickly enough to the changes in our business . We were like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy had to be temporary . Important changes needed to be made , most importantly , a workforce reduction . Both myself , and the other co-founder , Scott Sanfilippo tried to hold on as long as we could hoping that the economy would improve . My advice is that sometimes changes have to be made and they may be difficult . " <p> 33 . " In my first business I thought I could bootstrap my way to where we needed to be for our next big move . We would need a ton of cash to make the next big move . Despite incredible scrimping , great growth and creativity , it was two years in when I realized there 's just no way to get to the next level by bootstrapping . My optimism kept me from getting a capital infusion when we could best capitalize on it . Worse , I kept the business going for another 18 months because I did n't  want to close a reasonably profitable venture though it was clear my interests were starting to stray . At this point , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings to me and to the business . " <p> 34 . " The one thing I would have done differently as a business owner is- develop a content strategy at the onset . The internet is evolving the- traditional business landscape into one that is heavily focused on creating- relevant and valuable content for your target audience . We only recently- began investing in a serious content strategy and it is beginning to pay- off immensely. - While content is not our product ( we are essentially a research firm that- provides experts to legal and financial firms for litigation support , due- diligence , and investment research projects ) , it provides incredible value- to the scalability of our online presence and our business as a whole. - Our content is our identity and the vehicle to deliver valuable content to- our visitors . " <p> 35 . " In a previous business , I would have actually spent the time to clearly outline and articulate expectations of one another for the business . Caught up in the moment and good feelings of starting a new business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ways . However , only two of us are actually doing all of the work , and there is nothing that we can do about it other than dissolve the business . So , in retrospect , it would have benefited me greatly to define those expectations in detail at the beginning . " <p> 36 . " Every start-up has growing pains , but there are a lot of obstacles that can- be avoided by slowing down the pace and spending more time validating your- business model in a smaller scale before trying to expand . If I could go- back and start all over again , I would be more thorough and careful in- testing and validating my technology and service to avoid some of the- glitches we faced later on . " <p> 37 . " We should have planned for success better , - hiring mixologists sooner and having more liquid nitrogen and ice cream- base on hand . We also made a lot of purchases that were not necessary , or- could have waited . For example , we still would have purchased our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional website , having- mixnmatchcreamery.com take folks to our Facebook page instead . " <p> 38 . " As a lifestyle brand to chefs and- foodies , my customers are my friends , business advisors and critics . They- have and continue to shape my business with their insight , purchasing- patterns and interest . No matter how much feedback I receive , I can always- use more ! " <p> 39 . " Looking back I would have sought out a mentor to guide me through the initial hurdles of a tech start-up . Having someone in your corner that has walked the walked would have been priceless and educational . " <p> 40 . " I 've been an entrepreneur for 10 years , and in the food service industry for more than 30 . Looking back , the biggest change I would 've made would be to intelligently add resources for staffing . I wished I had started my business and added support staff in a more careful and flexible manner , one that did n't require a compromise of equity or partnership status . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafting favorable incentive and performance packages when bringing on hires . " <p> #1 ( Generic ) : I would not have done everything yourself . Instead , I would have outsourced as much as I can . As a small business , you have ton of things to do and yet you want to be in the market ASAP . I just spent too much time trying to get everything perfect incorporation , copywriting , marketing , testing . It was just too much for me to handle and as a result increased my time to market . <p> #2 ( Specific ) : I would have just used online incorporation . I used a CPA . It was just too much paperwork going back and forth and yet I do n't  understand how am I supposed to run my Inc . If I just used a good online incorporation site , I would have finished things with few clicks and would have had all my documents in one place . " <p> 42 . " As an entrepreneur who started a PR firm in 1990 , what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of my industry and- target market of clientele . I was so eager to have clients , I would- solicit my public relations services to anyone who would hire my firm. - Now , I understand that you must value your services and be proactive and- selective in choosing quality clientele . " <p> 43 . " I would stand firm on pricing yes we all want to be involved in a win-win , but I would be firm and not worry about if the person was going to feel my prices were too high . Instead I would invest that time into showing why I charge the amount I do for PR and believe that if they passed on it someone else would pick it up and enjoy the benefits ! " <p> 44 . " I should have been conscientious and made sure that I spent the majority of- my time being pro-active rather than reactive . Being pro-active produced the- customers in the first place and as time went on I got caught up trying to- micro-manage the back-office processing of new inquiries on daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my time being pro-active and- increasing the new business it would have forced me to find a way delegate- or simplify the other tasks and I would now be seeing a much larger business- that is far more profitable . The pros would have far outweighed the cons . " <p> 45 . " I did n't plan cash flow by month . The challenge was that I did n't take into account receivables that would slow my cash collections . While I ran a slight profit , I did n't have enough cash to operate . I had to add more cash into the business- which created a personal financial strain . " <p> 46 . " The saying patience is a virtue is definitely something I wish I took more- seriously when I was starting out . As a younger entrepreneur I was always- ambitious on the hunt for more . Over time I realized that results dont- come over night in many cases , instead they take time and effort but when- they kick in , they are that much more valuable . Ive come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward but I cant make up- the time I had spent doing things differently . " <p> 47 . " I would have sold products first before building them . We ended up building- a lot of functionality and throwing it away because we did not try to sell- it for real money before we built it . There is a difference between what- people like and what they will pay money for . Moving forward , I will get- MOU or pre-payments before putting in lots of effort in building the- product . Ability to sell your product for cash is the real product market- fit . " <p> 48 .

@@74694317 @3394317/ <h> How to Apply Performance Management at a Startup <p> I 've thought long and hard but I just ca n't think of a large , successful company that does not implement performance management . Famously , Jack Welch , CEO of GE , was a huge advocate of it. - The reason is probably fairly obvious . Performance management helps businesses achieve results . How so ? By ensuring that all employees are performing at their best and pushing in the same direction . <p> So why do n't start-ups embrace performance management ? Typically , there are a number of perceived barriers and questions small businesses have about how it 's done . How do you set up the process ? Do you need an expensive system to manage it ? Is it too much effort for the ROI ( return on investment ) in the end ? <p> Do n't worry start-ups there are only five key steps for implementing performance management that you need to keep in mind when getting started ! <p> 1. - Set company objectives . <p> Invest time to think through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what the timeline on that looks like . Consider how to convert that long-term strategy into annual tactics and even quarterly objectives . This will enable you to be specific about what you require from each person or team for any given timescale . It also provides the framework for being able to track how you are progressing , as a business , against your long-term strategy . <p> 2. - Establish a dialogue . <p> When your company objectives are clear , you need to communicate this to everyone on your staff . Whenever you implement something new , there 's the likelihood that people will feel hesitant . Introducing performance management is ultimately in a brand 's best interest , but it may not seem so at first . <p> That 's why it 's so important that you 're able to be open and honest with your team . If you 're not already speaking to each person for at least an hour every couple of weeks , then you need to start doing so . Use this time to understand what it is that drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a genuinely open and supportive way will ensure that the next step is straightforward . <p> 3. - Put targets and goals into place . <p> Having discovered what your team 's goals are , it 's time to figure out how people can set out to achieve them. - This can be accomplished through the setting of targets , and , specifically , SMARTER ones ( i.e those that are Specific , Measurable , Attainable , Realistic , Time-bound , Evaluated and Re-Evaluated ) . <p> Set aside a few hours with each person . - Start the session by letting them know upfront that the objective of performance management is to help people to be the best they can be at their job and that by working in a fairly scheduled , planned out way , the company will be much more successful which ultimately works to make them successful too . <p> Outline what the company 's long-term strategy is , what the tactics are for that year and how that 's broken down into quarterly company objectives . This gives people the necessary context in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will understand how their own work is linked to the company 's plans . <p> 4. - Monitor . <p> Establish regular formal reviews with your team to discuss how they are progressing with their targets . This will give you an opportunity to praise great work , provide ideas or suggestions on anything that seems unclear , and to encourage anyone who needs extra motivation . <p> 5. - Repeat . <p> When you reach the end of the year , you should find that your employees have achieved great things and feel good about the process . The business will have taken an important step to achieving its long-term strategy . But do n't use this as a chance to sit back and take no further action . Performance management is an ongoing process and it needs to be regularly implemented and reviewed in order to ensure long-term success . <p> Performance management is n't just for big , established businesses .

The Sound of Music certainly made it seem easy to say goodbye if you use a jaunty little tune to accompany your adieu , but the reality is often very different when a beloved employee is moving on from their current job position to another place for various reasons . They might be retiring . Maybe they need to relocate for family or for a bigger salary . They might even be an intern who finished up the semester and is planning to intern at another position afterward . <p> No matter what the case , you ca n't help but feel the sad sentiment creep up inside of you . You worked alongside this person on projects and deadlines and bonded over silly inside joke emails and group meetings . You probably got lunch together at some point and maybe even hung out outside of the office . They were a stable and dependable part of your life- and the business . That employee brought their own special touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately left behind an imprint on your life and most likely the lives of others in the office who worked with them . <p> Here at MyCorporation , we value our associates and the energy and talent they bring to the office each day . Creating strong relationships together as a company unit as well as outside with our customers is important to us . There is a saying that many hands make light work and beyond just hands , many unique voices and- personalities- - make companies light-hearted as well as trustworthy and down to earth . When you work with a great person who gives their all and goes above and beyond to shine , - every day becomes an adventure together . Whether you 're breezing through the shining days together or weathering a storm of complications , you know you would n't be able to do it all on your own . <p> here 's how to send off that associate with all the best wishes . <p> Get together for a goodbye lunch Depending on how pivotal the role of the employee to the company is and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire office along or at least those who worked within their department . If you are a fairly small business , you may just want to have lunch be a one on one session between the CEO and employee on the way out . Make the affair light-hearted while out together and recall great times together with plenty of laughter . <p> Offer to send along a written recommendation You can use a letter if you want , but these days its best to request for one to be used on your LinkedIn account . Future associates and employers ( hey , you never know just how many career transitions you might have ! ) will be able to read that recommendation and see the type of work you are both capable of and the- personality you bring along to the table . <p> Communicate often There are n't  many employers who appreciate unprofessional farewells from employees . For these situations , it truly does depend on the type of relationship the pair had together though . In many cases , the employee might believe they 're leaving with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot , but in truth for many employers all it does is burn bridges . You never know whether or not you might encounter this person again later on in your life , so it is best to keep your emotions in check and exit as gracefully and dignified as possible . If your relationship together was strong , be sure to stay in touch . Email often , friend one another on Facebook , and check in with the others life as much as you can . An employee never has to wait for their boss to initiate the connection either- a little " how are you doing " email sent on the spur of the moment never fails to put a smile on your face ! 34788 @qwx654788

However , people still had questions about registered agents , as well as the benefits and pitfalls with choosing a third-party service like registered-agent.com . So we decided to re-visit the topic and dedicate a post to answering some of the most frequently asked questions we 've received . Also , if you have n't read it already , we recommend first reading our last post on registered agents as it answers the more basic questions . <p> In what situations would I need to designate a third-party as my registered agent ? <p> A registered agent is needed anytime you form an LLC or incorporate , and you typically will want to name a third-party as your registered agent if : <p> You formed your LLC or Corporation outside of your home state . <p> You do n't  have a physical address <p> You can not guarantee you 'll be in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a registered have a physical address in the state you do business in and that the agent is available during normal operating hours. - Naming a third-party registered agent solves these issues since it is their job to be available to receive important paperwork . And , if the registered agent service has a multi-state presence , you 'll be able to go with that central agency even if you decide to expand outside of your home state , which makes the whole process much simpler . <p> Couldnt I just have a friend who lives in-state act as my registered agent ? <p> You sure can ! Like we said above , anyone with a physical address in the state you do business in can act as your registered agent . However , there are some pitfalls with choosing a non-professional to provide RA services . The first is that you really , really have to trust this person not only will they be responsible for receiving services of process , but the state usually delivers important reminders and forms to your registered agent . If they blank on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself falling out of compliance with the state . Sometimes it is just worth paying for professional services . <p> What are the benefits in choosing a professional registered agent outside of my business ? <p> Everyone in your company , including you , is going to be insanely busy as the business is being built and grown . Since you do n't  need many qualifications to be a registered agent , most business owners assume that is n't a very important role and that they , or someone else in the company , can handle it . However , do you have the time to sit down and separate junk mail from important notices ? Do you know how to respond to state and legal notices ? Do you know when , exactly , everything needs to be filed by ? These are things you can learn , but if you 're already busy running a business , it is all too easy to forget about that growing pile of mail . A good , trustworthy , professional registered agent can file all necessary renewals , keep you up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretely inform you of any legal matters . <p> Registered agents perform an important , but largely misunderstood , role in a business . They act as confidant and gate-keeper , sorting through the mail and notices sent in by the state and helping keep your business in compliance . Because of the role they play , you really need to consider your options carefully before choosing a registered agent . <p> If you have any questions , feel free to leave them in the comments or call us at 1 ( 877 ) 692-6772 were happy to help out ! 34788 @qwx654788 
@@74694321 @3394321/ <h> Four Ways to Completely Ruin A Skype Interview <p> Our CEO Deborah Sweeney wrote her Four Tips for Skype Interview Success over at the Forbes Blog last week , so we decided to write a response looking at the four ways to utterly ruin a Skype , or other video based , interview . Interviews via webcam are a fairly new thing , and most people have simply transferred what they would typically do in a phone based interview to their video interviews . <p> This guy is not being all that he can be . <p> But what if this interview is for a job you do n't  want ? How do you make sure you adequately scare away any potential employers and mark your Skype username as one to avoid at all costs . Well we first off recommend you do n't  try to scare away employers . A simple no will suffice if you choose to look for other avenues of employment . But , in the spirit of fairness and equality , here is our tongue-in-cheek response : four ways you can completely ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would at home . <p> There is no one to judge you when you are alone at home , so a stained t-shirt and some baggy sweats are perfectly fine if you want to spend the day vegging on the couch while watching re-runs of Maury . However , Maury is n't going to hire you . One of the best ways to completely ruin your chances at landing this job is to dress like you are n't  going to be leaving the house for a few days . Unkempt hair , unshaven , dirty clothes ; all of these and more can be used to thoroughly disinterest the interviewer . Do n't  forget , they can see you and everything that you are doing on camera . When you are talking to someone on the phone , they may not be able to tell you have n't showered in three days and are currently drinking a beer at 11 in the morning . On Skype , it is pretty obvious . <p> 2 . Use your regular username . <p> Are you known by the handle hotpartyanimal4567 ? Well then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be something you are willing to share with your friends , potential employers may not want to know your level of hotness or about your affinity for partying . If you want to ruin your chances of being hired , be sure to use the username you registered back when you were a Freshman in college and Skype was the hottest new thing . That is of course unless you have a normal username , like your actual name . Dialing that wont leave a sour taste in the interviewers mouth and works to establish a good first impression . Or that you at least know how to register more than one username . <p> 3 . Plop down in the middle of a noisy/well-used room . <p> Everyone has that one couch that is simultaneously beat up , gross , and covered in animal fur , yet is the most comfortable piece of furniture they own . When company comes over , they refuse to even touch it , which means all the more comfort for you . But there is a reason no one wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the seams ; it looks gross . And looks are important when you are using video chat software . If you want the interviewer to question your hygiene and ability to take care of yourself , then using that chair is a great way to do it . Better yet , make sure the room the chair is in is completely ruined . Beer cans , pizza boxes , dirty dishes , animals sleeping all of these show you do n't  really care how much of your personal life is shown . And , if you do n't  care about something like that , it is unlikely you will try too hard to make sure your professional life is much more in order . <p> 4 . Browse the internet . <p> Are your Farmville crops ready to sprout ? Is there something really , really , really interesting on the front page of Reddit that you have to read ?

This blog post will help you examine some of the crucial issues that come with moving and how to deal with them as well as access the following six areas . <p> Your Needs and Situation <p> You first need to thoroughly assess exactly why you are moving into a commercial office building , as this affects how and where you plan to move . <p> For example , if you are setting up an office outside of your home because you need to hire more employees , then factors such as availability of public transportation , parking spaces ( for you and potential employees ) and desk space will be critical to the decision making process . <p> If you are moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new clients or projects in the pipeline , you might want to consider a longer-length lease with the possibility of expanding the hired space further in due course . <p> Budgeting and Costs <p> Carefully considering and calculating the costs involved is key for efficient planning in order to ensure your move does not end up costing you more than you can afford . Budgeting ties in with a strategic relocation plan to help keep finances in check with the processes involved . <p> Additionally , do n't forget to think about the costs other than just rent . There may be additional business taxes to pay ( depending on where you are ) and you will undoubtedly have other servicing costs to think about " cleaning , heating/AC , insurance , WiFi , and more <p> The Lease Itself <p> Obviously you hope that your business will continue to grow , but what if things go wrong and you can no longer afford the rent ? You should check whether you have the option to break your lease and whether you can renegotiate or otherwise get out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start , before you sign anything . Do n't feel like you have to sign a five year lease just because that 's how it normally works " everything is negotiable . <p> For a small office space you may even be able to negotiate a monthly rolling contract , at least for the first three months before you then commit to a longer contract . <p> Process Management <p> Think about whether you will still run your business in the same way once you have moved . This is a good chance to modify how your business operates and it is a good idea to formulate processes and consolidate before you put your efforts into growth . <p> For instance , you may want to : <p> Discard all unnecessary items and make sure unwanted files are disposed of securely . <p> Archive old documents so that they do n't take up too much office space . <p> Scan and destroy old paperwork and aim for a paperless operation from here on . <p> Invest in new equipment that saves space and works more efficiently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arranged . <p> Technology <p> You probably already know what technology is most important for your business , but if you are planning to invest in upgraded software or equipment you will need to think about getting this in place as soon as possible to ensure that your office is operational right away . <p> Do n't take for granted that the building will provide wireless connections , due to issues surrounding security , the volume of tenants within the building and the service provider . Ask your landlord in advance what facilities are provided and plan ahead to ensure that you have the right services in place . There is nothing worse than taking ownership of your new office and then realizing that you will have to wait two weeks before your internet access is set up ! <p> Office Layout <p> One of the most exciting and important things to consider when moving into your first office is the layout of the space and where everyone will be sitting . You need to be practical when making decisions about layout because it affects the efficiency and productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a number of teams within your business , or are hoping to hire once you make the move , it is perhaps the best idea to position the teams based on the synergy of their output . This will make sure that communication is not hampered . <p> Also think about lunch options for employees , as eating at the office desk can make a mess and be smelly depending on what kinds of food are brought in . A cafeteria or break room keeps things organized and has a positive impact by providing an additional informal space for employees to refresh themselves and interact with each other . <p> You may also want to keep growth options in mind too . If you plan to grow your business significantly , think carefully about how much room for growth your office provides . You need to strike a balance between keeping costs low , but also provide enough space " since moving offices in six months time again can be pretty expensive . <p> About The Author <p> This guest post was contributed by George Peters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses and office owners about air conditioning installation and servicing .

In order to keep employee turnover to a minimum , it helps to create a positive work environment that not only attracts loyal employees but make them want to stick around as well , and if you 're wondering how to improve your employee success rate , here are a few tips to get you on the right track.Knowledge of the Company <p> In order to attract talented employees to your company in the first place , it 's important to make sure a positive image is associated with your business 's brand . Community involvement and company values can help separate your name from competition , so make sure to bring up any ways that your company culture is represented in the initial interviews ; make it known what charities you 've donated to and any volunteer work the staff engages in to give your future employees a good idea of what you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to make sure to let your candidates know what kind of work environment they can expect . If you run a tight ship , make that known from the start . When a really great candidate comes in for an interview , it 's tempting to want to sell them on the job , but it 's also important to be realistic about what they can expect . In other words , do n't make it sound like a loose , low-pressure atmosphere if , in fact , it 's a high strung deadline-driven position . This will help you hold onto the employees that you hire because they 'll start the job knowing what they 're coming into instead of not knowing , finding out later on and making the move to jump ship . <p> Employee Incentives <p> Businesses that have supportive , loyal employees are the ones who are giving their employees more reason to stick around other than just a basic income . Practical benefits such as health/life insurance , paid vacation time , and sick leave are all things that mature job seekers look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives included , you 'll give them very little reason to look for employment opportunities elsewhere . <p> Thorough Training Programs <p> Nothing turns off potential employees faster than walking into job that does n't offer adequate training . It 's nerve-wracking enough being immersed into a new experience and if they are thrown head first into the workplace without any education or training to help give them some direction , do n't be surprised if they start looking elsewhere . Develop a thorough training course that allows your employees to learn on the job as well as have some private time with the instructors to clear up any area that they 're unsure of . - By giving your employees enough time to get comfortable and familiar with their daily duties and responsibilities , you 'll start them off feeling confident and capable instead of overwhelmed and stressed . <p> Room for Advancement <p> When advertising your job openings , make any opportunities for advancement clear .

However , by giving future candidates a good indication of what to expect if hired and what future positions might be available , as well as providing them with proper training and incentives , it should help open up the doors for loyal , dedicated employees to step in and join the team . <p> Arlene Chandler is a freelance writer who loves helping people make financial and career-oriented choices to improve their day-to-day lives .

Make sure you understand how to use your site- analytics- to find out more about how users are finding your site " is it through Google or other search engines ? Referrals from other websites ? Analyze how customers are finding you and compare your search engine ranking for various terms to that of your competition .

Create a great website design and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what you can to keep them there by making your website pleasing to look at , interactive and helpful . Make it easy for customers to navigate your site with a clean layout and design . Study how other online stores organize their websites , and use their sites as a model .

Display privacy policies , security badges , anything that shows that your site is trustworthy and safe to log into and save information on . After all , your website is trustworthy , right ? <p> 4 . Make products easy to find . If your site is well-organized and you include a search bar , customers will be able to easily find what they need ( and maybe items they did n't  know they were looking for ! ) Make searching the site as easy as possible so potential customers do n't leave and go somewhere else . <p> 5 .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold your products in their hands to get a feel for the item and its size and weight and even try them out to make sure they work as expected .

Give them a deal they cant resist . Want free shipping ? A complimentary sample ? Batteries included with a product that specifies batteries are not included ? Often customers do their research on multiple sites before making a purchase , so once theyve landed on your site , offer them a great deal to ensure they make their purchase there rather than moving on to see what the competition has to offer . <p> 7 . Offer great customer support . Some customers may want to buy from you , but have problems when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product that are not answered on your website . Still others may buy a product and be dissatisfied with it . If you offer great customer support with the option to call or email in the event of a problem , not only will you gain more customers , you 'll retain these customers and get their positive recommendations . Users will continue to come back to your site again and again if they know you 're responsive to their needs .

@@74694361 @3394361/ <h> How Small Businesses Can Successfully Reach Their Customer Base <p> The traditional sales funnel is dead , at least according to McKinsey &amp; Company a global management consulting firm . Replacing it is a circular sales cycle . It used to be that marketers could rely solely on direct mail and other marketing initiatives to " push " information to consumers . Since consumers information channels were limited , and research avenues were often hidden from the public , consumers relied on various marketing initiatives to make decisions about future purchases . Today , consumers can easily " pull " information to them online through social media websites and review-based sites like Yelp . This diminishes the power of focused marketing initiatives by companies . Consumers now rely on strong word-of-mouth over a corporations advertising campaign so if you want your small business to succeed , you 're going to have to change the way you reach your customer base . <p> Step 1 : Use Branding and Information Marketing <p> Its not that direct marketing does n't  work ; its that branding has just become more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet before making a purchase . If you have a brand , start doing more PR . If you do n't  have a strong brand , create one . To do this , you can hire a PR firm or take to the social media networks to join the conversations your customers are already having about what you offer . - This gives you the opportunity to become a thought leader and in turn brand your business as a go-to company in your niche . <p> If you craft the right informational material , you can spread it all over the web and it will act as a point of reference for consumers . As long as your informational material is purely informational and relatable to the customer not promotional consumers will appreciate it and use it in their decision-making process . <p> Step 2 : Use Offsite Analytics <p> Offsite analytical tools like Google trends , Compete , and Comscore will help you hunt down your potential customers and tell you what they 're really searching for . For example , if you have more document ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , it gives you a clue as to where people are finding you on the web . <p> Step 3 : Use Onsite Analytics <p> Google Analytics is probably the best-known service available for analytics with good reason : it works . Analyze your sites traffic patterns . What websites are they coming from ? Do you get more referral traffic or do you get mostly Google organic traffic ? Using onsite analytics will also tell you how long people stay on your site and even how long people stay on each page . You can even track visitor flow , which is how people move through your site . For example , if users come to your site and land on your " about us " page , but then leave immediately , there could be a problem with this page that you need to address to keep visitors flowing through your site . <p> If visitors soak up all of your content , see the sales page , and then click away from your site , then there 's something wrong with the sales page . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your customers away as quickly as possible . To do this , hire a designer to re-do the look of the page and make the call to action stronger , or work with a copywriter to make the text on the page more effective . Test the new looks and see which performs better . <p> Step 4 : Use Social Media <p> Social media is n't an end-point like most businesses think it is . Using social media means interacting with your prospect-base and existing customers . Listen to what they have to say . Often times , they will leave you feedback on your Facebook fan page , tweet you about something they like or dislike about your company , or write up a review on Google Places or Yelp when they have strong feelings about your company . It is equally as crucial that customers know where to find you . To do this , it is important that you link to your webpage from any e-mail correspondence , social media networks and listings . This will ensure that your customers are able to find you when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 5 : Make Your Site More User-Friendly <p> One of the best ways to facilitate the consumer decision journey is to optimize your website for usability . Do n't  be afraid to link out to review sites with both good and bad reviews . Try not to delete every bad review you get " bad reviews are often rooted in real customer experience . Instead , if you are able , respond to the bad review and remedy any situation the review complained about right away . By showing this publically , customers will respect you more and appreciate you not trying to push them into a sale . Finally , making your navigation menu intuitive , and putting the most important content right on the homepage , will go a long way to improving your companys image . When people get a good first impression about you , they tend to spread the word .

@@74694365 @3394365/ <h> 5 Questions Small Businesses Should Ask Before Spending <p> One of the keys to startup success is the ability to efficiently manage scarce resources . Among the scarcest resource for any small business is money . Startups have to adhere to a budget and know what and where the money they are spending is going to . <p> Asking the right questions can lead small businesses down the right path . When it comes to money , here are five questions that small business owners should be asking in order to get the most bang for their business ' buck . <p> 1 . How will this expense help repay itself ? <p> One thing I learned in the early days of running a business is that expenses must bring a return back . It might seem obvious , but were conditioned to think we need certain things that , in reality , we do not . Eyeing each purchase you make with an eye towards return brings much needed focus back to the company . <p> Some expenses might not have clear returns . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to buy for an office to function properly with . Others expenses might be a bit more clear. - Seminars and training that boost skills within various departments can lead to measurable results back to the business . <p> 2 . Do we have a plan for follow through ? <p> A few years ago my small online publishing company was having issues with our web host . We knew we needed to switch to a new provider , and wanted to get it done ASAP . With a little research I found a highly rated host with reasonably priced dedicated hosting . All good things , right ? <p> As we found out , we had not considered many aspects of the follow through . Most notably , we did n't  know how we 'd go about migrating our data to the new servers . That turned out to be a prohibitively expensive endeavor . Because we could n't afford the move , we had to eat the money spent on the servers . That pushed back our move considerably . Always be sure to research the follow through details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time well spent . <p> 3 . Is this the best price possible ? <p> Many , if not most , of business-to-business transactions involve a flexible price . It might not seem that way initially , but there is often room for negotiation . Savvy small business owners should never buy products or services without feeling out the flexibility . <p> In the book , Never Lose Again , authors Steven Babitsky and James Mangraviti pose 50 questions that can help anyone get a better deal on almost anything . Small businesses can use the tactics from this book in order to negotiate better prices in exchange for concessions that they can more easily afford . <p> 4 . Are we getting the most for our money ? <p> If a small business wants to stretch its dollar , it can look to variable expenses . For instance , a small business can reduce its electricity bill by reducing consumption . According to power giant ABB , many companies can save by using less energy , since buildings account for such a disproportionate amount of energy usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring savings . If a small business can take some of these energy saving tips and turn them into $20 monthly savings , that 's $240 per year . Find three or four such areas for your business in order to maximize the savings made . <p> 5 . What will happen if we do n't  spend this money ? <p> One of my publishing partners asks this question every time were about to write a check . While we still write the check most of the time , we 've saved a great sum by carefully considering the consequences of not taking this action .
