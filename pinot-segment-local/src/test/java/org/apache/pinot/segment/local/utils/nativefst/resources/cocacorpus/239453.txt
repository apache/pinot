@@23909081 @3909081/ <h> How To Find and Fix Hum Extended <p> This is the extended version . There is a shorter 3-step version available here . <p> Very few audio or video systems are dead quiet . There are usually always a few hum related problems . If your system has a bit of hum , is it the transformer or a ground loop ? How do you determine the source of hum and what can you do about it ? <p> Sometimes hums and buzzes are quite obvious , sometimes not . The hum noise ' usually comes in two flavors , a low non-irritating drone ( 50 or 60 Hz ) or a slightly higher pitched buzz or raspy/irritating angry insect ' sound ( 100 or 120 Hz ) . Video hum is usually seen as diagonal bars across the TV or screen of a projector . <p> The low non-irritating drone hum is usually internal to the equipment and is mechanical in nature . The higher pitched and more irritating buzz ' is typically found emanating from the loudspeakers and is usually caused by a ground loop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fortunately it is also the easiest to solve . <h> Find out what 's making the noise <p> We first need to divide our search into two categories ; mechanical or electrical induced hum . <p> A mechanically induced hum or buzz is equally easy to determine . Place your ear very near to each piece of your electrical equipment and again , listen for hum and buzz . If you hear a hum emanating from within your equipment , we would refer to this as mechanically induced noise ( as opposed to an electrically induced noise ) . <p> To see if it is an electrical problem , make sure your system has been on and warmed up for at least 10 minutes , then simply place your ear near the loudspeaker ( with no music playing ) and listen to determine if the hum or buzz is coming from your speaker . If it is , then at least one component of your problem is electrical . This is the most common and usually caused from a ground loop . <h> Ground loop hum <p> Ground loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they are by far the most common . <p> You typically have a ground loop when the hum or buzz comes out of your loudspeakers . <p> Ground loops are a result of differing ground potentials . This means that the ground of one AC source or equipment source is at a different level than the ground of another AC source or equipment . This difference is usually amplified in the form of audible or visible hum . Visible hum is usually seen as diagonal bars across the video screen . <p> Tracking these types of hums down is more difficult and below we have assembled some helpful tips . It is critically important you follow these steps one at a time and do n't miss any . <h> Tracking down ground loop problems <p> The easiest way to figure out where ground loop problems lie is by the process of elimination . You need to determine where the hum or buzz is coming from within your system . If it 's a video hum problem , use a known good source like a DVD player rather than cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always assume that it 's either a connection problem or , more likely , a cable problem . Our experience has shown that poorly shielded video cables cause more hum problems than just about anything else . <p> In an audio situation , the first suspect in our hunt would be the power amp or the receiver that is driving the loudspeaker . To see if the power amp or the receiver is the culprit , turn them off , disconnect its inputs and turn it back on again . Go back to the speaker and place your ear in close proximity to see if the hum is still there . If it is , then you have a problem with your power amp or receiver and you should seek help from its manufacturer . <p> If the hum/buzz goes away when you remove the inputs to the power amp , your next step will be to reconnect the amp and move further down the chain . If you were working with a receiver or an integrated amplifier , you will need to jump to step 4 . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power amp , your next step would be to disconnect all inputs to the preamplifier or processor . Once these are disconnected , and the preamp or processor is connected only to the power amplifier , turn the system on and again , listen for hum . Should the hum now appear , it is a problem with your preamp or processor or their interaction with the power amp . Before returning the preamp or processor to the manufacturer , try a cheater plug to break a ground loop . Cheater plugs are simple devices that convert a three prong AC plug into a two prong AC plug and in the act of converting three prongs , to two prongs , they disconnect the ground from the wall socket . Try one of these on the preamp , or the power amp , or both . <p> If an AC cheater plug work , replace it with a HUM X. Using a cheater plug may not be the safest alternative . <p> If you determine that there is still no hum present when the preamp , processor or receiver is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your various inputs one at a time . After each connection , check for hum until you discover the humming culprit . <p> VCR 's , surround processors , and any device that is connected to a television cable or satellite dish can cause a loud buzz and should always be suspect . If , by the process of elimination described above , you determine it is a component like a VCR that is causing the hum/buzz to occur , and using a cheater plug or removing the ground pin on a PS AC Series Power Cable does n't help matters , it may be necessary to isolate the cable connection ( CATV ) with an isolation transformer . This inexpensive device is available at most Wal Mart , Radio Shack or department store type outlets and is sometimes called a matching transformer ' . If you have problems finding one , call your local cable TV company for advice . The matching transformer will be placed between the cable TV cord and the VCR , TV or processor . <p> Just remember , take the system down to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system up with as many pieces of the system missing or not connected . Keep it simple and get it to the point where the hum 's gone . Then start adding back components one at a time until the hum returns . <h> Mechanical hum <p> If it 's mechanically induced hum/buzz it is usually heard coming from inside the equipment . The causes for this are poorly designed power transformers and/or DC on the AC line . The PS Audio Power Plant series can remove DC from the AC line if that is the problem . <p> Mechanically induced hum is caused , almost entirely , by the transformer . If you suffer from this noise problem , you 've probably also noticed that it 's intensity varies depending on the time of day , sometimes even the time of month . The reason it varies is due , in large part , to the quality of the AC line voltage , the construction of the transformer and how much DC is on it . <h> Why do transformers hum ? <p> We could use the tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that might get us sidetracked . <p> The short and simple answer is that transformers hum because of an effect known as lamination rattle ' caused by DC voltage on the line or poor construction or both . Lam ' rattle occurs in all transformers to some degree , that degree being related to the quality of the transformer and the quality of the line voltage .

But since the stereo disc was launched , the angle was defined at 15-- and was changed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SL-15 became SL-20 . <p> To adjust your VTA properly , you need to find the adjustment on the base ( post where the arm is mounted to the turntable ) of your pickup arm that allows you to raise or lower the back ( the end opposite of where your cartridge is ) of your tonearm . Look at your owners manual ( if you still have it ) , go to the audio dealer from whom you purchased it or contact the manufacturer for help in finding out how to make this adjustment . CAUTION : On most tonearms , you will NOT be able to adjust the VTA while playing a record or with the stylus even resting on a record ( without destroying the record and/or cartridge cantilever or stylus ) . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! <p> For initial setup of your VTA , place a medium thickness album ( no 180-gram reissues or flabby RCA Dyna-flex Red Seals ) on the turntable and place the stylus on the record ( do not have the turntable rotating for these adjustments ) . With the stylus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cartridge should be parallel to the album . By this , I mean the flat area near the front of the cartridge where the cantilever/stylus assembly protrudes from the bottom of the cartridge . CAUTION : Make all adjustments on the tonearm with it sitting on the tonearm rest . You now have a good starting point to find where the nominal VTA setting is located for your arm/cartridge combination . Select 3 records from your collection with which you are familiar . You will use them to find fine tune the nominal starting point for your VTA adjustment . One of them should be a normal thickness album ( London CS 6xxx or STS 15xxx ( orange silver label ) , RCA Shaded Dog , non 180 gm . Chesky , etc . ) . The next should be a thick album ( Decca or EMI reissue , Mobile Fidelity 2-xxx series , etc . ) . The third album should be a thin album like an RCA Dyna-flab . <p> After setting the starting point of your VTA session using your eyesight , listen to a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for is the seniority of the strings , the air around the instruments and the width of the hall . If you set your VTA correctly for nominal thickness albums , you will hear the following : <p> 1 . The medium thickness album will have extended stage width , a hint of air or rich harmonics around the individual instruments and singing in the upper strings without any stridency . <p> 2 . The thin album will have good stage width but the strings will sound unnatural , edgy and irritating . <p> 3 . The thick album will sound slightly muffled , with a lack of high frequencies and air around the instruments . <p> If this is not what you hear in your comparison , your VTA is not set properly for medium thickness albums . If the thin album sounds correct , the back or base of your tonearm needs to be raised about 0.010 ? ( 0.4mm ) ( the thickness of a cover of Ultimate Audio ) for medium thickness albums . If the thick album sounds correct , the base of your tonearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for medium thickness albums . A few passes at this and you will learn what to listen for when you adjust your Vertical Tracking Angle . <p> To reiterate , once you have found the correct VTA setting for a medium thickness album , you can use this starting point when you want to adjust your VTA for best sonics . For very thin albums ( flabby Red Seal ) , or Angel and late Columbia , you will have to lower the back of the tonearm by as much as 0.005 ? . For very thick albums and many of the Decca , Classic or EMI reissues , you will have to raise the back of the tonearm by as much as 0.010 ? or 0.015 ? . Also remember that during the course of the life of your cartridge , the nominal setting will change as the cantilever ages and flexes making it sound as if the back of the tonearm is too low . After a short period of time of focusing on the sound ( and not the music ) , you will learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment is correctly made , listen and enjoy the music .

Youve seen the + and the terminals on a battery before , and you know that getting these mixed up often means battery operated equipment wont function . Loudspeakers and amplifiers are no different . Unlike batteries , they will continue to work , just not at their best . <p> Its important to make sure the polarity of your loudspeaker is correct between both left and right speakers , and between the speaker and amplifier- ( receiver or integrated ) . <p> Polarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connector : red for + , black for - . <p> A properly connected loudspeaker . Note that red goes to red and gray goes to black . <h> Why does polarity matter ? <p> Polarity is important for two reasons , and both concern how the woofer and tweeter move . <p> Sound is generated by the- loudspeaker drivers ( woofer and tweeter ) moving back and forth , pressurizing the air in synch with the music . This moving air pressure is picked up by your eardrum and converted to sound in your brain . <p> When a musical signal comes from the power amplifier , the recording studio intended it to either move forward or backwards on what is known as the leading edge ( the point at which sound starts and stops ) . Forward motion happens first when the + ( red ) terminal of the amplifier and speaker are tied together properly . This honors the intent of the studio and the musician . <p> Secondly , it is of critical importance left and right speakers move together . If they move out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time the other moves backwards ) the sound will lack bass because the two speakers cancel each others sound pressure .

Then tighten the outer shell of the binding post down to hold it in place . <p> Make sure one spade connectors gold area does not touch another . <p> If you are using a wire , follow the same procedure to unscrew the outer shell of the binding post and note the small hole in the binding post shaft .

@@23909114 @3909114/ <h> Back to Basics <h> How Much Power Do I need ? <p> Power amplifiers , whether standalone or built into a receiver , integrated , or even our mobile phones , drive our speakers and headphones so- we hear sound . <p> Amplifiers produce Watts and , if you 've ever wondered why the term Watt is always capitalized , its named after a rather famous historical character , - James Watt , famous for his invention of the Watt steam engine in 1781- ( this was no small invention . It- fundamentally changed the world by ushering in- the Industrial Revolution , - in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world ) . <p> A Watt represents one Joule of energy per second- ( one amp of electricity passing through one Ohm for one second ) . But you do n't  need to know all that to figure out how much power it takes- to make your speakers come alive . Its actually simpler than all that . <h> Let 's start with the basics <p> Most of us have read countless reviews of loudspeakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called sensitivity or efficiency . This measurement is typically expressed is dB " and yup , there 's yet another capitalized letter . The dB or Decibel is named after Alexander Graham Bell of " hello Mr. Watson , can you hear me ? " fame . <p> Let 's say your loudspeaker measures 90dB . So , what 's that mean ? If you send- one- Watt into your speaker- and- place- your ear- one meter away ( 3 feet ) , you will hear 90dB of sound . To put that in perspective , - a train whistle produces about 90dB when you 're a few hundred feet away , while a loud rock concert is about 115dB , a jet engine 140dB . Sustained sound pressure levels of 95 dB or higher can produce hearing damage , but not to worry . Whens the last time you were subjected to 24/7 sound pressure ? <p> The thing about using wattage and dB as a guide to choosing proper amplification power is problematic , because the scales are not linear . It takes twice the power to get another 3dB- of amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the speaker . <h> Making sense of power <p> If you double the amplifiers power , you 'll get an additional 3dB at the output of the power amplifier . But , amplifier power is not sound pressure power . <p> Amplifier power causes the speaker drivers to move back and forth , creating sound pressure waves that move the air and we hear music . Sound pressure is what we hear and microphones record . Sound pressure is what a sound pressure level ( SPL ) meter measures ( in dBs ) . While the sound pressure is related to the amplifiers power , doubling the amplifiers power does not double the sound pressure . And , at the end of the day , all were really interested in is how much power do we need to make our speakers louder . <p> Right ? <p> If we want to double sound pressure , we need 6dB more amplifier power , which requires four times the number of watts . And , if you 'll recall , the scales we use to convert sound pressure into amplifier power are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponential pattern . <p> here 's an easy chart that explains what I am referring to . <p> dB Change <p> Sound Pressure Change <p> Amplifier Power Change <p> +3 <p> x1.41 <p> x2 <p> +6 <p> x2 <p> x4 <p> +10 <p> x3.16 <p> x10 <p> +20 <p> x10 <p> x100 <p> +40 <p> x100 <p> x10,000 <p> Basically , you need one hundred times more power to get another 20dB in sound pressure . That means if it took one Watt to make 90dB , itll take one hundred watts to make 110dB ( and 115dB is as loud as a rock concert ) . <h> Can too much power hurt my speakers ? <p> A common misconception is that having too big of a power amplifier connected to your speakers will damage them . This is like believing a powerful car will always go faster than you want . Neither is true . <p> Yes , a large amplifier gives you the potential- to release the blue smoke hidden in your woofers , just like a big engine in your car has the potential to get you busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . Do n't  turn your speakers up loud enough for your ears to bleed , and gentle on the accelerator pedal . <p> If you need something to worry about , try adding too small of an amplifier to your speakers . Too small of a power amp can clip the amplifier and fry your tweeter . <p> Bigger is better . <h> So , how much do I need ? <p> Much depends on your listening habits and your speakers efficiency . If you like loud uncompressed music and your speakers are 90dB efficient , 200 Watts is likely plenty of power for you . If you only listen to light classical , jazz and do n't  expect them to rock the house , 50 Watts is adequate . <p> Higher efficiency speakers , like horns , take very few Watts . That is because one Watt can produce 95dB of sound , which is already loud . Another 6dB of sound pressure will cost you four times more Watts " but still , were talking fewer than five Watts to produce more than 100dB of sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert levels . <p> In closing , its also instructive to recognize that most music is n't constantly loud . Soft passages fall well below the 90dB levels . This means that for most listening , the average Watts used by your speakers is perhaps ten to twenty max . <p> If you want the best sound , go for more Watts but never at the expense of sonic quality . <p> Not all Watts sound the same . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> Thanks ! You certainly have more than you need , but is it overkill ? I think not . here 's the thing . When you 're in an amplifiers comfort zone , that area that covers perhaps 30% of available power , you 're in its sweet area depending on the amp . <p> So if you are like me , and want unrestricted dynamics , then you 're likely in a great spot . <p> I would n't even say , Paul , that Watts do sound ! : - ) Sound is determined by the designers selecting and voicing the components and modules of the stereo system and matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each component has its sonical imprint depending on the distortions added . <p> Fair enough Paul , however I would argue the following . Take any resolving system and change a component in that system a major one like the amp and its likely itll sound different . And this is true even if you put in an identical wattage amplifier . <p> For example , say I have a BHK 250 in my system . Which I do . If I replace that with another 250 Watt amp , say an Audio Research , or a Pass Labs , there will be an immediate and obvious sound difference . <p> Hi Paul , I have 20 y/o VTL monoblock amps which have been completely recapped including the coupling caps . I enjoy the near real experience of a performance thru my setup , and I really cant afford a new system . I have to work with what I have . Regards , John <p> No worries . One of the nice things about low powered tube amplifiers is they clip softly . So even if you do exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's little worry about damaging the tweeter . <p> Paul I installed a 10 watt tube amp ( Nobsound ) that uses two EL34 bottles . I have a pair of Kef iQ10s that I believe are 89-90 db and the music just flows . My ATI 1502 will be resting awhile while I continue to tweak with various bottles . Great post ! <p> Thanks and as I just mentioned , tube amps clip softly so you 're likely ok . Just do n't  expect dynamics and a lack of compression though that 's not important to many people , preferring ( : good : ) the soft warmth over any other considerations . That 's cool ! <p> Hi . I have a pair of Joseph RM25XL speakers . I sent an email to Jeff Joseph asking about what sort of power I needed for them and his reply did n't  mention WATTS . He said to look for a HIGH CURRENT amp . So , how about a companion piece on " how much current " <p> ps Seems as if Jeff Joseph always demos his speakers with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the kind of answer that 's very helpful . Current is expressed in amps and amps times volts equals Watts . But again , that is all just engineering speak . <p> If Jeff wants current , then likely the speakers are impedance demanding . I can think on no other reason why a speaker manufacturer would suggest that other than impedance dips because there you need lots of Watts at low impedance . <p> The RM25XL has a stated frequency response of 32Hz 20kHz ( +/- 2dB ) . The nominal impedance is 8 ohms , with a minimum rating of 6 ohms . Sensitivity is 88dB , and recommended power is 11 watts to 250 watts . <p> hi Paul , i am probably in way over my head here , but i remember 30 years ago when selling audio , how all the big Japanese companies were pushing high watt receivers with super low THD . They would rate those silly things at 200W per channel , but the transformers were so small and those things in no way could drive a pair of Infinity or Dahlquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp , baby Ampzilla , or PS amp would had a lot more umpf to the sound . it was so hard trying to tell customers that those numbers were basically meaningless . and of course they would tell me they had " 200W speakers " and therefore needed the 200W Sansui or Kenwood receiver . so as you said all watts do not sound the same , or even are the same thing . <p> that was it . they would cite these incredible numbers but it was peak power . i think they got those numbers by using a basic 8 ohm resistor rather than speakers and so as you said , they were essentially meaningless . thanks <p> It would be helpful if manufacturers tested their amplifiers at 16 Ohms as in the old days . I think you would find that many amplifiers rated at 8 Ohms 200 Wpc would not deliver 100 Wpc into 16 Ohms , just as many amplifiers do not double output as impedance halves . Frequency response , distortion , etc. at 16 ohms would also be helpful in magazine reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand more current at crazy phase angles , many also have high impedances at various resonant frequencies , especially at low frequencies where I suspect voltage as well as current is important . Speakers with integral amplifiers and external crossovers , etc. , I reckon , are supposed to obviate these anomalies or at least compensate for them in some way , depending on the cabinet design of box speakers . One thinks of some subwoofers as a simple example . Comments , especially on 16 Ohm specs ? 
@@23909116 @3909116/ <p> As a techy , but non audiofile I will be using Sprout in a fairly simple multimedia setup , connecting a Samsung TV to it and streaming my collection of music from a NAS ( Networked Attached Storage ) using either Synologys AudioStatin software or PLEX through an AppleTV via airplay . <p> Any recommendations on the best inputs from the Samsung and/or the AppleTV ? Digital to Coax converter or analog through the Mini Jack ? <p> As far as the TV is concerned , if you use the digital output you 'll need to configure it to down-mix the audio to 2-channel LPCM as the Sprout is n't an AV Receiver and cant decode Dolby Digital or dts variants directly . For TV I 'd propose you just use the analog outputs and feed them into the Sprout rather than feed digital . If you do want to feed digital you 'll need to verify that your TV supports a COAX connection ( most TVs these days support only an optical SPDIF connection ) . <p> To my knowledge Sprout supports neither Apple Airplay nor DLNA/uPNP but rather accepts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codec or the enhanced AptX for wireless . If you do n't  want to go the wireless route with your audio streamer you can always connect up the USB digital audio to the Sprout for ( what should be ) pretty high quality audio . <p> I know Sprout does n't  connect via wifi , I was wondering about wired connections between TV , AppleTV , and the Sprout . And I was wondering about digital to COAX converters and if they work well with Sprout . <p> There are many inexpensive digital optical ( TosLink ) to digital coax converters ( $15 ) . - Given the price I would give converting optical from the television a try. - You will probably get better sound this way . <p> ( BTW , it is the same digital S/PDIF signal , just a different physical format . ) <p> Should be ok . Much depends on how the receiving unit ( Sprout ) handles incoming data . In this case , Sprouts really quite good at it because of the way we manage to remove jitter and other artifacts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remove jitter from a signal entering it through the coaxial SPDIF is a bonus. - At its price point I doubt that you are using a digital lens so how are you removing the jitter ? <p> Can you also she 'd light on when the first 100 Sprouts will ship ? - Thanks . <p> The receiver were using in Sprout is good at removing jitter . It does n't  do it completely but does well . What 's remarkable to me on Sprout is Bluetooth which we take the digital signal out of the receiver and run it through Sprouts receiver and DAC as well .

@@23909117 @3909117/ <p> Paul said only the display board and the chassis are re-used . All three boards ( I believe that 's analog , digital and power supply ) and the transformer are replaced . I would not expect a sonic difference between an upgraded PWD and a new DS unit . Ted agreed and said he was using an upgraded PWD himself . That 's my understanding , anyway . <p> Yes , power supply , analog board , and digital board are all replaced and fit in the same slots as the previous Mk II and Mk I versions , so sonically there would be no difference . If anything , do the kit and you can keep your fuses . <p> Stevem2 , not sure that is correct . My understanding is the Bridge has an on-board digital lens and that is the cause of the gapless issue . Filling up the buffer causes the gap . Now I will freely admit I 'm not an expert , and quite honestly I think there is a LOT of confusion on how the bridge operates and influences the sound . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer needed in the Bridge , but you cant just take it out . Would seem to simplify the design of Bridge II . Paul will need to clarify that . <p> Alekz is correct . The whole ( original ) purpose of WaveStream was to make Bridge One do gapless . To the extent it worked , the WaveStream beta did just that . I believe Paul has said that WaveStream will also be needed for Bridge II , although I 'm not clear as to whether it is absolutely essential to do gapless over Bridge II ( WS also let 's people play internet radio or any other source that they could play on their computer to the Bridge ) . Btw , I have gapless now using foobar2000 and the Bridge so it certainly can be done with Bridge One . WaveStream ( and foobar2000 with the right plug-in ) sends a continuous stream to the Bridge so there is no gap as the buffer fills up , except for the first track ( or on sample rate changes ) . <p> Stevem2 is right . WaveStream is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the PWD/Bridge . This can be gapless audio from your favorite player . It can also be Internet radio or any other audio services available on your computer . It will deliver any audio from your computer to the Bridge or Bridge Mk.II ( when it is available ) and the PWD/Bridge will play it exactly as it was sent . <p> Bridge Mk.II is supposed to be able to provide gapless playback from any UPNP/DLNA media server without any other requirements . I hope that its Ethernet services are considerably more robust than those of the original Bridge . <p> And : even if the Bridges buffer is many megabytes it only takes milliseconds to process the first block of audio through it and not many more milliseconds to fill it up . The buffer does not have to be full before data can be retrieved from it . <p> Not to poo poo on the parade here but , for $6000 this thing better wash my face , and take the dogs for a walk . IMO I think its a bit overpriced , unless someone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new technology , and for what it is supposed to do but , holy crap lemmings . SoI expect hate mail for this butjust sayin . <p> I just realized I made a mistake , Stevem2 said " wave " stream , with all this talk of the new DAC I got my head stuck on " direct " stream and missed his point , duh ! Yes Wavestream ( or is it called something else now ? ) will correct the gapless problem . Sorry for the mistake .

@@23909125 @3909125/ <h> Two ways to look at a problem <p> The problem with problems is they first need recognition . If you do n't  see something as a problem , you wont look for a solution . <p> Take AC power as an example . If your HiFi system displays a constant low-level grunge , or a bright tinge riding atop musics notes , chances are good you have an AC problem . Some recognize it as a problem and search for a solution . Others , either unaware or in denial mode , shrug their shoulders or blame something else . <p> The hard part is recognizing a problem exists in the first place . Its easier to pass unhappy results off by assigning them to fate . <p> here 's another example . If all sample rates and formats of digital audio sound the same to you , there are two courses of action : <p> Ignore it , believing differences do n't  exist . <p> Identify it , - and look for a solution <p> I typically take the latter . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything as it is but maybe not . In the second case two possibilities open up : 1st one acknowledges that the Fourier transformation and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem apply , and that the formats available are sufficient in the physiological circumstances . <p> 2nd one thinks that these theories are not enough . In the second case , one must perform new basic work . Much luck ! You have to find out which other degrees of freedom influence the reproduction and clearly identify it . <p> But the latter also applies when the first case is assumed to be true . I think not so much about whether an mp3 file is as good as a 44.1 / 16 wav file but rather think of the disput between the advocates of dsd and those of pcm . In the end I 've to conclude that some basic considerations must be considered in the music reproduction . My thoughts are that the speakers and the listening room still represent the limiting factors of a correct reproduction and perhaps even other things . <p> PS Audio can continue with working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? But whether this is a real great step forward , I would doubt as I also doubt that the difference between a wine can be tasted when it was stored for 20 years or when it was stored for 20 years and a week even by the best tongues and palates . <p> There might be a third approach , Paul : Put the problem out of the system ! Meaning : used batteries and supercaps instead of AC and listen to vinyl instead of listening to digital signal gained by reducing the information content of the original signal , being decomposed/deconstructed and reconstructed in a way far from perfect . : - ) <p> This is my day job . This is a subject I know something about . Of all the things I 've done in my life , this is the one I enjoy the most . <p> If you determine that you have an electrical problem , there are two ways to approach it . Try everything you can afford . Believe each salesman who has the sure cure for whatever ails you . Chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding yourself . Sometimes even if you do , your solution is overkill , you spent far more money than you had to . The other way to to measure the problem . How do you know what to measure that you are looking for and how to measure it ? Become an electrical engineer who specializes in these problems or hire one . Engineers who work with specialized technicians who know plenty themselves send the technicians or field engineers out to investigate , record electrical performance over time , identify the anomalies , and recommend remedies . Intermittent problems are the hardest to find . Just when you think you 've solved it , it can come back again . <p> Electrical Engineers have put anomalies into nine categories . Each can have many causes . Tracking them down is detective work . Sometimes the problems is small , simple .

Right now I 'm working on evaluating preventative measures , the failure has n't  occurred .. yet . But it is inevitable that it will . Every machine has a limited life and from the moment you turn it on , its days are numbered . What do you do when you read scads of technical papers written by the most authoritative people in the business and they do n't  even agree what tests are meaningful and which ones are n't  ?

As the systems , equipment , and legal codes continue to get more complex , the number of people expert at dealing with it is dwindling . Why ? Because outsourcing has eliminated the career path from being an electrical engineering graduate who starts out knowing nothing like I and everyone else did , to becoming a full fledged competent engineer . It takes at least five to ten years of apprenticeship under the tutoring of other engineers to learn how and that costs money . When the last of us are gone , the world will return to the 19th century . There 's no one around to pass the knowledge on to . Industry no longer wants to spend money on its most important assets , people . It cuts into the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry for the rant . In the end , I 'll have the last laugh .

Its a well-intended exercise doomed by a fundamental lack of understanding . It does not end well , but it probably resulted in many people walking away deluded with a false understanding .

I have discovered that 47k ohms seems to work well for both MM and MC cartridges . Since I use both and switch cartridges a lot , this discovery has simplified my life . <p> Paul , admittedly 47K is the most common loading for MM and MI cartridges , but it may not be " proper " for all of them . There is a very long MM post on Audiogon where several respondents reported loading up to 100K provided more favorable sonics .

I just think we need a safe place to come discuss other things of interest for us . I get so tempted to express my views on what 's happening today but then thanks for keeping it all about what the readers come here for . <p> I strongly doubt , Paul , that changing a component in a stereo system can be done without any individual bias ( expectation ) . That 's why in the early days of hifi few serious audio-magazine let perform double-blinded listening tests with up to ten unbiased reviewers . That was a most time consuming and costly procedure why these magazines soon stopped these efforts . I do not know any dealer who is not trained to bias the customer before listening by highlighting the advantages of his offers . I most appreciate the judgements of my audiophile buddies listening unbiased to my system always offering the same test tracks . If they refer similar sonic changes I heard by exchanging a component I can be sure that I could neutralise my bias . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic effects of power cables finally bought PS Audio power cables . : - ) <p> You 're correct Paul , and truth is , I do the same . My only defense is that I have worked really hard at optimizing each and every component for neutrality so the synergism is less dependent on individual components as possible . <p> Its interesting timing for this discussion . I have had a mind numbing number of changes to components over the years . I 'm very content with the system componentry right now . What 's interesting is that the CD player , preamp and amp are all made by the same manufacturer . This last weekend I realized that through the years , the best component combinations in the past have been where , at the very least the preamp and amp were the same manufacturer &amp; time frame of production . When I start mixing , there is always some small aspect missing , even though there can be improvements in all others . It begs the question : Is the main reason a munfactuer like Paul offering seperarate components so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer next level performance you need to separate them . Based on my observations over the years , it seems to be the latter , yet I keep trying the make the former work . <p> There is certainly value to keeping with the same manufacturer ( depending on the manufacturer ) if that group of products was voiced by the same set of people . I do know companies , British in particular , that have teams working independently of each other without a central voice and in that case , one has to wonder . <p> It seems to me jumping to conclusions is a fairly common human failing . We want answers to questions and we want them fast . Holding back judgement is n't always easy . Often we either like or dislike something immediately . They say a decision to buy a house or not is made in the first nine seconds while the next forty-five minutes are used to justify the decision . Better have curb appeal if you want to sell your house . Marketing people know this and use it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted to sell you the sizzle even before you 've gotten a whiff if the steak let alone tasted it . Its only later when we 've gotten ptomaine poisoning that we realize it was n't so good after all . Speaking about ptomaine poisoning , Paul do you remember your initial reaction to the Hypex amplifier ? You were so excited and enthusiastic . That 's the problem . You take equipment home that you 've already been sold on ( how generous of the seller ) and then you have a trial period to convince yourself how smart you were to choose it . I once knew and electrical engineer who was exactly the opposite ( no not me , a neighbor . ) No matter what he bought he took it back to the store for a refund . <p> Some say that after you get the sales pitch and high pressure to purchase from that sales gorilla , its best to walk out of the store , no matter what . You can always come back after some thought and consideration . -Same thing goes for listening . If it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again later . Frame of mind may have something to do with it . <p> And right along with jumping to conclusions is the danger of circular reasoning . The great Percy Wilson , an esteemed older British audio person and Gramaphone technical editor , loved to tell the Zanzibar Fallacy to some people describing the affect of a change in their system . The danger is that after getting used to a system its colorations become the reference . The Zanzibar fallacy can be googled . I heard it from Percy himself courtesy of Bud Fried of IMF and Fried speakers ( and Lectronics of City Line Avenue in Philadelphia if anybody is old enough to recall that ) . <p> I have been an audiophile for close to 50 years now and he longer it has gone on I realize how so much complicated it can all be . I will jist give one example . Over 10 years ago I obtained a one meter pair of WBT interconnects . I believe that they retailed for $1000 at the time . Anyway even today if used between an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if compared to , say the latest MG Audio Design interconects of today . But if I place these same German , WBT interconnects between an amplifier and preamplifier , the overall sound of the audio system goes kaput . IOver the years I have found that certain combinations of audio products may work in certain situations , but not in others . Another possibility is the paticular power conditioner one uses on certain audio products might not work with other audio products . There are so many variables in putting together an audio system . For instance , not too long ago Michael Fremmer found that one paticular power cord used with another audio product caused a noise problem . Simply by changing the power cord to another power cord solved the problem . The only way to be sure one has the best possible audio system possible would be for one , such as Jacob Heilbrunn , to copy Michael Fremmers entire phono front end and Wilson Audio speaker system , with its Thor subwoofer system . Of course , if one has the funds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have long misunderstood mag reviews assessment of an individual component , when that specific component may not synergize well within their system . The same piece may offer formidable performance when properly matched , along with efforts to tweak . I have read several posts , in which a cartridge ; for example , was entered in a cartridge shoot-out , only to be found inferior without taking table , arm , phono stage , loading , set-up and cables into consideration . Too often blog posts have statements suggesting the only way to determine the sound quality of a component is by direct comparison within that specific system . My personal experiences , having heard many finely set-up systems , has been to throw out the preconceived biases of whether the audio is sourced from digital or analog , tube or solid state ; but allow the entirety be consumed as a whole . This has better assisted me in realizing an added piece of equipment may require additional changes to eke the most out of it . <p> making changes in my system are nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that if there is a difference , a positive one can be detected and selected . <p> long term listening rather than quick A/B switching is preferred but the quick mode can be useful at times . i try not to make extravagant leaps but now and again , that 's what it takes . my audio research sp3a1 made that obvious . <p> spending huge on wires is another thing i avoid , i havent paid more than $100 for wire but did win a $1k acoustic zen silver IC and it IS gorgeous in sound and sight . 
@@23909141 @3909141/ <h> Bi-amp <p> To bi-amp or tri-amp is two use two or three amplifier channels for each loudspeaker . To bi-wire is to use one amplifier- and- two speaker cables for each loudspeaker . The two are very different in concept and performance results . Let 's start with bi-amplifying . <p> Bi-amping or tri-amping requires the preamplifiers output signal to be shared by the amplifier inputs ; either two or three depending on which you are doing . Let 's stick with bi-amping to keep the words fewer . Instead of connecting- the- preamplifiers RCA or XLR output directly to the input of a single power amplifier channel , as is traditionally the case , we now split the signal into two : one going to each of the two power amplifiers we need for bi-amping . The output of each amplifier is connected by its own speaker cable to the loudspeaker : one amp powers the tweeter , the other the woofer ( in a two-way ) . <p> There are several words of caution when bi-amping speakers . First , the input signals must be identical . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the XLR output for the other ( for multiple reasons , not the least of which is the 6dB gain difference ) . If the preamplifier has only one of each , which is typical , use a patch cord signal splitter . Secondly , the power amplifiers themselves must be gain matched " and closely . Some purists insist the power amplifiers themselves must be matched as well , but I think that philosophy ignores some of the potential benefits of the practice . <p> Once requirements have been met , the system should work the same as before , except now we have one power amplifier dedicated to the tweeter , another to the woofer . <p> So , what are the benefits and what are the downsides ? Much depends on how and why you are doing this " and there can be a number of reasons . <p> Tomorrow well start with understanding the traditional reason for bi-amplification . Well then move on to more exotic reasons that may make more sense . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 22 COMMENTS <p> If an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadblocks are there to using both outputs of the pre amp ? I am assuming that the pre amp will be able to handle the impedance drop in this case . <p> Bass Management provides you the ability to select the subwoofer and your main speakers crossover frequencies , and the subwoofer volume output level . Therefore unless you are using one or two amplified low frequency subwoofer 's , turn the main output crossover off . <p> Because you are bi-amping your Swan Diva 's full range , turn off the main output crossover and accept the fact that the preamplifier balanced outputs will be 6db higher in gain compared to the main output RCA connectors . <p> Looking forward to more on this topic . Using a Tube preamplifier myself , it has been a challenge to find a subwoofer with a high enough input impedance to not compromise the sound . ( It seems the ( preamp ) manufcturer recomends an amplifier input impedance of 20K or higher . Adding a subwoofer ( amplifier ) with its own similar impedance ( 20K ) in parallel with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I actually ended up having to place an additional item ( Apt Holman Preamp with 100K input impedance ) between the preamplifier and subwoofer to raise the impedance . <p> On a side note , the concept of an active crossover is great . But it would need to be of the same quality as the preamplifier to not degrade the sound ? Correct ? I 've looked at passive crossover like F-Mods . But it seems like I need to factor in the input impedance of the ( high pass ) amp to order the correct ( custom ) crossover frequency . <p> It appears you 're not speaking about the more conventional definition of bi(tri)-amping where the output of the preamp goes to an electronic crossover which splits the signal frequencies before the amplifiers . You 're sharing the full signal from the preamp with each amp and using the passive crossovers in the speakers . Will you also be discussing the use of active crossovers ? <p> Well traditional is in the eye of the beholder . Traditional to me is as I have described . A newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I am just an old dog . Actually , no doubt about that ! <p> I agree there are not a lot of actively multi-amped systems especially in home use but there are many in professional use some of which cross over to the home such as ATC and PMC . And there is an arguement it is superior to passive mult-amping since the amps have a much easier load to drive when its only a voice coil and not an LCR circuit in addition to the voice coil . I admit not having heard them much ( I 'm trying to cure that , only the Rogers LS5/8 for a month decades ago ) but my gut and hopefully logic says its potentially superior to passive multi-amping . <p> Here we go again . Suddenly more is n't less anymore , its more now . If you use different amplifiers for the woofer and tweeter , you have to determine if one is phase inverting and the other is n't . You have to maintain the same phase relationship as before or you will get a serious FR anomaly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active crossover is IMO a great idea . however , speakers above the woofer should be protected with series capacitors to prevent their being destroyed by LF transients such as turn on thumps . This is especially true for tweeters . <p> The first time I encountered this arrangement came as one of those " jaw dropping " moments . I was at an audiophile trade show probably in the mid to late 1960s . Two monster speakers were filling a giant ballroom space with jazz . Then the demonstrator turned on lights inside what werent a speaker enclosures at all but huge frames with cloth made to look like a speaker enclosure . Inside each was one Phillips Little David , a small tri-amplified three way speaker sitting on the floor in each frame . The rest of the large space was empty . Amazing , so much sound including amplifiers in that one small enclosure . <p> The only way to " fix " Bose 901 was to turn it into a two way biamplified speaker system . An array of tweeters cuts in at 6db per octave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel in the system . These tweeter arrays probably operate at around no more than a watt or two but are powered by a 100 wpc JVC receiver coasting along . It has the advantage of a built in seven band equalizer used to tweak the treble response and exclude any and all low frequencies . It also operates in class A mode at low power output . Thees also a passive crossover network in the tweeter array . Loudness matching is very critical . In addition to the Bose 901 equalizer there is another 10 band equalizer to correct mostly for its poor bass FR and a dual 7 band equalizer to adjust for program material . On many recordings , unless the " below 40 hz " filter is cut in , the 138 wpc Marantz receiver will clip and if the room lights are lit , they will dim momentarily when it does . Its also impossible to play phonograph records without that filter . The system nominally has an additional 8 db boost at 30 hz over and above the 18 db the equalizer provides while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would take several pairs and about 600 to 1000 wpc to equal the bass performance of Teledyne AR9 I have in another room . <p> Love the Posts as I prepare for a days work , its my gift before the plunge ! <p> Nice topic timing ! I was just troubleshooting an issue last night which is related to your topic . With my ears pressed against my speakers ( why do I do this ! ? ) , I noticed a buzzing osculating sound coming from the mostly the midrange driver . So I proceeded to unhook all my equipment to see what the culprit was . The culprit was the XLR to RCA cable that sits in between my preamp and subwoofer amplifiers . When connected this cable to my 2nd set of preamp outputs , buzzing osculating sound starts , even without connecting to the subwoofer amp . I swapped out this cable with a XLR cable with XLR/RCA adapter . When I added the adapter , the buzzing osculating sound starts , not with XLR cable alone . <p> My solution was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier while still using the XLR for the main amps output . Although I tried to compensate for the -6db loss with the gain on the subwoofer amp , I still was n't getting the same quality of system resolution that I was getting using the XLR to RCA cable . <p> They sell isolation Connectors in many configurations . I use them to stop him in home theater setups at times . Some devices just do like each other but always maintain a flower ground That 's all I have <p> I 've had a lot of speakers that were biamped . They all were designed for biamping ; there were passive components inside that provided impedance along with the drivers for the amps . When you use an active crossover between the preamp and amps and then go into the speakers drivers directly from the amps is there a problem with unknown impedance ?

@@23909148 @3909148/ <h> The Audio Cynic <h> Whatever Happened to Tone ? <p> During - the way-too-many years that Ive been involved with audio , a number of terms that were first used by JGH , HP , JA , and other initialed Editors , - have risen to common usage . Before them , I think you 'd have difficulty finding terms like " soundstaging " , " imaging " , " image specificity " , and the like . Along the way , the only term my parents and grandparents ever used to describe sound quality seems to have disappeared . <p> Whatever happened to " tone " ? <p> I think one of the reasons that audiophilic pursuits came to be viewed as the acts of a bunch of antisocial navel-gazers is the obsession with imaging . Yes , its important , and certainly imaging specificity aids in the creation of that holy-crap-theyre -HERE sensation we all lovebut is that all there is ? Oftentimes , I hear many audiophile-darling products sounding sterile , bleached , lacking bodybut boy , that image location is needle-sharp . <p> But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even listening to a church choir , its not all that easy to say " that third old lady in the soprano section clearly has a bit of asthmatic wheeze " , or " fourth chair violin is tuned half a semitone sharp " . One of the points of having a large body of musicians is that their sounds intermingle , intermodulate , and the group produces something altogether more - than just a bunch of separate , disparate sounds . And certainly , when one listens to music at home with a bunch of , shall we say , laymen , - they may say something like , " man , its like were right there " but they 're not going to say , " oh , Christian McBrides bass is clearly 3.2 meters to the left of and half a meter behind Dianas piano " . which might be the sort of thing you 'd hear at an audiophile society meeting . I exaggerate , but not much . <p> Were talking about the difference between listening to music for enjoyment , and as a social act or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my parents : as was true of many of their generation ( born WW I , fought in WW II ) they grew up with music on the radio , on records , in movies . Theirs was probably the first generation which could be constantly exposed to music without actually performing it , thanks primarily to radio . Music was heard over AM radio or on 78 records , both of which had rolled-off high ends , but could still sound very present and real , when done right ( go figure ) . - The music my parents favored was big bands or the small combos of Nat King Cole , Sinatra , Clooney . Melody was king . On those rare occasions when they spoke of the quality of reproduced sound , their touchstone was tone . <p> Even the kitchen radio was judged by that standard : rejects were said to sound " shrill " , or " thin " . The ultimate accolade ? " Oh , it has such nice tone . " <p> Look at the beautiful first-generation Fisher 500 receiver at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first real hi-fi receivers and a technical marveljust look at it . Look at that beautiful , golden-bronze sheen : that 's the visual analogy for the sort of sound that was sought in those days , warm and non-fatiguing andwell , - nice . Pleasant . Just what youd expect from those pictures of easy-chair-seated , - pipe-smoking , sweater-clad dad reading a book in a golden pool of light while the hi-fi played Copland or Kenton . It was an immersive approach to music , not an analytic one ; even when music was analyzed in school , it consisted of following individual instrumental lines in a symphonic piecenot scrutinizing placement of singers in the " soundstage " . <p> I suppose I 'm a bit of a hypocrite , kvetching about the overimportance given to imaging , while owning speakers that are famously good at just that . But the magic of the Spica Angelus to me is just how unobtrusive they can be , with that imaging well-matched to good control at the frequency extremes , and sound that stays the same all over the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves , pointing out just how pinpoint their imaging is , how high theyll go , and by God , youd better sit RIGHT THERE . Pfui . As my then-10-year-old son once said of Diana Krall , they just do n't  " sound sincere . " <p> Give me a nice , humble , sincere speaker any day over those quarter-million-dollar monoliths . They just do n't  have good tone . <p> You 'll note that the big Fisher at the top of the page has bass , treble , and loudness controlstone controls . Is it a coincidence that we lost tone controls about the same time that high-end gear lost tone ? I do n't  think so . <p> One last thing : I admired the late Harvey " Gizmo " Rosenberg , and had many phone conversations with him , though we never met . He may have been a flamboyant kilt-clad crazy in public , but in private he was a generous , patient man very willing to share his considerable knowledge of audio .

He has been in and out of the audio business for over 40 years , and each time he returns to it , he becomes more cynical.He does not intend to go quietly . <h> 17 COMMENTS <p> I guess I can agree with your general thought pattern here . ( Hows that for a vague opener ? ) I do like to have imaging and a nice soundstage , but for me most importantly is that the timbre of the instruments or vocalists is right . Not perfect , not exacting , but *right. * In a sense , a lack of coloration , to where you can unmistakably know which instrument or vocalist you are listening to . Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the timbre correct first and foremost . Could that be called " tone " ? Maybeor maybe not . A " nice tone " can mean different things to different listeners . Yet I know exactly what that phrase conveys . <p> The frequency extremes are also importanta missing low octave will take a lot of the listening pleasure away from me , sadly , and a dulled high end will just sound , well , dull , just as piercing highs are uncomfortable and unnatural to listen to . Superior soundstage and imaging are icing on the cake . <p> As usual , a lot of it is to do with physics , as our acuity to different frequencies changes depending on the sound pressure level . One of the greatest developments , that has stood the test of time , is the Quad TILT control . The loss of easy-to-use tone controls is a major regression in audio . How easy would it be these days to build a digital pre-amp with programmable tone controls ? Its also to do with speakers . The ones I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale at low volumes . One of the main reasons why I bought them , something the previous speakers failed at completely . I suppose it could be argued that 300B amplifiers and I had one no less than 5 years ago is a tone control , in a positive sense . Excellent article , many thanks . <p> After wandering the halls at Axpona for a couple of days in search of anything that has Tone , I can relate . My father in law had a Grundig of that ilk . Just gorgeous , and the antithesis of most " high end " systems shown at shows . <p> Steven heard the 40th Anniversary SHL5+ at Axpona , powered by the Vinnie Rossi LIO with ( I think it was ) 300Bs sticking out the top . A fantastic merging of state of the art and tone . <p> Hi Mark . VinnieRossi have been promoting Harbeth ( SHL5+ and M40.2 ) for a few years now simply because they like the speakers ( not uncommon , Hegel are another one who do the same ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say 25wpc/8ohms class A single ended . Do n't  know how they do it , as that is about double 300B output . I had a fabulous Art Audio Jota fully pimped with a mine full of silver and EML 300B-XLS that output 22wpc . So sweet , but when it went low it was woolly with SHL5+ . Bass had no slap and bass tuba and contrabassoon sounded underwater . Tried a 35W P/P but not much better . That was the end of valves for me . There are plenty who use valves with Harbeth , but I think they flatter to deceive , and Harbeth can be so much better with more power . That said , the VR amp does play to the SHL5+s strengths and with the right music should sound superb . <p> I was n't at Axpona , but have been to enough shows over the last 30+ years to know what to expect . From all accounts , there was at least a greater diversity of music being played than at most shows in the past , and I 'm all for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of systems produced sound well beyond the steely/etched/thin sound we encounter at shows all too oftenand I 'm all for that , as well ! <p> Great article , Leebs . I had a mediocre-sounding Quad preamp with a tilt control and loved it . You twiddled the frequency response above or below a pivot of around 1 kHz . Five years or so ago , Antony Michaelson of Musical Fidelity announced that he was going to manufacture an analog V-Tilt along the same idea . I lusted after one ! Sadly , I think he was talked out of it by audiophiles and audio dealers . Music lovers have suffered badly at the hands ( ears ? ) of audiophiles . The Quad tilt came with a bass boost/cut lever and several high frequency cut settings . These had different slopes . Wonderful idea . Easy and intuitive to use . You touch on something else in your article : the sterility of so much stereo sound . <p> Sam your post makes me think we need a new term for those of us that are n't  deaf and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many would say but I 'm an optimist . " Audiophile " has gotten to be a dirty word synonymous with " more money than sense " and " tin eared " . <p> I guess I would admit it takes time and exposure to real music and good systems to know the difference , as well as the discernment to sort out whether one reviewer or another knows what they 're talking about , and know how much weight others opinions should be given . <p> I would say that for me , Tone is the main factor/difference between realistic sounding music reproduction and " audiophile " music reproduction . <p> If your primary source is a computer , there are very high quality software equalizer plugins available ( e.g. , FabFilter Pro Q2 ) to adjust the tone . But I suspect when people talk about tone , its more than just the frequency curve ; its also the added harmonics and other pleasing artifacts added by tubes ( nothing wrong in liking a certain type of sound ) . <p> Great article . I currently use 3 New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in a system . I am with you on every point . You also described my own first response to describing my first real high end experience when I told people that " the horns stood up " . However , if you do n't  have beautiful tone in the first place why would you want to listen to the sound no matter how exactly pinpointed the source gets placed <p> Together with all others I agree on the praise for this good and valid article ! <p> What I want to add is that some kind of missing right tone is a point of frustration and constant search and change for many audiophiles . <p> High end industry with their tone control-less , tonality-wise unfittable equipment and their approach that exactly their gear is the correct sounding in terms of tone is n't that innocent . So if one put together a setup of neutral and correct electronics of one manufacturer , all he has to do is find the one speaker that makes tone right for him . Ignoring all the other speaker manufacturers claiming to be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose . Their product then harmonizes better with other correct sounding electronics and so on <p> I 'm sure if there was an option to fit any gear to each other rg. " tone " without quality loss , high end industry would sell much less ( except of this tone control unit ) ; - ) <p> My mathematical analysis of acoustics shows why high fi loudspeakers can not accurately reproduce the tone of real ( acoustic ) musical instruments accurately even in the same room unless that room is an anechoic chamber . When it comes to the effect the acoustics of a concert venue has on tone , the goal of stereo systems as they are now conceived makes that task hopeless . Without duplicating the reflected sounds accurately , you can not duplicate the tone . This is because not only do the high frequency overtones die out at about 1/3 to 1/2 as quickly as the lower harmonics and fundamentals , the reflections that impart the sense of space also impart the sense of power of musical instruments to fill up that space . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern high fi speakers of any type or price are junk . Compared to the sound of real instruments loudspeaker sound is flat , dead , and small . With this understanding , I 've had to re-engineer every speaker system I own and for concert music invent an entirely different kind of sound system . As I see it , so called high end audio is dead end technology . As it stands , it ca n't be made to work .

The idea of a subwoofer is to help your main speakers sound like they have low bass and to do so without pointing to itself .

I know most people use the analog out for subwoofers , but my understanding is that it would work for other purposes . <p> Apologies for the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm not a Sonos user but why not use the digital out from the Sonos to the Sprout rather than the analog out from the Sprout to the Sonos ( which I assume then converts that analog signal to digital ) ? Is it because the Sonos is feeding other Sonos units in the house ? <p> Thanks for your reply- its much appreciated . The reason I need to go sprout first is because I need the phono preamp to deliver the line out to the sonos. - Also , yes , the sonos is is also feeding to other units in the house . I recognize that this setup- is not ideal for sound quality , but I 'm trying to take baby steps that will allow me to continue to build out my system over time , but also keep the minimalist approach that I prefer . Thanks in advance for any other suggestions . I 'm particularly wondering if quality cables would make a difference . <p> I look forward to hearing your report. - Since you 're happy with the sound qualify out of the Sprouts headphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the analog jack , the cable ( or , if you 're using one , a stereo mini jack to RCA adaptor ) - does seem the logical place to look for improvement . <p> Quick update- replaced the old 3.5 to rca cable i was using with another cheap ( but well regarded on amazon ) cable- alternative and everything changed . What was flat/tinny/boring is now full and lively to my untrained ears . Ill still plan to save up for some good bookshelf speakers to pair with the sprout , but , for now , I 'm more than happy with the system . Thanks Steve and Paul- looking forward to learning more from the forum in the future .

@@23909158 @3909158/ <h> What happens to brands ? <p> Brands come and go , just like people. - And , like people , they have personalities reflecting their- raison d+tre . <p> Most brands are formed by entrepreneurs passionate enough about something to take a chance and put everything on the line for it . <p> But , at some point , - brands can become commodities , bought and sold like a head of lettuce . When that happens they lose their original soul . That 's not necessarily bad , though its almost never the same . <p> Take JBL for example . The first pair of high-end loudspeakers I ever heard were a pair of JBL corner horns . So good were these sonic wonders it changed the course of my life forever . Yet , you 'd be hard pressed to find a pair of new JBL home speakers you could say the same about today . They are different . <p> Millions of musicians and car owners know a different- JBL than the one I grew up with , and appreciate it on an entirely different level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wally Amos wanted to impress friends with the quality of his cookies ; I am certain they were pretty tasty . <p> The current owner of Famous Amos cookies , Kellogs , is more interested in numbers than quality or taste ; and their product reflects this . <p> When you 're interested in buying into a brand , look behind the curtain to see who is pulling the levers . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> I guess , Paul , you are rather referring to " brand image " . A renown image was once established on the virtues and strengths of a company . Once the core competences have been reduced to costcutting and profit maximisation it is still possible to conserve the brand image by investing in marketing similar as investing in makeup . A strong brand image can even stand scandals as Volkswagen proves having become the biggest car manufacturer last year . Maybe the consumer are aware of the fact that other brands use similar " tricks " of mocking . Or the image of the hole industry is already untrustworthy ! <p> Many high-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a particular take on some technical aspect of sound reproduction : a circuit topology , a driver material or alignment &amp; crossover pairing . Some , like Saul Marantz , sold their company &amp; saw the quality of subsequent products bearing their name deteriorate . Marantz is now trying to again become a quality brand because of the efforts of one man . Others , like Nelson Pass , sold their first company &amp; founded another ( &amp; then another ) . What these companies have in common is hands-on production , &amp; consequently limited production&amp; therefore limited profits . No wonder many brands associated with excellent gear have disappeared . ( : sorry : ) <p> I am not sure what " limited profits " means . I can tell you that for decades the company never made any money . Nada . We were perpetually in debt and struggled . Along about six years ago I managed to pull my head out of my ass and hired a real manager who is now our president and with much hard work the company is now consistently profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we have paid all our debts off , were healthy , were growing , lifes good and fun . Not too many of our contemporaries can say the same . <p> The big game changer hiring a real manager and ceding control to that manager . No one reports to me but him . Every other employee in the company works for Jim . <p> Most entrepreneurs are good at everything but not great . And especially not great at business . That certainly was the case for me . <p> Ceding control , releasing the reins , is hard to do . Especially for type As like me . But it was the best thing in the world to do . I have many to thank for helping me tug hard on the head as it slowly emerged from the anal darkness from which it lived . <p> Good Job paul.its not easy to make a good living these days . But you deliver a top , quality product at a very price reasonable price . Not to mention all those free upgrades for the DSD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Coast to coast have your piece . And then the free firmware upgrades deal of the century ! If nothing else you 're definitely going to Audio Heaven <p> Its funny , that just yesterday I thought about how all those top high end companies are settled financially . Especially those selling the most expensive stuff like Gryphon etc . Remember something like they were partly bought by an investor , not sure . How many customers are available for such products in such a highly competitive business with lots of companies producing for a very small market ? <p> What is probably the most tricky thing to navigate in growing a company and brand is product or brand tiering promoting very different products to different consumers and prices . JBL makes small portable bluetooth speakers for $99 or they have their Synthesis line with the Everest at $60-70k pair . To a consumer is JBL portable music , active monitors , passive , HT or Music ? All of the above ? Some dilution can occur here and that 's where having other names in the stable like : Levinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle with this as well but I do n't  rule out product from a large company not competing with a niche company when they apply their resources to design and engineering properly . BTW a friend of mine was thinking about a project to restore his grandmothers console but he did n't  have a lot of time or know of a good audio person to evaluate and repair the old speakers and turntable . Like many of us he also wanted to take advantage of music streaming . So I recommended the Sprout and he just took delivery Friday of the Sprout/ELAC combo package . Nice deal . Now his speakers have to break in . <p> I REALLY liked Fried loudspeakers . They were around for years , and then suddenly they were gone , before I could get a pair . I know Bud passed a while back , which brings up an interesting observation . One thing I notice when going to shows is 1 ) for the most part , each company has a designer/owner at its core and 2 ) it seems like almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or older . The same could be said of the attendees , by the way . : ) <p> The concern is the longevity of brands these days . I personally know owners of 2 brands , one a speaker manufacturer and one high end components . Underneath the covers , they about as close to a one man show as you can get . Yet , when you look at their websites , they look bigger than they are . Most companies have to be very lean these days to survive . I know this has always been the case , to some extent , but it seems like the industry has a large majority of key designers/owners that are getting ready to " age out " with no one to take over the reigns . As Paul said in an earlier post , he knows what he knows because of years of experience . <p> One hopes they are raising the next generation of passionate audio equipment Entrepreneurs . I just do n't  know how that 's possible in todays leaner market . <p> I agree . Through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the money . I have since switched to a cone driven speaker . I wont be switching back , but I also cant bring myself to get rid of them . <p> A long time back , in the 80s , there was a local dealer that had Tympanys with Audio Research mono blocks . Listening to that system is what got into this . <p> The secret to success in most business , besides having a good business model and product , is quality assurance and improvement , ie , the ability to evolve . I 've seen PS Audio evolve in a good way , in their adoption of tube electronics in a limited fashion in the BHK designed products . This in contrast to their previous avoidance of all devices employing vacuum tube technology . Thank goodness for the change of heart . I say a little bit of this or that , and a great deal of innovation keeps the product line at the top . Those audio companies that fail to innovate and maintain top build quality of product as PSA has done , inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mark Levinson ( the brand ) made and still makes excellent sounding products over the last 20 years . Nothing wrong with that . Sounds great for example with B&amp;W and Thiel ( when Thiel was Thiel ) . I know from my own experience . But what the future will be now that Harman is in the hands of Samsung. ( : bad : ) <p> I do n't  underestimate Samsung when it comes to making money . Making popular products for the masses , especially smartphones . That 's what they want . Produce millions to make billions . But when it comes to audio the combination high end and Samsung is like the combination PS Audio and 99 dollar computer speakers . Unthinkable . But who knows , in the future ? <p> Ive read that their corporate culture is to be the very best at whatever they choose to do . Thanks for the link , Bernd . I suspect their new effort will be much more competitive as Asian wealth and their love of the High End has grown considerably over the past 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 90s . They were quite good as I recall . Cheers ! <p> Yes I know . I never heard it but could be interesting stuff . But let 's not fall into the trap that " everything " was better in the old days , and let 's not idolize one person . Not Mark Levinson , not Jim Thiel or whoever . They are/were not the only ones who know/knew what they were doing . Im convinced there are a lot of young engineers out there designing wonderful audio . With sometimes a different soundcharacter than 30 years ago . More ( well designed ) class D instead of class AB . A matter of taste what you like . IMO not necessarily one is better than the other . <p> Brands , brand value and brand valuations are everyday business concepts . Recently did a project in cosmetics , when people simply develop brand names as quickly as possible and sell then on profit multiples of say 10 to 50 , because international brand managers can exploit smaller brands on a massive scale . In most industries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if " PS Audio " is considered a strong brand name , Paul could buy in a ready-made product and brand it , such as with accessories . People would buy a PS Audio widget for $100 rather than the Walmart widget for $20 because of the brand . Its pretty basic stuff . <p> Whether the brand has value is another matter . I am listening to Harbeth speakers , a great brand , 40 years of heritage , very profitable , global sales , but for most of that time all the products have been designed exclusively by one man , so in my view would be difficult business to sell and generate brand value . They could have badged plenty of products amplifiers , cables etc. , but chose never to do so , for fear of devaluing the brand . a rare and sound decision . <p> After reading this new article for the day I noticed something . all my audio is first generation . NuWave Dac . NuForce preamp and amp . BBE sonic Maximizer . Audience 1+1 V2 speakers . even my PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home made litz configured . And , interconnects are also litz from Q-Audio . Not one handed down brand name in the bunch . Even the audiophile fuses are first generation . It seems I intuitively did learn something after all from my short lived audio selling experience . <p> Excellent advice , especially when it comes to food products . You can usually tell when a high quality food company has been bought for its reputation because the list of ingredients changes . Odwalla , for example now sells products that have a lot of apple juice in them . There are audio companies that specialize in buying other companies and milking their name brand recognition . It is worth checking for this before buying an expensive new on the market product . <p> " When you 're interested in buying into a brand , look behind the curtain to see who is pulling the levers . " <p> Hi-fi brands , food brands , political brands .. I could n't agree more Paul !

Thanks very much ! <p> Welcome to the forum . - What kind of connection is it on the sub ? if there is only one it might be a LFE connection intended for a receiver/surround processor that has that kind of output which has already gone through a crossover so its only putting out the low end . The Sprouts audio out is a stereo mini-jack so you would need a mini-jack to RCA cable or adaptor . It puts out a full range signal . You could try using either the left or right RCA jacks but I do n't  know what will happen if you plug a full range signal into an LFE input , if that is what it is. - You should check you subwoofers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUB-1200 , and it has 2 RCA inputs on it , but it can also take a single RCA connection which is how I currently have my AVR connected to it. - <p> Unless I 'm mistaken , the Sprout has a 3.5 MM out connection for a subwoofer. - I have n't seen any mini to single RCA cables online . - Only minis to 2 RCAs. - I assume that means that I should use a connection like this one , but wanted to make sure- that was the best thing for it . - Thanks again ! <p> Exactly . Just get the 3.5mm to RCA pair and plug them both into the subwoofer . The reason the sub has this arrangement is so you can use it as a mono sub , where it combines left and right ( that 's what you want ) or as a single sub , just playing the left or right when you have two subs .

I tried through Vinyl Studio but you can only record DSD in the original resolution chosen for recording , i.e. DSD 128 , in my case . JRiver has a conversion function , but it makes the DSD 64 files at least 10 dB quieter , which is suboptimal . Plus , I wonder if it goes through a PCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys know of another method to down-convert DSD 128 to 64 and keep the same output level ?

As a reminder , I use Roon almost exclusively while streaming . Before , Roon- would try to default convert to 32/176 after negotiating with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DS Sr is concerned , giving a bunch of digital harsh as the output . So I restricted the max PCM bit depth to 24 bit and DSD 128 would then convert to 24/176 , which was fine . It just was n't DSD and I think I lost a tiny little bit in the conversion . Less " air " ( hate that term , but that 's what it was missing ) and instrument separation . Mandating that Roon downconvert DSD 128 to DSD 64 previously required a PCM intermediary step to 32/176 which taxed the CPU and also sounded like PCM with no benefit to the DSD conversion . Now with Roon ver 1.3 , build 216 , DSD 128 files are directly converted to DSD 64 and they sound every bit as good as the original ! Awesome . No need to re-rip my vinyl or hard convert my files . Plus , I can continue to rip in DSD 128 , which is nice . This is why I love Roon . They are constantly addressing ways to improve their product . All of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big concern . Very nice. - <p> Great you found that solution ! While I did n't  get , why you not just rip your vinyl directly to DSD64 , just the advice to check if Roon downconverts over PCM with a -6dB level drop ( as most software does ) or not . You can check by manually converting one file with the free Tascam Hire editor , which converts while preceiving the level . Then compare the two in level , you 'll hear the difference immediately . <p> I think you would n't want to have all your ripped vinyl -6dB lower in level . <p> Hobby musician , music lover , long time audiophile , jazz- , vinyl- , and tube nut ( but not dogmatic ) , now also CD/Hires/DSD nut .

Its a win-win , as far as Im concerned . Plus my Mac Mini is n't overly taxed while converting . I would convert to DSD 64 , but I 'm running up against space issues on my HD right now and do n't  feel like dealing with it , honestly .

PCM , " one bit processing " , etc. but instead to see what 's the lowest sample rate or bandwidth involved and how often some sort of sample width narrowing ( besides the final dithering for PCM or conversion to one bit for DSD ) happens. - And perhaps secondarily if any sample rate conversions involved use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . <p> jazznut said Why again is i.e. a DSD conversion with Jriver , Foobar or other converters ( except Korg , Tascam and obviously Roon ) affected with a -6dB drop in level ? - - <p> 0dBFS is the nominal maximum value representable. - In PCM 0dBFS value is usually defined as unity , e.g. the maximum positive PCM value is one least significant bit away from unity ( and the maximum negative value is precisely negative unity . ) <p> For SACD 0dBFS is defined as 6 dB lower than all ones or all zeros. - Its also called 50% modulation index , i.e. that 50% of the value represented by all ones or all zeros is the 0dBFS level. - Thats because DSD starts distorting when the modulation index gets too high. - For SACDs in particular you cant spend significant time above 0dBFS tho you can get to about +3dBFS with no distortion . <p> So if you are converting from DSD to a file in PCM format the only way to avoid any possible clipping is to have the output 6dB quieter since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits , even all zeros or all ones. - For properly mastered SACDs you can probably get away with approx. 4dB of PCM headroom instead of 6dB , but you should n't try to get away with no PCM headroom unless you know that the DSD never exceeds 0dBFS anywhere ( very unlikely . ) <p> As I mention in an earlier post , if the conversion step- is DSD -&gt; DSD you do n't  need to be affected by this. - Its when your final format is PCM or if you use multiple steps with PCM as an intermediate output that the 6dB difference between 0dBFS DSD and 0dBFS PCM matters . <p> I must say I have a bit of a " man-crush " on Ted for always weighing in before we too far off base with these discussions .

In my ( exaggerated ) perception 3/4 of the SACD/DSD recordings are from PCM files anyway . All that ncluding CD sounds so good n the DS anyway . <p> I just tried to do the best in conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Roon and need offline conversion , I will stay with the two only other options I experienced not to do the -6 dB drop ( Tascam and Korg ) and assume these also have the highest chance not to have PCM conversion involved and if they do , I probably could n't differentiate anyway . <p> Hobby musician , music lover , long time audiophile , jazz- , vinyl- , and tube nut ( but not dogmatic ) , now also CD/Hires/DSD nut .

The vinyl rips sound amazing and I 'm very happy with them . Now I have a problem , and I think may of you suspect what it is . I am getting the Bridge II today and it only plays DSD64 ( WHY ? ! ! ) so I now have to find a way to down-convert my albums . I tried through Vinyl Studio but you can only record DSD in the original resolution chosen for recording , i.e. DSD 128 , in my case . JRiver has a conversion function , but it makes the DSD 64 files at least 10 dB quieter , which is suboptimal . Plus , I wonder if it goes through a PCM intermediary conversion . It probably does . Regardless , do you guys know of another method to down-convert DSD 128 to 64 and keep the same output level ? I guess I could convert to PCM 24/192 and then to DSD 64 but that defeats the whole purpose of recording in DSD . The thought of re-recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just convert to 24/196 in Vinyl Studio and be done with it , honestly , unless I can find an acceptable solution . <p> Oh , I almost forgot , I guess I could use HQPlayer and output to DSD64 by default , but I 'd like to get away from that program and let my DS DAC take care of filtering and noise-shaping and such on its own . Thanks . <p> Adam- - <p> Does n't  Roon do this ? - Ca n't you take native DSD128 and convert to DSD64 in Roon ? - Do n't  you HAVE to do this with native DSD128 if you use Bridge ii ( since the maximum DSD rate you can feed through Bridge ii into the DSJ is DSD64 ) ? <p> Yes , Roon does this . As I detailed above , Roon just recently started downconverting DSD 128 directly to DSD 64 in build 216 which was released a week ago . Before that Roon would downconvert From 128 to 64 via PCM intermediary which I do n't  think sounded as good , at least to my ears , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobby musician , music lover , long time audiophile , jazz- , vinyl- , and tube nut ( but not dogmatic ) , now also CD/Hires/DSD nut .

Settings does have some stuff that seems relevant for online services , but no mention of Tidal or Qobuz . <p> Installing the bridge was very simple. - I think it took longer for me to get the DS out of the rack than it did to install the Bridge. - The only minor hiccup was that the screw holes on the Bridge did n't line up with my DAC , but the connection from inserting the card was tight , so I just left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Airport Extreme as my main router and I am using an Airport Express as a wireless bridge to the Bridge II. - I have n't had any issues with network stability or a single dropout of music streaming TIDAL with this setup. - <p> Honestly , it took me longer to setup the Samsung Galaxy S2 than it did to install the Bridge. - I am still getting used to the Android way of things. - For me , an iPad provides a better user experience ( no need to get into details of this ) , but the Galaxy is no slouch , and Bubble UPnp is a nice control app. - The Bubble UPnP app appears to be fast and stable and to date I have n't had any difficultly with it. - Really , all of this has been quite seamless. - <p> Without a doubt , this is the best sound quality I have experienced streaming TIDAL in my system. - Transparent and musical with a 3D soundstage. - <p> My earliest attempts with a MacBook via USB were the least acceptable. - For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would get fatigued listening for extended periods of time. - I was able to get things sounding better by incorporating the Uptone Regen and a Curious USB cable into the setup , but the Bridge sounds better in my system . <p> I upgraded my PWD Dac Version II via the Directstream kit a few months ago but kept the first generation bridge . - I was very pleased with the sound improvement with the upgrade and the 1st generation bridge was working fine for me , and gapless play was not a big concern . <p> After reading the latest reviews on the Bridge II , I decided to upgrade and just installed it a couple of days ago . - The upgrade as others have commented was very easy and the only hiccup was the firmware update froze on the first try but rebooting and trying again was successful . <p> My first impressions of the Bridge II is additional detail but at a loss of some fullness and body . - After 24 hours those traits have disappeared . <p> I installed Bubble UPnP configured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound quality . - I was tempted to quit Tidal as I was streaming through a Sonos ZP80 to the DirectStream and it was n't impressive to say the least . - <p> Now after hearing Tidal streaming through Bridge II , I could n't be more please with the audio quality . <p> If anyone is on the fence about purchasing the Bridge II do n't  hesitate . - The improvement over Bridge 1 is definitely discernable and if you are a Tidal subscriber it is a no brainer to upgrade . - I also love the convenience of using an Android device versus a computer/USB connection to stream Tidal . - - <p> The following users say thank you to mosttoysrsk for this useful post : <p> Welcome to the forum Guy . Thank you for posting the solution to your problem , and congratulations on finding it yourself these little successes are good for the spirit . Feel free to ask more questions and join in on the conversations , we look forward to your participation in this great forum . <p> J.P . <p> The following users say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul McGowan said It should work with Spotify or any other service . It has nothing to do with the Bridge in that the Bridge is capable of streaming anything you send it . You just need a controller capable of doing things like that . <p> Had the DS with Bridge II for a month absolutely brilliant ! Most of my listening is to ALAC tracks ripped from CD and stored on a NAS running MinimServer with playback controlled by BubbleUPnP on an Android tablet ( Nexus 7 running Android version 6.0.1 ) but I use Spotify to check out new music before buying the CD ( normally used less expensive than a download ) . <p> I have a prime account with Spotify but can not get it to play directly to the Bridge ; Spotify does not appear in BubbleUPnP library list Cloud heading for the local- renderer i.e. the tablet , and there is no Cloud " heading in the Bridge II renderer . <p> Any suggestions on how to fix this ? <p> My current work around is to use an SPDIF input on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I have to control from an iPad as Airplay is not supported by the Android tablet ! <p> If I can not use the Bridge II direct , the simplest- way to use my Android tablet for Spotify may be to buy a Chomecast Audio and connect its SPDIF optical output to the DS. 
@@23909173 @3909173/ <h> Heres a simple set of tips <p> I promised to get back to the Mac Mini server I built and shared with you how to do it . - Thisll be a bit of a start . <p> One thing that gets people confused is file formats . Lossless compressed , like FLAC or ALAC , vs. - uncompressed , like WAV or AIFF . Which is best to choose and why ? <p> I could perhaps write a few volumes about this but , instead , let me just share with you my take . <p> Disc space is cheap . - Do n't  bother with lossless compressed . FLAC wo n't work on the Mac server and that leaves only ALAC ( Apple Lossless ) . - Theres plenty of opinions on these two formats and here 's mine . - On the positive side there 's no question both give bit perfect playback . On the negative side , many feel they do n't  sound as good as uncompressed . How could that be ? - IMHO I think what 's perhaps going on is the increased horsepower needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Nough said . Memorys cheap , why compress ? <p> Uncompressed comes in two flavors , WAV and AIFF . WAV is a Microsoft format- and AIFF a very close version from Apple . - The Mac Mini server supports both but here the choice is a no-brainer : AIFF . <p> So use AIFF for all your media and lifell be good . - In an upcoming edition I 'll walk you through how to easily convert WAV to AIFF. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 30 COMMENTS <p> I use FLAC uncompressed the best of both worlds . I use db poweramp to rip all my CDs and there 's an option to rip to FLAC at different compressed levels , including one that does n't  compress at all.So your using FLAC which most streamers / electronics work with . You still able to use all the benefits of cover art , ratings , tags etc. and its not compressed , so ( in theory ) it does n't  use that extra horsepower you mention.In listening tests I find it sounds slightly better than normal compressed FLAC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature that db poweramp built into its software.Its uncompressed FLAC like a WAV file but with the added benefit of better tagging . I quote : - " FLAC encoder wording changed , also includes a FLAC Uncompressed encoding option ( which stores audio uncompressed , for those who want WAVE PCM but with better I 'd LONG ... Hope this helps <p> Maybe that 's just terminology . FLAC is an acronym for Free Lossless Audio CODEC and Lossless is , by definition , compressed . The file size s smaller than the original . If this " uncompressed " FLAC is the same size as the original WAV file , then it would qualify but all that 's really happening , in that case , is they have kept it WAV and simply modified the header . That 's what AIFF is . <p> Also another Benefit of using uncompressed FLAC over AIFF is that FLAC can be high Rez ( eg 24 / 192 ) which I do n't  think with AIFF is possible . The only thing is that FLAC does n't  work on Apple products bummer ! Damn Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused Apple of being ignorant , let me point out that Apples iTunes will play Apple Lossless and AIFF files up to a resolution of 32 bits , 384k . And FLAC is not normally uncompressed . Its lossless compression scheme is very similar to Apple Lossless , which was introduced several years after FLAC . DB PowerAmp seems to allow for uncompressed FLAC , but that 's merely to give it metadata options that are n't  available in WAV . Those metadata options are always available in Apple Lossless and AIFF . <p> Now that 's the pot calling the kettle black ! Apple has been the backbone of the music production industry adopting AIFF which is akin to RAW audio and is utilized in recording studios around the world since people work with 24bit audio usually to produce it . 24bit 96khz for example is more than enough of a resolution to emulate real world analogue . AIFF supports that . I suggest you do 1 minute of research before you show your ignorant ways . You state that FLAC does not work on Apple products , so how is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple products ( tower , laptop ) but I always went with AIFF because it makes more sense in the long term . Now that ALAC has been offered open source and free , I now SHARE 24bit audio but archive in AIFF 24bit . It sounds like you have never ripped audio from LP record which has the meat and potatoes to fill up all those bits in a 24 bit format . I do so daily as a service for clients and no one asks for FLAC . AIFF or WAV if you are serious about things . <p> Lossless music demands space more as the resolution increases and will devour a drive a lot faster than some will anticipate . From the manufacturers perspective its important to promote the relative cheapness of disc space when its prudent to promoting the onset of the DSD format and its giant fatty-fat-fat space eating file sizes . That said I realize many of the people in this community probably can easily afford the disc space they need for libraries filled with high resolution lossless WAV , AIFF , and DSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I suppose it depends on how big your library is . A terabyte of disc space is less than $100 today and it can contain more than 1000 CDs , so that equates to less than $0.10 per CD to store them in uncompressed files . I 'd say that 's pretty cheap . <p> How many full length albums in DSD 2.8 MHz and 5.6 MHz can you store in a 1 terabyte drive ? Not forgetting a formatted 1 TB drive supplies significantly less than a terabyte . Ive read that an hour of stereo at DSD 2.8 is about 2.4 GB and 5.6 is twice that . Please correct me if that 's wrong . <p> There you have a problem , for sure . If your albums are all high resolution then perhaps lossless encoding will be the next best alternative , as you could have half as much disc space used for the same size library . <p> I do n't  know anyone but Ted Smith who has such a big library , but he does n't  pack it in , just buys more HD and keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length LP ripped at 24/96 saved in AIFF format is 1.3 GB . ALAC brings it down to around 800MB ( give or take ) . <p> I archive to AIFF always and share through torrents as ALAC. a good compromise . FLAC has always been there but I simply find ALAC more convenient and on older systems ( pre 2006 ) FLAC is a system HOG . Not everyone has the newest and fastest folks . <p> A disadvantage of using a general-purpose computer such as a Mac Mini is that it is still a general-purpose computer with an operating system designed to do anything and everything . Numerous utilities and functions will be running that you will never use in the music server function and add needlessly to the system overhead . A different approach is a robust hardware designed dedicated computer as a music server , for example , the Bryston BDP-1 or BDP-2 . These use a minimalist Linux operating system to do one thing and one thing only . Any system overhead associated with translating lossless formats should be more readily accommodated by an optimized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test for yourself . Here is a suggestion . HDTracks has a storewide 10% discount currently . Use code " HDMEMORIAL10 " . Download two versions , one lossless compress one uncompressed of " Audiogon Presents The Wake Up Your Ears Sampler . " Even without the discount , you can each version ( up to 192K/24-bit ) for $4.98 . Formats available include AIFF , ALAC , FLAC , and WAV . Be sure not to download " AFLAC . " All you get is a duck . Be safe and please keep the " Memorial " in Memorial Day . <p> So , Paul , when will you make the PWT play AIFF or/instead of WAV ? I have my few HiRez files in WAV because that is all PWT will read ! : - ( I do not have NAS yet so only discs . Someone needs to get this sorted out and make a dedicated music player that is easy to use ( plug and play ) for us computer illiterates ! <p> I recall reading that although the PerfectWave Dac will convert files to WAV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is feed WAV files and does n't  need to process any other type of file . With this in mind I have converted all of my high res FLAC files to WAV and now that HD Tracks has a WAV option I download files in that format.Has something changed regarding the advice to feed WAV files to the PWD ? <p> Like you , Paul , Ive chosen to use AIFF for most of my music , as hard-drive space is cheap and Ive let my excessive caution get the better of me , but I 'm pretty sure ALAC sounds equally good . As you said , both formats are bit perfect ; the bits streamed to the DAC are exactly the same with Apple Lossless and AIFF . If one uses a Memory Play add-on with iTunes , such as Bit Perfect or Pure Music , the DAC is seeing a very low jitter , bit-perfect data stream . <p> Your explanation , that " more horsepower " is required to decompress ALAC , is interesting in theory but doubtful in practice . If you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iTunes ( look at the total User and System CPU load at the bottom of the window , and wait for it to stabilize after starting play , as the Activity Monitor is slow to update ) , the difference is very small . Checking it on my 4-core i7 MacBook Pro just now , the percentage of System CPU usage remains under 1% whether playing AIFF or ALAC . Interestingly , running Bit Perfect or Pure Music in parallel with iTunes will cause higher overall CPU usage , but those apps improve the sound . <p> I agree that reducing CPU usage is in theory desirable , as there may be a threshold above which high or heavily fluctuating CPU usage will cause problems , but unless your Mac is underpowered and not well optimized , there will be no sonic difference between AIFF and ALAC . Audiophiles are always predisposed to hear differences that are n't  there , so here 's my " Occams Razor " explanation for the audible difference between AIFF and ALAC : placebo effect . <p> That may well be the case and I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honestly am not sure there really is a difference , but were there then that would explain it , or perhaps not the activity , maybe it takes a different path within the computer ? <p> Whatever the case may be , my point still stands : why worry about it ? Do n't  use lossless for the final copy . Even if you download a lossless file , uncompress it and THEN place it on the HD . If there is a difference because of the processing requirements or changes , you wo n't hear them . <p> Following the purchase of some new speakers the dealer brought over a few songs he uses to set up the speakers which we downloaded onto my windows laptop . The files are AIFF format . I 've ripped all my songs in FLAC as supposedly there is no difference , but when I heard a Patricia Barber song in AIFF I thought I do n't  remember this sounding this good . A few seconds of direct comparison validated what I thought , the AIFF does sound significantly better than the FLAC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format or the ripping on my computer with J River.Larry <p> Thanks for simplifying things . I wish to comment on the device you saw in Munich . I think it was talked about in Stereophile last year . I like your explanation of how the device works . Makes a lot of sense . On the same subject , you heard a significant improvement with the device . This leads me to believe that the playback system in the room had a significant amount of edginess to it . Since both solid state and digital have an edge to their sound it is understandable why there was improvement . This means that slight tailoring of the frequency response may very well do the trick . Regards . <p> Not really . here 's the thing : the system sounded completely right before setting this piece into the room . Once placed , it now removed a layer of grit that was absolutely not apparent . Sometimes it is a matter of not realizing defects until they are removed . <p> I 'm curious if anyone has done a room test with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality differences from FLAC to ALAC . I personally do n't  hear a difference but it would be fun to run a audio spectrum test outside the box . I do hear a difference though from AIFF to ALAC or FLAC . Just some of the high end seems to be missing . But I can not quantify this other than feeling which is pretty much moot in science . <p> Ive been re-ripping my CDs in AIFF for the last few weeks after reading this article . I use Macs exclusively and have no plans on leaving the Apple ecosystem anytime soon . So far everything is working great in iTunes as far as tagging and artwork is concerned . I 'm using dBpoweramp for its accurate rip capability . <p> But then I stumbled upon this thread in another forum where someone has claimed that AIFFs can become corrupted while embedding JPEGs into them . Has anyone experienced this ? Or is this just misinformation ? Here is the thread I 'm referring to : <p> I 'd like to keep using AIFFs if possible because I think that decompressing ALAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the sound quality , whereas this is a non-issue with AIFFs.

@@23909175 @3909175/ <h> Bi-amping : horizontal or vertical ? <p> One of our readers posted a comment that should be expanded upon . Vertical vs. horizontal bi-amping . The terms are rather simple , yet they are important . <p> Vertical bi-amping is a practice I touched on yesterday " one channel of a stereo amplifier for the tweeter , the other for the woofer . Horizontal bi-amping is dedicating both channels of one amp to the woofer , and both channels of a second amp to- the tweeter . <p> Vertical bi-amping is valued because- the majority of the- power supply of one amp is dedicated to powering just the woofer . This is because tweeters take next to no power . Its probably a good compromise when two amps are used and the way I would recommend if you 're using identical amplifiers . <p> Horizontal bi-amping is valuable when you 're using different amplifiers to optimize sound quality " brutes on the woofer , sweet and small on the top end . <p> So we could make a rule of thumb that suggests vertical is best for identical amplifier models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amps . <p> But what if you want to go " balls against the wall " crazy ? Then use four monoblocks. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 15 COMMENTS <p> I strongly suppose , Paul , that in vertical bi-amping set-up the amp stage for the woofer is stressed much more than the tweeter channel . Thus the amp has to deliver his energy in a most asymmetrical way , resulting in different behavior of the channel circuits . I doubt that the amp designer has planned this use unless the amp has a 100 % dual mono design with a dedicated power supply for each channel circuit . <p> I never knew that 's what that was called . Its the only way I biamp It just made sense to me to keep the type of sound simpler for each amp <p> As for dual mono yes my krells were mono as my aragons but I do not see your point as a design critererior though . As a single channel would be powering all freq of it was used as most do in non biamping use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Woofers seem to get lighter in this situation . Setting up the same speaker in biamp can show this if tried <p> Good morning , In all three cases biamplified it lack the preamp incorporates a crosover to send only the necessary frequencies to the amplifier or channel dedicated to twiter , mid or low frequencies . Not to stress the amplifiers . <p> An interesting statistic would be how many audiophiles bi-amp their system . Of those that I know or came across , none have bi-amped . Fitting in the extra amps in limited space and providing the additional cabling probably has discouraged many audiophiles , including myself , for any perceived benefits . I 'm not aware of any Stereophile or TAS reviewers mentioning bi-amping in their own systems . If that 's true , that would be an important statement on this issue . <p> I used to Biamp when I used Adcom Or NAD equipment . That was the days when I had turntable or CD player as primary sources . Now that DACs entered the picture shelf space is limited . With Adcom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows . With the NADs I used one amp per speaker in bridged mode . That was fun . <p> I am a bit confused about the vertical biamping scenario . It seems intuitive that having two of a given stereo amp would be better than just one of that amp ; doubling the power on tap is typically a good thing . But , assuming there was no crossover before the amplification stage , would running a vertical biamp setup be superior to a pair monoblocks with equal total power output ? <p> To put this question into some more tangible terms , what should sound better : ( 2 ) BHK 250 being run in vertical biamp or ( 2 ) BHK 300 being run biwired ? Since it would be an equal total investment , this seems like a relevant consideration . <p> It really depends on the speaker as most have internal crossovers already and it would be quite a project to remove them . Two monoblocks like BHKs , drive nearly any loudspeaker about as perfectly as I have seen . Keeping the signal path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , I would recommend the two monos as a solution hard to beat . <p> I once had an opportunity to bi-amp a pair of speakers using four of the five channels of a home theater power amp . It made a substantial improvement , partly because each channel was more powerful than any of the stereo tube amps I had been using before that . With the industry shifting back toward two-channel audio and away from home theater , it would seem there might be some nice opportunities to pick up some nice vintage five-channel amps . Just a thought . <p> I did the four monoblock thing a few years back tubes on top , solid state on bass . At the time , I was really just avoiding the inevitable purchase of serious high power monoblocks ( I drive Magnepans ) . I used an electronic crossover to drive the solid state amplifiers , and used a simple capacitor on the input of the tube amps ( Magnepan specifies a single order cross for the mid/tweeter panels ) . <p> The problem I had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good blending of the sound between the amps ; so , I come down on the side of using identical amps . Also , with the crossovers , the additional interconnects , speaker cable , etc. , the system became WAY too fiddly . I could never just sit and listen . <p> A couple of years ago , I bit the bullet and bought a couple of massive monoblocks I 've never looked back . <p> I 'm really enjoying this discussion ! You guys are probably going to think I 'm off my rocker , but I 've been tri- amping for about 15 years ! I know very unconventional ! Ca n't disagree on that one . But a little explanation about my set up.The Infinity Epsilons Speakers , you really have know choice but to bi-Amp . Because of the hungry BASS section on the lower end . And that 's how it started . My krell Integrated Amp is used for the upper half , feeding 250 Watts into 8 ohms . The speakers have built in passive crossovers for the upper end only .. The second krell , feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossover , all balanced . This is a real Joy , because the crossover unit has so many nice features . Like 6,12,24,48 , Butterworth , and linkwitz , filter adjustments . And volume control for each speaker , etc. actually to many to mention .. OK , so , when did the third Amp come into play ? ? When I incorporated the Subwoofers . Amp number 3 also is connected to the same crossover unit as the BASS on the Epsilons ! With all the adjustments I need ! I have the Subwoofers on the linkwitz 24 db filter crossed over at 56 hz . The BASS on the Epsilons range from 35hz to 150 hz , Butterworth filter , so basically the BASS on the Epsilons Speakers are a BASS mid BASS . They work very efficiently , so do the Subwoofers ! ! I can only imagine if I could have gone as Paul mentioned , all mono blocks ! ! WOW , can you imagine ( 6 ) . Now that 's a pretty picture . Lol <p> I certainly do n't  think you are off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! . I have now been bi-amping for about about 8 years and tri-amping for a little less . All started off when I went to my Hi-Fi dealer to buy a new CD player.The sound engineer suggested that if I wanted to spend that amount of money , I would be much better off by adding some more amplification to my system . He demonstrated and I walked out with a pair of monoblocks and no CD player . I went back a couple of weeks later and bought the CD player anyway ! ! That started me down the multi-amp path to the extent that since my three-way speakers have the ability to be tri-amped I eventually ended up with a pre-amp driving six identical 250W monoblocks . I have recently replaced the monoblocks driving the bottom end with two of almost double the power ( 450W ) just to be 99% certain I do n't  reach a clipping situation . Why only 99% certain ? Because from what I have ben able to determine , one needs 500W to insure speakers do n't  clip at louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should be OK . I am such a believer in the benefits of multi-amping that both my middle system and small system in my study are bi-amped using an integrated amplifier on the top/middle end and a pair of monoblocks driving the bottom end . The ideal scenario is of course to have one amp per driver , but a lot of three-way speakers are only made so that they can be bi-amped and therefore generally one amp is driving the tweeter and midrange , but however , this still provides far greater driver contol than one often underpowered amp driving a pair of multi driver speakers . Obviously , more amplifiers means more expense , but one can make significant improvements with some of the reasonably priced monoblocks ( or even a power amp ) that are available and if you watch eBay , you can pick up some real bargains . There 's not much that generally goes wrong with a good amplifier , so they are a pretty safe purchase on eBay , providing they are n't  too old . If you are not convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of monoblocks or a power amp and try it in your own system . This is particularly beneficial if you are only running a small to modestly powered integrated amplifier , say 60W 125W . Put two 250+W monoblocks on the bottom end and I 'll be extremely surprised if you do n't  immediately notice a difference . I do n't  have any experience with big integrated amplifiers ( say 400+W ) however , I would expect the difference to be less , even if you were to add say two 500W monoblocks on the bottom end . As always , you should believe what your ears are telling you and not what 's on paper or because someone says so .

" Well , perhaps not all but many a road leads to the eternal city . I went there driving my old Lancia Aurelia Spider down Via Aurelia from Genoa . <p> I 've seldom heard non-vegetarians complain about vegetarians but often vice versa . Do n't  want to go any deeper into this discussion . <p> Its another cup of tea when it comes to HiFi . I do not complain about MP3 seeing so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bus or on the train . I doubt with all that noise around there will be more fun for them listening to DSD files or so . <p> When ones sitting in front of the stereo at home this is a different thing . As far as the reproduction of lossless reproduction is not touched remember your answer to the MQA discussion it is OK to give the people the opprotunity to listen to these lossy files . <p> Yet promoting this kind of reproduction should not be done imho . One should tell the people the truth . <p> Nobody expects he can get a T Bone Steak in a vegetarian restaurant , but a lot of people expect to get the opportunity to playback every kind of file . The owner of a vegetarian restaurant knows that he will stay in business if he goes on offering tasty vegetarian food . The owner of a HiFi company know , that there are too many competitors to neglect the wishes of those who want features the owner does not like . The owner of a HiFi company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lions ( I keep it to your phantasy which lions I have in mind ) . <p> So yes it is hard to draw a line in your business . There is always a risk that you will not arrive in Rome but somewhere else . <p> But let me ask you a question . And this goes to the heart of the matter . <p> Should the owner of a hifi company who is influential in the marketplace support something they believe is injurious to the art ? In other words , if that owner believes his inclusion of a feature will cause others to believe the owner supports a particular bad practice like a dentist chewing sugared gum is n't that a disservice to the broader good ? <p> Do n't  we as movers and shakers in the world have a duty to do what we believe is right even if it costs us customers and money ? <p> I personally think you have this duty and it proves your high standard . Its a risk , yes , but taking this risk and win is what devides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the iPhone quality standard and difference today if Steve Jobs would n't have acted like that . <p> I did n't  initially want a smartphone much less configurable than an Android , with a plug I cant use anywhere else , with low buds compatibility etc . But I bought it because I now understand and prefer the outcome based on these decisions . <p> I think the majority of us bought high end products from companies whose owners have this mindset , because their products are leading ( if less mass selling ) . <p> From a dealers point of view things are easier . If a frequent customer ask for a product that is not in the basket agreed with the distributors the dealer will find ways to satisfy the customers he does n't  want to loose . That 's how my dealer once was forced to deliver a Power Plant Premier . From a manufacturers point of view having the chance always to find new distributors or markets worldwide things are easier . However he must have an idea about the relevant market he want to serve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a some one man companies which simply produce products for their own fun . Often they have established a pseudo-religious community which follows the guru without any doubts . Some tube gear companies or horn-loudspeaker manufacturers come into mind . : - ) <p> I know a couple brick and mortar dealer owners , and its not so easy for them . I know many of the manufacturers demand you buy a certain amount of product on a certain schedule to be a dealer . The constant battle was that the manufacturers would change models 1 or 2 times a year , causing stock items to become obsolete . What you described , where you simply go to a dealer and they simply reach out and get whatever you want and they are n't  an official dealer , is not the norm . I was interested in starting up a local store at one point . The more I dug deeply into it , the less financially appealing it became . So much , that I now constantly wonder how any of them make serious money at it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments . The dealers are set into a competition amongst each other fighting to get the distribution licence . Then the dealers manipulate the customers to buy the stocked products . Fortunately there is the internet today allowing to get every information you need for more getting more transparency about available technologies and audiophile concepts . And finally there are more and more direct sales manufacturers granting money back warranty ! <p> While that may sometimes be true , I contacted several manufacturers , when I was looking into starting up my own local dealership . Not one manufacturer I talked to several years ago simply let you " become " a dealer and then you simply order product as you sell it . There was anywhere from a medium to drastic ( from a local owner perspective ) initial and/or ongoing commitment needed . I was naive to it , until I really seriously looked into it from a business model perspective . <p> I think PS Audio is in a segment , where " we do n't  make sonic compromises " is often more important than " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter is possible without having to make a compromise . <p> If you owned a grocery store would you sell meat or fish ? But I understand your point . If I owned an Italian restaurant I would n't sell Chinese food . We sold Bose for a while because people begged for it but stopped because we hated it . <p> I drew the line between hobby and business . As a hobby there is no pressure , no deadlines , no competition . None of the countless chores of running a business that has nothing to do with your hobby . You can do what you want , when you want to . If you build something as a hobby and it takes too long , does n't  work the way you want it to , you just start over . In business , your P&amp;L statement may keep you up at night worrying about payrolls , accounts payable , suppliers , mountains of bills , competition , magazine reviews . And you do n't  have to worry about conforming to the conventional wisdom . Turning a hobby into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That 's why I did n't  make audio my day job . And if you lose interest , no problem . Just move on to something else . <p> I would think in the case of MP3 they continue to be supported because , at the end of the day , I believe only a small small subset of human population can hear any difference between a properly encoded 320kb MP3 and a lossless file of any type anyway . I admit to falling into this latter category , even after spending many hours of wasted time trying to convince myself there was a difference with all manner of gear or equipment of a wide range of price points ( pop , rock , folk , singer/songwriter ) . <p> For the average consumer of music , they do n't  even generally listen at full 320kb either and still cant hear a difference . I admit to having to " squint " to hear much difference between a 256kb MP3 and a 320kb with most contemporary music or any older music originally recorded on tape . Below 256kb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the source material . <p> To use your car analogy imagine I have a vehicle that can go from 0 to 60 in five seconds . Let 's call that an MP3 file . I now present you with another car that can go 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds . We can call it your lossless file . Most consumers would not be able to ascertain any difference in acceleration between those two cars , but I would think those that follow this blog could tell a difference and would be willing to pay for that additional difference . If they wish to do so , more power to them , this is why the high-end continues to thrive . <p> As for file types , lossy vs. lossless , to use the meat analogy , let 's say I go into a restaurant and order a big fillet mignon . Presentation looks great on the outside . However , I cut into it only to find out it is full of air and is hollowed out , there is nothing there . This is how most pundits view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a larger bit bucket where the lesser file types already contain all the originally recorded information . For that reason instead of paying for the big fillet or having it take up so much room on my plate I can just get a smaller piece of meat and have room for many more on the plate ( or in my case fill the rest of the plate with veggies ! ) to receive the same satisfaction ! <p> Of course these analogies will now spur very heated debate LOL and as they say " your mileage may vary " on these points . <p> To your point , Larry , if you cut into that beautiful steak and only found air would you return to that restaurant ? Would you , in the end , patronize the more authentic restaurant who gave you the finer , smaller , cut of meat ? <p> In the end , I think much of this has to do with trust . In our small world we rely upon trust in our manufacturers , blog writers , and people who influence us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conclusions and opinions . And when those we trust do something in service of mere greed wanting to please crowds or sell more and not in service of the values they believe in and those who trust them , rely upon , then , have n't we lost something ? <p> +1 on this Paul ( since clicking " like " I do n't  think says who liked it ) . I would absolutely agree , if I get something and am let down , I am unlikely to return again . From my perspective , because of this " trust " , I am convinced that PS Audio products , as an example , are of the best the industry has to offer . This comes from the components you mention as well as influencers . There are others of course , who fall into that category and then some who are the hollow steak , they talk a big story and yet fail to ultimately deliver ! ! ! Have a great day . <p> Also , Happy St. Patricks Day to those that follow it . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holidays . Of course , in my part of the world there are many pretenders , those that fancy themselves Irish on this day as an excuse to imbibe all day and watch basketball ! I plan to stay off the roads later today for that reason alone . <p> The industry has lost control over formats , I lost track of them all ( AIFF , DSD ALAC , FLAC , MP3now MQA ) . Several of them have multitudes of sample rates ( 44.1 , 88.2 , 96 , 192 , 384 , 386 , DSD64 , DSD128 , DSD256 ) . I 'm all for improvements , but there is no control over it . The problem is compounded by the fact that once in existence , they never go away . It seems to me that the optimal solution is to design a product for one purpose . If you are able to focus on only that one function ( ex . CD playback ) , that product will , more often than not , be better at that one task than a multi-purpose solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we water down the overall potential and drive up cost . <p> Reminds me of when " HDTV " finally happened ( at least for me in my work , after a long wait ) in the early 90s . Figured that would be the ONLY format we would need going forward ( 1080i ) . Instead , there was an explosion of formats . When I went to the NAB show two years ago , they were already showing 8k stuff , while 4k was just getting serious traction . <p> But we have many applications requiring different formats cell phone , web , iPad , TVs , projection , etc . I suppose you could say that 's similar to why many audio formats got going they needed to adapt to the data-rate and storage capabilities of various delivery methods . <p> Paul , I do not see most consumer product companies as having any kind of serious problems with were to draw the line other than how it may impact their sales , and that is simply part of being in the consumer product business . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am free to buy whatever I choose . If Brand A does not have the features I want then chances are that Brand B , C , or D will have the features that I want and I will " vote " for that whatever brand I choose by using my hard earned dollars to buy that brands product . Companies make choices , consumers react to those choices by choosing which products to buy and the company that best meets the customers wants and needs usually does the best . Works for me ! <p> I just went through this process in the purchase of a new two-channel receiver . I wanted certain feature sets : phono input , tape input , AirPlay , Bluetooth , wired Ethernet , DSD capability and others . You are right in your assessment of the market . I could find some AVRs out there that had everything but with so much stuff on them they were , in my opinion , a series of compromises when I just wanted two channel audio . <p> My preferred Brand A offered most but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the process only three manufacturers of any price-point offered everything in one box ( and two the the manufacturers were divisions of the same company so probably just re-branded boxes ! ) . So while there was not a large choice , there were at least some choices . I would think that the higher and higher you go in the audio hierarchy of products , you find similar choices available as you point out , as a manufacturers reaction to their particular customer base . <p> The first time I heard a PS Audio Lambda I was listening to a Harmonia Mundi CD of Leclair Sonatas and for the first time in my life I gazed back at my CD collection in awe at the prospect that all of it likely would take the same leap in sound quality . I was especially moved as I had been comparing the sound using many many different units as transports over years and heard easily observable differences among them but none of such a large order of magnitude . The same thing happened with my new Memory Player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to listen to my growing collection of Audio only Blu Ray discs but not to compare the sound to SACDs multichannel or not of the same title rather to listen to them at all on the Memory player . The prospect of using an OPPO or other unit and equaling the sound seems unlikely . This comes to the point of " where to draw the line " in adding features to such a product aimed at audiophiles . Must have been a tough decision indeed . This is not to downplay what the Memory player does since it is certainly among the most interesting products I can think of to reach the market already ; but stillif only . <p> Taking the specific issue of MP3s first , there 's the matter of time . I have amassed so damn many of them over the years that the idea of redoing the process is , to put it gently , unappealing . Do I spend hours re-ripping to WAV or other uncompressed format ? Or do I use those hours for listening ? At this point , listening wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commerce . I resent having choices and decisions forced on me or worse yet withheld from me . I know from direct personal information , for example , that I 'm not the only person who is holding onto and listening to various 78 rpm recordings because they are not available in any other form . <p> A few years ago , I was setting up a vacation home and wanted a waffle iron . I went to all the usual suspects and found that the only ones available were the Belgian type or ones that made waffles in cutesy shapes . Through resorting to thrift store and garage sale shopping , I was able to find one . I note that waffle irons with traditional grids are now back on store shelves . <p> When I 'm not being pissed by many marketing decisions , I do feel a certain sympathy for the people at the other end of the line who make those decisions about what I am allowed to buy . <p> I have pondered the same thing as you . I agonized in the past over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then wanted my music in the car or the boat or on my phone I generally had to make a copy in a format accepted by those devices . So.I ripped in APE and FLAC and WAV and MP3 and others and listened .. and listened .. and finally decided that convenience won out over format . Danny McCafferty belting out at high volume " Hair of the Dog " sure sounded no different regardless the file type , so , MP3 became the format of choice ! ! : - ) <p> My vacation home seems to be a repository of all kinds of outdated gadgets . I still have a toaster up there from the early part of the 1900s that just has the little doors on the side and you tilt up the bread , toast it on one side , then turn it over and toast the back . Talk about a fire hazard , grin , but it still works ! ! ! <p> A lot of new devices work with FLAC now . I 'm sure more will in the future . Its much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downsample to mp3 than it is to do the reverse . I know JRiver allows files to be easily converted to mp3 from any format . <p> Paul , I 'm with you on this one . I have never found it necessary to rip anything to mp3 . So I do n't  have my entire collection on a single personal listening device ? Do n't  care . I just put whole albums or playlists of current favorites on the Ipod ( or whathaveyou ) in Redbook ( or better , depending upon device ) , and if I get tired of it , I change it . Though I admit I do n't  use those types of devices much . <p> My guess is you are in a fairly unique place in the market , where it likely wont have a sinificant impact on sales if you remain true to your standards . Or at least you are perhaps in a position to be able to make that choice , unlike others . <p> what 's expected and what 's delivered ? Even though my preference is wav ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to listen to all other formats , well , maybe not REAL AUDIO . Friends come by with USB sticks , and I want my rig to be open for as many formats as possible . Isnt the whole MQA trick happening in the software ? Would it make a DAC sound worse , if an additional little mqa plug in is activated , and not active when not needed ? I could even live with two different versions of software for my dac , one with a mqa plug in , one without . I do not think that yet another lossy codec is worth a long discussion . If it is implemented in a software I would try it , and maybe forget it as time goes by . My question : Does mqa force you to make real changes in the hardware , more than just that one stupid indicating LED ? If that is the case , then there could be a problem . <p> Lossy digital file compression throws away information , bits that supposedly do n't  matter based on listening tests . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietary compression algorithms on streaming sites like Spotify and YouTube . After a half hour or so I get a headache and when I try to listen to known good material afterwards , it sounds worse BECAUSE THE FILE COMPRESSION SCRAMBLES MY HEARING . To get back to my full discernment and enjoyment of music , I need to sleep off the file compression like an audio hangover . <p> I know other people that experience MP3 the same but they are all conservatory trained musicians , and yet not all conservatory trained musicians , mostly those over 40 years old . So what makes the difference , where 99% of people love MP3 but .01% of people perceive it is bad for their health ? <p> We now know that hearing develops based on the quality of auditory stimulus . Coherently complex sounds like a forest , Classical concert hall or acoustic jazz club ( with NO PA ! ) actually grow bigger brains . I am convinced that digital processing of music including the missing bits stunts the development of hearing .

@@23909188 @3909188/ <h> USB vs . Ethernet <p> I just noticed todays the last day of July and it saddens me. - I so adore summers in Colorado- I am reminded- to enjoy- what 's left ! Hope you 're having a good summer as well . <p> We released Bridge II today , and you can read about it here . The Bridge connects home networks with DirectStream and PerfectWave DACs . Its chief- benefits of one touch play and placement freedom are- overshadowed by perhaps its biggest advantage : - better- isolation than USB , I2S , coax or AESEBU for connected music sources . There 's nothing better than Ethernet for- isolation and sound quality . But , as we 've come to know in these posts , nothings perfect and there 's no free lunch worth eating . Still , we can get there without much pain . Bear with me . <p> I described USB as the simplest connection for computers and DACs in yesterdays post . - But how do we easily and simply take that one step further , connecting by Ethernet to enjoy the benefits of greater isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine my setup for a moment . Mac Mini sitting close to the DirectStream DAC , tied together through USB . I open iTunes , launch Bit Perfect , select my track and play . Sounds wonderful . If I want to manage music selections from my listening chair , rather than my computer screen , I use Apples free mobile program Remote on my iPad ( which connects over WIFI to my Mini ) . - Classic setup , takes all of 5 minutes to make work , easily duplicated on Windows machines as well . <p> Now imagine you just bought a Bridge , stuffed it into your DAC , connected it through an Ethernet cable to- your home router . That 's simple enough , but how do we stream music ? As mentioned , we have to choose a different program . iTunes will only play to USB or internal sound cards , unless you use their proprietary streaming protocol Airplay but let 's erase that from our minds so we do n't  get confused . Hang in there with me . <p> I switch to JRiver at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can tell the program to look for the Bridge and play to it . And that is it . Using JRiver , or any UPnP based server program , you simply choose the Bridge from its available list ( like you might choose USB ) and you 're done ! Its that easy . <p> I am simplifying this entire description to get across an idea Ive been building up to for some days . If we keep things simple , changing from- playing over USB to Ethernet is n't all that difficult . And once you figure that out , you 're free to put your computer anywhere you wish no longer tethered to the DAC . <p> There 's much more to go and ill cover a few particulars in the days to come of good/better options for storage on computers . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 21 COMMENTS <p> I am doing somethiing similar , but on the less expensive side . I have a USB hard drive connected to a Raspberry PI 2 teensy computer running a Linux operating system called Volumio , which is made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any audio codec thrown at it . That is connected via a USB-Optical cable to a Sprout . From the Sprout ( which is fantastic , by the way ) to an Adcom amp to Sequerra Metronome Pyramids . The Pyramids are power hungry . I used to use a pair of PS Audio 200C amps that were destroyed in a flooded basement . Amazingly , the Sprout can run them , but the Adcom strains less . MPdroid from an Android tablet/phone or Mpad from an iPad serve as the remotes , since Volumio is " headless " MPD server . I use a Seagate GoFlex NAS to backup my music ( and other ) files , just in case . <p> Since my router is upstairs along with two NAS drives and my laptop is connected to the PW downstairs , I think I will have to use old early 21st century technology and stick with the USB . They have upgraded the telegraph and I heard one guy say that one day they will be sending real words down those lines . If that do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethernet concept , but I 'm confused by your explanation of why iTunes wo n't work with it . I do n't  think your statement that " iTunes will only play to USB or internal sound cards " is true . Wrong on two counts , actually . <p> 1 . Any app on a Mac , including iTunes , will play out to whatever sound device you 've set up in your Sound Control Pane and Audio Midi Setup . The iTunes app has nothing to do with it , which can be a hassle in an audio system with an external DAC . What JRiver does is what third-party " helper " programs like Pure Music do when used in conjunction with iTunes : Take over those controls so you do n't  have to do it manually . I do n't  believe JRiver is doing anything proprietary . If JRiver can find your Bridge II interface , then the Bridge has to be accessible by Audio Midi Devices as a Network device , and therefore iTunes could still be used as your media library database ; you simply have to configure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPnP that makes this impossible without JRiver ? <p> 2 . Professional editors ( like me ) and sound mixers have used Firewire audio interfaces for a long time , in addition to internal sound cards . USB came along later . Toslink optical has been on all Macs for years , providing electrical isolation , but it has other problems . Nowadays professional audio/video interfaces are primarily Thunderbolt . Some DACs , like the Lynx Hilo , are also Thunderbolt now . There is some speculation , based on Apples use of a new " USB-C " port rather than Thunderbolt on the latest MacBook laptop , that USB 3.1 may be the " one port to rule them all " for Apple in the future , but I do n't  see that happening anytime soon . Anyway , as I mentioned the other day , you can get a Corning Optical Thunderbolt cable that sends data down an optical line , thus isolating that path from noise . I 'd like to see more high-end DACs offer Thunderbolt connections . <p> I would love for you to be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunately , it does n't  work that way . Its true the programs you refer to simply circumvent iTunes path and can play to anything in the computer or even attached to it . But the computer can not see the Bridge without the help of a UPnP based library . That library is what communicated over the network with the Bridge and other UPnP based products . <p> JRiver has a UPnP library it can access , iTunes does not . Minim server , I believe even Windows Media player has one built in as well , but not all do many do n't  . <p> About 12 years ago I used to stream audio over ethernet to an Airport Express from iTunes , and it would come out the optical interface bit perfect but with jitter . Ran it through a professional de-jitter box and out the other side came low jitter , low noise bit perfect digital audio . As good as any CD player out there at any price for less than $300 , plus a Mac somewhere in the house . Then Apple changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again would drop the audio stream occasionally . Plus it did not stream HD music . Sigh . <p> That reminds me that I have a " NAS for Dummies " setup using an Apple Airport Extreme . I ran an ethernet cable to the basement and plugged it into an older Airport Extreme I had laying around , then plugged a couple of USB drives into the Airport . The networked drives can be connected or disconnected in the Finder . <p> OK so that 's 1 1 USB vs ethernet so far , however you do n't  need a general purpose computer with a NAS if you use the NAS on-board processor to run server software . I switched from a DAC attached to Mac mini via USB , with my music on a USB-attached disc , running Audirvana+ ( controlled from a tablet ) , to a NAS to hold my music library and run Minim server software , with an ethernet connection to a Sonore Rendu ethernet-to-SPDIF converter and thence to my DAC , with BubbleUPnP control software on a tablet . I find the latter setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality than the former " DAC&amp;MAC " . <p> Our DACs do n't  even offer Ethernet connections , let alone WIFI . You can attach Ethernet if you purchase an optional Bridge , but that does not have WIFI built in either . There are several reasons . <p> First , adding wifi requires antenna and I do n't  want an antenna hanging off the back of our DAC . Looks stupid . Second , the RF radiated out of WIFI affects the sound of the rest of the DAC and therefore should not be in close proximity . Third , wifi setup , passwords , etc. are complicated from a user interface standpoint and we do n't  have the programming space within the network Bridge to do a nice job . <p> In my mind there 's no question an externally connected WIFI Ethernet Bridge that costs about $60 is a much better solution for all the above reasons . <p> Me ? Distracted ? seriously ? Yeah , well , some claim I suffer ADD while others see me as just flitting around . I did get distracted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers who are n't  interested and approach the subject like chapters in a book to keep interest afloat . <p> There 's one other difference between USB and ethernet : when using the Bridge , the screen on the DS shows track information -title of the piece being played . This info is apparently not available when playing a CD via the RCA plug , or from the computer via USB . <p> I use JRiver , too and am having a good deal of trouble with having it recognize the DS and staying locked on . I cant say I 'm happy about having to replace a year old piece of hardware to correct deficiencies in the UPnP. 
@@23909189 @3909189/ <p> I 'm very close to making a purchase of the NuWave Phono Converter .

I use the LANRover as an intermediary which helps the USB signal not only between the NPC connecting to my Mac Mini , but also running from the Mac Mini to my DS Sr. I just switch the USB input from DAC to NPC when ripping and then back when Im done .

Keep in mind the LANRover does n't  work for everyone , particularly those with Windows 10 , I believe . If it works , though , its great . Since you have a Mac Mini like I do , I do n't  see why it would n't . I think this would be a significant step up from a 25 ft USB cable ! Ethernet packets do not significantly degrade over such a short distance , but USB signal can and will , I believe . Plus you get galvanic isolation with the LR . Like I said , it works forward and back. - <p> The ADC is excellent based on the fact that I can rip quality vinyl and play it back and it sounds virtually the same as the original vinyl . Its based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NPC and remark and how fantastic and vinyl-like they sound . You are of the opinion , for some reason , that the ADC in the NPC is sub-par . You are the only one I am aware of who shares this opinion . I 'm sure there are better ones out there , but this one suits my needs perfectly and for a great price . Oh , and I used a quality HDMI cable ( Nordost Heimdall ) from NPC to DS DAC and it sounds great . ( a generic HDMI cable does n't  , BTW ) That one IS indistinguishable from analog to my ears . So **35;346;TOOLONG . Maybe other have better ears than I do and can tell a difference easily , but I cant reliably. - <p> That is strange that the LR did n't  work in your system .

I think the NPC originally sold for more than your whole tt setup . And I do n't  think you can change the loading for different cartridges . It is probably designed for a moving magnet cartridge .

Those do n't  play without gaps why would DSF be any different ? This is n't an SACD-R its a disc full of data . <p> FLAC or WAV files do play gaplessly if they are designed to do so. - I have a FLAC version of Beethovens 5th Piano Concerto , purchased as a digital download , and the last two movements play with no break as they should ( and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tried putting these on an optical disc. - Does a UPnP control point or a player like foobar do something special to get the proper transition , something that a transport like the DMP does n't  know about ? <p> From my NAS through the Bridge. - ( As I said , I 've never put them on an optical disc. ) - If I have time this weekend I will experiment. - The DMP in general is not a speed demon about things like track transitions , though . <p> Almost 4 months since I started this thread , and finally my DMP is set-up in my system . <p> My 1st download I tried , " Signature , solo piano " Fiona Joy . It is DSD , and the files were DSF. - The DMP reported that the data was " PCM " ( ? ) but also 176.4 / DSF . <p> This is beautiful music ! Upon closer investigation I noted that it is from Blue Coast It is not where I 've downloaded it from ; plse refer to the opening post for the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company well worth supporting ! But ( currently ) I still prefer the shiny disk , so now I 'll investigate if they sell it in this format too . Ideally , I 'd like to buy in SACD format ; as well as hi-res FLAC and/or DSF . <p> The only problem I 've encountered so far , was that when I skipped a track with the remote , the next track was breaking up / skipping / stuttering . I stopped the disk , and re-started from that same track and all was fine . <p> Hello BB . I did not refer to gapless ; just wanted a method to evaluate dowloaded rips in highest quality possible , in order to decide if I 'm buying the disk or trashing the download . Yes , some kind of illegal " try before you buy " but here in my neck of the woods I do n't  seem to have another option . <p> BTW I have a 44.4K Flac downloaded version of Steve Strausss " Powderhouse Road " , liked it very much and finally managed to obtain the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that the original sounds better than the download ! <p> And you are correct as per your post # 2 ; ISOs do n't  work and Ive subsequently managed to rip downloaded ISOs using ISO2DSD . Have only done one , and was n't able to compare ( as yet ) differences in sound . <p> There are some disks , like for example Carol Kidd , of which I have the originals ; as well as the Hi-Res Flac versions . Just to show you that yes , I do buy : ) . So now I want to check if I can download a few SACD rips of same , then I can compare the original redbook with the downloaded ( ripped ) hi-res flacs and ISO2DSDd DSFs . <p> At the end of the day , my mission is simply to end up with the best ( original ) version possible of my best liked music . <p> I must add ; I 've had some problems so far . <p> * One of my 44.4 flac-converted-to-wav disks would not play ( it played flawlessly on my PWT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipping tracks using the remote on DSFs . <p> * I tried a downloaded rip " Jazz at the Pawnshop 2015 " 256-files , so they 're huge . The DMP would n't play them at all . Just seemed to start ; then stopped . <p> Plcomp only does regular DSD , no higher-x versions . - DMP is the best-sounding , worst-navigating device Ive ever had . - Though we are talking about throwing random stuff at it , to be fair . - I pretend its a disc turntable . - Press play ( sometimes twice ) and let it run .

@@23909199 @3909199/ <p> here 's my thoughts : its very system dependent . I think it depends on your interconnects and your preamp . And perhaps firmware . When I was using 1.21 I preferred the DS directly into my Torii Mk III amp using a VooDoo Cable UltraLinear interconnect and then an early version of the VooDoo Cable Stradivarius interconnect . The preamp seemed to add a bit of a damper on the dynamics and " realism . " When I upgraded to Pikes Peak I was a bit uneasy about this configuration , a bit too bold and bright . I updated to a VooDoo Cable Stradivarius " Cremona Edition " interconnect and still felt restless listening . I then went back to 1.21 briefly and enjoyed the sound more . After that I decided to try adding my Decware CSP2+ preamp between the DS and Torii Mk III and this was like Goldilocks pudding " just right " when using another pair of the Cremona Edition interconnects and Pikes Peak . I 've left that configuration in place and am really enjoying the system sound . <p> So I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preamp in and preamp out . I was surprised to prefer adding the preamp this time but glad I tried it . <p> For me removing the preamp layer was a big improvement , I sold it and keep enjoying the direct connection ( no more veil ) to my ( tube ) power amp .

Gives whole new meaning to the best pre-amp/no preamp analogy ! My biggest nemesis horizontal enhancement ! <p> perhaps there should be a clearer distinction in the terminologypre-amp to me means either separate or integrated analog volume control , and no pre- a.k.a . DS means digital volume control . The DS is adjusting volume electronically via an algorithm , and a pre-amp is adjusting volume via introducing a resistance ( or amplification where higher gain than line level is desired ) into the signal path . <p> For me its a bit simpler . If the DirectStream is used to control input selection and volume control after the source and prior to the amp its a pre amp. Also to me volume control is volume control is volume control no matter how its achieved or accomplished . Thirdly , if one uses the DirectStream as a pre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quacks its a duck ! <p> I 'm not convinced or even suspicious the DSs direct connection has anything to do with what 's going on in that thread . In fact until you mentioned it just now I had n't  even considered it . Methinks somethings failed but I 'd be hard-pressed at this point to pinpoint a cause or issue such a dire warning until cause/effect has been properly diagnosed/determined . Put a pre amp in the chain and same fate/result could happen to it as well . Like the bumper sticker says ; " Sh*T Happens ! " and electronics are far from immune . Pre amps are not an insurance policy but moreover just another risk . We pays our money and takes our chances . <p> I first started out using a good set of balanced cables directly to my tube amp . I thought this sounded good but as good as the DS is I thought it sounded a little thin or lacked weight . I did experiment with a couple preamps , first an AI Modulus , just OK , I then connected a Decware CSP3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight I was looking for . I had to go back to single ended , but the sound and clarity has increased as I 've gone up the cable chain . I 'm now using Morrow MA5 RCA interconnects and I 'm loving the sound . I will eventually try a fully balanced preamp . So for me the preamp is staying in my system . It seems to have great synergy . <p> I mean if there is no pre-amp in the chain , there is no protection . If something weird happens with the DS ( like in my case ) - the full signal with no attenuation goes straight to the power amp and speakers .

@@23909206 @3909206/ <p> Wouldnt work with SACDs because of licensing issues . Sony requires SACD audio to be encrypted and the DS would have had to been built to handle that kind of data , which requires royalty payments among other things . The few separate DACs that can handle SACD are very expensive . <p> Or you could buy the Electrocompaniet EMP3 multiplayer ( like I did ) : http : **25;411;TOOLONG .. ital/EMP3 which actually is an Oppo 103 on the video part and proprietary EC on the audio part . For HDMI2 you may choose SACD playback as PCM or DSD . Too bad the DS does not contain HDMI audio in . <p> Tamblers , two questions : ( 1 ) What do they mean by " proper I2S " ? Do they follow the same protocols as PSA ? A number of companies have adopted the same protocols as PSA but there is no official " standard " . - ( 2 ) Assuming they are compatible with PSAs implementation of I2S , what are they outputting ? It is almost certainly not DSD even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle it because the signal would have to be encrypted per Sonys requirements and PSA does not have a license from Sony ( I believe there are a bunch of other technical issues that would need to be addressed as well , as dew1551 noted ) . If they are putting out PCM , they may well be downsampling it to CD ( rebook ) standards when playing high res files . <p> I assume they mean the data and clock signals are sent on separate streams which I thought was the point of I2S . The Oppo player must be configured in setup to output bitstream rather than PCM to do this . Of course its not SACD which must be encoded but then the PWT does n't  do that either . <p> There 's no way they produce unencrypted digital audio out of their HDMI connector and , even if they did , which they do n't  , it would not be compatible with our system .

This makes owners think that this port has anything to do with HDMI audio or video , but it does n't  . These ports ( with a HDMI cable in-between ) are used as a practical way of transferring I2s signals . I2s is the standard way of transferring the digital signal between your CD transport and the internal electronics within the CD player ( e.g. DAC ) . PS Audio has extended this transfer between 2 devices by using the very core signals and thus fewer conversions .

@@23909210 @3909210/ <p> Today while listening to hybrid SACD discs on the DMP and wanting to listen to differences between PCM playback and DSD , I discovered that the DS DAC will not cooperate when the " SACD mode " on the DMP is switched to " Redbook CD " . The DACs display shows that DSD is being processed , not PCM. - <p> The cable connection between the two units is I2S . And neither reloading the SACD nor rebooting the DS DAC alters this behavior . <p> This is the first time I have tried to do this with the replacement DMP . I believe I recall when trying this with the first DMP that there was no handshake issue with the DS DAC when switching between " Redbook " and " Stereo SACD " modes when listening to a hybrid SACD . <p> Or could I be doing something wrong ? <p> What I am noticing is that it takes inordinately long for the DMP to process any change I make to the " SACD mode " configuration . In fact , the display will lock-up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping the " back " arrow to return to previous screens . <p> Peanut Butter , I followed your suggestions . The only way I am apparently able to get the DMP to play the Redbook layer of a hybrid SACD is to disconnect the I2S cable and substitute a different digital-cable connection . According to my DMPs display , only DSD is being read to the DirectStream DAC when the I2S cable is in place , regardless of configuration to just read RedBook . <p> I have also found out that even when configured in that Redbook mode , the DMP will not read the PCM layer of a hybrid SACD to a non-DS DAC as long as an I2S cable is attached to the DS DAC . This is direct contradistinction to what it is said in the DMP manual , specifically : " Multiple outputs can connect to multiple DACs if desired " . <p> Rob , somethings not right . It should be as simple as switching from Stereo SACD to Redbook and reloading the disc at least it is on my DMP . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen reads : <p> Bootloader : 1.13 Firmware : 1.94 FPGA : 1.04 Web : 1.06 Engine : 24-0507 <p> Even if you do have the current f/w , you might consider reloading it in case something has gone a bit sideways . Have you tried a different HDMI cable ? <p> Pb , I have the same firmware as you . Just to be sure nothing had corrupted , I tried reinstalling . <p> And a different HDMI cable makes no difference . <p> The only way I can persuade the DMP to read the PCM layer of a hybrid SACD is to disconnect the I2S connection to the DS DAC . <p> Also , as mentioned before , switching SACD mode on the DMP wont allow me to return to the play-screen right away because the **25;465;TOOLONG icon ( on the touchscreen ) stays inoperative for up to 80 seconds afterwards . <p> I had the same problem , and I posted about it elsewhere here . Opening and closing the tray fixed it . It seems changes to SACD mode only take effect after you eject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates being shown on the external non-PS DAC when the DMP is transmitting silence . Ted Smith commented on this in response to my post about it . <p> Time to reach out directly to PS Customer Support . They will take care of you for sure . 
@@23909211 @3909211/ <p> Ive been using JRiver MC on my Mac Mini to play CD rips and hi res downloads to the PS Audio DSD , and it has worked fine . <p> But now I 'm trying to get audio output from other applications on my Mac Mini to default to the USB port and DSD , so I can stream Tidal from a browser ( Safari or Firefox ) to the DSD .

Yeah , that 's something I usually try to do all updates pretty much applied when I see them , though I wait a bit on major version OS upgrades to let any initial bugs get updated .

So I suggest deleting the Aggregate Device for now and see if you can get the vanilla USB selection working out of JRiver first. - <p> I deleted everything I could from Audio Midi , actually . Both the Aggregate Device &amp; Multi-Output Device are gone , leaving only things it does n't  even give me the option of deleting the Built-In Input &amp; Output , plus the PS Audio USB . Have not been able to choose " Use this device for sound output " for the PS Audio it just wo n't select it . The little speaker icon remains on the Built-In Output line . <p> DOH . <p> While writing this reply , I tried it one more time . IT WORKED . I have no idea why . I did go to " Configure Speakers " in Audio Midi which I have also done several times before but now it actually switches the speaker icon to indicate its using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if I 'm still mystified why its actually working now and not before , lol ! <p> PS . This was worth it if for nothing else than getting the pointer to the Tidal app , which let 's me choose lossless quality where the browser version I was using before would n't . <p> I 'm not a Mac expert but I do have a couple of Mac minis that I use to stream to various DACs . IIRC you do n't  need to and , in fact , do n't  want to select the PS Audio USB in the Audio Midi to receive sound output . As long as the PS Audio USB is showing in Audio Midi as an output and it is configured to its maximum sample rate , JRiver should be able to select it as an output , regardless of which output Audio Midi is configured for . If you select the PS Audio USB for sound output in Audio Midi , you will get all system alerts and other noises overlaid into your music . I always leave the internal output selected in Audio Midi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the PS Audio USB selected after all . It did switch the speaker icon yesterday , which I had never been able to get it to do before , but at some point after last night it reverted back to the Built-In Output . Its less of an issue now that I have the Tidal app which allows directly selecting the PS Audio USB for output but there are times when I want to be able to output from a browser for YouTube or something . That did work briefly yesterday and now I cant get it to select the DSD again . The speaker config screen has everything grayed out so it seems to not really recognize the DSD . <p> There is also a separate selection for " Play alerts and sound effects through this device " so I do n't  think system sounds etc. would necessarily play via the DSD unless that is selected . But of course right now I cant tell ! <p> You may want to try a Mac support board . If Tidal can play to the DS directly and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midi then it is unlikely the problem is the DS . I suspect there is some other issue with your Mac . Just as an FYI , have you tried this using a standard USB cable ? There have been reports that not all audiophile cables work reliably in all cases with this combo . <p> Well , fooey . The Tidal app allowed outputting directly to the PS Audio DSD over USB along with JRiver , so I was at least able to do that even if other apps could n't see the DSD . <p> But a couple of days ago I applied the latest OS X Yosemite update and now the Mac does n't  see the DSD at all . Nothing , nada , anywhere. - I 've restarted both multiple times , switched USB ports , switched USB cable . It was literally playing to the DSD via JRiver as the Yosemite update was downloading , and then after the reboot it does n't  even recognize that there 's any USB device available for sound . Neither the Sound system pref or the Audio Midi utility show anything on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also went to Apple menu -&gt; About This Mac -&gt; System Report -&gt; Hardware -&gt; USB to see if anything shows there , and there 's still nothing . ( Not sure what it would show as I 've never looked at that before . ) <p> Ive tried posting on an Apple support forum but got no response . I 'm going to look for a better Mac support forum ( any suggestions ? ) but if anyone has any suggestions thanks in advance . <p> Not only am I getting the PS Audio DSD showing up for JRiver &amp; Tidal , its allowing me to choose it for overall sound output so browser sound is now going there . Ok , cautious WOOHOO ! been trying to get that going for a while now and it briefly worked before . Keeping fingers crossed that itll keep working this time . <p> I bought a mac mini today because I was using a ripping NAS server that has software issues and for the second time has to be returned to the manufacturer to be fixed . I think I 've given up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mac store to get it set up for sharing , I plugged it in and set it up as quick as a ferret up a drainpipe , just- like any mac . Easier than falling off a log . I also downloaded a free app so I can share it from an iPad mini . <p> The previous set-up into my PWD II was : <p> 1 . - Airplay streaming from Qobuz on- my mac ( to those in the US , Qobuz is French for Tidal ) into the PWD using a mini-Toslink into the optical ; and- <p> 2. - My NAS steamer into the USB socket . <p> The mac mini now has Qobuz installed for online streaming and jRiver for playing stored files . <p> I can do these both by either min-Toslink optical or USB . Question : should I prefer one or the other , or are both the same in terms of sound quality ? -

They 're on the way ! I saw a demo a while back where the rep for Nordost simply put the Macbook Air he was playing from on a set of the Kones- and the change in the sound was immediately palpable . And dramatically for the better . I 'm going to abstain from the usual cliche jargon nonsense . ( " blacker blacks " , " less smearing " , " larger soundstage " . etc .. ) Ill leave that for the pros . All I know is that it sounded better . So fast forward several months and I have finally gotten around to ordering the Kones. - So my question is where to put these bad boys ? I do n't  play CDs pretty much ever , so that 's out . I play a lot of vinyl and from my music server , so I 'm thinking of starting under my Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether to put the others under my NuWave DAC or my Mcintosh amp . I 'm leaning to putting under the DAC since I think I may need more than three Kones to support the weight of the Mac ! Maybe even 5. ( edit : from Nordost FAQ : " The Sort Kone AS will support 75 lbs or 34kilos per piece . The other Sort Kones will support 100lbs 45.45 kilos per piece . " ) I was thinking the TT would be a little clumsy on the Kones and hard to level . Still , there a lot of vibes coming from a TT , so it is tempting . And what about under the P10 ? ? Or the Phono converter ? Had n't  thought about that one . Does anyone have experience with these at all ? Before anyone says , " you be the judge and try different configurations and settle on the best one " . I say , have you ever tried to lift a Mcintosh amp ? A P10 ? ? Not an easy thing to do , especially if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lot of help with moving these things ! So I 'd like to keep the experimenting to a minimum . Thanks in advance for your comments ! <p> " OK , first thing is the concern of weight under your amp. - Each sort kone handles 125 LBS so three under your amp would support 375 LBS so all you need is three assuming your amp weighs less than 375 LBS . <p> Personally based on experience I would start with one set under the pre-amp. - That component is critical. - Second , I would go under the amp. - Whether tube or solid state those amps have large transformers and filter caps which cause enormous vibration. - Getting that out of the signal path is very important. - With your last set I would go under the DAC . <p> You need 4 from a stability standpoint under a turntable or even better 4 sort fut if your table has threaded inserts under the bottom. - So only having three shifts the focus to the dac. - That is also making the assumption you listen to digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So there you go . Looks like I 'm starting with the amp , preamp , and DAC ! At least having 2 sets of the Kones under the amp and preamp will allow for me to easily experiment with the last set under the Mac Mini versus DAC versus phono converter . Ca n't wait to try them out . I 'll keep you guys posted . And Elk , that means more audio-speak jargon will be headed your way ! - <p> So I have had the Kones for a little while now and must say that I am pleased with them . I initially put them under the pre/pro and my Mac Mini server and DAC . I noticed a small but noticeable improvement in the focus of the sound ( jargon alert ! ) . Things seemed a little tighter overall with more precise percussion and tighter bass , especially . When I would compare double dsd rips of vinyl back to back with the vinyl , with care taken to equalize volume , I could not easily tell a difference between the two . Before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a real advantage to using the Kones so I got another set for the turntable and went about comparing the vinyl to the digital again . Then when I put the brass/ceramic Kones- I was floored ! What a big difference ! All of a sudden the bass was much more meaty and impactful with the percussion almost as if it were in the room ( was listening to Santana Abraxis on MoFi Ultra Disc wonderful ! ) . Individual voicing was better defined ( more jargon ) . There was more of a difference pre and post with vinyl , definitely , than digital . It stands to reason since there is a huge moving platter and electric motor in the TT . Finally , I did another rip of an album I had recently copied , this time with the BC Kones under the TT as well as under the Mac Mini . I then replayed the before and after files and found the newer files with Kones to be superior. - I then compared to vinyl and once again the digital copy was close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I think the Kones are the real deal . They 're not cheap , but worth the investment . At least for me they are . I am intrigued by the titanium and ceramic Kones , but they are very pricey ( $370 per ! ) and only give modest improvements over the brass , from what Ive read . Oh , I forgot that I had a set of the aluminum and steel Kones to try and barely noticed any difference with them . At least under my Mac Mini . The ceramic and brass seem to be the sweet spot in price and performance for me . Hope this helps somebody. -

The soundstage is especially goodnot just left to right , but front to back . Really good spacial clues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd been toying with hooking up a sub to these speakers before receiving Sprout , and I may still , but Sprout seems to add a lower octave that was n't there with my previous set-up .

Sprout was especially kind to some restored Nat Cole trio stuff from the 30s and 40sit all sounded much better than it had a right to . <p> I 'll try a turntable tonight ; too lazy to re-arrange my desk right now .

Please consider adding that . Thanks . <p> The- Peachtree Decco65 is definitely some amazing competition for Sprout . Keeping in mind that we do not fear competition , but rather welcome it and even LOVE it , ( because it keeps us honest , it proves- there is a market , and we just know how much room there is to grow the marketindeed we are really close friends with our top competitors ) , the Decco is somewhat formidable because of that elegant design and material makeup . The wood wrap for example is very nice . You know , it- looks like a small unit , but its actually pretty close to full component size . The Decco comes in at 743 cubic inches to Sprouts- astonishing 83 cubic inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , our turn to brag ( here 's how were better than the Decco ) : we are 1 tenth the size and 1 tenth the weight , yet we- have all their features plus- a phono stage plus- bluetooth , my two most commonly used inputs. - <p> RCA analog outputs : I would love them .

The air under Albert Kings voice , the horns and guitar all sound great and in place . <p> I also did an hour or so with headphones ( Grado 325i and Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro ) , both sounded great to my ears , but truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the GeekOut 1000 is where they will be plugged in most of the time .

What are your impressions ( if any ) of the Sprouts internal DAC ( vs the GeekOut 1000 or in general ) ? <p> Heh , wow , kind of embarrassed I did not think to try it out sooner , thanks for the nudge . <p> I have been playing it this way all morning now ( Macbook Pro USB -&gt; Sprout DAC ) and have to say I am very impressed with the sound and detail I am getting this way. - <p> First , the bass ( literally , Sam Jones upright bass on Somethin Else ! ) has much more of a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the GeekOut on this album .

Other than that , the Sprout seems super-solid so far , very happy with it . <p> Thanks for the impressions . I too was a bit worried about the ginormous power cable plug .

Plugged in the headphones with the vinyl setting , was getting the same thing in my cans. - Even plugged in a digital music player through a line-out cable to red/white into the vinyl jacks , same thing .

Sprout only supports moving magnet phono input . If your turntable has a built in phono stage and outputs a line level audio signal , you are going to get lots of distortion . <p> The fact that you get similar distortion with your turntable and another audio source tells me this may be the problem . If you look in the Sprout manual , it specially says not to plug other audio sources into the phono input .

Happy days ! - <p> However , since I am a novice in the world of hifi , I could really use a good advice or two from you guys : - I recently became the proud owner of a beautiful 40-year-old Thorens TD 166 mkII turntable . But when I connect it to my Sprout I am having severe speaker hum problems. - <p> here 's a rundown of the situation : <p> 1 . The turntable has been in my possession for only 4 months I bought it from a well respected refurbisher in Denmark , who took it apart before the sale . The turntable should be in great- order. - <p> 2 . The Thorens I have is born- without a grounding wire , so after reading some threads on the subject , I assume it is grounded through the RCA connectors . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Upon connecting everything , the speaker hum only occurs when input selection is set on Vinyl . No other devices are connected to the Sprout and bluetooth sounds perfect . <p> 5 . Hum is present from low volume and increases when volume is increased . <p> 6 . Vinyl music plays at a very low volume , compared to bluetooth level . <p> - <p> So , a novice- question : Do I need to add in an additional preamp other than the one built into Sprout ? - <p> Can/should I ground the turntable in another way ? <p> After googling around , I realize that hum can be a tricky thing to solve . But any advice is very much appreciated ! - <p> What cartridge do you have in the Thorens ? Assuming it is a moving magnet ( MM ) cartridge , you just connect it directly to the Sprout via the Phono inputs ( as you have done ) . A turntable chassis is n't grounded via the RCA shield lead . I 'm betting you just need to run a ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper wire , connect a spade connector to each end , find a screw on the bottom of the turntable that connects to the metal chassis and connect the other end to Sprout . I would guess the hum will disappear . <p> Yes , I believe Andy is correct . The metal parts of the turntable , in particular the arm , may be ungrounded . Sure sounds like it . You can test easily . Take a piece of wire . Connect- one end of the wire to Sprouts ground terminal . Then , with the volume turned up so you hear the hum , touch the other end of the wire to the turntable arm or other metal parts of the table to see if the hum goes away . Ill bet it does .

The LPS-1 can output 5.5 Watts at 5V and the MC110CS can accept 5V according to the website <p> Its set to 5V .

More detail , more and better bass , blacker background . <p> Amazing improvement and so cheap.I had a similar improvement when I moved my computer and WiFi router out of the listening room . <p> I think for my system I 've found the holy grail input of the DS lol . Toslink was winning for me until now . <p> All of my power cables and balanced XLRs are unshielded and star quad config @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated with the DACs ethernet input . <p> I only have a short 6-inch BJC Cat 6 cable from the DAC-side FMC into the Bridge II with fiber between DAC and the router and another 6-inch BJC Cat 6 cable from the router-side FMC into the router . <p> Hi <p> I am confused . I have a similar setup as you do with the FMCs but i do not use a Bridge II . I use an Auralic Aries streamer instead . <p> I have like you a BJC Cat 6 from router to router-side FMC , fibre between router-side FMC and streamer-side FMC , BJC Cat 6 from router-side FMC to streamer , streamer to DAC via USB . <p> Is this correct ? I did n't  get the statement about " fibre between DAC and the router " care to explain ? <p> In my case , I still preferred the AC wireless link on my streamer vs the now fibre isolated wired link . But the difference was now marginal compared to AC wireless vs the setup without the FMCs . <p> I am confused. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAC and the router " care to explain ? <p> Hi , sure yep that 's correct . The fiber ( and pair of FMCs ) was introduced to replace most of the ethernet between DAC and router ( apart from short 6 inches on the ends ) . <p> In your case the fiber was introduced to replace most of the ethernet cable betwdeen your Aries and router , no ? - <p> Are you using a Directream with your Aries ? And USB cable between the two ? Which USB cable and what length ? <p> I 've seen people report differences when introducing fiber on the music server side of the router , which sounds counter intuitive to me but I never discount and always respect peoples obsevations . But on paper I thought the biggest improvement is to be had right before the ethernet input of the DAC ( for the Bridge II for DS owners ) and using an ultra short ethernet cable . <p> I would think ( guessing only , I 'm no expert ) using fiber further upstream would make a smaller difference but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their USB DACs . <p> @Mi2016 You should try bypassing your router altogether and do a direct connect from your PC ( Mac Mini in my case ) to the DS . Your sound will improve even more , I 'd wager . I detailed how I got it to work for Mac Mini in post #23 in this thread : <p> When you say I 'd have even more improvements , are you doing both the direct Mac-to-DS connection and using FMCs ? <p> I do know all those threads . You 're lucky in using a Mac because John Swenson mentions Apple ethernet ports have the best signal integrity , far better than commonly found in ISP modems and routers , so that may be a reason for the improvement of the direct Mac-to-DS ethernet connection . Uptone definitely say you need to use the Macs ethernet port for the endpoint connection and use the cheap usb-to-ethernet adapter for the router connection . Alex said using the latter to your endpoint sounds crap and may be worse that your router ( possibly due to signal integrity as mentioned ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surface Pro 4 with USB 3.0 hub , so I would need to use 2 x USB-to-ethernet adapters and bridge their connections . I do n't  imagine the signal integrity from those adapters is better than my Apple Airport Extreme ( using Alexs guide that Apple use high quality high signal integrity Broadcom chips ) so I do n't  bother . <p> But I should try it to compare with the optical isolation . I really do n't  know how it can get better than only have a 6 inch ethernet cable into the DS but I 'm willing to try it . <p> Have you tried FMCs , right before the Bridge II input ? The improvement for me was quite shocking . <p> I 'm powering both FMCs by Uptone LPS-1s ( that I already had ) although I do n't  think the router side FMC needs anything special . <p> I agree with Alex . The dedicated ethernet port to the DS is optimal in this situation and was more stable than the other way around , in my experience , even if they sounded more or less the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  notice any improvement at all with them in between the Mac and DS . Maybe there was a slight decrease in dynamics , actually , so I removed them from in between the Mac and the DS . I definitely noticed an improvement with streaming Tidal through Roon with the FMC in between the router and the Mac , so there they stay . Not huge , but things just sounded more " right " . I also power my FMCs with a single LPS-1 with a splitter . I 'm very happy with the setup ! I 'd be curious if the direct setup is an improvement for you . Good luck ! <p> Hi all , so I got these optical bits to try it out between my router and BridgeII and what I found was , that although the treble sounded very clean the bass was gone , it had a very lean sound . So sadly all the optical bits are back in their boxes and will go in the back of my cupboard to be forgotten about. - <p> I 'm with- @Mi2016 . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mac Mini in my case ) , but not between the server and the DS Sr ( I use the bridged direct ethernet connection ) . And the power supply helps too ! As do the ethernet cables used . I have no idea why that is , but it seems to . I use the Cat 7 Tera Grand cables which are a great value. - <p> I 'm enjoying the improvements they made so much that I 'm getting someone to look at upgrading the capacitors and switching regulators ( and there 's a couple of cheap linear regulators in there too ) for higher quality components , to get the full benefit of the external linear PSUs Im using . <p> I use two- TP-Link 6700 power banks ( floating battery power supplies ) to power my FMCs as this was recommended to me by someone over at the CA forum . I cant say that I tested it versus the stock PSU but in theory it made sense and was cheap to implement . <p> I have wondered if it would be better to use an audiophile LPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time as overkill for an FMC .

@@23909229 @3909229/ <h> Bi-wire <p> How daring are you with your system ? Have you ever tried to bi-wire it ? <p> Bi-wiring means to split the output power from your amplifier into two separate speaker cables : one for the top end and one for the bottom end . You can also tri-wire , of course , but that 's rarely done . <p> So , how important is bi-wiring ? And do you need to have two inputs on your loudspeakers to have it effective ? <p> Bill Low reminded me that a simple change of wire positioning , on a loudspeaker pair with separate inputs for bass and treble , can make a noticeable difference . He tells a story of going to a dealers showroom , playing music for the staff on their reference system , then going around to the rear of the speaker , making a quick mystery change they all noticed for the better . What he did was simple : move- the speaker cables from the bass input terminals to the tweeter input terminals , when the two are tied together with a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several occasions , each time enjoying a noticeable improvement . <p> So when we take that trick a step further and use two pair of speaker cables to connect the amp and loudspeaker together , the results can be even more dramatic . <p> In Music Room One I have a treasured pair of MG Audio Planus III speaker cables that are in a shotgun configuration . To me this is the best of both worlds : two parallel speaker cables , each separate until the very last moment , terminated into one set of spade lugs at the amp and loudspeaker ends . And here 's what 's interesting and perhaps misunderstood . Shotgun is not bi-wire despite the fact there are two speaker cables in both cases . The term bi-wire is only accurate when separated by high and low frequency inputs on the loudspeaker , thus separating and isolating the currents in the wire . Shotgun is merely doubling the speaker cables but I find that approach better sounding . <p> But if you 're not up for the expense of bi-wire or shotgun style , at least pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding posts : go high first . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 33 COMMENTS <p> If you have $x to invest in speaker cable is it better to use the bi-wire / shotgun method or a standard configuration cable , equal in value to what you have invested in the bi-wire/shotgun set up . I totally agree with connecting to the top end terminals first and where possible get rid of those terrible gold jumpers that connect the LF HF terminals with some good quality cable or some good aftermarket jumpers . <p> It really depends on what you 're running for speaker cables . There are so many options they 're hard to list but maybe in tomorrows post I can do some of them . For example , you could have an old pair of speaker cables laying around that had terrific top end but kind of sucked in the bass . These would make a perfect bi-wire for the top end . <p> Paul , There really are so many options . I seem to remember a conversation with Bill Low , where he explained that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker to determine the configuration of conductors when Single Bi-Wiring ( e.g. number of conductors evenly split vs. more conductors to the low than the hi inputs ) . . . and a similar train of thought for choosing Double Bi-Wire pairs . The thinking being that if the X-over point is relatively low as in a 3 way speaker , that more/better conductors need be allocated to the hi frequency input . Where as with smaller 2 ways where the critical midrange is reproduced in the low frequency driver , that the reverse would be recommended . Q1 : Have you ever tried this with these two different types of speaker/X-overs in your experimentation ? Q2 : How does this theory work with the " go hi first " idea ? <p> This is why you have me curious . Are you using a ribbon type wire as I see some do . Its multiple conductors next to each other on a ribbon . If yes this sounds different . ? ? Wow this hobby is nuts and I am sure I am crazy already . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks nice and as the conductors are in parallel its raise the conductor size And lowers the imp of wire . Regarding freq there is a skin effect but that is related to high voltage transmission wires . Al <p> Hi Paul . Did Bill Low then reset everything to the starting position ? Could he be sure that the contact surfaces of both ( all ) connectors were thoroughly cleaned and had identical resistances ? Even the movement and touching of the cables might have changed the static charge ! Nordost , another cable manufacturer recommends regular treatment of cables with a static inhibitor spray . I would also look for the type of power amp before making such recommendations for doubling the cable surface and thus reducing the resistance of the cable connection . Sometimes a vacuum tube amp likes higher cable resistances ( or better dislikes lower resistances ) for a best match with the speakers ! <p> I 'm a bit mystified with a tube amp system preferring higher resistance cables . If the resistance with a high output resistance amp ( almost every tube amp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non flat and the higher the resistance the worse the affect ( although the peaks and dips stay at the same points ) . This is more like a tone control than reproductive fidelity . Just look at the simulated speaker load frequency curves in Stereophile reviews . <p> Good reply . I just repeated the generalized arguments of some cable manufacturers ! : - ) However for a power ( impedance ) matching between a tube amp and a high impedance widebander the cable recommendations might be different ? But nobody could explain to me the audible effects of different matching ( power , current , voltage ) strategies . <p> I only know a little but basically a low damping factor amp and speaker will interact with the speaker impedance to give a frequency response at the speaker terminals that looks like a squashed version of the speaker impedance curve . The lower the damping factor and higher the wire resistance the more variation in response . <p> But frequency response is n't everything . Decades ago I heard the changes in sound with a Bering BA150 amp that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lower the feedback the better it sounded to me . Lower feedback meant worse frequency response and higher IM and harmonic distortion but it sounded better . I asked David and my friend Murray if they knew why it sounded better with what seemed to be worse conditions . Both said that reduced feedback improved linearity ( if 1 volt in gives 5 out the ideally 2 volts should produce 10 volts ) . what they were saying was the dynamic response ( accuracy of reproducing level changes ) of the system was better with reduced feedback . I have always felt the more dynamic a system the more real it sounded . <p> You 're absolutely right Paul . And no , I am sure he did n't  do that calculated of a test . But I can tell you from personal experience that , counter to what one might think , running directly into the top terminals for the tweeter always sounds better than the opposite even with cleaned terminals and lugs . <p> Are you going to cover Bi-Amp ? Horizontal vs Vertical in particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schweikert VR5 Anniversary Mark II speakers . Therefore Horizontal vs Vertical is not an issue for me . However , I am often asked which is better when using 1 stereo or 2 monoblocs . <p> Shiloh assuming the same quality of amplification , my experience is that mono-blocks usually sound better ; probably due to the separation of power supplies allowing each amp to freely play the content on that side unrestricted by any sharing conflicts in power . This seems to be true even in amps with very substantial power supply construction like conrad-johnson . <p> Vertical is usually preferred if the stereo amp has a single power supply , the usual circumstance . Since the lower frequencies usually stress the power supply the most and the upper frequencies need less draw , the bass channel can be a power hog with less likelihood of overloading the power supply . <p> As paulsquirrel hinted , just undoing the terminals and then remaking the connection can make a difference all by itself , akin to the advice to unplug and replug every input cable . Youve got a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And presumably , with speakers with the terminals connected with jumpers , you run the risk of the jumpers not having a good connection too . Did Mr Low share an opinion as to why it was generally a good idea to hook un biwired cable to the tweeter inputs ? FWIW , I use a stereo amp each side and biwire the speakers . <p> Paul , I 've owned two speaker models with accommodation for bi-wiring . At that time ( many years ago ) Richard Vandersteen was known to recommend bi-wiring rather than " jumpers " . I assume he still does . The others were Duntechs and John Dunlavy was a bit vague ( most unusual for him ) whether he believed bi-wiring was beneficial or simply that his customers expected it . I did bi-wire both but now can not say if it was truly better or if I just expected it to sound better . ; ) Not unrelated to that was my use of mono bloc amps , thus only having speaker wire 1 M in length . <p> Regarding your " shotgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any better than using " single barrel " wire of an equivalent aggregate gauge ? <p> Any speaker I 'm familiar with which provides bi-wire terminals pairs the woofers to one set and mid/tweeter to the other . Considering the sonic importance of the midrange its no wonder to me that direct wiring to that set is preferable to the signal running through an extra set of connectors and then a metal strap or wires ( which may be a different configuration or even material ) via the woofer terminals . <p> I 'm curious about the possible reasons why " going high " may provide better results .. It is counter-intuitive to what I have read , and always thought to be true in that , since the low frequency drivers demand more " power , " the wiring should always " feed " the low frequency posts first ( the exact opposite of Mr. Lows recommended configuration ) . <p> After using biwire and shotgun configurations , I have switched to a diagonal configuration using one high quality pair of cables with a high quality set of jumpers.I happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower positive post , and the negative side of the cable to the upper negative post , with the jumpers set accordingly . I suppose I 'll have to try the " Low ( Bill ) configuration , " but it goes against what makes sense to my feeble brain .. <p> P.S. Congratulations on the positive press in both TAS and Stereophile ! <p> If you want to experiment with this idea about whether the wires being connected to the midrange/tweeter binding posts sounds different from being connected to the woofer binding posts here 's an experiment you can do . For each channel you 'll need a 2 pole 2 throw switch . A CD player with A-B repeat helps too . Make sure all of the terminals and the connecting links are scrupulously clean . An invisible but real film of oil and dirt can build up on all the exposed conductors that will affect results . You can use Deoxit or another electronic parts cleaner . Connect the amplifier output to the common center terminals of the switch , wire one pair of end switch terminals to the woofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you throw the switch you will be toggling from one connection to the other . The A-B repeat function on the CD player will let you hear the same selection both ways to make a fair comparison . You can have someone else throw the switch ( es ) and keep track of how many you guess right . If you try this experiment please post the results so we can share them . <p> One thing magazine reviews rarely if ever talk about is quality of manufacture . I 've seen a lot of very expensive shoddily built equipment and not just in audio . Its surprising how much industrial equipment is not very well designed or built from a quality of product standpoint . <p> It seems to me the shotgun configuration is just another way of saying different speaker cable . If you can accept that different cables have the potential to sound different , then it is not out of the question that shotgunning cables also has that potential . It is not obvious to me , though , why it ought to be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . <p> Regarding the shotgun-to-tweeter configuration sounding better than the shotgun-to-woofer alternative , both being connected via the same jumper , it beats me why one should be systematically better than the other . I am on vacation right now , but will try the experiment on my B&amp;W 802 Diamonds when I get home . These are currently bi-wired using parallel pairs of Cardas Golden Cross . I think I can still find the jumpers . If the thread is still alive , I 'll post my results . <p> I 'm sure you are right , but ( i ) it is not clear to me from Pauls OP that this is what he had in mind , since I expect he would have mentioned it if high-end jumpers were a key element ; and ( ii ) getting hold of a set of high-end jumpers is not trivial in the context of the quick test I had in mind ! <p> At this point ( iii ) also pops into my head . I 'm not sure how many speaker cable terminals and jumpers my speakers binding posts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts are attached at the speakers base is more flimsy than you might expect . 
@@23909230 @3909230/ <h> Back to bass again <p> I know . I harp on this a lot . Yet , the puzzle never ceases to amaze me . <p> Why do most loudspeakers have wimpy- low bass ? Wouldnt you think a speaker that costs $80,000 would have it all ? Or even a speaker costing much less ? Or much more ? <p> Maybe its just me and my expectations . I walk into a dealers showroom with the best speakers they carry on display " some extremely expensive . I crank up a few of my favorite pieces and right where the low note is supposed to be , there 's little- but a faint reminder of what 's recorded . And the rare times I do hear it the note comes from a subwoofer . <p> Perhaps fewer and fewer people are interested in musics full range . Yes , perhaps that 's it . <p> Otherwise , the whole affair is just confusing to me . <p> Reviewers that shall go unnamed wax and enthuse about expensive speakers without once mentioning the missing low frequencies . <p> A true puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loudspeakers told me that designing passive loudspeakers with a limited bandwidth creates a maximum of customer satisfaction . Most old vinyl records a dramatically limited in bandwidth . A subsonic filter in the signal path can be omitted . The problem of room modes is drastically reduced and thus the requirement for room tuning devices cluttering the listening/living room . Time coherence of the limited number of drivers is possible . Having three or even four and five ways loudspeakers the step response will never look as required from a time coherence point of view . And finally : a psychoacoustic finding is that the hearing computer between the ears is able to add the lacking bass notes if the drivers of the loudspeaker have a perfect timing behaviour . <p> When is bass REAL ? I was at my one and only audio show in NYC -Stereophile 1986 and heard a symphony recording on the big Genesis speakers in a very large room . Awesome , some guy said behind me , and the bass was indeed ! But it did n't  sound real to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech ( MIT ) Night at the Pops . The six double basses in the orchestra sounded rich and deep AND real , not what I had heard at the show . For many years , we have attended the full series of our wonderful Virginia Symphony , and even though Chrysler Halls acoustic is not the best , it takes live music to keep your ears " in tune " . Likewise , the occasional small chamber music concert . <p> Hey manniesm I was also at that 1986 Sterophile show , and to this day I still remember how I thought the bass in the Genesis room was way overblown . AND , I also enjoy listening to the VSO in Chrysler Hall ; however , I get much more enjoyment listening to them at Sandler , as that superior acoustic allows them to sound like the world class orchestra they truly are . Unfortunately , since I no longer live in the area , I now drive 500 miles each way to hear my beloved VSO . We probably know each other ; and if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my address is : gcsakakini@yahoo.com . George <p> Not even a bit of of a mystery to me . I have calibrated hundreds of rooms . And only in ( maybe ) one case , was the best speaker location for the mids/highs , also the best location for the bass and the lower frequencies almost always loses to things like imaging , etc . And that is why I quit purchasing full range speakers . Speaker + great subs + great integration solves the problem . Just sayin ! ! ! <p> And the lower frequencies are the foundation of both great music and film reproduction . Without great , full range bass , you miss way too much . <p> Amen . The biggest drawback large , full-range speakers have is that , though they may be capable of producing fairly low notes , placement in the room is dictated by the high-frequency producing drivers . So you are stuck with the woofers below this spot . <p> Additionally , once you take the burden off a single cabinet for producing full range , the " sats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a good sub produces lower , cleaner , more musical bass than most any large-cabinet-bound woofer , often for a fraction of the cost . <p> Couldnt agree with you more . Low bass which is on the recordings , whether heard live or not , can rarely be reproduced by two speakers in the same spot as you need them for best imaging and tonal balance . <p> Therefore , at a minimum , all speaker need built in subwoofers with volume controls to set the balance right . External subs are even better . <p> But even with volume controls , that does n't  deal with room anomalies that totally screw up the room response in the lower frequencies . External subs are the very best solution . I have a friend who owns the $65,000 Magicos , placed them for optimal imaging , best response , etc and then purchased some eternal subs since his bass started going south at about 60HZ ! ! ! What 's wrong with that picture ? ? <p> Well , the recommendation came from the very detailed analysis that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have set up a bunch of rooms , and in 100% of the cases , using all 4 corners ( OR the two diagonal corners ) represented excellent pre-EQ results . CAVEAT : this only applied to rectangular sealed rooms . <p> Correct me if I 'm wrong , but the aim of that method is to produce the most even sound over multiple seats . I have the ( sad ) luxury of only concerning myself with one seat . Typically , if you try to get the best result for a wide area , it is a bit of a compromise compared to tuning for a single location . <p> Again , that has not been my experience . Not only has that approach provided the best seat to seat response , it has also ( by a long shot ) provided the best sweet spot response . I , too , am a selfish audio fanatic and I ONLY care about the sweet spot , since that is where I sit . Again , this ONLY has worked for me with sealed rectangular rooms . Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of it . <p> One of the advantages of good subs ( as I mentioned above ) is they can take the load ( and a load of distortion ) off the mains . By crossing the mains over above their rated bottom point , they play cleaner than full range no matter how good they are . <p> A lot of folks will argue that mains should always be run full range , but my experience does not back this up in many cases . <p> All this stuff is not for the faint of heart , and requires a transparent crossover and preferably the ability to delay the mains . If your subs are behind your mains , they are WAY behind in time . You can phase align them no matter where they are , but that does n't  mean they are time aligned . When you hear them time-aligned , its a head-smacker . Sounds like a single pair of speakers , independent of where the subs ended up in the room ( assuming they are in a " good " spot ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is happening . I can not cut off my speakers low end and the corner is the only available space for the single sub . The REL rep suggested setting the sub to 10 Hz . above the main speaker rating . Perhaps I need to try this range . <p> Maybe its why genesis are separate as my IRS v are . But I do feel even they seem Low . I feel More than I hear it seems . If I increase the bass output control to what i like than its obviously too much on other tracks can I be losing low end hearing ? I Always felt even back in the day that my RS1B was low . Yet or shook the room . Can it be for me I like it to be too much . <p> I 'm not sure subs in itself produce better bass than full range speakers . But they can be easily placed in the best place for the best bass ( cancelling out standing waves ) without having to remove your couch , kids or spouse . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the speakers/subs . <p> Yes , GOOD subs and GOOD speakers . But that goes without saying . BTW , my 2 REL subs are not placed in the corner . Too much boomy bass . More halfway , not too close to the wall . Much better , in spite of what REL says in the manual . <p> Getting good , articulate , deep bass response from a loudspeaker is I believe , but am happy to be contradicted the one thing that adds most to the cost of a loudspeaker design , and not by a small margin . Then , having gone to all that expense , the listening room itself ( and everything it contains ) will actually have the greatest impact on whether all that cost ends up delivering against its design objectives . Finally , against all logic , it seems to me that what an overwhelming majority of listeners believe they want audiophile as well as non-audiophile is NOT accurate bass . Surprisingly few people have had the rare privilege of hearing a system with a truly deep and flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing they inevitably ask is " Wheres the bass ? " . <p> I should point out that I do n't  have such a system myself . My speakers are flat to about 28Hz , and if they went any deeper I do n't  think my limited size listening room could accommodate it . <p> I am certain you 're right , but when you pay more than the price of an automobile for a speaker you 'd imagine theyd at least make it truly full range in the room . <p> The lowest bass is nearly always missing because speakers , even those " flat to 28Hz " , are n't  delivering that output to your listening chair . The fact they go that low in an anechoic chamber 1 meter from the measurement microphone is not relevant . That they deliver that low frequency to your listening position is all that matters . And 28Hz is plenty low , if only you were getting it . <p> Speakers need subwoofers . Either built in or external . Period . Bass 40Hz and below needs to be separately amplified and adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pedals while performing on a wooden floor and the microphones are nearby , the low frequency pounding reverberates through the room and gives a sense of real . Its on the recording . Even the subway beneath Carnegie Hall should be noticeable in the quiet passages when recorded that way . <p> Without these cues you 're missing too much . And few rooms cant support it at the listening position but nearly no loudspeakers reproduce it . <p> I think you have a point about the " Wheres the bass " thing . Its true we have had our notions of bass bent by surround systems , clubs and movie theaters . True , correctly balanced bass reproduction provides sound that seems a natural extension of the mains speakers , so that they seem to be wildly outperforming for their size . There should n't be any exaggerations . But most folks have come to like exaggerations of one sort or another . Many like their tweeters exaggeratedly " hi-fi " or " revealing " sounding ( read : imbalanced with regard to the entire spectrum ) . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range speakers + active sub with parametric EQ . I use the sub less for adding bass , but for cancelling resonances <p> I 'd never buy a pair of full range speakers or speakers + sub without a parametric EQ for the low bass , because then the only option for trouble-free bass is extensive , near to perfect room treatment <p> Full range with one pair of speakers usually means very large speakers , large room , acoustically treated roomnot for everyone <p> Even some with smaller listening rooms may want to buy very good and expensive , but smaller speakers , so there 's probably a need for non-full range , expensive speakers <p> Food for thought Gary of genesis is working Ina pair of speakers that can be put against or close to the back wall . Now how far he gets will remain to be Seen . Bass is no doubt the obstical for most of us . <p> One thing I 've noticed with a lot of speakers is that they use cheap crossover parts . They are designed to be small to fit into the cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupling capacitors and 18 or 20 AWG inductors . Swapping out a cheap inductor with a 14 AWG hepolitz inductor can dramatically improve the base . <p> For years now my criteria for main speakers includes the ability to extend with reasonable output down to 40 Hz . That point was chosen for two reasons . It covers the fundamentals of most musical instruments , and second , that includes an acoustic string bass ( 42 Hz ) because I listen to a lot of jazz and want that covered . <p> I 've never owned a subwoofer ( which I define as covering the 40 down to maybe 20 Hz octave ) because I do n't  have the room necessary . However I have heard demonstrations where the addition of a good sub or lower bass driver can improve the upper bass and midrange when integrated properly . So if I ever move to a place where the room supports at least a pair of lower bass drivers I 'll certainly consider them . <p> Agreed with all comments requiring an active subwoofer for the octaves below 40 Hz . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution ? I would strongly recommend the best tweeters . Otherwise timpani will sound as Chinese gongs and violins as violas ! <p> Would love to get a list of your favorite test tracks for bass . I seem to recall in an earlier post that you use one from a Boz Skaggs album but I do n't  recall which . I generally use acoustic bass from well recorded jazz albums like Charlie Haden or Christian McBride . I also use some classical organ pieces . What do you use ? <p> There 's an electric piano or synth and one note it hits is inevitably missing from 90% of the system I listen to . And here were not talking about low , low bass . Remember , this is a primary keyboard synth and not some subway rumble . <p> Once you hear it youll know . Each note is ( and should be ) the same level . As the keyboardist runs down the riff , the final note he hits is missing . Most people listening to this are n't  even aware it exists and once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that CD . I assume you are talking about the last track " Thanks To You " . I 've listened to it on 3 different systems my audio rig with speakers and headphones , my home theater which is in an acoustically tuned and professionally equalized room with 7 subs that goes very low , and a computer-based nearfield system using Focal pro monitors with a sub crossed over a 70 Hz . They all produce the same sequence of notes . The song is in 3/4 time and I think the riff you 're referring to uses four bars where he plays quarter notes on beat 2 and 3 of bar 1 , all 3 beats of the 2nd bar , plays the 1st beat of the 3rd bar , rests for two beats , and then comes back in on the first beat on the next bar . Is that accurate or are all of my systems missing the " magic " note ? <p> You are not alone In feeling this way . I too have wondered many times , in fact whenever I read an audio journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn blue in the face describing speakers with as you so well describe wimpy bass . Descriptions of performances floating in the air are very impressive but are really a nice but misleading way of saying that there is little or no bass . Bass forms the foundation of music . It gives substance to what would otherwise be emasculated music but is described as ethereal . You have a system with excellent low bass so it is easy to notice the absence of it . For those who are not familiar with live music or are used to music without really deep bass will not understand your point of view.Ear buds and small speakers can not defy the laws of physics . Low bass requires that a lot of air be moved at very low frequencies and this requires big drivers not a couple of puny eight inch drivers . People mistake mid bass for bass . As a reviewer one can not trash bass deficient speaker specially if it is expensive so one gets round it by using flowery language . That is why look before you leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I agree with most of what you say above , but it reminds me of what fellow bass players used to say about buying an amp " got ta be an 18 ? speaker " to produce real bass . <p> One of the most popular electric bass guitar amps was/is an Ampeg SVT , which has multiple compartments with multiple 10 ? drivers . I 'm currently using a PJB amp with a similar design but with 5 ? drivers . Other musicians are always impressed with the tone and the bottom of this amp ( as its not huge ) , then are shocked when I tell them they 're listening to 5 ? drivers . <p> There are a lot of really good in-ear monitors nowadays that have tiny drivers that , when installed in your ear canal , produce amazing , clean bass on your tiny eardrums . So I suspect its more about the size of the room , etc . <p> 1 . If your walls weigh over 2lb/ft2 , they contain bass frequencies , over 5lb/ft2 they contain sub frequencies . Under these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note and seat to seat so it is not going to be accurate . I use bass leakage to get accurate bass : large open areas like stairways , doorways , open floor plans and large glass areas or light walls . <p> You can also use bass diffusion or tuned bass traps , but they have to be custom ordered and take a lot of space . I make custom acoustic furniture so bass and treble control can be camouflaged as socially acceptable objects . <p> Dipoles of course have half as many spatial resonances , but even the mighty Audio Artistry Beethovens most accurate bass I have heard from a commercial speaker do not have full range bass . Most dipoles cross to a sealed woofer or subwoofer , which creates spatial anomalies in the crossover region and inaccurate bass . <p> 2 . Because of heavy walled architecture , traditional instruments except organ have a bass rolloff at 80Hz or above . This includes Fender basses and their myriad clones , the pickup locations on the string subtract 6dB from fundamentals below the fifth fret and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showman " sealed cabinets have an f3 80Hz and above . <p> 3 . Speaker efficiency coupling to air is proportional to the diameter over the wavelength , so inherent response for the same displacement is -6dB/octave going down . To compensate for this , the cone displacement doubles for every octave until the box tuning frequency . At this resonance , the impedance rises and for any transients including notes starting and stopping the energy is delayed and put into the room at the speaker frequency , not the musical frequencies . <p> This " one note bass " effect muddies bass for all commercially available speakers , including subwoofers* and studio monitors , causing recording engineers and producers to include an 80Hz bass rolloff in all recordings . <p> 4 ) Unless the studio has huge , well integrated subs , bass will also cause Doppler distortion , frequency shifting from inter-modulation between frequencies . This insures the universal bass rolloff . <p> 5 ) Even if the recording has accurate bass ( I have found a half dozen obscure titles in 45 years of search ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudness to the original event because of human loudness curves . <p> A ) The Toole corner location only works below the room compression frequency , where the wavelength is equal to the room diagonal . For example , a typical 8 ' x 12 ' x 18 ' Living Room is 50Hz . If your read the Welty &amp; Olive Harman/AES paper , it takes three subs per channel with adjustable location , level , EQ and phase to flatten a typical room up to 200Hz using locations against the wall . With luck you can do it with one sub , but you will be tripping over it . <p> Mark Risi of Performance Imaging designs HT with two LFE subs and a sub per sat , for a total of nine . This generally works , but you need separate cal setting for sources without LFE ( i.e. MUSIC ) , and with or without correlation between channels . <p> B ) Film soundtracks have bass with vague temporal characteristics ( phase and envelope ) so they sound good on cheap subs . They are presenting sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rex footsteps for which listeners have little to no experience . I have been in a high-end post production control room and it was far below audiophile standards . <p> Thanks for adding your expertise and highlighting the basics of room acoustics ! Could it be that the " sound " perception of majority of subwoofer aficionados is trained by heavy metal concerts and dance club sounds and not by natural instruments ? <p> The perception of majority of sub aficionados trained heavy metal concerts First of all : what 's wrong with that ? In these concerts bass is important , so I wan na hear it at home . And the did you ever hear organ or contrabass in a classical piece . In a concert hall I mean . I thinl you have . Well , there 's a lot of deep bass , so Iwanna hear that at home as well . ( I understand that 's not quite possible in the " average " room ) . So playing classical music at home , my subs are very important . 
@@23909232 @3909232/ <p> After reading an article regarding the use of an Ethernet to optical fiber media converter to transfer digital music from PC to a DAC , I decided to try using it . The article described sonic improvements with this setup . I am using 2 TP-Link Gigabit Ethernet Media Converters ( - 1 for sending and 1 for receiving ) . A 6 inch Ethernet cable connects to the sender from my router and a 6 inch Ethernet cable connects from the receiver to the Bridge on my Direcstream DAC . THE TP-Link media converters are connected to each other with a 3 meter SC-SC Fiber optic cable . I can get an Ethernet connection to my laptop from this setup without a problem . I cant get a connection to the Bridge recognized by J River Media Center . Any ideas from anyone on how to get this to work . Thanks in advance . <p> I had ( I think ) similar issues when I put the same optical isolation " system " in place . - I found that the ethernet " handshake " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passive ethernet switch , TP-Links and DAC once I strung everything together , unless I de-powered everything in the chain upstream of my PWD MKII/Bridge I and then powered it all back up . - I never quite isolated the culprit , but I suspect the switch- is the- main offender . <p> This is- the answer to the OPs original problem . DS can not be used with- a gigabit media converter . Have to use a 100mbps converter . Went through this with each of my DACs and other devices , and had to make sure I was using the right converter for each device . For the DS , this device works with a single mode fiber interface . This device does n't  . Neither does this one though I use several elsewhere . <p> scotte1 said I had ( I think ) similar issues when I put the same optical isolation " system " in place . - I found that the ethernet " handshake " , if you will , would fail somewhere between my router , passive ethernet switch , TP-Links and DAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chain upstream of my PWD MKII/Bridge I and then powered it all back up . - I never quite isolated the culprit , but I suspect the switch- is the- main offender . <p> Once it comes up and connects , its stable . <p> Hope this helps <p> Scott <p> I did de-power everything and it all started to work flawlessly and continues to do so after 2 days .

The TP-ink models are well-labeled as to whether they are single mode or multimode . In the home , either will work just fine . I chose single mode , simply because that 's what my Superstream came with , so I decided to stick with that . You also have to make sure you have the right plugs on each end .

The sonore and Roon guys also recommend removing WiFi routers out of the listening room ( especially away from Dacs ) . <p> - <p> EDIT : I 've later seen you 're running ethernet cable in the wall . I wish I could do this but the modern powerline adapters are doing a really fantastic job .

Your comment about being able to hear the music behind the noise makes me think there could be a problem with your DAC . <p> If there was a problem with your network , you should probably hear no music at all , and Roon would be giving you errors about communicating with the DAC. - <p> There is another thread about somebody hearing static over their music when playing Roon to a DSj . That got fixed by turning the DAC off for a while. - <p> Just to make sure you 're not barking up the wrong tree , I 'd encourage you to try connecting the DAC and the iMac directly together via ethernet and seeing what happens . <p> If I remove the ethernet cable from the 2nd MC110cs ( that goes to the DAC ) &amp; connect this directly into the switch , the input on the switch lights up &amp; Roon ( music server ) see my PS Audio DAC on my network so the switch is working fine . <p> I 've emailed the supplier of the media converters as they must be faulty ?

@@23909235 @3909235/ <p> I am visiting this forum since a couple of Months now and this is where I am coming from . Streaming audio has my interest since the beginning and after several set-ups with Squeezeboxes with DACs and power supplies I went 2011 with the then new Linn Akurate DS/1 . A beautiful piece of equipment and it served me flawlessly until January of this year . The sound quality was really good and the first years Linn brought software updates with new features likes Airplay , native steaming of TuneIn , native streaming of Tidal . But over the last years I felt a resistance from Linn to adapt to new stuff . Most Linn customers complained that they did n't  like the access points Kinsky and Kazoo but I used the Lumin app that was pretty cool for the time . When I was reading more and more about Roon I decided to give it a try . In January I bought the Sonore SonicOrbiter and with a decent linear power supply over my Audionet DNP preamp / DAC it sounded pretty compatible with the Linn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to give up anymore . <p> So I sold the Linn and was looking for a new streamer / DAC since then . Roon endpoint and MQA were on my shortlist . After being interested in the Mytek Brooklyn I was reading this article by John Darko . That was looking really promising ! And then I found this forum with the clear statement that MQA is underway . I knew this is going to be my choice . I promised myself to wait until then but last week I could n't wait any longer and picked up the DSJ . I connected the device and Roon immediately found the DAC and selected the right settings . After three hours listening I- wrote the distributor that I will keep the device . Compared to the previous gear wider soundstage , better separation of instruments , very powerful bottom . The music is really detached from the speakers . A very realistic and relaxing musical experience . Also very good looking next to my Audionet pre-amp ! <p> After almost a week of listening and enjoying ( not enough because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I can conclude that this was the right choice . I really enjoy re-discovering my music collection . The only negative when it comes to sound quality : the DSJ is not painting the pretty picture . Bad recordings / masterings are revealed as bad recordings . And there are a few points that could be improved : <p> There 's no difference in the DSJ between changing the volume in PCM and DSD the data has already been converted to 30 bit wide samples by the time it reaches the volume control. - So I must assume you are talking about changing the volume earlier in the system. - Does the display on the DSJ show DoP or DSD when you are playing DSD ? if not , you need to look at that earlier component for potential problems . <p> Similarly most of the time people complain about ticks/pops , etc. when going from PCM to DSD or DSD to PCM its upstream : especially if one uses features like fading out a track that 's ending and fading in a track that 's beginning. - Also if your system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tick or pop when transitioning to DSD or to PCM. - Some streamers convert each track to DoP rather than converting the final output stream This may break gapless playing of DSD tracks. - Huron allows a few technically broken transitions from DSD to DSD to go thru if they do n't  come too often. - This should help with some streamers . <p> Huron has settable default top level screens the volume display , the sample rate display or the bridge display ( if you are using the bridge . ) <p> The DS does n't  change the material presented to it in order to present good material as the masterer intended it you have to accept that if the input is n't quite as good it wont be made better. - Still most people find that most of their software sounds better than it did before the DS ( or DS Jr. ) - A few would like some sweetening and an appropriate choice of speakers , preamp , amp and/or interconnects , speaker wire or power cords can help there . <p> Thanks for your quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use other components before the DSJ . I am directly streaming from the NAS into the BridgeII . But it is not the physical knob that is creating the ( low level ) noise but it occurs when I am using the Roon volume slider on the iPad or Mac . But I am using the the DSJ volume control through Roon , not the digital one . <p> As for the sound discussion . I am not looking for changes in the sound ! It is good as it is . The effect I was referring to is just the- revelation- effect ; - ) The rest of my gear : Audionet DNP preamp , Audionet AMP mono pre amps and B&amp;W 802 Diamonds . Via Blue cables . Great sound , no worries ! <p> Also thanks you Elk ! As for the sound see above in my reply to Ted . And thanks for the link . I will take a look . <p> I fully agree ! I was n't referring to Redbook vs hi-res or DSD but merely to imperfect recordings and masterings . These will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it is supposed to be . As most of my 6600 albums are Redbook I am glad that well recorded Redbooks improved big time ! - <p> The only negative when it comes to sound quality : the DSJ is not painting the pretty picture . Bad recordings / masterings are revealed as bad recordings . <p> To- compensate- bad recordings , it needs flexible options of tweaking the system somewhere else and to a larger extent in my experience . Like tone controls or level controls of speaker chassis if possible . <p> If you listen i.e. to average 70s/80s Pop recordings , you 'll i.e. often hardly hear enough bass and not much more quality otherwise , if the setup reproduces the really good recordings correctly and in a magic way . <p> Even if you did n't  reach this magic level yet , I can tell you , the DAC is capable of enwrapping you in a nearly holographic way with 70% of good recordings . Youll be i.e. able to hear differences between different recordings of the same label and the same artist ( take i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the one sounding just as good as you 're probably used to , the other beaming you into the sound , focusing each sound - to your ears in a fascinating way , just as a heightening of the improvement of the sound stage effects you already heard . <p> So what you call good today can be vastly improved with your system growing . This revealing characteristic imo is the key of the sound of those DACs . You 'll immediately know when it happens. - <p> Generally in my experience , the more revealing components are , the more they can limit their great sound a bit to better recordings and be more unsatisfying with bad recordings . After one achieved this revealing level of the PSA DACs throughout the setup , the good ( not only the best ) recordings get so magic , that one easily accepts to pass on the bad ones and realize , they simply were recorded or mastered or voiced badly . <p> Hobby musician , music lover , long time audiophile , jazz- , vinyl- , and tube nut ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Directstream DAC on Huron with Bridge II , a galvanic isolation device for LAN connection , a Monster High speed CAT6 LAN cable , a NAS drive QNAP TS253pro with 2 x 4GB WD red pro drives and Jriver for QNAP on the NAS with an *. aif/*.dsf library behind .

@@23909236 @3909236/ <h> Does a relay " click " if there 's no one to hear it ? <p> Mechanical or quasi-mechanical switches- are antiquated devices in a modern world . There are other alternatives that make no sound at all . <p> Switches that make no sound are called analog switches . They are typically MOSFET based and their types vary to the same degree as their mechanical counterparts : cheap ones , expensive ones , good sounding ones , bad sounding ones . Again , its all up to the skill of the designer . <p> Traditional bipolar transistors do n't  work well for analog switches . Digital , yes . Analog , no . This is because bipolars have diodes that distort- low-level AC signals . MOSFETs , on the other hand , are near-perfect switches . <p> To make an analog switch you can use a single MOSFET but typically you use two . One in series , the other in shunt . <p> These switches are low cost and excellent sounding . Not as good as the finest gold , rhodium , or silver tipped relays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOSFET analog switch in all our entry and midlevel- analog audio products . Relays are used in our highest end analog audio products like the BHK series . <p> So wrapping this up there are three types of input selectors in use : mechanical switches , relay switches , analog switches . The latter two are easy to control via a remote . <p> Tomorrow we look at the biggest challenge of them all , the volume control . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 7 COMMENTS <p> Does a speaker generate audible temporal distortion if the listener has only ever heard music with the same temporal distortion ? <p> SSS ( solid state switch ) is really fast . So fast that it can implement noise-free switching , by turning on and off at zero crossing . <p> Analog switches can also be used for an arcane audio test that Harry F. Olsen called " the single best measure of speaker performance " : the rectangular gated sine wave . Radio engineers call this a " rectangular modulation envelope " , which means that a fixed input signal , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at zero crossing so there are an integral number of cycles . This presents " second order transients " at the beginning and end of the modulation pulse . The signal is continuous , it does not jump in voltage like a Dirac or step function , but it does go from zero to maximum slope instantly because that is the nature of a sine wave , changing the fastest when it crosses zero . It also goes from maximum slope to zero instantly when it stops . <p> I have documented that unlike step transients , this waveform exists in music , so any speaker claiming musical accuracy should be able to reproduce it ( but very few can ! ) . Percussion instruments that are struck including keyed hammers in piano and celeste load kinetic energy into a mass and then release it instantly so the sound springs to life fully formed like Venus on the half shell . Plectrum instruments and pizzicato string techniques load energy silently by stretching a string and then releasing . Skilled wind players can start instantly by a combination of lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments can also go to zero quickly at the end of a note by using an analog " switch " in the form of a hand to damp and absorb all the energy abruptly , a technique usually notated as " staccato " . Mechanical keyboards almost always have dampers that are critically adjusted in softness by maintenance technicians to absorb the energy and cut off notes quickly . <p> So what does this mean for speakers ? There is an inherent flaw in all speakers : energy storage . The mechanical system of mass and spring stores potential energy in the spring force and kinetic energy in the mass velocity . This means that when a note starts abruptly there is a delay time while the resonant system of mass and spring loads energy , and after the note stops the energy is unloaded over some time . Both of these are at the characteristic frequency of the driver resonance , which corresponds roughly to impedance peaks . Since this frequency is not present in the music , it is ANHARMONIC , and therefore audible at low levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woofer , tweeter , squawker , cabinet and every coil and capacitor in the crossover . This can account for some peoples preference for first order crossovers and single driver systems ( which have other problems ) . At woofer resonances it tends to fall off the loudness curve and for treble speakers is is quite short and only affects musical consonants . Every time you listen to a speaker play music your ears adapt to this sound so by now you have thousands of hours of " break-in " to the universal temporal distortion of dynamic ( cone and voice coil ) speakers . BUT , a gated sine wave generated by an analog switch driven by a zero crossing counter makes it clearly audible , and visible on a scope trace . <p> This also explains why I have never liked vented boxes they have two resonances and more than double the temporal distortion . The lowest temporal distortion obtainable is a dipole , infinite baffle or backwave absorber ( B&amp;W Nautilus ) . <p> The only published measures of temporal distortion are phase and group delay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate to sound . OTOH , a scope trace of response to a gated sine is instantly comprehensible . This is why it is not published ! <p> Once again the test of a signal switch is the difference between what it sounds like and a shunt . MOVs will definitely have some characteristic of their own . They are after all active devices . What happened to " more is less ? " Relays can build up oxide on their contacts because of arcing , even if it is a very small arc over a long period of time . Of course gold will not oxidize but other substances can find their way between the contact points unless they are hermetically sealed . Usually that is considered insignificant but when the gain after the relay is enormous and the expectation of low noise is very high , that could matter . Mercury wetted relays have no contact resistance and no bounce . Their MTBF should be very high . For high end preamps , I think theyd be worthy of consideration .

I 've got a dedicated Buffalo router for the Melco because I initially had problems with my home network Ive hard wired it to my main router but set it up on a separate subnet ( do n't  ask me how , I just followed some instructions i found without really understanding it ) and it works perfectly .

I understand the need for a hardwired solution but a NAS could still work as a hardwired solution . I had the same issue , the NAS being in a remote room in the house and my streamer ( Sonore Signature Rendu ) which only takes ethernet in much like the Bridge is in the living room . If you happen to have a coaxial cable outlet from the wall somewhere close to the PS DS , then you may consider a Moca system . I had tried EoP in the past for few days few years back with Zyxel devices and did not like the occasional spikes in the sound . I then transitioned to Moca . Moca will allow you to transfer ethernet via coaxial which is an extremely robust and reliable set-and-forget solution . One Moca adapter connects to the remote router and the coaxial outlet there ( you need to have a coaxial cable outlet close to the router ) and the other adapter close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest devices from Actiontec for more than 2 years and they just work . Track change or skipping is instantaneous even at 24/192 . I am streaming from a Synology DS1515+ .

I tried minimserver on my Synology prior to purchasing the Melco and , to be honest , it got a little confusing . So I stuck with standard software on Melco and have had no issues . Let me know if there 's a benefit , may be I 'll take another like look. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my N1A .

Theyve been very silent about it . <p> Hi Dave K , I 'll be getting my Bridge 2 in the New Year so wont be able to confirm until then . However , Alan Ainslie from Melco advised me that by changing from Twonky to Minimserver , the Melco is able to output DoP over Ethernet . You are correct that it cant do that with the standard Twonky software . <p> And if your planning to copy all your music into the internal hard drives , get a really long book to read , it could take a while . <p> Thanks , davek. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal HDDs. - The albums are organized by folder . - Some folders have artwork and some do not . - How easy or difficult is it to add artwork to folders on the internal HDDs ? - Thanks . <p> Assuming you have a laptop on the same network as the Melco , you 'll be able to see the Melco as another external drive , same as a NAS , and the music will be organised into folders in the normal way .

I 'm currently running N1A via bog standard USB cable into DS ( sold decent cables and W4S Recovery in order to fund Bridge 2 ) and it still sounds great .

@@23909241 @3909241/ <h> Bi-amping : active crossover <p> The ideal way to design a loudspeaker from the ground up is with a separate amplifier for each driver and an active crossover directing frequencies to each- amp . And it is almost never done . And the few that have been designed like this are n't  very well received . And there are a million opinions of why : Audiophiles like to choose their own amps , speakers that plug into the wall socket are not well liked , few have sounded that good , its all or nothing in terms of sound ; - to name a few . <p> Some people like to make their own active loudspeakers using their choice of- amplifiers , electronic crossovers and drivers . This too is bi-amping- ( bi-channeling ) . To roll your own requires an electronic crossover . There have been many available over the years , and my favorite has always been John Curls Symmetry crossover . But purely analog crossovers- are rare today , and for good reason . What does one do with an electronic crossover that divides frequencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossover to take advantage of them " even if DSP is included ? I am sure there must be a few raw speakers , but I can not think of even one . And so , using an electronic crossover to bi-channel a loudspeaker is a practice for hobbyists and do-it-yourselfers . For the most part . <p> The idea is simple . In any multi-driver loudspeaker you must make sure the proper frequencies get to the appropriate driver : highs to the tweeter , lows to the woofer , middle frequencies- to the midrange driver . In most speakers this is handled with a passive crossover built into the loudspeakers itself . Consisting of a collection of capacitors , resistors and coils of wire , passive crossovers are what define the sound of a loudspeaker " the tools of designers shaping sound . <p> But there is a school of thought suggesting passive crossovers are too crude to make smooth sound . After all , combining two drivers into one seamless sound field is a serious challenge . An argument could be made that using modern active techniques that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a handful of caps , resistors , and coils . Let 's look at the pros and cons tomorrow . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 19 COMMENTS <p> A US based company that recently left the market ( TacT Audio ) offered a digital 10 channels room correction preamplifier ( TCS MK II ) that could be used as an active digital crossover allowing to set the frequency range and roll off as well as the volume level for each channel . However the digital formats were limited to 24/96 ! Alas the technology is no rocket science ! <p> However in 2020 when Japanese broadcast sttations will offer 8K tv for the Olympic Games Show audiophile hires formats will be no rocket science anymore ! Thus one can relax and wait enjoying old fashioned vinyl records produced by audiophile recording engineers . <p> I would say : a good recording from the vinyl days rules every ( digitally performed ) mixing and mastering . I have some direct cut vinyls based on an analog recoding whose red book format version simply sound dead and dull . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their processors allow for driver correction of frequency response , phase and group delay , using a microphone in a highly flexible 3 way crossover . In their case , I found their AtoD and DtoA processing good enough to be indistinguishable from a wire on an A/B comparison on a very highly resolved system and their internal processing is at 96/24 . There is much conjecture as to how high a bit rate or frequency is needed to make digital processing audibly invisible , with some saying it will never be . Still , I have not heard of anyone doing scientifically valid tests . Using the same recording on masters with different bit rates does not work because every bit rate master is re-equalized at the mastering console . Our setup used an analog system with two inputs from a turntable . One direct from the phono preamp , and one that went through a DEQX processor without any correction , equalization , or gain . The signal was only converted to digital and processed back to analog . Listening comparisons could not pick one from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analog passive crossovers , I have set up both carefully on the same speakers , believing that digital had the advantage . My results confused me . I was able at first to match the sonic characteristics of the active corrected speakers with very high quality passive crossovers . So , I worked on the digital corrected version until I got it sounding more resolved and musical . I then went back to the passive system and fine tuned the crossover trying to match the resolution musicality and smoothness . I expected to at best be able to match them . The result surprised me . The analog was beating the digital on all three parameters . I tried a few fine tuning tricks on the digital , but I could not match the analog . This was even when the DEQX was used as the pre-amplifier for both setups . So , there must be more to this than just a digital to analog comparison . My conjecture is that passive crossovers may match the dynamics better because when tuned properly they compensate for impedance changes that happen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossover between a woofer and tweeter . I do prefer active crossovers between the midrange and woofer or subwoofer because the crossover can be at a far higher rate actively . Also , correction is very valuable at lower frequencies for room resonance control . <p> Another example of more is more . Engineers and those critical of them have an saying that expresses the more is less idea . Its called " the KISS principle . " KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid . Engineers do not make their designs complex because they want to . When they do it , its because its the only way they know how to achieve very specific goals . <p> The use of electronic crossover networks at the low signal level driving multiple amplifiers has many advantages over a single amplifier driving a single multiway loudspeaker system using a passive crossover network at the amplifier output level . One disadvantage is complexity . It is not as simple . The more flexibility to make precise adjustments you have , the more complex things are going to get . There are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to list them all . But like all tools , you have to know how to use them . Even a hammer can be used to build a house or smash your thumb . <p> Active equalization has advantages but room correction is n't one of them . Not for conventional speaker systems . The problem is that the speaker systems offered do not facilitate independent control over the direct and reflected sound fields . Therefore , , when you adjust the equalizer to compensate for excessive high frequency absorption in a dead room , you are creating a high frequency peak in the direct sound field at the same time . No matter what the rooms acoustics , when you try to compensate by correcting for it , you are at the same time making things worse for the direct field . <p> Engineering a good idea with relatively inexpensive components can often achieve far better results than tweaking a flawed idea throwing everything you 've got regardless of cost including the kitchen sink into it . <p> I have to add here : Pauls power plants ( regenerators ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIFI system could edit a bad recording in that way that the original sound is recreated ! : - ) These systems only add their own colorations ! <p> That depends on how you define garbage . Is garbage the hardwareor the idea ? Having exhausted vast numbers of variants to the hardware including the most extreme and absurd imaginable over nearly 100 years , and still not getting the desired results , do n't  you think its time to take a fresh look at the idea ? For me that 's where the real garbage is . Its also a lot harder than trying to build a better tweeter or woofer . It not only requires putting at risk our most cherished preconceptions , it requires knowledge and actual thinking , something in very short supply these days . <p> Room Equalization works at frequencies that are not directional , below approximately 100Hz . As for expensive or inexpensive components , I judge them by testing them and listening to them , not by price . Good sounding components improve a good design . <p> As the eigenvectors showed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room 1 , there are directional resonances in all three dimensions . Correct for resonances in one dimension and others are created or made worse in the other two . The basic problem is that the listening rooms are too small to get the largest resonance frequencies below audibility . Not only that , but bass response can vary as you move around a room . A foot or two can change it by as much as 40 db at some frequencies in some rooms . <p> There are nodes and anti nodes in all rooms whether you are talking about a live performance or a loudspeaker playing , therefore , you equalize for the prime seat . Room equalization is not expected to correct the normal room resonances . <p> Talking about active speakers I 've been a fan since the nineties when Walter Fuchs from SAC audio ( Essen , Germany ) demonstrated his active system called " Cantabile " . LONG ... In those days I could n't afford such a system and I still feel sorry about it . Now I 'm planning to talk to Walter Fuchs again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active loudspeaker system . Walter , being our age , ( I was born 1949 ) could be an interesting partner on the continent for PS as well . You can contact him on : http : //www.volpe.at . <p> Regards , <p> G.R.J. Smit <p> The Netherlands . <p> P.s . : A Direct stream is one of the next steps in the new audio line I 'm establishing . <p> Passive crossovers can sound smooth as silk provided the coils and capacitors are top class and these can be very expensive . also the best coils are air core coils which can be quite expensive . simpler the crossover better the sound . This is why simple 6db crossovers as a group sound best . 12db crossovers are almost as good . Unnecessarily complicated crossovers require too many components . More the components more compromised the sound whether the crossover is passive or active.The easiest way is to match the crossover points with the roll off points of the drivers and ensure that the sensitivity of the drivers is the same and use the minimum of resisters , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why corners are cut . After all the bottom line decides the final outcome in business . <p> First , I want to second Soundminded comments 100% on this topic , especially the pithy hammer analogy . <p> Let me expound on the overwhelming advantages of active crossovers . To measure the drivers a voltage source is applied and the response recorded . The goal is to mate this curve , in amplitude AND phase , with the next higher and/or lower driver curves . <p> With a passive crossover , the inductors , capacitors and resistors interact in complex ways with the **26;548;TOOLONG system that are not fully predictable because of subtle resonances that differ from the standard simplified model of driver behavior like cone breakup , suspension non-linearities , magnetic field non-linearities , hysteresis , etc . Energy cycles back and forth between crossover reactances and drivers , adding many resonance frequencies with resultant phase shifts , spatial and time distortions . <p> The difference between ideal and physical crossover components has to be taken into account and is obvious in ferro-magnetic core inductors , aluminum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less than twenty , and the tradeoffs continue ad-infinitum . <p> Further , energy storage in one driver and associated crossover will cross-feed into the others . These low level effects can be ignored in normal machine engineering practice , but when the desired system output is human perception with 120dB dynamic range and .001% sensitivity to particular anharmonic non-linearities you cant ignore them . <p> Hand-tuned analog active crossovers correspond closer to audiophile superstitions ( which have grounding in reality ) , but DSP has so many virtues it is easier to address the " digititis " than the foibles of passive componentry . I use Behringer crossovers which are full of junk parts by audiophile lore and a measly 24/96 , but I am radiantly happy with the results because I can address the temporal , transient , intermodulation , dynamic range and spatial distortions that plague " High End " systems . <p> The first DSP advantage is eliminating interaction between drivers and crossovers . The conditions of use are identical to the conditions of driver measurement a dedicated , high damping factor amplifier connected directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow linear acoustic superposition precisely . The second is reducing crossover component distortions to electronic levels approaching the .001% threshold of perception ( one has to be cognizant of quantization error propagating through the calculations and dynamic range ) . <p> The third is tailoring curves that ca n't be constructed from physical components , especially tricky compensation of non-flat driver response and using negative time . The fourth is dynamic re-programming to tailor the system tradeoffs depending on the program content . For example , low volume levels allow very gradual slopes while high output requires steeper slopes for power handling and Doppler distortion criteria ( My favorite speakers have either first order or fourth order and higher depends what you are listening to ) . <p> Although there are an infinite number of crossovers that produce flat response on axis , none are completely flat off-axis and they vary widely . A DSP crossover can tune the speaker for some room anomalies , although this is inferior to tuning the room to the speaker . Finally , DSP allows tuning in situ , after the drivers have broken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced . <p> One problem passive filters have is that the impedance of drivers is not constant . For example , as drivers draw current , their coils heat up increasing resistance . As they move back and forth they can have a change in inductance as well . This means the filter action of the crossover network is not constant but varies with amplitude and voice coil heating . The voice coil problem is well known and is called thermal compression . <p> The active crossover does n't  have these problems , their filtering action as a function of amplitude and frequency does not change . For the designer or experimenter an active crossover can be used to quickly and inexpensively try many combinations of crossover frequencies , crossover cutoff rates , and different filter types such as Butterworth versus Linkwitz-Riley . For a manufacturer , this could be one way to arrive at an optimal design through trial and error and then try to duplicate it using passive components . Equalization can also be applied actively and then duplicated insofar as possible in the passive network . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active crossover networks and active equalization are degrading to performance . The market wants speakers that sound flat with no low level signal manipulations . Therefore the crossover networks can become very complex . This can create serious load impedance problems for some amplifiers . With no way to adjust the sound the audiophile resorts to expensive cables that act as filters . Unless you are a very skilled engineer and have a lot of experience with filter calculations as well as the necessary data , the effect of any particular audiophile wire is unpredictable resulting in a lot of trial and error . An entire cottage industry has grown up around this .

I have downloaded MCH DSD files from Native DSD and I stream them to my stock BDP-105 which decodes all 5 channels and feeds 5 channels of analog to the PrePro in my theater . Does n't  require anything special in JRiver . As long as the Oppo is powered on and connected to your network , and you have JRiver configured for Media Network , JRiver will discover the Oppo .

I also have a PS Audio Preamp in the mains channel ( surround and center are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dirac which will level the channels during calibration . Without dirac , you would simply create channel level offsets in JRiver and run all the DACs at the same output level . If you have them stacked you can control all three with the same remote . Works OK . <p> I personally prefer to control volume in MCH mode in Jriver . All DAC set to 100 , and volume control done in Jriver . Easier . <p> - I used Vanity Card with Oppo as well in the past . Works fine also . Never used the HD with native DSD . I never ran MCH native DSD but I prefer MCH with DRC in PCM over DSD . Further , the convenience of using a server to me far outweighs any benefits of having to spin discs to play MCH DSD . <p> Ask me specifics and I can comment more . I have tried- nearly every MCH architecture under the sun over the years . ( Trinnov , Theta , MCH analog preamps , Server based etc. etc. ) . - 
@@23909254 @3909254/ <p> I 've heard that Pioneer model and while its not bad , I find that it suffers from incredibly steep ( to my ear ) low midrange roll off followed by an unwelcome compensatory boominess in the high-mid bass ( possibly to make up for the 4 inch low frequency driver ) . I find a lot of speakers that seem designed to surround a computer monitor also suffer from this same flaw . Unchallenging music that 's been compressed can sound pretty good at lowish volumes but anything challenging ( particularly live jazz performances for some reason ) really sound dreadful . <p> The Def Techs ( again , to my ear ) are much more refined ( and more expensive , keep in mind , then the Pioneers ) . At low volumes they disappear into the room and create an almost subliminal ambiance . When you crank them up , they maintain amazing composure at surprisingly high volume . Its a little hard to describe . Imagine if someone were whispering ( or mumbling ) the Aria to a famous opera and they suddenly raised the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its actually a little freaky . <p> To be fair , I already own a pair of the Def Techs so its not like I went shopping specifically for Sprout speakers .

( If you do n't  believe in speaker break-in periods , owning these will convince you ) . <p> I 've heard that Pioneer model and while its not bad , I find that it suffers from incredibly steep ( to my ear ) low midrange roll off followed by an unwelcome compensatory boominess in the high-mid bass . . . - <p> Interesting. - The measurements do not reveal either such a roll off or bass boost. - Instead they are remarkably flat . <p> What can I say ?

To you point , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiars of the listening space or maybe I am attributing some other sonic artifact to the midrange roll off <p> I heard the Kef Ls-50s awhile back and really liked . I 'll audition them with the Sprout as well as the Sierra-2s from Ascend Acoustics . I wont be buying any speaker until I listen to it with the Sprout . <p> andrewnewman said . . . the graph shows a flat response . Perhaps it was the peculiars of the listening space . . . <p> I suspect so. - <p> The reviews are excellent , the price has dropped , they are readily available and easily returnable. - If at all interested , I would buy a pair and test them out. - Walmart sells them for $117. - I expect they are great little speakers . <p> The LS-50s sound glorious ! I bet they are a great match to the Sprout . Be aware , that we have ( in the same thread ) talked about 150 dollar speakers , 400 dollar speakers and 1500 dollar speakers . While I 'm sure we all agree cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials and engineering that has the potential to produce a better sounding speaker . <p> Given the power rating of the Sprout , what are your thoughts on how well a speaker with a sensitivity of 85db would accommodate- a medium size room ? - I am considering auditioning the new B&amp;W 686 s2. - I live in an apartment , so I cant play music too loud anyway . <p> So a lot depends upon how loud you want to play the music and how large the room is ( also how close you are to the speakers ) . I would think that you could get to reasonably righteous sound levels in a room with normal ceiling height where you are typically not more than 8 feet from the speakers with a sensitivity of 85db . I 'm pretty sure you could end your lease prematurely <p> Given the choice ? No question , go the Sonus Faber . You wont be unhappy .

Sprouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were testing . <p> The following users say thank you to Paul McGowan for this useful post : <p> Thought i read at kickstarter.com that Scott was testing sprout with the Argon1s . So how did that go ? Are these the best match for Sprout ? <p> The price for the two is exactly the same here in Norway . But I 'm leaning more against the Argon1s because i read in a review that the LS50s are a little dependent on the placing , and Aphion state that their speakers are not so dependent on the placing to sound good . <p> - <p> When that is said , I 'm no " audiophile " , so both will probably sound great to me . <p> Ill be listening to all sorts of music . But mostly pop , rock and some rnb/soul . <p> I just picked up a set of Focal Chorus 826Vs for what I think is a steal. - They are just over 91dB efficiency so they are not overly loud with the Sprout but they seem to be quite musical so far while breaking in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as well. - My older PS Statements have a nasty habit of dragging the Sprout off of the stand. - - Will give a bit of a blurb on the setup after I futz with it a bit and let it finish cooking. - <p> So , we 've been enjoying our Sprout with the Pioneer BS22s . Decided to try it out with the Wharfedale 10.2s . Very nice . I can hear- what folks mean regarding the oversold bass of Pioneers . The Wharfdales are an improvement , but were gon na try something else before making a decision . We have- them another week before moving well move to another test . <p> I looked up a few other models to consider trying out in this price range and above ( probably a $1000/pair max ) and noticed Definitive Technologys headquarters is less than an hour from our DMV home . That caught my interest . I love supporting US-based companies . It also appears I can try these out at home with Best Buys return policy . So , one or more of their StudioMonitor Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the Sprout sounds with Definitive Technology StudioMonitor 45s . I actually prefer the sound of the 45s to the 55s but I will caution that if you intend to put them close to a wall you might consider the 55s ( or 65s ) as they have a top mounted passive radiator instead of the rear firing port of the 45s . <p> Well , I am running into a problem with trying out ( or even hearing ) a set of speakers in the $1000/pair price range . I cant find anyone in the DC area who stocks the Def Tech 65s or the Peachtree D5s . I even called Def Tech ( they 're only 45 miles from my house ) and Peachtree and they do n't  know of anyone who stocks them . I guess DC hates music . <p> Seriously , what other speakers in this price range should I tryout/give a chance ? <p> One other question . The Sprout is ideal for apt living and nearfield listening .

In our townhouse the speakers are necessarily close to the wall and one to a corner . The front firing bass port- helps that a bit . Overall , we like these better than the Wharfedale 10.2s and the Pioneer BS22s . They are fairly ugly speakers though , - a black box without curves or wood finish . <p> These may be a keeper , though we might opt to test one more pair a step up from these , any specific recommendations under $1500 given the necessary speaker placement ? 
@@23909256 @3909256/ <h> How much is too much ? <p> There is a fairly common misconception I run into when speaking with customers , particularly at shows . <p> " Is my amp going to draw too much power from the wall or a Power Plant ?

" - A low efficiency number , - somewhere down in the 85 to to 88dB range , is going to take a lot more power from an amplifier than a 90dB or even a higher 92dB efficient speaker . - The efficiency rating on your loudspeakers , and the type of music you listen to , will determine how much power your amplifier outputs . <p> So why do we bother with bigger amps ? - Because the worst thing you can do is under power your speakers or , more realistically , get the amplifiers output close to its maximum rating . - Amps should work at a comfortable level to them . - a 100 watt amp straining to put out close to its maximum wo n't sound as good as the exact same wattage output from a much larger amplifier . <p> Its called headroom , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better , but it does n't  take more juice out of the wall of the Power Plant to have it . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 15 COMMENTS <p> Well , technically a class A design , a true one , is the same in one sense . It is the same because whatever wattage it delivers to the load depend entirely on the load . An 8 Ohm speaker will draw half as much as a 4 Ohm speaker with an A/B or with an A. However , it is not the same when it comes to what it draws out of the wall . <p> One of the interesting differences between the types is that Class A consumes a constant amount from the wall regardless of how much it is putting into a loudspeaker . In a class A design , let 's say a 200 watt class A , it draws an constant 200 watts from the wall . If there 's no speaker attached , it still draws 200 watts , only this time the watts are going into heat . When you play music , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat , but the draw is constant . <p> Therefore , a class A amp is running at its coolest when its delivering power to the speaker . Instead of pumping the watts into the heat sink , it pumps it into the speaker . <p> PaulYour comments are true for a class AB or a Class D amp ( and a few others ) , but NOT for Class A. They suck electrons out of your wall regardlessAnd its not just headroom and amp comfort zone ; you really do n't  want the amp ever to clip , because then some very fast edges will get to the speaker and you risk killing the tweeter , since fast edges -&gt; high frequency , and most tweeters are sized for the rather small amount of real treble in real music PetePS nice new website , but perhaps this text could be a little darker for ease of typing <p> Interesting problem . How much power do you need ? How much from your amplifier , how much from your utility to power it ? Once upon a time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Burwen 's 20,000 watt system have enough ? ) , flat frequency response from DC to infinity , zero distortion and noise . And then I became an engineer and everything changed.Not only are those parameters unattainable , they are also unnecessary and even undesirable.Engineering is intended to provide optimal solutions for problems , not necessarily the most expensive or the highest degree of overkill obtainable.For a home , a 50 watt per channel amplifier may be more than sufficient for a large acoustically dead room if you have Klipschorn speakers . At the other extreme , getting my original Bose 901s to equal the bass output of my AR9s at 60wpc could take 3 to 4 pairs and 1000 wpc.In a sports arena or for the PA system of a high rise office building banks and banks of multithousand watt amplifiers might be required.I note that subjectively , at maximum undistorted output a 1000 watt amplifier will play twice as loud as a 100 watt amplifier.I 've come to the conclusion that like other engineering problems , careful assessment is necessary to choose the optimal size amplifier for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some speakers , stability with low impedance or highly inductive or capacitive loads is more valuable than greater maximum undistorted power output.Among the things I do is I solve this problem from the other end.Paul and others who manufacture equipment tell me how much power their equipment needs and my job is to provide it.Not just for his amplifiers and other equipment in his system but for hundreds and even many thousands of other loads simultaneously.The problem must be solved for every part of a power distribution system and the entire system as a whole so that all of the equipment works reliably without a ridiculous waste of money . How is it done ? That 's the art of electrical engineering for facilities.The utility company has the same problem at a much higher level where power grids serve entire regions , nations , or more than one nation . How adequate are these systems ? In developed countries they are reasonably reliable but not entirely and taking them for granted has made their capacity to meet peak demand increasingly questionable . In the developing world , they are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in advanced nations like the US and Britain they can and do fail and when that happens , it can be on a massive scale.Here 's a short video about how electric tea kettles can overload the entire electrical power system of LONG ... it ca n't happen here ? Guess again . It already has , more than once or twice . <p> The point I was suggesting is that even if the volume going to the speakers remains the same , a bigger Class A amp will draw more power from the mains than a smaller Class A amp , in contrast to your point Paul , that a bigger Class AB amp ( for example ) will only draw the same power as a smaller Class AB amp , if the volume to the speakers remains the same ( all other things being equal of course ) . <p> Class A amplifiers will draw pretty much the same power from the wall outlet whether they are delivering power to loudspeakers or not . This is because the tubes or transistors constantly draw current . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipated as heat in the output tubes or transistors . Therefore with a few clever exceptions class A amplifiers are generally low powered and run very hot.Class AB amplifiers draw a minimal level of power with no signal output ( 0% efficient though ) and draw increasing amounts of power as output increases . They typically can achieve about 40 to 45 percent efficiency at full power output . Because energy is stored in the power supply capacitors amplifiers can momentarily draw down on that energy in addition to what they draw from the wall outlet , hence the difference between momentary peak power delivery and continuous power delivery.Class D amplifiers especially those having switching mode power supplies can be vey efficient , up to 85 to 90 percent . This is because they only draw sufficient power to operate the speakers . When the output transistors are switched on they are at saturation and have very low voltage drop across them hence no power is dissipated in them . When they are off , operating at what 's called cutoff , they draw practically no current . This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and run cool . Although not favored by most audiophiles , compare the size , weight and cost of Class D amplifiers from Crown and QSC with comparably rated Class AB amplifiers from companies like Krell and McIntosh . There 's a world of difference . Power quality backup systems like UPSs and power regenerators have different capacities both short term and long term and inefficiencies of their own depending on their design . As I understand the PS regenerator it uses a rectifier to convert incoming AC to DC and then generates a 60 hz sine wave which it amplifies using a class AB amplifier to 120 volts ( 230Volts 50 hz for some export models . ) Typical UPSs use switching mode circuits which are highly efficient . They also have battery backup . However the cheap ones called line interactive types that are adequate for your desktop PC can have up to 40% harmonic distortion . Much more expensive types called double static conversion can have up to 5% harmonic distortion . The PS regenerator has a rated maximum of 0.5% harmonic distortion . Generally line interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . ( I have one , an Eaton 5110 but I 've never tried it for audio . ) Double static conversion types are usually too large and expensive for home use . They are typically used in industrial applications . They also require periodic battery replacement . Since audio systems for home use are not considered mission critical loads ( might be for a recording or broadcast studio though ) a PS regenerator seems like the right product for this application where power quality must be assured . <p> Paul.I finally was able to login and it says my name in polichannel . Can someone there totally delete my account so I can start over again ? I have sent you and email asking for this Did you receive it ? Terry Franklin Not polichannel <p> How about how much is too little ? For example as when using a relatively small class A/B amp with a spec of 80 WPC at 4 ohms into somewhat large speakers rated for considerably more power but when the system is never played louder than something that you can easily talk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never asked to pump out anywhere near its maximum output . Does using a smaller amp in this manner have drawbacks ? Or should the speakers be driven at ambient levels with a bigger amp that better matches them even when the system is never played louder than an ambient level ? <p> Old Infinity speakers have reps as power hogs . Their reputations are well deserved . I had to bridge two NAD amps to 300 watts per channel to keep from being eaten by the 8-Kappas . I now run the GCA-250 with my 9-Kappas and that is a marriage made in audiophile heaven . ( Actually they got hitched in Kansas . ) I never was exactly sure what headroom meant . <p> Watts are typically the first spec quoted , and they are only secondarily related to the system sound quality . Speakers with higher efficiency than typical audiophile standards are necessary for realistic reproduction . A concert grand or string quartet puts out 110dB peaks , an orchestra is 115dB and a snare drum is over 120dB . With a normal 85dB efficient speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watts respectively . Further , if you put over 50 Watts into a 1 ? tweeter , it will either launch into space or start smoking . ( tweeter specs are with a 12 dB/octave high pass filter on pink noise ) . Pro systems are expected to be louder than acoustic music , and they start around 95dB efficiency . Most of my speakers are 98dB and have one amp channel per driver , in which case 60 Watts each is adequate for midrange and tweeter and a few hundred for bass . The bass amps are digital , which is twice the efficiency of analog . <p> Well I have a pair of Mark Levinson 33H 100w class A power amps.I also have a PS Audio Power Plant Premier which claims to be able to handle 1500w which I bought a few years ago for the power amps.They do n't  work together ! The reason being that when you turn on the power amps they have a high initial surge current that causes the power plant to shut down , so you can never boot up the combination.You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they choke transient peak power surges , making the amplifier produce a less dynamic sound on occasion . Not a problem for the 33Hs as they have enough onboard capacitance . Might be a problem with many other amps . I 've experienced it before.Thanks for this blog post , it reminds me I have an unused Power Plant Premier to dispose of somehow . <p> It is most unfortunate that turn on amplifier inrush current for your amplifier trips out the PS regenerator shutting it down . There are easy fixes for this . If you are a good designer you can build one yourself although it obviously wont be UL listed . A simple way is to use a current limiting resistor in series with the amplifier power input with a bypass relay on a time delay circuit of say 15 to 30 seconds . This allows the amplifiers transformer to build up reverse emf and the power supply filter capacitors to charge up . Usually there is a bleeder resistor in parallel to the power supply caps in the amplifier so that when its turned off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier is on and stable the draw of that resistor is minimal having negligible effect on the power supply . The value of the resistor should be low enough to allow the power supply to stabilize in a reasonable amount of time , high enough to prevent the regenerator nuissance tripout and its wattage rating high enough to prevent the resistor from burning out . The relay contacts should be quite robust since it will open and close an inductive circuit , 30 amps at 250 volts is sufficient . A single pole single throw relay is adequate . You could time it out buy using a DC relay with an RC timing circuit but I 'd probably opt for an adjustable time delay pilot relay to close the main relay . Love those time delay relays . Another option is to substitute a time delay on contactor which will perform the same function as the relay .

Bass is better defined , percussion is more impactful , and generally everything is more musical . The biggest difference was under the TT , by far . Before the Kones I had sorbethane pucks under most components . - A couple downsides to consider WRT the Kones : price and size . They range from around $45 apiece for the aluminum and steel to up to $350 per for the titanium and ceramic . I went for the BC Kones at $140 per since they had the best price/performance mix . I did n't  notice too much difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC Kones . As for the size , they elevate the components 56 mm or slightly more than 2 inches . That has stretched real estate in my rack , for sure , but its been worth it , IMO . Also you really need to experiment with placement under each component , as their location affects their ability to drain unwanted vibrations .

As to whether you need 3 of 4 Kones , I 'd say go with 3- since I have n't seen any mention where 4 is truly advantageous , other than from a stability standpoint . However , with 4 you may run into wobbling issues . Nordost recommended 4 under the TT but I found 3 worked great so I stuck with 3 .

@@23909261 @3909261/ <p> I was surprised when people here posted up to 500hr for the DS to sound its best . I was getting spitty sibilants and was starting to think there maybe a problem with the upgrade kit . One of our more studious colleagues posted that at 500hrs the spit dries up . I am now a believer . I have been running track 9 of the XLO/Reference Recordings system conditioning CD every night &amp; it seems to be doing the business . I 'd say I was up to 400hrs and will keep it up another week . <p> Sibilant reproduction , especially female vocals , is a major concern for me so I hope it continues to dry up . <p> Another thing is , I did n't  like JRMC 20 . I seem to get better sound with 19.0.146 &amp; 18.0.194 <p> rossop , many of us ( including me ) felt that the DS definitely needed several hundred ( yes at least 4-500 ) hours for things to come into their own . My own opinion is that after that point any changes become very subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after burn in I felt I still had a bit of harshness in the female vocal range . Turned out to be my silver ICs that were champs with the PWD Mk.II . They could n't cut it with the DS . You using silver ICs by any chance ? Not saying that DS and silver do n't  mix , but it might be worth an experiment . <p> Yes I 'm on 1,2,1 its great . ICs are old ( expensive ) Yamamura Churchill . They are copper . The only silver wire I have is the PSA hdmi cable to connect the DAC to the PWT . <p> I run from my PC/NAS ( in one room ) via PLCs to my main system where the DS lives . So maybe I have some electrical noise on the line . However , that setup compares very favourably with the same music file played through the PWT . I cant really tell the difference .

Well , you never know considering in my own system I 've found the DS outputs to be the most " tweaky " part of this DAC , it might be worth trying something else just to see if perhaps the Churchills are not a perfect match . <p> I 'm trying the DS for 30 days . - Sounded quite nice after about 2 hours , but after an overnight break-in session has started to change . - In the past , with other equipment and tweaks , the pre-break-in time does give an indication of important overall qualities that eventually return , usually in a more refined way . <p> the qualities were : a lovely midrange , especially on female vocals , large soundstage with lots of depth , very quiet background , seductive coherence , and something I cant put my finger on and therefore can not explain ( perhaps it is something it does n't  do ) . - Going from a well regarded ( and sounding ) tubed unit to the DS , I was n't missing the tubes . - Very surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very different from the two off-the-shelf ( but still wonderful ) chips Ive owned ( saying the obvious ) . - A better mousetrap ? - Will see how it goes . - But 500 hours ? - <p> I personally find the multiple hundreds of hours break-in claims difficult to take seriously , both on an objective basis and on the fragility of sensory memory . <p> But , in any event , you will have the unit long enough for a 500 hour break-in if you keep a source connected to it continually .

I have found with some digital cables that running a burn in disc begins to have deleterious effects after a while . - To me , things sound very bright and , dare I say , sibilant , following long and continuous burn in disc sessions . Consequently , I now only use a burn in disc ( in my case Isotek ) for the first 100-200 hours . After that , I use sampler discs that are made up of a variety of musical styles . I wo n't name names , but I got this tip from some folks in the digital sound reproduction business . The theory behind it was over my head , but I gave it a whirl and , sure enough , I got better results . So , you might dispense with the burn in disc during this last stretch and use a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playback after 350 hours and make sure I reboot the system every few days . <p> I was tossing and turning in my sleep on Thursday night when I- had an epiphany . I thought I might pop the top of the DS just to have a look . When I pressed it down and removed the lid the lid earthing cable was just hanging there .

The lid earth strap may- have come loose- when I popped the top but I do n't  think so . <p> - <p> I did n't  have a good listen at that time but the next day and again today and I believe I am now heading in the right direction .

@@23909262 @3909262/ <p> So I have been trying to setup optical fiber conversion from ethernet for my DS DAC and its not working for some reason . I purchased a pair of TP-Link MC210CS and connected with Lynn SCSDUPSM-3M 9/125 Duplex Single-Mode Fiber Optic Patch cable and powered it up to work as an ethernet connection between my switch and my Mac Mini . No problem . It wont work with the DS DAC , though . I switched the toggle switch from " forced " to " auto " and nothing . For whatever reason this setup does n't  work with the DS DAC . I am pretty sure I intentionally used the same unit referenced by another DS DAC owner- on this forum , but no dice . Does anyone have insight as to why this is n't working ? I thought the only important designation on these converters is that it be single-mode fiber and not multi-mode . This is a " 10/100/1000 Mb " unit so it should good with any switch . Any help is greatly appreciated. - <p> Are you referring to connecting the TP-Link between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> I am not 100% positive that you need " 1000 Mb " capacity . <p> Do you have the transmit and receive fibers connected correctly ? <p> It should be transmit &gt; receive between the units , not transmit &gt; transmit &amp; receive &gt; receive. - <p> I believe that- you also have to rest the media converter after you change any selector switch settings. - - <p> Thanks for the reply . I agree I do n't  think I need Gigabit speed for the converter . The 10/100/1000 designation suggests it will work with all switches . From all I have seen , though , it shouldnt matter with the DS DAC . I know another DS owner made this one work . <p> I 'm pretty sure I had everything connected properly . It worked connected to my Mac Mini and just disconnected the ethernet from the MM and connected to the DS DAC and no dice . There is no " transmit " or " recieve " on these units that I know of . They are identical and only have a toggle between " forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that and they do n't  work . Are you saying there is a orientation to the fiber cable , itself ? - <p> As for resting , I re-cycled the power after switching with no luck . After re-testing , I plugged back into the MM and it worked fine. - <p> .. - I purchased a pair of TP-Link MC210CS . This is a " 10/100/1000 Mb " unit so it should good with any switch . Any help is greatly appreciated. - <p> Adam- - <p> I bought a pair of TP-Link MC100CM converters to add optical isolation between my switch and renderer/DAC , after checking on-line what was required for handling an ethernet stream to a renderer/DAC . Many ( most ? ) only need a maximum of 100 Mbps ; indeed some are designed to not accept higher rates ( e.g. Sonore Rendu and some Linn models ) . I asked Sonore why this limitation was imposed and got the reply that a stream of 1000 Mbps could bring with it RF interference problems . <p> The MC100CMs have worked perfectly with the BridgeII / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MC100CM , one pair between my NAS and switch and one pair between the wireless hub and the switch . <p> I found no benefit between the switch and my Sonore SSR . <p> An interesting result , however did you try putting optical isolation in only the last leg , i.e. between your switch and the DS , with wired ethernet connection between all the upstream components : NAS to switch and wireless hub to switch ? <p> I 'd guess you would get similar SQ to what you have now one leg of optical isolation should break any wire-bound electrical interference path . In case the switch introduces any electrical interference I reasoned the best place for isolation would be the last leg , between the switch and the DS . <p> I tried everything I could to get the optical fiber to work with the DS using the TP-link MC200CS . I know that the MC100CM modules work for the DS DAC so I went ahead and ordered a couple of those units . Worst case is that it does n't  work for the DS and now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you guys know how it works out . <p> I received the TP-Link CM100M units yesterday and installed them between the switch and the Directsream DAC . I selected- all the dip switches in the up position and it fired up without any issues . After listening to my standard reference files , including Tidal streamed via Roon , I came to a few conclusions : <p> Playing vinyl DSD rips showed the optical isolation to be a little more dynamic , just a touch . Not jarring by any stretch . The music was a little more palpable . I 'm not sure I could pick it out in A:B comparison . <p> Playing hi res 24/96 files , RB rips , and DSD downloads also pretty much followed my experience with the DSD vinyl rips . Just a little more dynamic and hopefully not expectation bias . <p> Things got interesting when I listened to Tidal streams via Roon . I immediately noticed the music was more palpable than before . It was like the improved dynamics were on turbo . Percussion was more crisp and cymbals more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thiles mandolin strikes on " When in Rome " seemed to jump out with more energy and all the instruments had more distinct percussion and separation . This was not a subtle difference . I could easily blind pick the fiber isolation from the non-isolated. - <p> So why is this , I wonder ? I can only ascribe this to the fact that streaming is more susceptible to upstream noise than my archived recordings , I guess . Just to see how good Tidal files were sounding , I compared The Doors Morrison Hotel DSD 64 from HDTracks to the Tidal version and could honestly not hear a difference . Not that there was a huge difference before , but now there was none . The Tidal version sounded great . And just as importantly , I have not experienced any momentary distortions I would occasionally hear while streaming . I wishfully attributed this to my non-shielded CAT6a ethernet cabling picking up RFI from the mess of cords I have behind my system . Now the optical fiber crosses the power cords , etc , and is now theoretically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very happy with the fiber isolation . One quirk I noticed was while- listening to DSD 128 ( or which I have a lot of vinyl rips ) to the Bridge . Roon apparently negotiates with the DS DAC and converts DSD 128 to PCM 352 automatically and then to 176 . This has gone on without a hitch without the optical isolation . But- after isolation , I get a harsh digital noisy sound obscuring the underlying song . I had to go into Roon and enable- DSP and down-sampling to DSD 64 to make the digital noise go away . This ca n't be a problem of bandwidth , I would imagine . Its not a processing issue since it can transpose into DSD , which takes more processing power than the conversion to PCM 176 . I have no clue why that is . Weird . More experimentation is needed to figure out what the cause is. - <p> Thanks for the input Ted ! I will try to find the cause and report back . Let me ask you one thing : does it surprise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files than hi res stored files ? I 'm going to repeat the comparison tomorrow just to verify my observations , btw . <p> Surprise me ? - Not really. - Would I have predicted it ? - Probably not. - I 'm not too surprised that there are differences : - Let 's assume that there are differences when using different players/renderers on the PC. - If so those differences have to be from jitter , RFI , groundloops , etc. - Jitter is n't a big problem in the DS , but having optical connections will lessen RFI from the cable itself and should break groundloops ( or at least change them. ) - So your report amounts to saying that in your system the streamer produces more hash from the computer than playing the stored files. - I 'm not surprised at that , tho in someone elses system it might be different . <p> 2 ) Perhaps the software is converting to 352.8k but the bridge can only do 176.4k so there 's crap as 1/2 the data gets thrown away somewhere . <p> Tho I do n't  have your setup Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As you say explicitly converting DSD128 to DSD64 or to 24/176.4 is the best solution ( I 'd recommend 24/176k , all other things being equal , to avoid extra steps along the way. ) - - <p> I found the problem ! As it turns out , Roon wasnt- downconverting to 24/176.4 , after all . It was downconverting to 32/176.4 ! I had totally missed on the signal chain page that it was floating from 64 to 32 bit . I Simply went into the device setup and under " Playback " there is a setting called " Max Bits Per Sample ( PCM ) " . I selected that and it now downconverts DSD 128 to 24/176.4 without issue . It sounds great too ! Maybe there 's a bug in the negotiation between Roon and the DS DAC ? Is this a DAC or a Roon issue , I wonder ? -

Click the " test " button to the right of the pulldown .

USB problems can be a bear to chase down . You are on the right track . It sounds like a signaling issue to me . I am not a big Windows user but someone should be able to point you to the system logs where you will see if log-able USB signal issues are happening . For the moment do n't  worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cable rated to be compliant with the USB signaling standard . The bar is n't very high . An Amazon Basics cable will do . Get a short one ( &lt; 1m ) and definitely try it in the computers main USB ports . The problem could be as simple as a dirty contact or poorly shielded cable . Long cables are much more susceptible to having signal loss issues . <p> Thanks Andrew , I will try to test with a direct connection to the laptop later todayI had guests last night , and was n't able to continue my testing. - I will try a short new cable also , as the one I am using is quite a few years old , and may be the culprit. - Songs played just fine this morning for about 50 minutes , and then the sound cut out. - Player is currently still playing , but not sending sound via the USBno error displayed. - Normal computer sounds outside of the player are still working on the computer speakers. - It is definitely something with this USB connection , and hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the system logs , after I try the direct connection and a new cablethanks for the suggestion ! <p> I am glad to update this thread to say that I now have everything working properly via the USB connection. - <p> I tried a new USB 2.0 DAC cable , plugged into the same port on my display monitor , and it did n't  work. - In fact , the failure/cutout occurred even faster with the new cable : less than one minute into the music , each time. - <p> I then switched USB cables so that my mouse is routed through the monitor , and the Sprout gets the sole remaining empty USB that is a direct connection into my laptop. - It was n't initially recognizing the Sprout in the new port , so I uninstalled the driver and the USB 1.6.1 software from PSAudio vis the control panel , and reinstalled clean in the new port. - Everything has been working fine ever since , through the same Pono Music World 20 player ( by JRiver ) . - I have played for several hours with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think this solved it. - Not entirely sure if it was the direct connection or simply the uninstall/reinstall , but I am happy that it works cleanly now. - Thanks for all the suggestions ! <p> Andrew you are going to love it , this thing is incredible ! - I am waiting for a second Sprout I bought at retail price ( ouch ! ) in the Dec 1 batch , hoping it arrives in time for a Christmas gift . <p> Also , and this may be obvious to everyone , but I will mention it again just in case it helps somebody later : I intentionally did not set Sprout as my default speaker device. - Instead , I selected Sprout as the output device from within the JRiver player only. - This means that sounds from any other programs when I am working ( such as email dings , etc. ) come out of the computer speakers , and do n't  interrupt or overlay my music. - A loud program error " ding " can be really disturbing coming through your speakers when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the capability to select a specific sound device for output , but I may have an older version of iTunes , or just did n't  look hard enough . <p> Unfortunately there is no way to switch between the Sprouts digital inputs . If USB and coax are both used , I believe USB takes priority . I do n't  know what happens if both are connected but one is turned off ( i.e. , whether it still senses the connection ) . A switch would have been nice ( just an extra position on the selector switch , at least externally ) . <p> It would appear that Sprout prioritizes USB based upon the presence of voltage . My Mac Laptop will hold the digital input even when shutdown as there is a small amount of +5V current that Apple provides ( for some reason ) . 
@@23909267 @3909267/ <h> Bass and treble <p> When I was growing up every amplifier or preamplifier was adorned with tone controls : bass and treble boost/cut filters . Today , there- are- few to be found . <p> I think the main reason they existed- was to compensate for the poor frequency response of the loudspeakers . As speakers and electronics got better , the need to preload " pre-distort " the music signal- went away . And that was a good thing . <p> Building loudspeakers with greater full range capabilities is infinitely preferable to tone controls that attempt to Band Aid the problem . <p> But , that 's not all tone controls did . They helped poor recordings become more listenable and attempted to make up for an interesting problem in our hearing . First brought to public notice by Harvey Fletcher and Wilden Munson in 1933 , the Fletcher-Munson curves taught us that frequency extremes naturally rolled off with level . Essentially , when sound is at low volume levels , the ear/brain tends to pay less notice to bass and treble . To hear music with flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Preamplifiers with tone controls often progressively boosted the bass and treble as the level control was turned down . Some manufacturers allowed this compensation to be selectable and added a defeat button labeled " loudness " . Remember that button ? When Loudness was engaged , the music was progressively pre-distorted with boosted bass and treble to compensate for low volume levels . Today , you do n't  see these controls very often . <p> None of these tone controls come without negative baggage . <p> As I have written many times , in electronic design there 's no free lunch . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 33 COMMENTS <p> Could it be that basically there is a wrong assumption in the Fletcgpher-Munson findings , Paul ! Music typically is not ( ! ) a sequence of pure sine waves but characterized by transients . And : Is the finding from sine-wave perception via headphone applicable to loudspeakers ? And finally : each instrument has its characteistic overtones . It seems impossible to maintain the amplitude relations of a series of overtone intact when not adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency ranges ( bass and treble ) ? ? ? ? ? <p> I have had quite a few amplifiers over my 70 years and the ones that I had the most satisfaction from all had tone controls . I now will not purchase an amp , or preamp , without tone controls even though I am aware that they may " distort " the sound . I have listened many times to amps with the tone controls in and out of circuit and have never felt that I was losing anything by having them in circuit . I still have a 20 something year old Pioneer A401 Integrated , with tone controls , and set them flat and then switched them in and then out of circuit and actually preferred the sound with them in circuit ( note : I did n't  say better , but I preferred them in circuit ) . The tone controls on this amp were , I think , called active tone controls in that you set them for the most desirable sound at moderate listening levels and when the volume is cranked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point was reached were they were no longer active ( never reached that volume level though which is probably why my hearing is still good and still able to just pick up a 16khz sine wave ) . One other benefit I found was being able to increase the bass slightly more when listening to headphones . In case anyone is wondering I have had a few Pioneer Amps , Sony , three Sugdens , Two Naim amps and preamps , a Musical Fidelity Integrated , a Unison Research S6 valve Integrated , and a Parasound Halo preamp with a pair of Xindak monoblocks and several Nad integrateds ( one being the 3020 amp ) . I am currently running a Parasound Halo integrated and in my home , in my room and with my electricity supply this amp sounds great and is giving me more satisfaction than any previous amp I have owned and it has tone controls . There are probably a few people who think that I am deluded ( poor old fart ) publicly stating that I love good tone controls but I do n't  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else and I would not be judgemental on others who do n't  like tone controls .. that is their choice and everyones choice is valid in their own system let 's rejoice in individuality . <p> I 'm in the same camp . After lots of looking and listening while shopping for an amp last year , I went with an integrated ( a Luxman 507uX ) . Bass , treble , and loudness . And a rumble filter ( you should see the woofers move when I play vinyl without that switch on ! ) , and a mono switch . <p> The nice thing about this and most modern amps with tone controls is that all of that can be completely switched out of the circuit if they are not needed . Its the best of both worlds ! The amp sounds wonderful however I set it so I 'm very happy . <p> I do n't  need those controls often , but when I do , I usually need them badly and I 'm glad they 're just a pushbutton away . <p> Paul said : But , that 's not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listenable <p> So what is wrong with making something more listenable . <p> In my college days , when tone controls were the norm , I rarely used them , except for an occasional recording that was a little dull or bright , or if I wanted a little more bass . I appreciated a defeat switch so that you could take them out of the circuit . My favorite was my NAD 1300 preamp that had three selectable frequencies for where the bass and treble controls would kick in . I always used the settings at the extremes to have the least affect on the midrange . <p> When I worked at Radio Shack , it amazed me how many customers would crank the bass and treble controls up all the way when listening to the stereo equipment . <p> Yup . That 's pretty much the comment I logged in to post . One difference , I worked at a Lafayette associate store . <p> Tone controls were ( and for me still are ) a way to deal with unfortunate choices made in recording studios , live venues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate in terms of my enjoyment of the music not that they are demonstrably wrong headed ( wrong eared ? ) . <p> I miss them on the Sprout , which after a year or so of waiting finally has been put into service in the " new " northeast home , but not seriously so . By the way , the scare quotes are because the house was built around 1867 and renovation/restoration has been the order for a while . <p> I 'm pleased to have defeatable bass and treble on the well aged AVA Transcendance preamp in my southwest digs . That 's where my remaining LPs , 78s , and the bulk of my CDs reside . <p> Yeah I 've often thought that a lot of purchases of ancillary gear and maybe even primary gear flows from , in effect , creating " tone controls " ( in-line equalizers ) for the amp . You could start a retro revolution in the industry Paul ! Maybe just start with a Sprout with tone controls : ) <p> A little diversity in this direction could be a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of High End because the gear does NOT have tone controls like it did in " the Good Old Days . " It would be interesting to hot-rod an old integrated with tone controls and mate it with modern speakers and a front end and present it at an audio show . Unfortunately , the room rent at shows is a bit pricey for such privateering , but heywhat price , fun ? <p> Theoretically I agree with the content of todays post . But .. were not living in a perfect audio world . No speaker has a flat frequency response . So what 's wrong with bass and treble tone controls and loudness controls to make recordings become more listenable ? That said , I do n't  have those tone controls and do n't  want them . I 'd rather have a top-notch equalizer . But I understand why some people like these controls . Even if they add a little distortion ( which most people do n't  hear anyway ) . <p> Tone controls seem to me like using a sledgehammer to drive a small nail . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put an equalizer in your signal path and fine tune the response to your liking ? Personally , I have never had a use for tone controls and would n't buy a high end piece of kit that had them . <p> I have a McIntosh MA6900 integrated with a built-in 5 band equalizer and loudness button . They have sophisticated light switches that take them completely out of the signal path when disengaged and 99% of the time I leave them inactive I lose a small amount of clarity . BUT , when a poor or old recording requires it , I 'm very glad to make the adjustment . Studio engineers EQ every track and live engineers EQ every track , sometimes making adjustments moment to moment for both the music , the room and even for the crowd . Certainly its a choice , but not having it is like saying " I never add salt , only the chef is allowed . " <p> Taken to an extreme , some room correction solutions actively EQ as the volume is changed with the goal of a full low even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but its an interesting concept . <p> Interesting article Paul . One major point that Paul makes is ; I think the main reason they existed was to compensate for the poor frequency response of the loudspeakers . As speakers and electronics got better , the need to preload " pre-distort " the music signal went away . And that was a good thing . <p> Personally I believe in amplifying the sound signal as purely as possible without coloring the sound signal . The people I know who like their pre-amps with RCS say that it is all done in the digital domain and the analogue signal is purely amplified from there . The resulting readout on the SPL is a flat signal , therefor it is not the same and makes up for the short comings of the room . Thus the wife acceptance factor is better since the room does n't  need to be tuned . <p> As someone who has been in this hobby since the 60s I have a slightly different perspective . <p> First of all , I do n't  remember any amplifiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivers yes , but not basic amplifiers . <p> Second , I remember preamps being introduced without tone controls while their manufacturers touted a more direct signal path less distortion with the elimination of those extra pots and wires . To what degree that was true might be questioned but the idea took off and more and more manufacturers introduced new models without tone controls . Along the way filter switches , loudness controls , mono selectors , and even balance controls ( less common ) disappeared . <p> Whoever created the " straight wire with gain " motto really started something . That may have been intended for amplifiers originally but the idea of minimizing functions in a system became widespread . <p> When we talk about amplifiers with tone controls what is meant is integrated amps just get a little lazy sometimes when typing . The " straight wire with gain " motto was , I believe , first mentioned by the late Peter Walker ( hope I have the name right ) , founder of Quad Products . <p> Wayne , maybe I 'm too anal about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think of a basic power amp , not an integrated . If I intend amplifier in combination with preamplifier/line stage then I say integrated . <p> I believe you may be nearly as old as I am so we both lived in the era when separate components were the norm . That developed into integrated amps and receivers which became more popular , saving space and often money . Still later , with the emergence of digital sources , phono stages were no longer needed by many hobbyists so that line amplifiers began to replace preamplifiers . <p> I find it interesting that in recent years separate components have made something of a comeback in the marketplace . <p> I really do n't  know how many younger folks in this hobby still make these identifications but they are ingrained for me . <p> I like the idea of tone controls with selectable hinge pointssorry I never ran across that . <p> Loudness compensation seems a useful correctionbut virtually all loudness controls do it wrong . Even in the concert hall , we perceive less bass at low volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Controls should be used to compensate for the difference between the volume of the musical event and the volume we are listening at . That means the degree of loudness compensation should vary according to that difference . Virtually every loudness control today has a fixed ratio of compensation to volume-control position , regardless of the sources recording level and the gain or loss elsewhere in the chain . Back in the 50s and 60s ( and maybe sinceI forget ) there were amps with separate " volume " and " loudness " knobs ( see the Pilot amp at http : **28;606;TOOLONG ? p=1631 ) . You set volume to your normal listening level , adjusted loudness ( I do n't  recall a calibration systemI think you just set it where it " sounded right " ) , and left the loudness knob alone thereafter unless playing a recording cut at an extremely high or extremely low level . <p> But having two knobs whose names seemed to mean the same thing confused people , which may be one reason why this system went away . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I designing the control panel for such an amp , I 'd label the second knob " Loudness Compensation , " make its knob much smaller , and maybe make its action stiffer . <p> As I think about this issue I feel more uncomfortable with the term pre-distortion . Shaping the EQ is n't distortion : the waveform and the harmonics should remain , just the levels are changed . Distortion to me means irregular waveform or additional signal that was n't there before . Guitar pedals pre-distort intentionally , but shaping EQ ( through tone controls or voicing by engineers ) need not add distortion . Paul , do you agree with that refinement in terminology ? <p> No call me a purist , but no . Distortion is anything less that original , perfect . EQ clearly distorts the signal perhaps not in the classic sense of distortion with added harmonics or IM , but distortion none the less . <p> Isnt it most revealing that I always have to bypass the equalizers of the car stereo system of a rental car ? Obviously the majority of the previous drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening room that is more pre-distorted than the cabin of a car . : - ) <p> Hellwhen you come right down to it the job of a volume control is to make changes in something that had an original perfect loudness when it came off the piano , out of the horn , from the bowed strings , the vocal cords , or whatever . <p> A volume control introduces more or less of an original . It distorts . We could n't live without it . <p> Yes , and our emotional reaction to the music varies with loudness . We also sense when an instrument is too loud or too soft for the space in which it is recorded . To some extent the volume equates to distance from the source of the music , but way too soft or way too loud becomes unreal . <p> call me a philistine your opinion on using equalizers in splitting hairs for me . I think there are very few records where an equalizer is not used during the recording session . Why should it be less meaningful to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls can introduce considerable phase distortion and really muck up that delightful " realish " sound that were after . That 's assuming it was somewhat preserved in the original recording , though . These days DSP can deliver phase linear response but then that opens another can of worms . <p> Yes , tone controls are a handy thing to have . However , they do increase distortion and can blow drivers if used indiscriminately ( I learned the hard way when I was a youngster ) . many years back I had a chance to play with the Manley equalizer.now that was a fun piece to play with and can be indispensable if you listen to a lot of old old recordings . <p> As auioib mentioned , the loudness compensation has to be relative to the absolute sound level , which means it varies with the recording ( which generally are all close to maximum modulation regardless of original music volume ) and the gain of the preamp , amp , speakers and room . I had a Mac C11 with " sensitivity controls " hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad compromise . <p> The loudness curves come from the inherent rolloffs of the hearing mechanism at roughly 400Hz and 4KHz . That 's right , our ears are tuned to the old analog telephone bandwidth . The top two octaves and the bottom two to three are below the hearing threshold because of limited frequency response of our inner ears ! <p> Paul , in your amp and preamp designs you can aim for perfectly flat frequency response , but a speaker designer adds or subtracts level in the various frequency ranges with crossover filters and zobel networks , so is that not also pre-distortion then ? He is tuning or equalizing the system to his idea of the sound that he wants . It is rare to find speaker specs better than plus or minus 2 dB which means that at any given frequency there can be a 4 dB variation , which is huge . If one speaker had an upward slope from -2 dB at the low end to +2 dB at the high end , and another speaker had the reverse , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The problem with most bass and treble controls was that they impacted the mid range more than necessary . I loved the old a/d/s C4 preamp and R4 receiver designs which , in addition to regular bass and treble controls which could be defeated , they also had low bass control which only affected frequencies below about 50Hz an area in which most speakers needed some help and our ears definitely need help . Variable loudness control existed on a number of integrated amps but the main problem with them was that people did n't  know how to set them correctly , same as with consumer grade graphic equalizers most of those ended up being set in a V shape and ended up doing pretty much exactly what bass and treble controls could do . <p> The most recent equal loudness curve is the ISO 226:2003 and it shows that even at a listening level of 100dB the low frequencies sound less loud that the mid range . At a more reasonable listening level of 80 dB perceived loudness at 40 Hz requires 25dB more level to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert hall the ear behaves in a similar manner , when listening to rock or pop music that is not the case to the same extent as the dynamic range of the music is usually limited to 6 dB or less , and the same is true at a live event of that type of music . Live events sound system operators generally overcompensate by cranking up the highs and lows to the point that the midrange is masked to the extent that one can not understand lyrics or hear instruments other than bass , drums and guitars . I attended a Trombone Shorty concert where he was blowing his guts out 3 ? from the mic and I could not hear that there was a trombone playing ! <p> The term pre-distortion should be replaced with some other term because it a negative connotation as far as tone controls are concerned . Altered respons.e would be better . For example the distortions of the digital process can be described as pre-distortion . As far as tone controls are concerned they improve the sound in the case of poor recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned , if a speaker is frequency limited , tone controls will not help because the speaker is incapable of producing frequencies beyond its limitations . So speakers with limited frequency response could not have been the reason for tone controls.The Fletcher-Munson curves were another reason for tone controls and for good reason . There was a strong objection from a purist reviewer who got the ball rolling against the tone controls and it became a fashion for lesser reviewers to follow suit . After all they were reviewing top class recordings and equipment played at high volumes so tone controls and the Fletcher-Munson curve did not matter . For the manufacturers it was another way to save money and still be complimented . After all they were doing the trendy thing , saving money at the same time and avoiding the complexities associated with really good tone control design . Truth be told tone controls still serve a very good purpose and can be switched out of the circuit if so desired . As for a handful of parts causing distortion , as the purists claim , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . Regards . <p> I think the term distortion is somewhat inappropriate for the context in which we are using it . Distortion has a negative context , we spend considerable time and effort to reduce " distortion " in our amps , cables , speakers etc . Equalization I think is a better and a more accurate term for what we are talking about . Yes , tone controls can introduce true distortion products , but good ones rarely do . After all , the pure sound you are talking about paul is supposed to be the sound that reaches your ears , not what comes out of the transducer . To have pure sound come out of a speaker , to then be severely altered by various effects of the room , will be far from " pure " where it counts , at your ears . To pre-equalize the signal , so that the sound at your ears is the same as that at the source ( Yes , it will almost always be somewhat different in some fashion ) , is not , IMHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a case , someone would call the " pure " sound distorted , and the pre-equalized sound , pure . I think we want to be careful that our nomenclature does n't  lead us down a path to a worse end result rather than a better . 
@@23909268 @3909268/ <p> I- did an experiment the other day and connected my NPC to the DS Sr through the I2S input with generic HDMI cable .

PCM. - PS Audios support and affinity for DSD should be reasonably obvious , as our DirectStream product is nothin BUT DSD . <p> I hope we can engage in a spirited knowledge filled discussion on this forum . - Thanks. - <p> Great topic . As I think most here who have heard a good analog system know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing our music . I look forward to hearing this sound reproduction . Quality from the direct stream . <p> DSD is roughly equivalent to 88/20-bit PCM , so both are high resolution . Both provide excellent sound . <p> The disadvantage to DSD ( Sonys name for PDM pulse density modulation ) is that it can not be edited and , thus , must be converted to PCM for editing . Thus , it is very rare to obtain a " pure " DSD recording that has not spent a good share of its life as PCM . ( Query : if it is turned into PCM at some point , has any benefit of being DSD at one time been permanently lost ? ) <p> ( As an aside , converting a DSD/PDM stream to PCM and back again is a lossy process . We like to think it is just math , but it is not : PDM data has no direct equivalent to PCM data . Thus , the conversion requires interpolation . The inaccuracies are tiny , but present . ) <p> On to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PDM , whether it is PCM or PDM/DSD in the consumers possession as a stored music file . Weird , huh ? <p> PCM ADCs work by first converting analog into PDM , as a single bit data stream . This signal than passes through a decimation filter ( love this term ) to turn the signal into multi-bit PCM . <p> At the other end , PCM is transcoded into PDM prior to decoding . In both cases , this is because it is a lot easier to build a quality PDM DAC or ADC . As a result , almost all are PDM based . ( There are a few exceptions . ) <p> One would think this would give the advantage to PDM/DSD as long as it is recorded , never edited , and then played on a PDM DAC . Not only are such recordings rare , modern PDM/DSD ADCs and DACs are almost always multi-bit not pure 1-bit PDM . As a result , any theoretical difference/advantage of PDM is at least partially lost as the pure PCM/DSD signal will be decimated to 4-bit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like PCM as PDM is played back. - ( Kudos to the DS for avoiding multi-bit decimation ) . <p> In addition to being impossible to edit , PDM also contains the disadvantage of carrying a lot of noise on the signal . The noise begins at roughly 30kHz and rapidly increases so that by 40kHz the noise is louder than any high frequency signal that may be present in the original sound . The low pass filters necessarily applied to the signal begin significantly filtering out the signal at roughly 35kHz . Does this matter ? I do not know . Does it matter if a PCM file is 96/24 and thus able to produce up to a 48kHz waveform ? <p> Both high resolution PCM and PDM allow for gentle reconstruction/low pass filters . PCM employs them to avoid aliasing artifacts to reach the playback system ; DSD/PDM to keep high frequency noise from doing the same . This strikes me as a draw . <p> While there is some truth that 1-bit PDM/DSD is more analog like in its digital representation of the signal , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were 1 bit , a lot more processing takes place even in 1-bit playback than PDM/DSD aficionados like to admit. - ( The DS appears to avoid this . ) <p> Bottom line : <p> The advantage of PDM/DSD is that , in its purist form with true 1-bit ADCs and DACs , it is a less processed signal . Such equipment does not exist in the current world of audio recording and playback ( or is incredibly rare ) . The big disadvantage to PDM is that it must be turned into PCM to be edited in any way , making it very hard to work with . It can only be transcoded to PCM or FLAC ( etc. ) process . <p> PCM has both a wider bandwidth and greater S/N . It is easy to edit for both the recording engineer and the consumer , and it can readily be transcoded to other formats ( FLAC , MP3 , etc . ) <p> A huge advantage for purveyors of PDM/DSD/SACD : it is easy to encode an acoustically transparent anti-piracy code in the data stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . - But my ears tell me dsd sounds like analog , now this may make no sense to some .

But the one released from last year no 3 dsd 128 is amazing . - <p> alrainbow said - Dsd is a marvel to hear there is no doubt it just sounds easier to listen too . <p> Subjective impressions are always interesting . <p> I do not find either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other. - For me , the of sound depends primarily on the quality of the recording , and then on the particular playback equipment. - I have heard both dreadful and excellent examples of both DSD/SACD and PCM . <p> There are a lot of good papers on DSD theory in the AES Library for those that are n't  members of the AES and do n't  want to pay for a paper that may or may not be " worth reading " I 've found one " illegal " copy of one of the good papers : Derk Reefmans " Why Direct Stream Digital ( DSD ) is the Best Choice as a Digital Audio Format " : http : **25;636;TOOLONG .. es/dsd.pdf <p> Anyway many of the " problems " or statements by Elk are not true for all DSD , they are arguably true for single rate DSD this is like condemning PCM for the faults of Redbook . <p> One should remember that you cant get excellent quality results by editing Redbook in 16/44.1 you need to use at least wider samples for any sample by sample processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for any processing where contiguous samples interact ( e.g. filtering ) . <p> Double rate DSD allows amelioration of many of the issues cited. - For example the DSD noise hump in the DS does n't  go to the -40dB that Elk states , it stays less than -80dB or -90dB. - Also the hump does n't  peak around 30-50kHz in the DS- it does n't  grow above -120dB until approx. 60kHz. - This leaves the effective bandwidth well over that of 88.2kHz PCM- ( closer to that of 176.4 or 192kHz ) <p> Its not that you loose all of the " DSD goodness " when you go to PCM its that low rate PCM does n't  cut it. - Keeping the rate at double rate DSD or above allows any math or filtering you want. - When you are " done " you " dither " back to one bit. - I put dither in quotes because that 's what you 'd do in PCM dither back to the archive sample width. - The equivalent in noise shaped single bit based processing is to requantize ( run it thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archiving. - With double rate DSD or higher this causes less damage to the signal over the audio band than converting a PCM signal back to 24 bits ( dithering or not ) . - Yes , the noise grows ( as it does with dithering or truncating the width in PCM ) but the number of operations required to get- an audible change- is huge. - Similarly as I mentioned the noise hump can be as low as -80dB FS for that to grow to significance also takes a huge number of operations . <p> Another approach to doing DSD processing is to do your processing in the analog domain and then convert back to double rate DSD quite a while ago I remember being surprised that some of the CDs I liked best had a DAD SPARS code ( digital recording , analog mixing , digital delivery. ) - Going from double rate DSD to analog and then back to double rate DSD can be a very transparent process arguably more transparent than any process that includes going to lower rate PCM ( e.g. 384kHz PCM ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say instead that we just do n't  have any good mathematical models for DSD. - The tractable models ( linearizing the process with assumed random dither ) somewhat work but do n't  describe the more troublesome behaviors of sigma delta modulation well . <p> As it turns out , most of the introductions to sigma delta you might see online are first order modulators one delay , or a first order loop filter , or one integrator , etc. - A first order modulator is at least stable kick it in the head and it will eventually settle down. - As soon as you get to more practical sigma delta modulators they are n't  unconditionally stable ( SACDs typically use fifth order modulators ) . - The most practical thing to do when designing a high order modulator is to run gobs of simulations try " all " of the expected inputs. - You should of course also do the best job you can analyzing the linearized model of the modulator as well , but neither simulations nor mathematical modeling ( with current models ) - prove stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modulation. - What does this mean ? - Well if the output of the modulator were all 1s or all 0s you 'd be at 100% modulation and at one " power rail " or the other. - 50% modulation means that your " full scale output " is at 50% of the power rails. - The good effects of this are that its reasonably easy to build a modulator that 's stable up to , say , 75% or 80% modulation so if full scale is at 50% we have 3 or 4dB of headroom. - I.e. " soft clipping " if the input temporarily spikes up to about 3 or 4dB over the full scale input the modulator is still stable it wont start chirping , oscillating , etc . <p> Obviously throwing away 1/2 of your available voltage range is n't something chip makers want to do. - So they take heroic efforts to get the unconditionally stable modulation level up to , say , 90 or 95%. - This let 's them get about 5 or 6dB more S/N ratio and a higher output level both of which are desirable. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much headroom for musical peaks. - Since were all used to CDs ( and PCM in general ) having no headroom , this is n't totally evil. - Having a high modulation level in a modulator which only has PCM inputs a good trade off since you know PCMs maximum levels anyway . <p> I both do n't  want to alarm people and- I do n't  want to sweep under the rug some of DSDs problems . <p> As I mentioned recently to Paul , just because something is impossible , it does n't  mean it does n't  work - Parts of DSD are impossible in the sense that we cant describe them clearly or analyze them with our current models. - But that 's true for many processes in nature that are chaotic. - Just because we cant predict the future does n't  mean its not going to happen. - Just because we cant predict the- rest of the bits in- the output of a sigma delta modulator does n't  mean we wont like the sound when we low pass filter them. - We have an existence proof that DSD can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . <p> alrainbow said BUT can we measure why it sounds better than pcm ? and do you agree it sounds more like analog . the relaxed sound I am speaking of ? <p> al <p> Wed have to have a model of the differences that the ear/brain is sensitive to to measure them. - Comparing two PCM formats is relatively easy only sample width , sample rate , and channel count/arrangement can matter. - Even then do we infer that 192kHz sounds better than 96kHz ? - Or that stereo- sounds better- or worse than MC ? <p> Ted Smith said Anyway many of the " problems " or statements by Elk are not true for all DSD , they are arguably true for single rate DSD this is like condemning PCM for the faults of Redbook . <p> Double rate DSD allows amelioration of many of the issues cited. - For example the DSD noise hump in the DS does n't  go to the -40dB that Elk states , it stays less than -80dB or -90dB. - Also the hump does n't  peak around 30-50kHz in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - This leaves the effective bandwidth well over that of 88.2kHz PCM- ( closer to that of 176.4 or 192kHz ) <p> Its not that you loose all of the " DSD goodness " when you go to PCM its that low rate PCM does n't  cut it. - <p> All good points. - I hope all realize I am merely raising issues for discussion and not advocating one format over the other. - I am agnostic on this point . <p> Single rate DSD has greater limitations , just like like 44/16 PCM. - SACDs are single rate and most DSD files are single rate and sourced from single rate ( or PCM for that matter ) . - Thus the issues raised . <p> I agree DSD is not necessarily " damaged " when it is transcoded to PCM ( I love the phrase " DSD goodness " ) , but many DSD proponents claim DSD is somehow superior in all respects. - Theirs is an argument of faith that somehow DSD is pure ; PCM , polluted. - I find this argument specious as almost all DSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as PCM. - Additionally , almost all DACs decode all digital streams they receive as four to six bit DSD. - That is , we are typically listening to something which is neither PCM or DSD , but sort of a hybrid . <p> For me the vastly more interesting question- and one which I have raised on this forum long before the DS was announced is whether there is something special or " better " when decoding single bit DSD to analog v. decoding PCM. - If there is magic , I argued , this is where it should reveal itself. - <p> I wish I could claim prescience with respect to the DS entry as a partial answer to this question . <p> But neither one of you has answered the question does dsd 128 sound better or more natural to your ears . I have found that if I take a good dsd 128 and convert to 24/192 it looses something . So my understanding would lead me to think there is something to dsd being better in some ways .

All of this is subjective anyway . - <p> Al- <p> One way to compare DSD64 and DSD128 is to visit the DSD File downloads site operated by Opus 3 Records. - There you can download DSD64 and DSD128 versions of the same recordings and the same converter ( Korg ) and compare. - The Yamina EP is very reasonably priced so that could be a starting point . <p> As to whether recordings made with a pro Analog to Digital Converter ( ADC ) at DSD64 like the Grimm sound better than ones on another pro ADC , say the Mytek or Meitner at DSD128 , well that 's a different question and one with fewer easy comparisons . <p> I did this comparison when I downloaded a dsd 64 by accident . And thence dsd 128 . Regarding opus 3 I have a bunch of there stuff . I also own the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for my statement . I also own the mytek and a msb stack . I did several post regarding this topic on computoraudiophile . I got bashed by someone there in the industry for pointing out dsd 128 being better . As they did not argue if better but said its . Bad buisness model . The website claim need to use master analog tapes to make there dsd 64 downloads . My argument was why not dsd 128 as its better . It seems to me the more our audio reproduction gets the more I realize the music is the weak link . I have a dsd of Elvis essetional stereo 57 . It is a fantastic Elvis album . Now I heard the analog and that recording was a tad better than my dsd. - So my thinking is dsd 128 would of put it on par . The new opus3 no 3 dsd is fantastic too but if you convert in jriver on the fly or audiogate or download the dsd 64 and compare to 128 the shine is less . That easy relaxed sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PCM 24/192 and it looses more . Now I am not pro reviewer and do not want to make points that no one cares about . But most pros have to know this better thN I do . But do not talk about it . I do not want to start a rant but what gets done to us as we buy our music not once but three or four times is just not cool . I own a few hundred sacd , s and I have ripped them all for me . Guess hiw many really sound like a dsd 64 . Not many . So my guessing is a 1950 to 1960 year old analog master can sound that good in dsd 128 why done we have many more of them . Another fact is this did you know reel to reel is better than some vinyl or overall is just better . And it is pure analog second or third generation . How can this be . My reasoning is we never get to hear the analog master dsd conversion on almost anything we buy digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a small format that it will be years for us to have our dsd 128 or even dsd 64 . Didnyounwatch the video and see the part they say no analog masters were used . The whole thing just stinks- <p> The differences between DSD64 and DSD128 also depend on the DAC. - Any given DAC may do one better than the other. - Theres no technical reason that DSD64 should be better than DSD128 but people have argued forever things like is 24/192k really better than 24/96. - Once again ( among other things ) it depends on the DAC . <p> Coming from you I will shut up a listen , but what part of system resolution do you think plays into this . As some dacs may be - better than another and having only a few dsd capible dacs to play woth I would take your experience way above mine and must correct .

She was there for the duration , your personal physician and guard . I had faked sick about two weeks earlier , so Mom had her suspicions . Luckily after puking on her slippers I was good to go . Even I could n't fake that shit . <p> In those days until 6AM there was nothing on the tube but a test pattern that featured a weird Indian head and some cryptic numbers and arrows that we now know were messages from the Masons . Then there were stale news updates , droning weather guys , a sports dude with a bad toup , and unwatchable soaps .

On this particular day , a miracle was broadcast named Orchestra Wives . <p> In 1942 20th Century Fox released Orchestra Wives starring the actual Glenn Miller Band as part of the usual let 's get the kids into the theatres ' pap crap . You know . Like A- Hard Days Night and Purple Rain . I had been turned onto Miller the year before but that album was the soundtrack for The Glenn Miller Story , and as great as that film was it was still Henry Mancini conducting the NBC orchestra .

A family doctor ( may God bless you sir ) recommended Chick take up the drums to loosen up his bones ' . Hey . Beats leeches and bleeding . Chick would never get taller than 5 feet and was hampered by this spinal crud his whole life . But man , those drums . <p> Chick was 17 when he moved to NY City and by 21 had his own band .

Goodman was more of a classically trained musician , but one of my favorite examples of a guy who chucked the symphony for what made him smile . You can watch videos of him playing , and see that smile around the reed . I know guys that could play clarinet and swear on a box of Twinkies you ca n't grin like that and play those gorgeous runs .

Billed as kind of a publicity stunt , the show was titled The Birth of the Blues with the Goodman orchestra .

@@23909285 @3909285/ <h> How Do CD Players Work ? <p> Most of us- understand what a CD player is ; a box we insert CDs and play them . <p> But , what 's going on inside ? How do they work ? What are the basic elements of a CD player and why do Audiophiles not use them very often , preferring instead CD transports and DACs ? <h> Back to the beginning <p> On October 1 , 1982 , Sony placed the first nail in the LPs coffin with its release of the world 's first commercial compact disc player , the CDP-101 , in Japan . The launch signaled a new audio medium that promised to deliver a crystal-clear music experience for a generation of consumers accustomed to vinyl records . <p> It was touted as " PerfectSound Forever " . It was anything but perfect . <p> The CDP-101 retailed for about $674 ( roughly $1609 in todays dollars ) , and was launched alongside a group of 50 classical and pop CDs published by CBS Records . Names like Mozart , Tchaikovsky , and Schubert shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pink Floyd , and Journey . Each disc cost $14 apiece ( about $33 in todays dollars ) . <h> From vinyl to optical <p> It was Sony and Philips that together invented the CD player , though they had n't  come up with the technology itself . Instead , American engineer- James T. Russell invented the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil . He applied for a patent in 1966 , and it was granted in 1970 . Sony and Philips hijacked the technology , at first for laser discs , later for the audio CD , but Russell ( and the company he had sold the patent to ) took them to court and won , forcing them to license his invention . <h> That first player <p> So , what was inside that first player ? The same three basic elements found in every CD and DVD player today : a turntable , an optical reader , and a DAC . <p> Let 's first take a look at the turntable and optical reader . <p> The turntable is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CD itself . Speeds are quite a bit faster than an album , averaging 600 rpm as opposed to 33 1/3 rpm for vinyl . When you place a CD atop the turntable , the label faces you , the optical surface with all the bits faces down . <p> Below the CD optical disc waits a laser mounted to a moving sled or carriage . The carriage can move back and forth along the CD as it spins . In close proximity to the laser beam is a photo receptor that converts the reflected laser light into an electric current . <p> Once converted to electrical signals , the ones and zeros we 're so familiar with are sent to the CD player 's internal DAC . <h> The DAC inside <p> DAC stands for Digital To Audio Converter . As its name implies , this circuitry takes the ones and zeros we call digital audio , and converts their message into audio " sound we can then use to play through speakers or headphones . <p> The bits of digital audio form a type of machine language with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio , words represent numbers , and each number represents a higher or lower part of the music 's loudness . <p> The maximum number of bits within a word determine the number of possible words . CD words have 16 bits , which means CD systems are limited to 65,536- words ( compared to 16,777,216- possible words in a 24 bit system ) . Within those restrictions , digital words form louder and softer levels that the DAC turns into sound . <h> The difference between a CD player and transport <p> Most Audiophiles no longer use CD players , preferring instead to separate the duties of the CD player into two separate pieces of equipment , the Transport and DAC . <p> An aftermarket transport contains the turntable , laser mechanism , photo receptor , and associated electronics to convert what is on the CD to electrical ones and zeros . <p> One of the more interesting aspects of the optical extraction process is the format the ones and zeros are prepared in , called I2S . <p> I2S ( pronounced , " I squared S " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digital music data itself . Clocks are needed to keep all the bits coming at the proper time and organizes the order in which they appear . <p> Some transports output this I2S format , but most do not . Instead , the four separate digital audio clocks and data of I2S , are mixed together and output through a single RCA connector , optical cable , or XLR . This new format , which must later be untangled back into I2S inside the DAC , is known as S/PDIF , an acronym for Sony Philips Digital Interface . <h> Why CD players have fallen out of favor <p> The vast majority of high-end audio systems separate the duties of the all-in-one CD player into two units , the transport and DAC . Separating these necessary components in a digital audio system results in better sound , or at least that 's the theory . <p> There 's no reason whatsoever that separating CD players into two chassis is superior other than the fact it permits manufacturers to lavish more attention on each , as well as allows consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable all-in-one CD player might just have a comeback someday , if enough high-end manufacturers decide it 's something their customers want .

Currently , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my office , will it improve sound if I move the NAS to my music room , having NAS and DAC directly connected to a switcher as in Magisters case ? <p> Honestly , the best answer that I can give you is to give it a try to see if there is a difference . There are so many variables here that I do not understand , including the signal path , that it bears just experimenting to find out . We are used to thinking of signals in audio progressing in a linear fashion but that is not the case with digital transmission which is bidirectional , packeted , monitored and corrected along the way . Way above my pay grade but there may be others here who could provide more intelligent insight . <p> I also use audio quest vodka cable ( cable connected to DS DAC ) with good results . <p> To get all out from good quality Ethernet cables It is worth of trying - isolation of network connection from main switch to DAC e.g. With Optical media converters ( removing EMI and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have noticed if cable runs are long then by adding a switch just before dac makes better results . Good LPSs for media converter and switch also makes a difference IMO . <p> In my case NAS and Roon server are connected to main switch before optical isolation , so after optical isolation before DAC , there is only one switch and galvanic isolator . <p> I think you guys need to do some research on how Ethernet actually works and how it is implemented . <p> IMHO , there is no chance in hell that the wire- you use affects the audio quality of bits that are packetized and sent out through- a collision-based protocol into receivers that completely buffer and isolate the packets . <p> EldRick said I think you guys need to do some research on how Ethernet actually works and how it is implemented . <p> IMHO , there is no chance in hell that the wire- you use affects the audio quality of bits that are packetized and sent out through- a collision-based protocol into receivers that completely buffer and isolate the packets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. to control emissions of noise that may affect the rest of the system ) - Ground loops ? ( Via the power supplies if not necessarily the signal lines ? ) - Does changing the number of collisions affect the noise that the- Ethernet injects into the rest of the system ? - I can hear them- on an AM radio- I 'm not claiming that there 's an audible effect or that there is n't , just pointing out that your statement is a little condescending and overly simplistic in that you are n't  systematically ruling out some other fairly obvious and arguably plausible- mechanisms . <p> EldRick said IMHO , there is no chance in hell that the wire- you use affects the audio quality of bits that are packetized and sent out through- a collision-based protocol into receivers that completely buffer and isolate the packets . <p> I stand by what I heard when I upgraded my ethernet cables. - I can not explain it , but a ) I trust my ears and b ) I have been at this hobby long enough not to have pre-formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff sound bad cheap stuff sound good. - If the cables had not been an audible improvement , I would have been delighted to send them back and save the $$$ . <p> Like cabin , I found that adding a good LPS for the network switch and the NAS helped . <p> I use a Fiber FMC connected to a fiber switch and then a- $11.75 6ft Blue Jeans ethernet cable connected to the RJ45 source . The best and effective way to isolate the source from any noise in the network domain like NAS , PC , etc and lot cheaper than the audiophile cables ( though I fell into the trap and bought one earlier ) . <p> here 's the thing . The wire quality can not help make the bits better and many people find it hard to grasp how changing it can affect sound quality . I am among them . We know digital cables can make a difference , and that often has to do with timing , but in the packetized world there are no timing issues . <p> In the case where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plenty that do , all I can guess is it must have something to do with shielding or noise . Other than that , it would be one of those mysteries " things we hear but can not explain . <p> The following users say thank you to Paul McGowan for this useful post : <p> If you think Ethernet cables or wifi can affect the data , I 'd stop using internet banking NOW . I do my banking on my phone and I 'm still waiting for a rogue " 0 " to- be added to my account and my money is equally- precious as- my music , as without money I could not afford to go and listen to music . <p> Some manufacturers suggest wifi in preference to cables or vice versa . That just confuses the issue , which I do not see as an issue at all . <p> Over- the last couple of years I have eliminated all expensive cables and several expensive components without any detriment . Most of my cabling is balanced and comes from the pro store , as do my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated given how they are used . I wanted a CD digital source . I asked the largest- Japanese manufacturer of transports if there was any performance difference between their $40 transport and their audiophile $3,000 transport , to which the answer was basically " no " . <p> The only thing left that could be considered an expensive accessory is a PS Audio P3 power regenerator , which I acquired some years ago and did seem to give a cleaner sound , and has remained in place ever since . <p> This all somehow reminds me of the Buffalo Springfield lyric : except in reverse <p> " Nobodys right if everybodys wrong " <p> I am in something similar to Pauls position : I know enough people hear- something here to suggest that something is happening , and I have come to the conclusion that it probably relates to the sort of factors Ted describes . Much like improving the power supply on my Cisco switches ; those had a much bigger impact than expensive Ethernet cables that I also tried and returned ; I suspect my old ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do expect to hear a difference when I implement my incoming Mivera Audio Superstream with its dedicated switch and fibre connections . I anticipate that decoupling the Ethernet electrical path will make an audible difference in front of my MSB Select DAC which remains Roon-unready as compared to the LANRover . <p> I am a network guy , and when it comes to data over IP , there is zero reason why the cable should affect the data . But just like a lousy video cable to your monitor can add noise to the picture you see without affecting the quality of the underlying data displayed , a good cable can improve it . I think there is probably an audio analogue to that . <p> BTW , anyone know off hand if the inputs on the DS , including there Ethernet input for the Bridge , are galvanically isolated ? - Hope so . <p> I too have gone the simplification route with my system over the years : its plain to me that no- additional devices- sound- better than No Additional Devices . <p> Agreed . " Difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate thread in a separate forum , I have asked Paul why he thinks the DMP/DS combo sounds better than the Bridge/DS combo on identical file material. - <p> And I also agree that simpler , i.e. , fewer devices and connections , almost always equals better , though some of Pauls observations about the insertion of a preamp in certain systems caused me to rethink a few things . Right now , I have a Tortuga LDR passive pre in my speaker system . It accommodates the BDP-105 as an SACD player and the NADAC as DAC for now , so it serves a valuable switching function that I will no longer need when the DMP arrives , but whether it makes anything sound better is up for grabs . But other than that , if I can make it simpler , I sure try to . And in my case , network audio is simplest of all . <p> Having putzed with a few servers and noting differences among them I can see where the DMP may outshine a computer server . In particular , the MAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than PC based ones . I attribute this to the ability to control the software environment , to some extent , offered by Windows and the BIOS/UEFI environment . Having a superior , purpose built device like the DMP to extract and deliver the goods without the extra " noise " of unrelated software processes ( housekeeping " if you will ) could give you a better result . I found that there was a wasteland between a $1K PC server and the $10K+ range for commercial servers where the perceived differences were minimal or mostly absent despite expensive hardware differences . I have not had the opportunity to try the Aurender W20 , though , but at its price- My experience is neither extensive nor authoritative and YMMV . <p> Back to the OPs first post , before you spend the kind of money that an Audioquest Vodka Ethernet cable can cost you , I would recommend that you look at whether fiber might be an alternative or supplemental approach . If you do , then a fiber/Ethernet link or switch is another or additional way to address it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I expect one would want to have a very good power supply for the transceiver nearest the DAC .

@@23909291 @3909291/ <p> ok , trying to see if I can get better sound quality than what my Synology NAS Media Server software and the Synology DS Audio remote iOS app can produce . I am listening to Linn Jazz ( should be 320k ) but coming in at 16k ) <p> Right now my Synology NAS communicates directly to my PWD Mk1 . I do not need my mac pc turned on to communicate from my iphone to my nas . I prefer to keep it this way . <p> Am I correct in that JRiver requires a stand alone computer to be running since the software sits on it ? Can I also assume that JRiver does/can point to an external NAS for the library ? If so , does it point well to Synology NAS ( in a mac OS environment ? ) The import function for JRiver has me a bit confused . Surely the entire music library on a NAS is not importing to the local hard drive of the pc ? Would negate the idea of a NAS .. I must have some misunderstanding here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that software does in fact sit on the NAS and does not need a separate pc running to operate ? Does Minim make its own remote ( for the iOS ) or can other remotes just work fine ? I prefer not to use the elyric as it has not worked well with the Syn . NAS . <p> thoughts ? . this will help me decide my direction away from Synology ecosystem .. <p> JRiver has to be installed on a computer . At this moment versions for Windows and OS X ( audio only ) are available . In the future ( not the PS Audio future : -w ) there probably will be a Linux version . JRiver can point to an external NAS . No , the albums are not copied to the computer on which JRiver is installed . Minimserver does not require a computer . It can be installed on the NAS . I used both systems : 1 . NAS/Minimserver and eLyric on the iPad and 2 . JRiver on the iMac , NAS and JRemote on the iPad . Although it requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most . I really like JRemote on the iPad . Of course there are other apps than eLyric , when you want to use Minimserver . Minimserver does not have its own app , but you can use apps like PlugPlayer . <p> To add to what wybe said : You do n't  need a computer in everyday use to run MinimServer with a NAS . There is a small program called MinimWatch that you do need to install on a PC or Mac that 's on the same network as your NAS . MinimServer on a NAS is headless so you need some way to restart it if needed or change the indexing options etc.thats what MinimWatch does . But most days I do n't  use the computer when listening to music . There is also an autorestart package for Synology , so if you add a new album MinimServer will automatically restart to add the new tracks . <p> I have a Synology NAS with MinimServer and have tried Kinsky and PlugPlayer control points ; my favorite remains eLyric , with Kinsky a close second . Note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EMM music manager . Ive read that the eLyric control point does n't  work well for some people . On my system it does occasionally quit unexpectedly , but the music keeps playing and I just restart it . Otherwise I like its layout of information and appreciate the convenience of being able to change options on my PWD ( I cant use the remote for the DAC because of the angle and distance from my listening chair ) . <p> MinimServer is great and the developer , Simon , is very responsive to questions and support issues . <p> for me at this time there is no really god solutions . I think the elyric solution would have been good but now it is forgotten by PS audio so no more evolution of those softwares . <p> minimserver is very good and the development of the software is effective and work on a NAS ( which is by far the easiest solution ) . this is my favorite !

Good tagging is a huge amount of work and I never want to do it over again . The one indisputable advantage that MinimServer has over any other server I have tried is its ability to browse your music how YOU want , based on your tags , not somebodys preconceived idea of what you want .

@@23909293 @3909293/ <h> Real time analyzers <p> Several readers have been asking how we measured the response of the speakers in the sound room . As well , others have asked if there is a good test for determining if your ears are working well . Ill share with you what we did and do . <p> To measure your loudspeakers response you will need two things : a real time analyzer ( RTA ) and a pink noise source . Using the two will give you a close approximation of the output your speaker is producing in terms of both volume and frequency . Here is what a plot like that looks like : <p> I just grabbed this as an example and it is not a measurement of anything in particular . Getting a picture to use on these posts from our RTA in the lab is a challenge . What this graph shows you is loudness of the speaker at specific frequencies . Each of the blue lines represents a slice of frequency , the highest frequencies are on the right , the lower bass notes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller equals louder . <p> For a source , there are many available choices . For my application I prefer to use a simple CD with a pink noise track . Its also easy to download the same thing . Here is a link to a free download of pink noise . <p> The easiest do-it-yourself method for making a quick measurement is using one of the fine mobile apps . There is an Apple iPhone app here , and an Android app here . Each work quite well for what you want this for . They both use the built in microphone , equalized for flat response , on the mobile device and include a pink noise source as well . Neither is good enough to design a loudspeaker , but for checking to see how your system is working , they are perfectly fine . <p> The real trick to using an RTA is where to point the microphone . That 's rather tricky and I am not a great teacher for this . I will tell you what I know . Try and get an average , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  get too far back because you 'll get much of the room interactions in the measurements . If you get too close to the speaker you will get a measurement more of the individual drivers rather than the speaker as a whole . <p> If nothing else its a handy low cost tool to play with . Tomorrow I 'll give you the secret to a personal audio test . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> If a speaker has only one or two tweeters you can just put your ear right up to it . If you have speakers with an array of tweeters , especially if they are closely spaced like IRS each driver has so little output its sometimes hard to tell that way . A doctors stethoscope is useful . Use the conical adapter , not the domed one . I happened to have bought one when I used to measure my blood pressure with a mercury sphygmomanometer the way some doctors and nurses still do . I use an electronic unit today for blood pressure but I still have the stethoscope . <p> About 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 315 . The identical unit is offered as the BSR 3000 . It has two ten band equalizers , a pink noise generator , a fluorescent 10 band spectrum analyzer with adjustable resolution selectable between 2 and 3 db per increment , and an electret condenser microphone . It seemed it had everything I needed to adjust my sound system . <p> Unfortunately IMO it did n't  work . Adjusting for flat response did n't  sound remotely like flat . There was no correlation between what I measured and what I heard . I made sure the forced air heating/AC system was off since that added a lot to the bass on the spectrum analyzer . No matter what I tried the sound was much too bright and thin . Was the unit defective ? Probably not . It seemed to function properly in every respect . Either I do n't  know how to use this equipment , it needs to be of professional quality , both , or ? ? ? ? What to do ? That 's when I decided it was time to trust my ears . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task achieving accuracy is and how many variables there are . <p> Fortunately I not only have a good pair of ears , I have a brain that likes analyzing and solving problems . Its been well trained for just such tasks . And I found that this problem is far more complicated than it first appears . Any valid system for measuring must also explain in precise detail why speakers that measure the same sound different . Look at John Atkinsons video on YouTube that explains how he measures loudspeakers for his magazine . IMO the published results are virtually worthless . So are his judgments as a critical listener as proven by the experience with the live versus recording demo in Maryland . His counterparts and colleagues are hardly any more trustworthy . <p> Modeling speaker sound output , acoustic interaction with the room , and the resulting sound fields is a complex problem . Then add in all of the other variables like different recording techniques and the way electronics perform as systems in the real world , not individually on bench tests and you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations by and for audiophiles just do n't  come close . How convenient for those who have magic bullets to sell to eager audiophiles with money burning a hole in their pockets for the next sure fix . <p> A real time analyzer is an artifact of a flawed model of hearing . This goes back to Helmholtz , who was a professional surgeon and an amateur physicist . In his fascination to understand how ears work , he used his professional tools : saw , scalpel and microscope . This meant he was looking at ears from cadavers , while human hearing has a myriad of active mechanisms that were hidden from Helmholtzs eyes by death and dissection . He saw Cilia on the Basilar Membrane , which he perceived to be a biological analog to tuning forks , and so the frequency model of hearing began . Fast forward to 1932 when Fletcher Munson collected the data for their famous experiment , still quoted by hordes of reviewers who have developmental deafness to spatial perception and cant hear the sonic difference in high-definition sound . There are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Basilar Membrane detect time , not frequency . Fletcher and Munson had vacuum tube sine wave oscillators but no mechanism to replicate the temporal aspects of music and speech . Second , they used headphones to produce consistent sound levels for their mobile experiment so they could measure a large number of individuals . This cuts out extreme low frequencies , which are sensed through the body , and extreme high frequencies , which enter through the eyes and skull . It further bypasses the pinnae , which are directional phase encoders . The most subtle flaw in their experiment is they traveled to urban and suburban locations to draw their test subjects . This guaranteed the people the measured lived in an environment with motors and speakers . Motor noise masks echoes and speakers mangle phase , especially off axis . Individuals raised in the background noise of motors in urban and suburban America , and in reach of radio broadcasts which took over the supply of music in urban and suburban US by 1932 are phase deaf . Fletcher and Munson made no attempt to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who did , brandishing the Fourier theorem and conveniently ignoring the PHASE component of the Fourier transform . Consequently , audiologists in the experimental protocol established in 1932 have documented the consensus results of 20Hz and 20KHz limits to hearing and the phase deafness of the post-industrial population . These are all falsehoods with respect to Natural human hearing . <p> Harry F. Olson recognized the critical importance of transient response to sound reproduction . He state categorically that the rectangular gated sine wave was the most comprehensive test of loudspeaker accuracy , and featured oscilloscope traces of RGSW on the cover of his 1972 book , " Modern Sound Reproduction " . This is because a discrepancy between transient and steady state response will make it impossible to flatten a reproduction system . Pink noise will gauge response to short bursts of frequencies , but will not report resonances in the system which take time to load and unload the energy . RTA analysis also ignores the relative phase of frequency components which determine the accuracy in reproducing the transient wavefronts as notes start and stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of differentiating musical instruments , and also in creating musical expression that is the beginning and end of the notes tell the story , just like in speech where the consonants carry 5% of the energy but over 50% of the meaning . <p> With the advent of audio grade DACs , ADC and digital signal processing , Richard C. Heyser developed a measurement system which captured all the information from Fourier analysis , including both time ( phase ) and frequency response . This " minimum length sequence " signal illuminates issues like cone breakup , diffraction artifacts , harmonic and intermodulation distortion and the inherent anharmonic transient response of dynamic loudspeakers ( the 1925 Kellogg and Rice patent that took over the world in seven years and still accounts for 99% of speakers made ) . It also can effectively eliminate the room echoes from the measurement . This makes RTA measurement over 40 years obsolete , not counting the RGSW technology that was available in the1960s . LONG ... <p> Amplitude frequency response is only one component of a Bode plot . The other is phase frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems there is a direct correlation between the two so either is sufficient . Usually amplitude frequency response is the one presented . Loudspeaker systems are not zero phase systems . Therefore both are needed . <p> The problem does not stop there . The response in all directions in space are required to describe the loudspeaker system and the arriving directional components at the listener are also required to understand the effect room acoustics have had . At the current state of the art , the kind of data available to consumers and even professionals is inadequate to predict how sound systems will work . One exception is the design of sound reinforcement systems in large spaces using controlled directivity speakers . When the desired performance parameters are defined , and the directivity characteristics of the speakers selected are known , software based modeling gives a cookbook design output . Its practically an exact science . Does n't  apply to home audio hi fi systems though . <p> Paul , you say microphone direction/placement is tricky . Why wouldnt you place it at the prime listening position ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room as well as your source speakers at the position of your ears when listening . <p> Maybe the listening position is utilized for set up and in this case you are simply evaluating the speakers ? <p> Is there a Fake Time Analyzer ? Better to call it an audio spectrum analyzer . Its a struggle to even live in real time . Is lying in bed at 4 aM worrying about something qualified as living in real time ? <p> Its only until recently that I 've started to become interested in speaker measurements and one thing Ive been unable to determine based on everything I 've read on the subject is related to how a speaker measures when its actually playing music . I read Pauls post and figured this would be as good of an area as any to try and ask a couple of questions . <p> 1 . ) From what I understand , when we measure speakers , we only measure them playing one specific frequency at a time at a specific defined decibel level . So my first question is , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are say +3db at 100hz , are we still +3db at 100hz if we changed our base to 80db at 1k or would our sweep of tones and accuracy change at different loudness levels ? Is a speakers frequency response curve the same no matter how loud you play it ? ( Obviously within its designed limits ) <p> 2 . ) Building on above , what happens when a speaker is playing multiple tones simultaneously ? If a speaker is now playing music with the 1k frequencies being at 90db , would the drivers still be producing +3db at 100hz ( and match its measured frequency response of individual tones ) while its now doing the work of playing all the other frequencies at the same time as well ? For that matter , are we even able to measure this ?

That 's a tough load for any machine and the more ease of use we build into these boxes the greater their load and complexity . In fact , its ironic . The simpler a computer becomes to its user , the more complex it becomes to its designer . <p> Computers are noisy hostile environments for the innocent bits playing our music . And computers are happy to share their internal hostility with anything connected to it , like a mosquito spreading a virus . The less direct contact our audio systems- have with computers the better off we are when it comes to sound quality . <p> So if our goal is to take advantage of a computers hard work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch of a button or screen , we also would like to keep our distance from these noisy boxes . <p> More tomorrow . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 15 COMMENTS <p> i wonder always that it is modern to beat the computer . Please tell me the difference between a DAC or ADC and a computer . Without the information technology developed for " computer " neither PSAUDIO nor any other company would ever have been able to build CD-players or DACs not even Philips or Sony could have built one . <p> Why are computers noisy hostile environment specific for " innocent " bits playing music but not for bits enabling CADCAM , computer tomography , data-warehousing and so on and so on ? <p> Is audio really so specific ? What about " STAR WARS " ? I think most of what you will see is done by computers as are all DCP and 3D DCP systems . Since I 've worked on these systems from the years of Hollerith-machines til today I can not see any difference in data processing . <p> Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some special favour . But maybe I am too inexperienced to judge . <p> The bits themselves are ok and forgive my prose in trying to make a simple point . When you are not too interested in things like jitter and digital noise that gets into your audio equipment , computers can be just fine . Perhaps the devices you have mentioned are n't  too sensitive to these kinds of problems . However , audio equipment of the kind we enjoy on a highly resolving system are . <p> So the problem comes down to one of having to pay attention to noise and jitter related problems associated with computers . The best thing you can do for your audio system is to physically isolate the desktop computer from sensitive DACs . <p> Yes , I think audio is a special case . I 've used computers for decades for both video and audio production , and there do n't  seem to be as many issues with video " fidelity " in editing and manipulation being " interfered with " so to speak , by the computer as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraught with issues admittedly many we did n't  know we had until long after new **25;745;TOOLONG , etc. were adopted . <p> I would point out that a number of manufacturers of disc players that do both audio and video allow one to shut off the video circuitry and/or the display in order to reduce noise in the audio circuits . Not sure they would waste the energy and money on that sort of feature if they did n't  believe that it has a real effect . ( See other thread where folks are giving Paul a hard time for the idea of putting out an audio-only Blu-Ray player ) <p> So I think The idea is , " multiply that by all the processes going on in a computer that do n't  have anything to do with audio " and its a hostile environment for our " precious " audio bits . Or perhaps not the bits per se , but the electronics that are responsible for delivering them to us intact . <p> Hmm maybe , due to the points you make , this is why in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) connected vis a quality Toslink cable ( isolated ) to the small Meridian DAC sounds nearly as good as the Macbook Pro running through its USB to Ayres best DAC in the main system . <p> Paul , you just need a better computer it seems . I 've never had the problem of noise from my computer getting into or affecting my music files . Whether I use the HDMI or digital out the sound actually seems better than the original CD . Its probably an illusion but it seems so . <p> I have multiple computers and their all noisy they do n't  exist without noise and jitter . One way I know this is the fact that the same computer connected one way , USB , sounds so much better connected another way , Ethernet . But there 's more and well cover them all . <p> Given a reasonable DAC one that buffers and reclocks the incoming data stream if SPDIF , or buffers and clocks if USB or ethernet its extremely hard to see what effect the " computers activity " can have on the DACs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethernet have in effect got isolation transformers in the better equipment , so subtil ground loops cant form . But it ca n't be the bits nor the jitter nor the edge speed , because the bits is captured into the buffer and clocked out with the internal clock . <p> I do not deny the observations , but it seems to me knowing why is important . <p> Yeah its sadly complicated . What is causing the effects we hear ( ruling out the beers and so forth ) ? I think the place I 'm going with it is , " simpler is better " . If its possible to make changes in the sound in so many ways ( using the computers different I/O , hanging bits on the I/O , different software players , Bit Perfect , etc. ) it would be nice to take those variables out of the equation . <p> I heard Pauls travel Mini on my gear at a Chicago Audio Society meeting ( first public DS demo I believe ) , and it inspired me to have " his guy " do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly one of those " you do n't  notice it until its gone " sort of things your computer is n't necessarily horrible sounding , and some of the ways of doing it with a computer from a hard drive are less error-prone than reading it " live " off a spinning CD . <p> It does n't  necessarily follow that the best thing for everyone to do is get a new , dedicated music computer . But taking it out of the equation more is appealing , which I gather is the idea with NAS-to-Bridge II . Give us the computers control options and remove it from the audio-processing bit as much as possible . <p> To say " computers were never designed to be audio players " is a little disingenuous . Sound stream had a digital audio workstation in 1978 ; Pro Tools started ( as Sound Designer ) in 1984 ; there was a Midi interface for the Mac in 1985 ; Mac home computers offered built-in 16/48 stereo processing in 1994 ; my videos have been mixed with Pro Tools on a Mac for over 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released in 1998 , and since the iPods launch in 2001 , audio playback has been one of the most important tasks of a computer . <p> As to the noisy environment , that depends . Some computers are noisier than others , while various processes can be minimized and optimized for playing audio . My Mac Mini is a relative weakling from 2011 , with a single 2-core i5 processor . Right now , playing a high-res Apple Lossless file with Pure Music ( Memory Play ) plus iTunes ( latest version and latest OS ) , the Activity Monitor says Im using about 7% of System CPU ( 6% User ) . Its a trivially easy task even for old Mac Mini . <p> I agree with Pete above that with a decent computer setup and good DAC , the computer itself will not have an audible effect on the DACs output . Its vitally important to figure out what really does have an audible effect , because there is a lot to go wrong , but do n't  tell me " everything makes a difference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good . ; ) <p> Pro Tools ! Aargh ! Still hate it ! The only way they could make a computer audio system work reliably ( or at all ) back in the day was to DICTATE EVERY SINGLE THING in the setup . I still laugh to think of the $1,000.00 NINE GIG ( massive ! ) hard drive I was compelled to buy to conform to Pro Tools specs . ( I 'm sure others can Trump that one ) <p> ( insert bloated , rich , political joke here ) <p> TO THIS DAY , Pro Tools still has about twelve pages of disclaimer on their software essentially saying , " If you do n't  set your system up EXACTLY as we say , do n't  come bitching to US . And DO NOT upgrade your OS until we get around to supporting it IF and WHEN we do . " <p> The practical reality of Pro Tools use is , it is best to have a computer that is DEDICATED to the task . In some ways , its not far different from what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I go through the same thing with the Pro Tools parent-company product , Avid Media Composer . When everything has to work 24/7 , when downtime is money , one should have a computer dedicated to the task and then do n't  change it ! That said , audio playback should be far easier than video editing or audio recording/mixing . I should also note that I use a MacBook Pro for my home editing system ; it has a crapload of programs installed that have nothing to do with video editing or audio mixing , and yet because it does n't  rely on third-party video and audio hardware with drivers ( as does my office system ) , it performs perfectly , with almost no downtime . <p> Indeed , computers were never DESIGNED for audio , high end audio that is . The fact computers nowadays are USED for audio does n't  change that fact . Nothing disingenious about that . A lot of people nowadays take pictures with their cellphone , despite the fact they ( the phones ) were never designed for that . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REAL camera ? Why not ? With a real camera he can make real good pictures . With a cellphone only snapshots . And although a lot of people do n't  see the difference , that does n't  mean there is no difference . With audio its the same . Computers make noise and have to many tasks every split second to care about soundquality . And although a lot of people do n't  hear the difference , that does n't  mean there is no difference .

And it will soon be time for me to try all components plugged directly into the P10 with the DMP .

So far , looks like a dead end.Ted ? <p> @Stevie B : We love our even ordered harmonic distortion . It is very obvious in the case of heavily overdriven tube circuits ( Jimmie Hendrix ) but less so in the use of small amounts of harmonic distortion in the studio . As I learn more about the techniques used to capture audio I realize how much " interpretation " goes on by audio recording engineers . You are ( often ) not listening to anything that resembles the original product . Processing is done to get that initially recorded signal to sound more pleasing to the ear , even if that means getting it to sound more " natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmonic distortion using minimally overdriven vacuum tubes or , lately , software emulation of this sound . Harmonic distortion you are adding tones above and below the fundamental frequency that enriches the sound . It is a " little white lie " that we usually find pleasing when used in reserved amounts . It is not necessary by any means but many raw recordings are flawed by the techniques and equipment used ( or misused ) so that fudging the sound makes them more attractive . There are many other tricks used . The only way to know what it really sounded like was to have been there when the recording was made. - <p> Stevie B said The statement was made that digital can NEVER sound right as our ears and neural circuits have evolved to decode analog and digitization produces an unnatural waveform . <p> I have seen this argued both ways : the ear is analog , because it is a natural part of our world and must therefore be analog. - So there . <p> Or the ear is digital : sound stimulates the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receptor cells of the Organ of Corti which creates an electrical nerve impulse which travels the spiral ganglion sending information through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain which interrupts these pulses as sound. - The ultimate digital system. - Therefore digital reproduction sounds best . <p> Both arguments strike me as nonsense. - Each adherent starts with the premise his preferred method of reproduction sounds better and works backward to claim this preference is physiological. - Neither proponent explains why so many prefer the opposite method of recording and playback. - <p> If the premise of the article is true , then Ted may be able to add the required " artifacts " during D to A conversion. - Another slot could be added to the DS and a Analogizator board inserted. - An additional Menu Item for " Vinyl/Tape/Tube Amp/Off " could be added and Voila- perfect analog reconstruction. - I wonder if the artifacts would survive the BHK amplification chainBK could fix that. - I 'll bet Paul would love this idea . <p> Also , did you notice the reference to " Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a pair of " Eastern " ears reading this , I would love to know your position on comparison of the two processes. - That preference may be cognitive. - <p> A nice little article. - I am pleased he makes the point that digitally sampled waveforms contain all the information of the waveform. - Many believe the waveform is " stepped " when digitally recorded and played back. - Untrue. - The playback is a normally shaped analog waveform . ( Of course , every recording has some level of imperfection/distortion . ) <p> With respect to various harmonic distortions/additions sounding better to at least Western ears , I believe the writer is being careful to state this may not be universal. - Eastern music does employ scales different from Western , and often recognizes quarter tones , etc. - Equal temperament , used in tuning a piano which makes all 12 steps of an octave scale equal intervals , makes music in all keys similarly out of tune. - The advantage is that the piano need not be retuned to change key . Eastern music uses different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds out of tune for a classical Eastern musician. - Of course , we have difficulty grocking Eastern music as well. - ( As an aside , classical string and wind players , and singers , perform in pure temperament unless accompanied by a differently tuned keyboard . ) <p> Recordings are not automatically sweetened with harmonic additions. - This is simply one tool in an engineers toolbox. - As one would expect , pop/rock is heavily processed and manipulated. - The end result often does not sound as it was recorded. - ( Similar to the dreadful photo processing many use when posting to the Internet do people really think these photos look good ? ) - Classical recording is rarely compressed , never sweetened/processed , and usually is usually just subtly EQd to enhance a sense of naturalness. - <p> Stevie B said Another slot could be added to the DS and a Analogizator board inserted. - <p> I forgot to mention that such processors have been sold for years in the form of tube buffers/tube output stage ; e.g. , click. - These are designed to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can be replicated digitally as well with plug-ins but does not have the same emotional appeal . : ) <p> Ironically properly implemented digital is smoother than analog what its missing in digital are the higher frequencies ( the ones above the antialiasing filter cutoff in the A/D converter . ) <p> As to simple distortions like 2nd or 3rd order distortions : in general a truly balanced implementation of analog will , in theory , nuke all deterministic even order distortions. - Conversely many digital processes can easily introduce odd order distortions . <p> In my view the problem with digital is that there are a lot more places for unnatural distortions to show up. - I.e. high frequency hash from the sharp edges of digital signals , clock jitter , groundloop hell from the many boxes we use in digital setups , etc. - With pure analog processing the distortions are often more benign since they are likely to resemble the distortions that we are subject to in the real world already , and therefor already discount : things like reverberation , echos , changing FR depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSD distortions : Most of the papers that talk about SDM converters and their distortions are computer simulations of essentially chaotic processes. - We do n't  have good enough theoretical models of the sigma delta process to calculate or predict most distortions any more efficiently than doing a simulation and measuring the output. - But these results are very specific to the particular SDM being modeled and those models almost certainly are different than the SDM implementations actually being used in the real equipment. - In the case of the DS where the SDM is done purely digitally I consider the specifics of how I ( mostly ) avoid noise modulation and overflow to be a trade secret and that there 's no plot out there that will show any particularly simple distortion , e.g. second order distortion of the processes in the DS. - Since I use balanced technology in the DS there 's little 2nd order distortion above and beyond the output transformers. - I can see 2nd and 3rd order distortions on the scope but their levels are at essentially inaudible compared to the levels of euphonic distortion people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Analog is additionally far from flat in frequency response. - The bottom end is particularly problematic , with peaks , dips , all sorts of oddities . - <p> While digital filters do impinge on high frequency response , analog often has big problems at this end as well with more peaks and dips. - I am hard pressed to opine whether digital or analog is better in this respect . <p> @Stevie B : I have very little experience with " things recording " , but hope to gain more as I go . When I have tried to ad a bit of " tube sweetness " to a track I have ended up not liking it compared to the original . Perhaps I use too much or apply it incorrectly . It certainly is not a panacea but I understand that it is used quite a bit in pop recordings . Other forms of distortion are used , too . Clipping ( ick ) and extravagant- compression are two other types that I dislike immensely . <p> wglenn , Your comments concerning the recording process are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the process was kept as pure to the original as possible. - Maybe we blame the hardware and software for unless than perfect sound when it has actually been manipulated during the trip from the studio to my equipment rack. - Here is a perspective from a recording engineer on analog vs digital and if you search his blog , you can find some interesting discussions on loudness vs dynamics. - <p> - <p> I have a much better appreciation for what Paul , Ted and Arnie must contend with in trying to accurately reproduce instruments and the human voice with ever-changing technology. - <p> There are those who level the field as tape , then vinyl and a distant third is great digital . I for one see things as much more complex than that . - First off most here have one system maybe two , as I have two speaker setups and many headpones our beloved music has many faces . I think what you have found is that change is good meaning you just like the sound of your music processed as you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet you still like it . - As we look for purity in our audio it does not lead me to what I like always . How many even use any form of eq , or processing on our end ? I would guess most do not , my point is as I do not either , - having a few setups shows me there is other views in the window of sound we listen to . - Many years ago I had a set of Allison acoustic speakers they had a set of switch son the back the changed the sound of them . As I was not happy with there sound I called up the company . I was lucky to talk although the owner . One of his comments was why do you not use the bass , mid and treble on my preamp ? That lead me to buying an eq . As that road has many turns it still leads you to some pretty good places at times . - I a , willing to bet your results will not be pleasing worth all recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose speculation there and ( probably accidentally ) misleading statements. - There are many kinds of distortion , the question is which kinds interfere with our hearing ( and appreciating ) the music we all like. - Noise is a distortion : noise correlated with the signal is very noticeable , noise uncorrelated with the signal is quite benign , the ear/brain is really good at ignoring noise it hears in the real world- Phrases like " above 20 kHz the music signal will start to be drowning in the noise . " are misleading even taking the Stereophile graph as described. - Note that the signal to noise ratio is still better than 50dB at 90k , but for PCM at 176.4k or 192k the signal to noise ratio is 0 dB. - I 'd much rather have a 50dB S/N ratio there than no signal at all. - But the graph from Stereophile is misleading : its a graph of the noise thru a one third octave swept filter ( people shouldnt take graphs and leave behind the captioning ) - So , for example , - the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20k is being affected by the signal at 30k , etc. - Similarly the Hawksford graph is wrong in the caption- claims that its showing a noise reference line for 20/44.1 , but 20 bits is approx. -120dB S/N not -150dB S/N as shown , similarly a 44.1k sample rate does n't  represent a signal at 200k as shown : it does n't  go above 22.05k. - Another misleading phrase is " All these strong high frequency content might fry your tweeters ! " - I do n't  know about you but I would n't want speakers that cant handle a HF signal thats- more than a factor of 100 lower than their rated signal handling just an octave lower. - Or to put it another way , the DSD noise is much lower than a perfectly legal PCM signal at a 176.4 or 192k sample rate . <p> Ill stop now : ) <p> P.S. Since were in a thread about tape , just imagine the ultrasonic frequency spike at the tape bias frequency its quite a bit louder than the DSD noise and its a pure tone , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tube amps and analogue playback ( eg. vinyl ) . Objectively the DSD conversion adds distortion but the anomalies are not perceived as objectionable and in some material , the added noise and imprecision actually makes it sound less " sterile " , " clinical " , more " real " ( conversely being in an anechoic chamber is disturbingly unreal- due to the profound silence ) . It would make sense to me that some people could prefer DSD64 over DSD128 upconversion since DSD64 will give you more of that distortion . Even though the noise is ultrasonic in nature as measured off the DAC , nonlinearities in the playback system like your headphones and speakers ( perhaps certain amps as well ) could create audible intermodulation . Maybe for certain music , this could be especially beneficial . <p> which is excerpted from the following article showing hi-res PCM and DSD64 and DSD 128 to be identical in many measurements . <p> Since these articles are a couple of years old , are they still valid and does the use of an FPGA and Teds magic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinyl directly to tape and compared it via headphones to analogue from my CD player. - Without the DS in the chain , some of the magic was gone , therefore the magic IS in the DS . <p> I think the euphonic argument about DSDs noise comes from the cognitive dissonance that some have that DSD could sound better. - People seize on the most obvious difference between FR measurements between DSD and PCM and then " post hoc ergo propter hoc " . - They ( usually ) do n't  look at the phase response of DSD vs PCM and take note that DSD preserves the waveform shape better , and in particular that transients are better preserved. - IMO its this about DSD that matters the most for sound quality- and the extra noise is n't really a feature , but more of an unavoidable ( but mostly benign ) side effect of the noise shaping in DSD . <p> The modulation argument does n't  hold water either : many of us have speakers flat to 50 or 80k and amps and preamps that have at least that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these systems not worse . <p> BTW I do n't  intend to imply that DSD is necessary to preserve transients high enough- resolution PCM can , but it would require a lot more processing and bandwidth than DSD for the same low distortion of waveform shape. - I chose DSD simply because the " hard " work for me was an excellent output stage ( which is simple with DSD ) and the rest was simply math/programming . <p> Stevie B said - Even though the noise is ultrasonic in nature as measured off the DAC , nonlinearities in the playback system like your headphones and speakers ( perhaps certain amps as well ) could create audible intermodulation .

" -Ted <p> Glad to hear my suspicions about phase info confirmed . This is what- really gobsmacks me about DSD and why I often prefer the DSD version of a track to the PCM version . If the source for both is an analog master , I think that the phase relationships sound more " correct " to me . I find it hard to put into words but I 've thought lots about phase this year after learning so much from Galen and his cable designs . Is this the " thing " that analog gets right that PCM misses out on , phase preservation ( relative phase relationships ) ? Is this why master tapes sound so incredible ? - <p> Master tapes exhibit a great deal more phase distortion than digital. - For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital equalizers can either mimic this behavior or avoid it ( linear shift ) depending on ones choice of digital equalization. - <p> Then there is the tape recorder itself and all its analog circuity : capacitors , transformers , inductors , record and playback heads , etc. - All of these goodies introduce phase smearing , especially capacitors and inductors. - The phase shift is greater at high frequencies . - Plus , If the azimuth is off , there is phase shift between tracks with tape which can be particularly significant with 24-track tape this phase shift is heard as the shifted and unshifted tracks interact. - High frequency phase shift can sound more open as it creates a widening effect. - <p> Tape emulators mimic all of these characteristics , along with the natural compression of tape. - Many like this sound even though it is in reality less accurate than digital. - This is what people hear as " warmer , " more analog like . <p> Its just darn hard to sort out . On further thought , Reference Recordings PCM has that " phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got the DSD transfer of Kind of Blue and so far , I think that I like the Hi Res PCM remaster better . I have n't spent a lot of time with the DSD version yet so this is just a casual first impression . I do wish that Rudy VG would share more of his knowledge . Clearly a brilliant ear and technician but stingy on explaining how he did it . Interestingly , he was an Optometrist who continued to practice to fund his recording habit , an amateur with extraordinary talent ( and talented musician friends ! ) . 
@@23909314 @3909314/ <h> Music to My Ears <h> Bebop Deluxe <p> Mankind astounds with creativity , stupidity , ingenuity , and levity . The same species that invented the super-collider will drink beer with buddies in his garage and drop a frozen turkey into a vat of boiling oil , setting said garage on fire . I know a guy who did this . But once in a while as our globe hurtles through the frozen frown of space an event occurs that makes God smile . One of these events was the birth and life of Dizzy Gillespie . <p> Born in 1917 , as a teen he heard Roy Eldridge on the radio and decided to play jazz trumpet . At 20 he replaced Roy Eldridge as lead trumpet in Teddy Hill 's orchestra . Kid knew what he wanted . By 1939 Diz was playing on the big boy circuit with Cab Calloway , and showing the first beginnings of bop soloing which Calloway did not understand or appreciate . There is a famous story involving a spitball that may or may not have originated from the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not think of Gillespie as a good musician he heatedly blamed Dizzy . Gillespie denied it strongly enough for the spitball to become fisticuffs and knives . Bands . Always dangerous places. - - Calloway fired him . <p> In 1941 and ' 42 Gillespie played with small combos , but made his money writing for bands like Jimmy Dorsey and Ella Fitzgerald . Then in 1943 , he joined the Earl Hines band where he met Bird . <p> Charlie Yardbird ' Parker was born in Kansas City in 1920 . Kansas City was already a happening music scene and Parker caught the muse early . He picked up the sax at 11 years , and quit high school in 1935 and got his union card . At 17 he was traveling with Jay McShann 's band , and in 1939 Bird landed in NYC working as a dishwasher in a club where Art Tatum played . By 1942 he 'd been practicing 10 hours a day , and he was hired by Earl Hines for his band . Parker played with Gillespie in the Hines band for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combos , including jam sessions at Minton 's Playhouse , which amongst a rich collection of musicians was this weird player with a weird name , Thelonious Monk . <p> Monk was born in North Carolina in 1917 , 11 days before Dizzy was born in South Carolina . The family moved to Manhattan when he was young , and Monk started playing piano at 6 . By his teens he was touring with an evangelist playing organ . I ca n't imaging telling my Mom at 14 I was leaving home to play organ for a traveling bible thumper with a tent . But Monk was different as a kid , and he was certainly different throughout his life , both private and professional . <p> In the early 40 's TMonk became the house pianist at a club on the first floor of the Cecil Hotel at 210 West 118th Street in Harlem , otherwise known as Minton 's Playhouse . Henry Minton was the first black delegate to the American Federation of Musicians Local 802 , and had run the Rhythm Club , so he had cred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was well aware of the hard times musicians suffer , many times at the hands of the unions , and his real desire was to create an atmosphere where young players could get together and explore music together . Jam sessions were restricted by the unions , and union guys would haunt the clubs trying to catch these guys and fine them , anywhere from 100 to 500 dollars , which in the early 40 's was a small fortune , especially to a young black jazz musician . But because of Minton 's union ties and his respect in the community , Minton 's Playhouse became a haven , and really , the birthplace of bebop . <p> Through Minton and Teddy Hill who managed the club , musicians started coming to the late night jam sessions there to explore music outside the current boundaries of swing . All these guys had cut their chops with the big swing bands , and late at night they wanted to let loose . And they did . A famous Parker story has him playing Cherokee in a session and realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any key . What that meant simply was each note in a chromatic scale being as important as any other , thus not being in a given key , Parker discovered he could fly into a series of soloing that defied logic , with passing chord changes , altered chords , and chord substitutions which were remarkably revolutionary . <p> And guys like Gillespie and Monk , along with Kenny Clark , Joe Guy , Roy Eldridge , Ben Webster and Lester Young started flying with the Birdman . Mary Lou Williams , a writer , vocalist , and mentor to Monk said the boppers goal was to create a music that no one could steal . And in fact , guys like Dizzy were infamous for telling a newcomer to the stage to do a tune in a key never tried , counting a quick four , and flying that trumpet with a grin around his embouchure . Dizzy 's playing was so complex he was rarely copied by his contemporaries , they went after Miles and Navarro instead . Here 's a recording of Diz with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the keys and Christian Wesley White on the standup . <p> And Parker and Dizzy in 1951 . <p> Oh My . <p> Thelonius Monk spent a lot of time leading his own bands and was a huge a contributor to the new style and its weirdness with his unique style , which was so different it was impossible to copy . His seemingly natural use of dissonance and percussive attack , switched key releases and those hesitations that burst like a silent virus were not only unique and fascinating , but few players could stay with him . Miles Davis famously would ask Monk to sit out during his solos so he would n't get confused . Miles . But John Coltrane had no problem . <p> Yeah man . <p> This music was populated by a lot more supremely talented people than I can list , I was just going for influences . Bebop has been called in history the musicians music , mostly by folks who could n't figure out how to dance to it and so it could n't be popular . But it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to know how music works , or what the minor seventh of the mixolydian mode is to hear that these guys , man these guys could truck . <h> About WL Woodward <p> W L Woodward is the Director of Operations at PS Audio . He has been married since 1974 to his high school sweetheart and should practice his guitar more . <h> 4 COMMENTS <p> Amen Mr. Woodward ! While I do not know of the history you speak , I do know who can play . WOW ! Dizzy can play . Combine him with Joe Pass and I 'm hooked . Combine him with anyone else and I 'm hooked . Thank you for the history lesson . I was aware of Miles asking Monk to sit out though . I believe he was also derisive of Coltrane if I remember correctly . <p> You are welcome Drew . There are some recordings of Diz , Clark Terry , and Roy Eldridge playing with the Oscar Peterson Trio ( ! ! ) calling themselves The Trumpet Kings which are really worth checking out , especially Live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone just goes " Yup . " Miles was a bit of a pill for sure . but dissing the Trane is just plain ignorant ! Thanks for reading and writing Drew . Woody <p> Thanks for the concise history ! I love bebop , and bemoan the fact that most authentic recordings are not hi in the fi department . Few have ever been able to play as Dizzy ; even Wynton Marsalis stabs at bebop show him to be mortal . <p> I hear you Christopher , the recordings are few and poor . The genre just never had enough broad appeal to make the larger producers want to make it right . No matter . We have some great stuff still alive through guys like Blue Note .

@@23909317 @3909317/ <h> Back to the classroom <p> Thanks for indulging me my story of the early struggles with an outdated education system . I hope we 've come a long way since those days of industrialized factory schools churning out something ; although I am not sure what . <p> The saving grace of my education through public schools was the few standout teachers I had ( and I suspect you had as well ) . Hats off to those brave souls that really loved to teach and share and gave their all towards that endeavor , despite an antiquated school system that had n't  changed much since it started , back in the Henry Ford days . <p> Let 's finish up with DoP and move on to other subjects . If you 'll recall , DoP is a format that permits single bit audio ( DSD ) to " trick " a computer or network into thinking its Multi-bit Audio ( PCM ) . Because computers do n't  recognize Single-bit Audio , they do n't  know what to do with it . And that brings me back to what I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer a video bit , math bit , audio bit , or mouse bit all look the same . Bits is bits . Remember ? <p> Now , do n't  get turned around just yet . Many of you wrote in to say " if bits are bits , why do cables matter , sample rates , etc. ? " Ok , that means you 're thinking too much ! Ill likely call Mr. Shannon out of retirement to give you a good whack for doing so . : ) When I write " bits are bits " I am not referring to how those bits are delivered , their speed , their timing and all the little details critical to how those bits are going to sound . No , I am referring to the bits themselves : the ON and OFF pulses are all pretty much the same . <p> So if bits are bits , how do Single-bits differ from Multi-bits and how does a computer know the difference ? Computers use something called a header , which is a small group of bits that represent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer " I have PCM or I have DSD or I am USB " and with these instructions , the computer ( or DAC ) knows what to expect next and what to do about it . <p> The problem we run into with Single-bit Audio is two fold : its a stream and does n't  have a consistent " reminder " header telling the computer what 's going on and most modern computers were never instructed to deal with Single-bit Audio even if they did have the instruction set . They only know Multi-bit Audio . Think of this as getting a set of written instructions in a language you cant understand . That could change , over time if operating systems of Microsoft and Apple wanted to include Single-bit audio , but for now they do n't  . <p> So here 's what some clever guys did to get around this problem : they put sheeps clothing on the pack of wolves . If you had a flock of sheep and wanted to get a pack of wolves into that group without the sheep noticing , youd wrap the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now let 's relate that to Single-bit Audio ( the wolf ) and Multi-bit Audio ( the sheep ) . <p> Single-bit Audio is a stream of on/off bits . The more ON bits the more energy we generate to make a loudspeaker move . Multi-bit Audio is not a constant stream , but rather a stream of coded packets ( their bits also make more or less energy to the loudspeaker , but they must first be decoded , unlike the simpler Single-bit stream ) . Think of Single-bit Audio as a flowing stream of water and Multi-bit Audio as a long unbroken freight train . Each of the cars in our imaginary freight train has an identifying marker that let 's an inspector know what 's inside each of the cars of the train . This is the header I spoke of . <p> If we want to take our continuous stream ( Single-bit Audio ) to a new location , one thing we could do is divert a section of the streams water and fill up one of the freight train cars . If we repeated this process , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire stream intact to anywhere we wanted . How did we manage this ? <p> Picture our stream running in an overhead pipe with a gate on the pipe that opens up at identical intervals , releasing water . Below the pipe is our train . With each water release we fill up one of the cars of the train ; the train then moves forward and the process repeats . Using this method , the train can travel anywhere it needs to go . What we 've done is expertly divided up the water in the stream into containers ( the train cars ) which allows us to transport the water intact to a new destination . Once we arrive all we need to do is reverse the process and we again have a flowing stream . The water is identical , its in the same order it started with and it was never converted to something else for transport . <p> Now you start to understand how DoP does not convert Single-bit Audio to Multi-bit Audio , it simply breaks the continuous stream of bits in Single-bit Audio into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and fools the computer into thinking its actually something it is not . The computers happy , the data is intact . <p> Remember that the bits are bits and the computer ca n't tell one bit from another ? Once we add this header that is lying to the computer , falsely identifying the attached group of bits as PCM , the computer let 's them through because it simply can not tell the difference and does n't  care ( they pass through unmolested but the computer still does n't  know what to do with the DSD bits and thus cant play them without a program to help it understand them ) . <p> For the more technically minded here 's the details . The Single-bit Audio stream is running at 2.822mHz ( 2,822,000 bits per second ) . The DoP " converter " simply culls out 16 bits from the Single-bit stream and attaches an 8 bit header to it , then repeats that process over and over again . The bits it is grabbing have no timing information associated with them ; they are simply a group of exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 audio bits , plus 8 header ( information ) bits equals 24 bits . So a DoP packet is 24 bits long ( 8 info bits and 16 data bits ) . Each of these newly minted packets collectively run at 176.4kHz . Sound familiar ? Sure , you 've heard of high resolution audio running at 176.4/24 bits ? Right . That 's single rate DSD in DoP clothing . You can do the math yourself : 16 x 176,400 equals 2,822,400 which is the exact sample rate of single rate DSD . Simple eh ? And the other added 8 bits ? They account for the larger file size of DoP vs. native DSD ( bigger by 1/3 ) . <p> here 's a picture of what that looks like . <p> The orange squares to the left represent the 8 information bits attached to the 16 bits of DSD to the right . This is our freight car filled with Single-bit water ( the wolf were trying to hide ) , and the 8 header bits provide the sheeps clothing to trick the computer into believing the next set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the 8 information bits let 's any interested party know the data is really DSD . Thus , if the DoP data is put into a DAC that understands that information and can process it , all it needs to do is throw away the 8 bits of information data , connect all the 16 bit wide groups of DSD together and play the DSD stream perfectly . No conversion process ever took place . <p> Now , let me go grab a cold glass of perfect water from the stream , uncontaminated from any dreadful impurities , despite the fact it arrived in a freight train with a wolf as engineer . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> Because the header is doing much more than just saying its DSD or not DSD . Remember , the header has to look like PCM , has to tell the computer the information that follows is PCM . There are standards of information in those headers , sample rate , bit depth , channel orientation , file types all required for the computer to verify and authenticate it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for many decades . These standards are what they are . If we were to start over and want to make DSD work , we would n't do DoP because its a hack but one that works without any damage to the signal . <p> Going back to 2012 , I always thought the bridge with the PSII sounds better than USB with a good cable ( at least for me ) because the ethernet cable conveys only signal with no jitter issue only bits whatever how they are packed + I2S connection <p> So can we make the following analogy ? <p> Ethernet /bridge connection may have the same effect as DSD for transportation purpose : bits with no timing issue on the route to the computer , which makes the quality insensitive to the cable . Even not being single bit , can we see it as a kind of Multi-bit direct stream Audio ? : it looks like it is bits-packs conveyed and deciphered with clock treatment only within the dac / i2s ; another " X " oP thing : ) ? <p> So if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you experience a significant improvement with the DSD vs PSII/bridge ? and DSD/USB vs DSD/Bridge ? ( I speak of SQ only , not of the bridge features for network management purpose , which remains of course a good reason to use it ) <p> Thanks . Fortunately , the new DirectStream does n't  pay much attention to how things are delivered to it , whether their full of jitter or not at all . Weve managed to get DirectStream to sound pretty close on all manners of input . <p> Having said that , there are , of course , differences . The Bridge and USB inputs all deliver data without timing info attached DoP or otherwise . There is also a new means of getting DSD directly over USB that well look at updating DirectStream to handle as well . <p> No , unfortunately its not that simple . I probably made it too simple . PCM does n't  use a header and uses just the 16 bits , up to 24 bits ( for S/PDIF ) . <p> There is a bit ( embedded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCM or not , but this is not part of the regular data frame . DoP expects it to be set for PCM to make sure that no one throws it away along the road . <p> So devices expect the data coming over S/PDIF to be PCM , and if it really is then there is no problem . Because PCM doesn+GGt have a header , a PCM device still thinks that DoP data is PCM . That+GGs what makes it work , the fact that most equipment isn+GGt smart enough to recognize it as being anything other than PCM . <p> A pulse is a pulse . A bit is not a bit . The significance of each pulse depends on what the system is that its being used in . In a strictly amplitude versus time system a pulse is what will make your speaker pop , the larger the pulse , the louder the pop . In DSD , a pulse at a given time tells the decoder to kick the output voltage up by a fixed amount . The absence of a pulse tells it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pulse does not become a bit until it is used as one method of digital encryption . As with any system whether its the only system a circuit is designed to encrypt or decrypt or not , the pulse only means something in the context of that particular system of encryption . The system RBCD chose is a 14 bit binary encoded word system . Each pulse or bit has a value depending on where in the agreed sequence it occurs in the word . Having utilized the system that evolved from computers this base 2 system reads the sequence of bits in each word from right to left . It could have been designed to read from left to right or in any other sequence . This just happens to be the system chosen . These types of encryptions do n't  have to be restricted to a binary code either . For example , a third bit represented by a negative going pulse could have signified the digit 2 in a ternary or trinary code . 0 , + , for no pulse , positive going pulse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a ten bit word . In hexadecimal where 0 and fifteen different levels of voltage discrimination could be encoded and decrypted the same number of levels could have been achieved with a 4 bit word . <p> The binary system for audio and video data was undoubtedly chosen because it is relatively easy and there was a lot of hardware and software already around that could be made use of . It was much easier to understand than learning new coding systems . You have n't lived until you 've tried to perform simple arithmetic calculations in hexadecimal ( base 16 . ) <p> I think we can all agree that noise is the most pressing problem in digital as well as analog systems , and the elimination of noise is the engineers first task . Failing to eliminate noise is failing to solve the fundamental problem in digital systems . <p> From what I gather from your explanation Paul , and the math that confirms the explanation , there is no practical difference between DS and 176/24 . <p> They are one and the same at the end , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If DS is not converted , just held in a 16 bit word length in the same box car as PCM , it is being converted indeed , it is PCM , no ? The box car is the word length . The math appears to be the same , just approached one from the top down , the other from the bottom up . Or perhaps better described , one at the input ( door to the box car ) the other to the door on the other side . <p> This reasoning may be why a number of top designers disagree with DS advantages as being hype and nothing more . the only " more " is that DS adds noise that was eliminated with PCM . <p> My analysis is that DS may sound " smoother " to some listeners alike analog not because DS mimics analog it does not but rather DS has similar noise characteristics as analog : more of it the higher the frequency one is dealing with . <p> We can see how such noise is tolerated by LP lovers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothing the staircase so to speak . <p> " I think we can all agree that noise is the most pressing problem in digital as well as analog systems " <p> I entirely disagree . Noise is not a problem in RBCD systems or better . Where there is noise on RBCD recordings it was inherent in the source signal whether as noise recorded on an analog tape recorder or in the analog system , microphones picking up room rumble or other spurious sounds , or other equipment malfunction . The background of DDD recordings made in a quiet environment even at high gain assuming the amplifiers etc. are not introducing noise is dead silence . Whatever problems high quality digital formats have inherent in them , noise is not one of them . <p> To his statement , let me recite a personal , but appropriate story . I have a relative , fairly close , not blood , who was a systems engineer who graduated at the top of his class from Cooper Union , regarded by the industry as the top of its class . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was an angry and bitter man who did n't  get along with anyone in the family and at work too , which seriously impacted his prospects . He disagreed with everyone that disagreeable personality was his real profession , not his slide rule . <p> Everyone however thought that he was bright . When I met him at the age of 17 or so , I did n't  think he was really that bright and maintained my impressions through decades , after which a few others in the family eventually saw it my way . The man was n't really bright , but he knew how to use a slide rule better than I did . He also had a lot of textbooks about engineering that I did n't  possess . He was also taller than I and had a better head of hair . <p> He could figure out why everyone around him was wrong about everything and he was right about everything , but not why his entire family and all his friends were alienated . Interestingly , everyone in the family disagreed with him , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had his numbers , opinions , his textbooks and his very own anus . <p> In other words , he was the center of the universe and the universe was centralized at the Forum in Rome . Never mind that the Forum started crumbling 2000 years ago . <p> Back to the noise that Soundminded says does n't  exist or are the least of digitals problems : <p> QUOTE in the intro : " As technology continues to advance , issues of signaling , timing , power , and noise become increasingly important . " .. " Band-aid fixes rarely exist for these types of problems ; however , they could have been easily avoided by proper design if the engineers involved had been knowledgeable about noise , signaling , timing and power . By writing this book we hope to help eradicate the widespread ignorance , and often misinformation , in these areas , and in doing so , help avoid disasters of this kind in the future . " <p> I could go on an on about THE NOISE IN ONES HEAD that does n't  exist either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . However if Soundminded still thinks that noise in digital systems are hardly a concern , he is welcome to his opinions that no one in the engineering field would agree with . <p> I might have put it another way : Noise is NO LONGER the largest concern for audio digital systems because of the recent advancements made , but there is still noise that can and does exist as stray voltages that play a role in jitterand noises that can get induced in a circuit by other means , magnetic , RF and so on . But I have no idea why I , a non-engineer , has to explain it to one who is . <p> Did you ever know someone who knew so little about something he did n't  even know how little he knew ? Well that 's the digital noise I get from your postings . <p> Ever hear of " dither ? " That 's the NOISE that is DELIBERATELY ADDED to mask quantization at the very lowest sound levels recorded in digital formats . It is so low many experts say you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now why would anyone think of deliberately adding noise even at such a low level ? BECAUSE OTHERWISE WITHOUT IT THERE ISNT ANY . <p> Not only do n't  I read your links , I do n't  read most of what you post except when I scan them to see if you have topped your prior remarks with something I find even more ridiculous making less sense than what you 've posted in the past . <p> Of course , we already know that All Roads Lead to Rome and that you 're closed-minded and immune to evidence from MIT , Stanford , Texas Instruments and Microchip Technoligies as well as I could post dozens of other authorities who know much more about electronic engineering than you do and you should continue in your arrogant ways , because you know that the laws of physics can be violated at will , especially by you , and you know that a microphone or a battery of microphones hear exactly the same way as a pair of human ears hear because the microphones are made of the same organic material as the pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You are , Soundminded , so much smarter than all the worlds audio designers and engineers COMBINED that you had figured out all the problems in audio reproduction than they could not , and that is why your only proof of life are your words in lieu of achievements . <p> If there were a MOUNT RUSHMORE for engineers ( and I 'm certain you 're not reading this because you 're so smart ) on which the worlds top engineers heads were carved , for example like Gustave Eiffel , yours would top them all . <p> Mostly because you 're not reading this and because you 're not full of yourself .

But I 'm trying to make a good decision specific to the P10 . <p> I had dedicated 20A lines installed . In my case , amps to P10 was not an option ( my mono blocks overload the P10 output ) ; however , the upside has been great isolation of my front end components from the demands of the power amps , and with a 20A circuit , with the power amps on , there 's only a 1V drop out of the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work as hard ) . <p> If you go with power amps direct to the wall , I recommend you use shielded power cable night and day difference in sound . <p> Definitely yes ! I like to crank it up and Ive never blowin- a breaker ! - I have dedicated lines run to the breaker box installed too , it was my first step and messy ! - I went with 2 x 20 amp lines , 4 sockets on 2 separate circuits. - The more the better ! In hindsight , I would have done 3 lines and 6 sockets , for future expansion , but 4 is adequate. - In my opinion 20 amps is more than enough. - I noticed you have to worry about the watt load more than amp load . <p> I have a MC402 and MC205 on my P10 . Also , the Blu-ray player , DS DAC , etc each draw- only a couple watts and draw under 2 amps total . Those are plugged into my P10 too .

@@23909329 @3909329/ <p> None that I am aware of . You need some way to connect the device to what you want to hear . The closest might be a Sonos , using its digital output , but even then you still need some way to communicate with the Sonos and tell it what you want it to do , and they rely upon an iPhone or a tablet or computer to talk to the Sonos. - <p> OK , so here is a new product idea for you . I am no tech expert , just an audio lover . So here is a " customer perspective " on what I would like . <p> A system component that will connect to ( wifi etc. ) - and allow you to browse the internet for audio streaming sites . So it would have a wireless keyboard- - and a display or allow you to use other displays like your tablet if you do n't  want to buy its display . It would be cheaper than a dedicated laptop because it would not have the computing power or software of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source because it would have optimized output for audio ( better USB like integrated LANRover and other output options ) - and easily integrate with better external DACs . It would not provide CD playback or music storage but easily integrate with CD transports , network attached servers and music servers . <p> Is there a need for this or am I missing something that already exists ? <p> P.S. The whole idea here is that a laptop is not the best source component in an audio system because it way over performs in terms of computing capability but under performs in terms of music reproduction and integration with an audio system . 
@@23909331 @3909331/ <h> What happened to composers ? <p> As I have been immersed in building my big library I have noticed something interesting . <p> In classical music you sort your library by the name of the composer Mozart , Beethoven , Dvorak and in pretty much everything else the name of the performer Beatles , Glenn MIller , Etta James . <p> The big turning point in thiscatalogingchange happenedwhen we gained the ability to actually record a performance -which makes sense since the only way to record music for the classical composers was writing it down on a sheet of paper so no record of any performance remains . <p> My guess is if the playing field were even and we had recordings of the performers in Beethovens day this cataloging shift would not have taken place and we would always sort by performer . <p> Which would suggest the medium has a great impact on how we mentally catalog artists : we remember authors because we read their book actors because we watched their films performers because we listened to their music but composers ? <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , I think , because that 's all we have to catalog in our minds . <p> A great example of how technology changed our world view . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 6 COMMENTS <p> Paul , I think you missed it this time . In the time of Mozart and Beethoven the comosers were the performers ! ! Composers such as Beethoven often held some works back from being published , as they wanted the performances only by them . People would come to hear a new work by Beethoven performad by Beethoven ! ! If the composer was not proficient in a particular instrument , he dedicated it to a talanted vituoso of that instrument . Also , works were commissioned by wealthy patrons , and yet they are not known by the performer or the prince or nobleman who commissioned them . Take for example Bachs Goldberg variations . Goldberg was the performer , to be played to help his employer get to sleep . Bach was commissioned to write them . Still they are know as : BACH " S Goldberg variations . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performesrs of Gershwinss Porgy and Bess , a example of more modern composers . Classical music is still being written , and performed , and they are still know by the Composer not the performer . I could go on , but , I think you get my point ! <p> Pop albums are usually anthologies they are similar to classical recitals in including works by many composers . The common thread is the performer , so that 's the best way to file them . <p> I file classical anthologies first by instrument ( e.g. , piano , voice ) , then by performer . If you consider pop albums to be vocal recitals with accompaniment , you can see that they are filed just the same as many record collectors file classical vocal recitals . <p> You ask " what happened to composers ? " We still have them , they never disappeared . I believe the great composers of contemporary rock/folk music , like Bob Dylan , Brian Wilson , Lennon &amp; McCartney , Neil Young , Bruce Springsteen , Fagan &amp; Becker , Leonard Cohen and Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc , especially in terms of influence on the direction of music . The fact some of them were part of a performing group , e.g. , The Beatles , Beach Boys or Pink Floyd , does not take away from their influence as composers of great music . For filing purposes , I look to see whose name is on the record , if its Paul McCartney , then I file the record alphabetically under M ; if The Beatles , then I file it with the Bs . Since I do n't  own or listen to classical music , I do n't  have to worry about sorting between composer and performer . <p> What happened to composers ? The good news : they are mostly dead . At least the good ones are . If there 's a Mozart , Beethoven , Tchaikowsky or their like alive today they are unknown . The pop scene is equally bleak . There are no more Gershwins , Kerns , Porters , or Berlins . No Rogers and Hammersteins , No Gilbert and Sullivans . Even writers of the most trite pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 40 years ago to aging baby boomers . Todays scene is a lifeless arid desert . Todays pop singers almost entirely vapid. completely forgettable , at least for me . Whod ever thought LGWAG would ever be commercially viable ? But then I never dreamt deafening shrieks that murder your hearing with all quantity and no quality would be either . But it was in the era of turn on , tune in , drop dead . <p> How fortunate that each of the greatest composers for the most part wrote an entire universe of music . Each has written enough to keep music lovers fascinated endlessly . And their music is so captivating that you can hear the same compositions , the same performances over and over again and enjoy them more each time because you hear something you never noticed before . So that music writing died does n't  mean that the music necessarily died with it . <p> Classical composers write scriptspop composers write scenarios . That means pop performers have a lot more leeway to shape the music their way . ( Consider a Gershwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Peterson ) And many classical performers cover several centuries worth of worksIf you 're in the mood for Scarlatti ( either one ) , then Rachmaninov wont do , and vice versa . Also , classical composers write long pieces , so a given disc may hold just one work . And how do you file group works like opera by performer by the soprano ? the tenor ? the conductor ? <p> I , too , file classical by composer when possible , else by instrument or by genre ( e.g. , operetta , choral ) , and alphabetical by performer within instrument or genre categories . I file some pop works by genre , too ( e.g. , blues ) , but mostly do it by performer .

@@23909335 @3909335/ <h> How you get to the finish line matters <p> In Ted Smiths latest 5 minute video Jitter and Clocks he made a quick comment that may have just passed some of you by without notice . " Jitter does n't  matter until right at the point where you convert it to analog . " Let 's examine that comment today . <p> When you download a track of music from a site like Blue Coast Records , for example , that file is fed to your from a computer in northern California , over the internet , through your homes router , into your computer in a very circuitous and torturous path indeed . Because this downloaded data does n't  have a clock tagging along there 's no chance for jitter , but once you play it out of your computer over USB or S/PDIF you add a clock and our dear friend Mr. Jitter is back . But it does n't  matter how jittered the data itself is until the very last moment . Until the moment you try and couple a clock to its data going into whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something we can hear . <p> What this means is that you can have something as a source of digital audio , like an iPod , Sonos or computer that is full of jitter . And the amount of that jitter does n't  actually matter until you try and do something about converting that data to audio . So let 's imagine the iPod has 200ps of jitter and the Sonos has 10 times that amount ( it does n't  , but were just picking on it ) . The data in the two are the same . There will be no difference in how either sounds or performs until the point you actually convert the data to analog . <p> Now , you might say " so what ? I do n't  care about anything other than how it sounds and I cant hear digital audio , so when we decode the two examples and listen , the Sonos will sound 10 times worse than the iPod . And if I use a bad cable to connect the devices to my DAC , itll be even worse . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . If you manage to resynchronize the musical data and the clock so the jitter reaching the DAC is reduced to identical amounts , then regardless of how jittered the two sources started out , they will sound the same . This has great implications if you think about it . Its the whole idea behind the original Digital Lens we created in the 1990s , and home to claims that many manufacturers make about no jitter getting into their converters . 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 15 COMMENTS <p> I would have to agree with the statement . If I use an external USB converter with you dac the cable matters . But if I do not and feed the the Pwd directly it does not matter as much or at all . Now given any cables I use for audio are of a good grade and not a 5 staples . This whole jitter concept is very complicated . And here is another thought if we use any form of DSP then are we adding jitter in the path yet again especially if it is at the last digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a wild stab at it . Youve figured out a way to create a jittered clock signal that has the same jitter amplitude and frequency but 180 degrees out of synch and apply it to a buffer register just prior to the D/A converter . so when the D/A converter is slow by 0.1 picoseconds , the shift register has sped up by exactly 0.1 picoseconds and when the D/A converter is fast by 0.1 picoseconds the shift register has slowed by 0.1 picoseconds . Net result , jitter completely cancelled . In fact it does n't  really matter what the jitter amplitude and frequency are because this circuit will always cancel it out . <p> Great idea , but no . What well cover tomorrow is how clocking the data in affects the power supply , each clock pulse triggering a current request from the power supply and thus if that data and clock we perfectly timed together ( no jitter ) then the power supply and its associated ground planes would never amplify jitter because there was no jitter . <p> Once we understand then how jitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ( because each edge transition takes current when it triggers ) , then well imagine what happens if you could design a digital system that does NOT use edge transitions to take the data in and does not even use an incoming external embedded clock at all . <p> Jitter can be , is , random , and can change with amplitude and stray voltages on the circuit board . There is no symmetrical self-cancelling accordingly . Paul , with respect to an iPod ( other than the Classic which uses spinning hard drives and is still considered the best sounding ) is it not so that the Digital Lens is the same idea ? A SS buffer ? Most iPods use SS drives AND buffers . <p> We have struggled for decades with jitter in large part because we are trying to recover an embedded clock from a source , e.g. , in S/PDIF or " classic " USB . That takes PLLs , Digital Lenses , and whatnot , And the source clock probably was n't very good to start with . Does n't  asynchronous USB at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I get that there are power supply effects regardless , which you will talk about . But at least asynchronous USB let 's you use your local clock which you can make as good as your engineering and budget allow as the master clock . <p> I have read on other forums that the psu is important regarding jitter . And it is why I posed the question regarding the P10 and P5 . Especially with multi wave . It is easy to see how everything seems connected but I do not know why . But by listening I can hear changes Al <p> Hi Paul , love reading your newsletters every day , by the way and still thinking about that loaf of football bread from a few days ago . : ) <p> Thanks for the Blue Coast mention ! We actually do n't  send the files from NorCal ( actually , its Seahawks territory they are sent from : ) <p> Clocks and clocking are REALLY important to the sound . Having been involved with digital recording since the mid 80s , hundreds of pieces of gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its the second place we look at when rolled off high end or other bad sound rears its ugliness ( the first place to look is always the cable the last place we tend to look because its the cable . LOL ) . <p> There 's not enough time in my world to understand all that you know , but I do understand when something sounds bad that did n't  in the past . I 'm all ears to hear what you have to say tomorrow . : ) <p> Observation ; in the analog domain time base oscillation which is usually referred to as wow and flutter instead of jitter exists as well . In the manufacture of most phonograph records , this happens during the recording of the master tape , its playback , the recording of the mixdown tape , its playback , the making of the master lacquer on the cutting lathe , and on the turntable its played back on . At least six different ways time based errors are introduced each one superimposed on the previous errors and each one a over a billion times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records as their gold standard for sound . And this does n't  even include stretching of the tape during recording and rewind . Any comments about that ? <p> I was blown away , my jaw droppedwhen Ted Smith made a case for digital jitter making a difference in the analog domain at the level of 0.2 picoseconds . I could hardly believe anyone would make such a claim . I did n't  believe it when I thought the case was being made for bit errors being generated causing the wrong D/A output voltage . I do n't  think most people have any concept of what 2 times ten to the minus 13th power seconds means . I compute this as the time it takes for sound to traverse 2/3 the diameter of one hydrogen atom . Mind boggling . There are countless other ways the geometry between your ears and the source of sound , and the speed of sound itself changes timing many orders of magnitude greater than this constantly . <p> I considered becoming a physicist myself but preferred engineering .

PS Audios high level of activity and communication with the users in this forum makes it hard to not like the company and its products . <p> This is something that other companies would do well to learn . I have one in mind that makes excellent sounding products but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it has been over the last few years . I have one of their better DACs and is sounds great easily besting the NuWave DAC . I have been an active contributor on their forum and a strong supporter of the company , even in tye face of long delays in product delivery and lousy communication that has soured many who are still awaiting delivery of their products . Alas , while I still love the DAC and am patiently waiting delivery of their digital music server and portable digital audio players that I backed in their indiegogo campaigns ( two years ago ) , I too am becoming disillusioned with the company . I still believe that the owner and lead designer is an honest and good hearted man , but the company that he has built has suffered badly from their aggressive marketing and poor communication . In recent months the communication has gotten better , as the owner / head designer has taken over communication and his voice seems to bear far more trust than anyone else in the company , particularly their ( ex ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is an indicator of the power that poor or excellent communication can have with the user base . I am happy that PS Audio can serve as such an excellent example in this respect . Thank you Paul for being a great leader and smart businessman . <p> J.P . <p> The following users say thank you to wingsounds13 for this useful post : <p> Thanks guys your words mean a lot to us . I imagine Wingsounds13 must be referring to Light Harmonics ? They are certainly nice enoughb people that I have met at shows and they seem sincere enough in their desire to make good stuff . <p> We 've just always believed in our customers and put them first , before anything else . This has been both good and bad for the company , but its a policy that 's so deeply ingrained in the companys fabric its just the way itll continue to be . Though , I think perhaps Ted and I may be the only two people in the company that answer emails 7 days a week. - <p> Your words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BHK , everyone . This culture of communication with the customer is potent and is a powerful tool to strengthen the bond between the customers and the company . Simply witness the posts of a number of disgruntled customers in this forum and their rapid change of attitude when they get a quick response from the president of the company , engineers and/or designer of the product . This change is priceless in that it diffuses a bad situation along with the likely negative word of mouth and even the possibility of a return customer from one who otherwise probably never again buy a product from PS Audio . <p> Sorry Paul , it is not Light Harmonics rather their down market brand of LH Labs . : - ) Larry certainly does seem to be an earnest and honest man with a passion for giving his customers the best sounding equipment that he possibly can . This dedication to quality has been a double edged sword for them . Larrys desire for perfection is admirable but has also been a contributor to significant product delivery delays . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what they do deliver ( with the exception of their Verb IEMs ) will sound fantastic . Certainly the Pulse X infinity that I have sounds great . I wish them luck and a long ( corporate ) life . <p> Paul McGowan said Weve just always believed in our customers and put them first , before anything else . This has been both good and bad for the company , but its a policy that 's so deeply ingrained in the companys fabric its just the way itll continue to be . <p> Interesting comment. - I 'm not sure in what ways PSAs corporate culture could be bad for the company , but I 'll take Pauls word that it has occasionally been so. - But long-term it could be nothing but good for reasons that wingsounds13 expressed very well. - <p> I had heard of PSA for many years before buying a PWD + Bridge a few years ago. - I was pleased with the sound , of course , but even more impressed by what I saw in this forum. - Ive upgraded to a DirectStream and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 as my next major purchase. - I 've had experience with companies whose products sound good but who are n't  there for the customers when needed. - So call me a convert to PSA . <p> Our companys always been an odd mix of- traditional models of customer/dealer relations . Most companies tend to put their dealers first because they are the ones dealing directly with the customers and they are the ones the company sells their goods to . Have a problem ? Go see your dealer you bought it from him . That has never been our model that attitude has never made sense and its at times gotten us in hot water with dealers and yes , affected the bottom line in both good and bad ways . <p> Mostly good for long term growth , not so good- for short term gains . <p> From the day Stan and I started this company ( back in prehistoric times ) we were always customer centric . Dealers were an adjunct that helped us reach customers . While we love our dealers , ( most of them anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at maintaining a link between us and the customers often times pissing off a few- dealers in the process . And certainly a few customers too . <p> We watched over the years as many dealer-centric companies shot past us economically , while we muddled along , remaining loyal to our customer-centric model . With few exceptions each of those shooting star companies came and went , like bright embers popping out of a fire , to slowly burn out and turn to lumps of charcoal , or pale shadows of what they once represented " while we slowly grew . <p> I cant say our model is superior but I can say that I , and every one of the 32 people that make up our family owned company , sleep better at night knowing who we serve . <p> Dealers and customers come and go . I 'd sooner have our conversations with , and pour our resources and hearts into , end users and the products that make their lives better . <p> Its just in our DNA . <p> The following users say thank you to Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , it is not Light Harmonics rather their down market brand of LH Labs . : - ) Larry certainly does seem to be an earnest and honest man with a passion for giving his customers the best sounding equipment that he possibly can . This dedication to quality has been a double edged sword for them . Larrys desire for perfection is admirable but has also been a contributor to significant product delivery delays .

I wish them luck and a long ( corporate ) life . <p> J.P . <p> JP , I think the one major mistake Larry makes is that , being a typical engineer , always looks for ways of making things " better " and , unlike Paul , rapidly loses focus when concentrating on too many different products at the same time . It takes dedication to pay attention to only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning income before moving on to the next product. - You can have 50 great products " in the pipeline " but if none is ready to sell your cash flow suffers quite a lot . And that 's where LHL is at right now. - <p> The good thing is that they are very conscientious , so I do n't  know if you got the email for the Verb IEMs that were going to be replaced with an entirely new model after the Verb production units did not meet their original design spec and the manufacturer sold the technology to other companies. - So those of us who backed the original will get the replacement design for only the cost of shipping . But it was a distraction that delayed development of the portable player that was supposed to outshine Pono but has been delayed a couple of years . <p> But I learned after the Indiegogo campaign for the portable palyer that I should n't spend another dime on any LHL product through a crowdfunding campaign until their order list from previous campaigns has been actually delivered . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about doing that for a PS product whatsoever . <p> Agreed . Larry may have a great ear and design chops , but he is not ( yet ) a good project manager . While I might buy more products from LH Labs , I too will take a more reserved approach with them . On the other hand , when I have the funds I will be happy to buy more from PS Audio . I see a DS DAC in my future , unless its replacement is out by then : - ) <p> Paul McGowan said We watched over the years as many dealer-centric companies shot past us economically , while we muddled along , remaining loyal to our customer-centric model .

( That and they did sour on a PS experience 20 years ago and never got over it. - Their loss. ) - Yes the try-it-for-30-days is an alternative , but I liked the ability to go to the dealer , take several samples home , and pick the ones I wanted . <p> PJ said Thanks guys , amazing to get responses from , among others the Director of Engineering of PS Audio ! - I love this company . <p> PJ , <p> - <p> I am not home to check this for sure , but I think that BubbleUPNP Server works with Spotify. - I have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app to control with the DSJ connected via ethernet . - Simple to setup and there is an OS X version .

And there you have the justification for the high prices . <p> The great brands compete against each other that drives them onward and upward to create more advanced products . The new and amazing complications are attractive to the worlds customers , obviously , for they buy these products for themselves and as gifts for their spouses and children . These products are heirlooms , treasured by current and future generations , providing lasting value and enjoyment .

By the time its a second or two off it will be time to change to daylight savings time or back again anyway . When the battery dies in a few years you can chuck it and get a new one if you 're tired of it or just buy a 377 watch battery from Parts Express for 68 cents . <p> LOL , you+GGre absolutely right about the daylight savings . My Casio is a few seconds off when I have to readjust it . <p> And your table radio is also a high end system right ? And your Hyundai a race car , right ? <p> I just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ago , the man is a watch collector who sold me a used Rolex about 1999 for $1200 . I sold that same watch last year for $26,000 for which I purchased four Girard-Perregaux WW-Tcs for resale at $6200 each . Streeet value $15,000 each . I sold three for $11,000 within a couple of weeks on Amazon and kept the fourth for myself , I 'm wearing it . Just a bunch of mechanical junk for museums , eh ? <p> Now you guys can go back to your table radios to listen to Mozart and your Boses for the real thing . <p> Soundminded , early in life I was taught that a good business deal is where both parties are satisfied to the transaction . In all transactions I had ever made in life , to the best of my knowledge all parties were satisfied . Do you have an issue with that ? <p> Are you one who would stand on your soapbox in front of a high end audio store with a picket sign stating JUNK , JUNK , DO NT BUY IT YOU FOOLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer who spends the gelt for such goods is a fool ; most of whom happen to be highly successful people ? Do you think highly successful people got to where they are because they are fools ? <p> Youve stated more times than I can count that you had stopped being an audiophile decades ago , yet you are here harassing other audiophiles who are serious about high end audio , many others high end watches , high end autos and high end foodstuffs . <p> If you do n't  like somebody , fine , send him an email , with a piece of your mind , or whatever else you wish to send . <p> I know you think other people are fools , but let me clue you in : Its not so . <p> First of all Andrew , I did not invent the term " greater fool theory " and proved it by citing it in Wikipedia . Its used to describe bubble markets when the strategy is n't to buy low or sell high but to buy high and sell even higher . Such markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate and in many places around the world . In these markets there is a huge disconnect between what markets pay for things and their intrinsic worth . I just brought it up because you were boasting about a lot of expensive wrist watches you own . That 's why I sold my wine collection . If someone thinks a bottle of wine is worth five to ten times or more what I paid for it , good-bye wine . I wont tell you exactly what it was all worth but it was nearly six figures . <p> I do not begrudge anyone spending their money on whatever they want to buy . Its their money not mine . But I can tell you not one cent of the money I got for my wine went to buy audio equipment . OTOH , when discussing technology , there may be times when I question the intrinsic value of products and classes of products . I have to do that for a living as an engineer . My clients not only expect results they want , they expect their money be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You also brought up the subject of how no one wants old technology dismissing audio equipment of the 1960s and 1970s a junk . I simply reminded you that you wrote an entire posting , I think about your second or third one here lauding a much older technology that has without doubt been far surpassed by much better lower cost technology . Soon I may be looking into a Droid watch although I do n't  like wearing any kind of jewelry on my body including a bracelet . I cant resist the urge to hoist anyone including you on their own petard , that is with your own words . <p> The bubble theory neither applies to timepieces nor to my activities , as I do n't  own a collection of wristwatches . Unless you consider two a collection . Moreover , many audio designs are considered junk that were hoisted by their own petards , the Bose 901 being just one example . I had never raised the Bose issue in the first place it was soooo dead decades ago . <p> However , I have no objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table or car radios . I will to the latter two . I just do n't  consider these references or worthy of discussion on a website dedicated to audio advancements in 2014 . As to the ongoing arguments about a number of issues raised here , that 's what audiophiles do amongst themselves to improve the gene pool , so to speak . <p> However Soundminded , you had made it clear to us long ago that you are no audiophile and hinted so to speak : you 'd be ashamed to be called one . <p> Not I. <p> On that note , and with respect to the ongoings here on Pauls Posts , I strongly recommend a reading of Art Dudleys editorial in the latest Stereophile specifically dealing with how people on the net or on blogs inter-relate ( I would call it a dysfunctional marriage . ) <p> I am as guilty as the rest just because I enjoy a good debate , especially one I can easily win . However , none of it should be at the expense of others reading Pauls Posts , who were drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the issues Soundminded , Acuvox or Andrew Benjamin might raise . <p> First , try not to separate the world into " you guys " and " the good guys " . You have no idea who I am and what kind of system I own . I wont even tell you and let you believe I own a Bose . Its too damn funny . <p> You posted a rant about your expensive watch , although no-one really cares and it has nothing to do with the topic . A high-end audio system must sound good , and maybe look good too . In a high end system , most of the R&amp;D cost dosnt go into a good-loking case ( although with the snobbery nowadays I would n't wonder if many times that 's not the case ) . If one owns a high-end system for the *same* reason people own expensive watches , I pity the guy . What 's not to pity ? He affords good gear but cant truly appreciate it . He has no idea that the thing is built to sound good before anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproving you own point and the sight of reason being turned off by ego is depressing . <p> B77 , I mean no disrespect . Soundminded started the attacks on watches , not I. In fact timing , on which the original rant was about , has a great deal to do with digital audio . How about EVERYTHING ? <p> Regarding your comparisons about high priced watches and audio , I deeply disagree whether or not you pity such people Neil . People own high priced anything for a number of reasons and many are good reasons , including some wanting to show off ; others just enjoy the " look " of quality anything ; and others just enjoy OWNING the high priced spread . Who are we to set values , why anyone should own anything ? I can , only speaking for myself . Besides , we all know that people buy something sexy looking just because it is . <p> I also agree that subjects generally outside of the efforts Paul poured into this site should have minimal comment .

It would make sense to hire a pro driver now and then to show me what the car is truly capable of while I 'm in the passengers seat . Same with high end audio , if you 're buying it for the social status it provides , good for you . But I simply cant put the guy doing it into the category where some other guy who buys it for the sound belongs . Just as I cant see the watch collector the same way I see the high end audio buyer .

New technologies include DS DACs , digital amplifiers and new complications in timepieces never attempted before . The reason is the aforementioned : there 's interest in these products worldwide , and there 's no interested in your amateurish DIY projects here that are more appropriate for DIY websites . <p> Wristwatches really have nothing to do with audio except for analogies to timing in digital , clearly explained earlier but you were offended by the explanation having not explained it better yourself . <p> No one here is interested in amateurish attempts at fixing half century old old AR speakers or reconfiguring half century old BOSE speakers but you .

But you never get it . For you what is really important is to elevate your nonsense at the expense of letting us get on with the business at hand , dominating these conversations with your redundant BS , and pushing your nonsensical 40 year-old " invention " no one here is interested in one iota . I mean , NADA . <p> That 's what they said about real estate 10 years ago and dot com stocks fifteen years ago .

I find expert opinions on stocks and the stock market to be a reliable negative indicator . When they say buy , its usually time to sell . <p> You do n't  like old audio technology of the past ? What about 30 year old Infinity IRS V ? is that in the same category ? Before you say no , consider that Arnie Nudell has come out with two subsequent versions each at much higher cost and undoubtedly each time he would have told you each was a significant improvement over the previous version . That 's also what they always say . Sooner or later even I stop believing it . <p> Speaking about believing , Wilson claims he buys drivers and reworks them himself . Looking at many speakers including his such as Alexandria II you can spot what drivers are in it . For example the 13 ? and 11 ? woofers come from Focal as I recall . Why would someone rework drivers himself when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he wants them directly from the manufacturer with a exclusivity clause in his contract so that no one else can buy them ( that 's the stinkeroo deal Lincoln made with Sylvania about the ridiculous headlights in my car . ) So do you believe Wilson has a " secret formula " a whammy he puts on Focal drivers ? I find it highly implausible having worked in many manufacturing plants in many industries . That 's not generally how things are done . On my first job I was told , never build what you can buy . <p> No bubbles Soundminded . Rarity , as in art , that someone paid 2300% profit for . I made out and that 's how it is . Where I live real estate was not impacted an iota during the downturn . 99% of the rest of the nation got hit . <p> I do n't  take advice from stock gurus , I 'm a pro trader and real estate professional . Stock gurus and real estate gurus take advice from me that 's just how it is . <p> My reference to old technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Specifically the sixties , as the eighties beget new thinking and new technologies that put to rest the old thinking . <p> I cant speak for Nudell , and neither can you . I can speak to history which , if you read for example Robert Harleys latest books on the history of high end audio , pretty much would agree that Nudells work was always decades ahead of his time , vide the Servo-Static in the 60s , as well as the IRS of the late eighties , the manufacture of which became just too expensive . To compare the Bose 901s for example to the IRS is like comparing the Wrights Bros. biplane to an F-22 stealthfighter . <p> Nudell began seminal work on materials science as well as geometric design science , bringing advanced ideas into the audio realm . To prove that there was no bubble then , and no bubble now , todays much less costly-to-produce speakers are fetching record prices while record competition new companies exists side by side with the high prices . Bubbles in the economic realm are not caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As for you having stopped believing Nudell , that was your problem . Knowing better , I never stopped believing him , as past performance is indeed , indicative of future results or a foundation upon which the new is built . Sure , there are new , innovative designers on Nudells heels . So what ? What they have learned came from Nudells mind . <p> I have no idea what Wilson does to common Focal drivers . Wilson wrote for the same publication I have , I respect him greatly , I have no doubt about his integrity . He makes very expensive speakers for wealthy people who are willing to pay for the ultra-high end . What else can I add to it except to observe that since I 've known Dave Wilson from the early eighties , there have been no bubbles in his field of work , and that he has met the needs of his customers , none of whom to the best of my knowledge feel ripped off or are complaining . <p> I do n't  see that Arnie Nudell innovated anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor . There is nothing new about acoustic suspension woofers . There was nothing new about electrostatic speakers . There is nothing new about line sources . There was nothing new about ribbon tweeters including dipoles . IMO he merely combined and tweaked already existing concepts and that 's what he still does . Where is the innovation ? How much tweaking of a 40 year old concept are people going to pay for ? I think some people will pay just about anything . Same goes for prestige antiquated wristwatches whether manufactured in the 1930s or hot off the line yesterday . 
@@23909345 @3909345/ <h> Nothing is best <p> I 'm not sure how this thread morphed into a How I built this- about volume controls but things have a tendency to just drift in a certain direction . But , I ramble on . <p> In yesterdays post , I told the story of boiling the innards of a volume control down to nothing more than a single high-quality resistor . It was the best wed heard but it still had a signature that was n't appreciated . How could it get better than a single , simple , component ? By eliminating even that one device . <p> Preamplifiers are impractical designs . They consist of three things : input switches , volume control , output amplifier . With the volume control turned on high so no attenuation happens , preamps put out far more signal than needed to clip an amplifier . Which means volume control always attenuate " reduce signal level " to match the gain of the output amplifier . Seems rather counter-intuitive . We are forced to throw away signal to compensate for the amplifiers gain . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why suffer the added distortion of a volume control when it could be eliminated entirely by changing the output stage gain . Thus , a variable gain preamplifier is reduced from the tradition of three parts to two : input switching , variable gain output stage . <p> The first iteration of this technology we called the Gain Cell , which appeared nearly a decade ago in the GC Series . Today , its what is also inside the Stellar Gain Cell DAC/Preamp . But , we did n't  stop there . Bascom H. King- ( BHK ) realized the same thing . Volume controls are the Achilles- heel of preamplifiers and , using entirely different techniques , he too varies the vacuum tube gain of the BHK Signature preamplifier in place of a traditional volume control . <p> Both preamp offerings of the company are based upon the perfect volume control . No volume control . <p> And that is how you make a better volume control . <p> Nothing is best . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 20 COMMENTS <p> A bold final statement , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stereo system I was convinced that the solution used in the DS-DAC was even better . However this might be valid for digital sources only ? Why not designing a power amp with digital inputs only having a bit-perfect digital connection to any digital source ? For vinyl aficionados a PS Audio GCPH MK II could be added offering a fine AD-converter and a near perfect RIAA equalisation ( for different record label specific schemes ) and near perfect subsonic filter on a digital base ? ? ? Oh , I forgot , you are not a vinyl lover . What a pity . <p> If you are a vinyl lover , and it is your main source , the last thing most of us would want is to digitize a pure analog chain . I very much doubt it would be a big seller . The current phono preamp has an ADC , and I2S that can be run into the Directstream . So you would just be doing the analog conversion before the amp . I believe some do that , but it has n't  turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aeris , and the only thing I have found hard to accept is the AD/DA crossover that includes room correction , and equalization . Everyone who owns them and all the reviews are positive , so I 've come to accept that it works . Us older guys , and for all I know you may be one too , just more advanced than many of us that still are wary of added conversions . But I wonder if Ted has ever tried building an ADC using FPGAs ? That might be a real advance in ADCs . <p> Indeed , it is always a matter of optima the signal pass characterized by inherently added degradations of the original signal ( coloration , distortions ) . But if today in most cases the analog original is already recorded in a digital Format I assume that AD-conversion is near perfect today . Thus why not using all advantagages of digital signal processing having today most powerful processors ( compared to the processor performance 30 years ago ) and keeping the path pure digital to the power amp input ? I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacitors , transformers or analog amp circuits as in digital signal processing . <p> Exactly . In the end , we need an analog based volume control solution so vinyl can be accommodated . That 's why we designed Stellar to be analog based , as well as BHK . If no one was interested in vinyl the story would be quite different . <p> Choice , the BK preamp has more then one stage , this in itself removes a bit of sonic purity Vs a single endedpreamp , or Direct Heated Triode which has only one stage , And on top models No capacitors in the output signal path , just the output transformers . You just need to choose a tube that is very linear and a true DHT tube , the big300b tube is a DHT used mainly for a amplifier output tube for example , the 45 tube is a great low power tube to use . I myself use what was a German tube , that the Russians improved upon the 4P1L Vacuum tube , considered by many possibly the most Linear tube and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side regarding sensitivities to cabinet isolation . Which can be down with proper care . One thing very over looked is the tube sockets Gold over High purity Copper , or Phosphur Bronze are the only ones I use brass is vastly inferior and you can without question hear the resolution differences.most others are all Vacuum tube preamps Indirect heated triode such as 6sn7,6922,12ax7 , 12au7 . Direct Heated Triode , as in amplifiers are by far the most accurate for pulling information from the record , or disc . I am speaking of only from my experiences with preamplifier up to $15k I am fortunate to have a friend that just builds single ended Vacuum tube amplifiers , most people do n't  want to go through all the decisions . this PS audio BK design is a very good one though . And preamplifier . <p> We had this discussion in an earlier thread . I disagree . I owned a Placette Remote Volume Control that was literally nothing . Im convinced no one will ever make anything more " nothing " than that . The lack of distortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musicality , etc . The result was purely uninteresting . Its counter intuitive , but there is something to an active preamp that is additive to the music reproduction process , distortion and all . What I learned from that exercise is that distortion is not always a bad thing , and total removal comes at a cost . The analog volume control in my preamp may add some distortion , but I will no longer discount that the distortion it creates adds to the overall sonic presentation . <p> I never found my Placette to lack musicality , only drive . It always transmitted whatever musical properties were produced by the source component . But I do agree that a good active preamp adds something to the process , more like body , but not distortion to my ears . <p> In my Msb dac there is two ways they claim in improving the output One is on my model a single gain stage is used on the new select 2 there is no gain stage . Its inside and done on the da converter chips . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how there product is improved over the past model . And ps audio is no different <p> Its a thin line to walk to claim improvment but not trash the past . Paul being more honest than most in this . On my Cust gg head dac by lampi I can roll Many tubes and add or bypass the driver as it does lower the gain and difrent tubes do have varying gains Its not a vol control . What lampi does I have no idea but it does not seem to effect the sound at lower levels and nor does my Msb as it goes from passive to active passing 0 DB . I think anyone making a device at this point should have a minimal effect on sound . As for stages and purity I think the end result is what we hear and while measurements are important its always what we hear . If I measured my lampi and compared it to my Msb or even the ds dac I 'll bet being tubes it would measure worse but its sound is better in my system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some reality added to this post something that less than Suoer human ears can hear as well .

Not a weekend for audio or LONG ... <p> Paul , I may continue to buck the current trend but I do n't  consider you are talking about preamplifiers . Instead they are line stages . <p> Prior to the mid-80s with the advent of digital players , almost every control device ( preamplifier ) included a phono stage . They also contained input switching , output controls ( balance , bass and treble , filters , tape selector , etc. ) , and gain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital players ( CDs ) and the abandonment of phono systems by a growing number of hobbyists , many of those features were eliminated and the replacement components were commonly called line stages . <p> This still creates some level of confusion but for us " old timers " the term preamplifier suggests a component with far more functions than is commonly available today . <p> Please make a small compact Gain Cell preamp for desktop use ? The Gain Cell preamp now being offered is way too big for my desktop use . Desktop use does not usually require lots of inputs . Small ( external power supply to keep it small ? ) <p> Variable gain by nature requires something being introduced or removed from the amplifying chain to attenuate the signal or increase it and this would certainly introduce a change in sound . So the point is whether it is better than a volume control . Regards . <p> When done properly , a variable gain solution does a lot more than just eliminate the intrinsic sound of a given analog attenuator . <p> For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume setting , and perhaps more importantly , the signal to noise ratio remains constant . With a fixed gain product the noise level is constant , but as the input is attenuated the ratio decreases . With variable gain the noise level decreases at the same rate as the signal keeping the S/N ratio intact . <p> Well I hate to be the one to break it to you but every gain stage in the entire chain has the signal go through a resistor , that is unless you have learned how to bias transistors and vacuum tubes without them . The path the signal appears to travel from the output of one stage to another is not the actual signal path . The real path travels from the power supply through a resistor through the transistor or tube and into the load which is the input of the next stage or speaker . The volume control on most circuits only adjusts the gain between stages at one point . <p> Another problem is that in the recording process , there are a lot of volume controls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . <p> The Gain Cell is a variable gain analog amplifier while the DS and Jr . are digital volume controls . Very different . A digital volume control actually changes the bits to reduce volume . The way Ted does this is very clever in that it does not change sound characteristics . I wish I understood that process better . <p> The Gain Cell obviates the need for a volume pot because instead of a variable resistor shunting music to ground into a fixed amplifier , the amplifier itself changes its gain .

Specifically , I 'm reading- that it " decodes " only up to 192/32 and single-rate DSD , while the DS DAC itself seems to have a much broader list of input signals it can handle . When I use the Bridge IIs ethernet input is the Bridge doing the D/A conversion rather than the FPGA ? <p> I do n't  think I realized this when I initially shelled out the money for the Bridge II .

The Bridge II is just an interface that accepts UPnP data over your home network , converts it to I2S digital data- ( just like the other inputs do ) and sends it to the FPGA . The FPGA ca n't tell which input it is receiving data from. - The 192/24 and DSD64 limitations I believe were said to be UPnP limits but I could be wrong ( or , at least as likely , oversimplifying ) . I believe only the I2S inputs and USB can handle anything higher than 192/24 . <p> Thanks guys for all the great information . 2xDSD is no big deal as I only have one title in that format . Ill just have to set up RoonServer to deliver the right resolution when using the BII. - I 'm a little embarrassed , as I just looked at my music database and realized I have only 1 PCM album that is higher than 192/24 !

@@23909354 @3909354/ <p> Headphones with high impedance often- benefit from an amp . This is what I usually read/hear . So can I say that Nuwave alone could do a good job , given headphones with high impedance , and with an amp it will even be better ? Or its not ? <p> The need that high impedance headphones have for an amp comes from the fact that high impedance headphones require higher voltage drive to achieve high playback levels . High impedance headphones can be connected to the output of a medium power speaker amp without immediately being turned into smoke and ashes . They are also suitable for use with tube amps , particularly Output TransformerLess , which easily produce high output voltage but have limited current capacity . <p> Low impedance headphones will draw higher power from a lower drive voltage . This makes them suitable for use with battery powered portable equipment that has limited voltage available . The downside is that low impedance headphones require higher current drive at these lower voltages in order to have the power needed to produce adequate sound levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven from an amp , just that the optimal parameters of the amps output are different : <p> High impedance headphones need an amp with higher output voltage but do not need high current capacity . Low impedance headphones need an amp with lower output voltage and high current capacity . <p> In all of our cases of power delivery the output impedance of the source should be significantly lower than the impedance of the load . With high impedance headphones this is easy , and the output impedance of most line level source equipment being typically 50100 ohms is comfortably able to drive headphones with an impedance of 300 ohms or more . This output impedance not only controls the amount of power that it can deliver , but also the ability of the amp to control the drivers . If the output impedance is not significantly lower than the headphone driver impedance then the sound is likely to be unclear and/or flabby . <p> Some ( many ? ) headphone amps try to meet all requirements by providing high enough voltage output for high impedance headphones and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compromise , and rarely works extremely well for all types . <p> Thank you for the super helpful information which I am digesting with recall of my high school physics . <p> I think I have just one more question . Nuwave DAC features a high current output stage . So how about the voltage ? How can I know if it outputs- the voltage- required to drive headphones with high impedance ? <p> The balanced output should be about 4V which is enough to drive something like a Sennheiser HD-600 or similar to reasonable levels , but not " loud " . The downside is that while the design includes a High current class A hybrid output stage , the output impedance is something like 100 ohms as I understand it , they put a resistor in series with the output to protect the output buffer from a shorted output . The 300 ohm impedance of many Sennheiser headphones is a reasonable load for this , but on the limits .

Running standard 24/192 PCM into an MQA DAC would n't improve the sound in any way that I can see , as there would be no MQA data encoded in the PCM for the MQA DAC to decode . <p> I would think that if you convert PCM to analog , and then analog to digital ( MQA encoded ) and then MQA digital back to analog the final analog can never sound better than the original PCM to analog conversion , because that analog is the source and the only information available to the MQA encoding .

I think the biggest problem is two-folded . <p> 1 ) People do n't  understand the basics of how this operates , IMO . Firstly , if the Aries does not see the renderer ( DAC ) because the DAC is not connected via USB or the renderer is powered down there will be no USB driver to discover , would there ? So the fact that the Aries does not see the DS is perfectly normal if things are not done correctly and in sequence . In this case the problems are easily confused with malfunctioning or unstable operation . <p> Note that what I am saying here does n't  necessary cover your problem , but it has certainly been the case with others . <p> 2 ) The fact that the Aries USB output channel only shows in the LDS after discovery is confusing . There should be a static field saying USB ( with the driver field left empty ) so owners understand that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Auralic online manual . <p> Thanks to Frode post 14 : After a night of complete shutdown and reboot of my DS and Aries , The USB connection was reconigized in the lighting app . I checked the USB 2 connection and am now up and running . Apologize for my previous rant re serious issues with DS and Aries USB connection . I 'm a 67 year old newbie to this hobby and once in awhile experience frustration like back in the day with early PC windows . This Forum has been very insightful in increasing my knowledge and interest in the hobby . <p> dcuscela , you wo n't believe how many of the so called Highend cable manufacturers that do not comply with the USB standard . A low cost stock cable is the one to try when you run into these problems . They normally comply with the USB standard and as do the DS DAC. 
@@23909360 @3909360/ <p> I have noticed that issue also with the bridge when you have Jriver set to shuffle and you try to use bubblepnp or something besides gizmo or Jremote for pushing to the dacit also happens with my Krell Connect and Oppo 105d if I try to pull to them but if I push from Jriver it works fine so I 'm thinking its a Jriver Issue- <p> Using the same JRiver configuration and the same Ethernet cable , switch port , and switch I set up another network DAC in place of the DirectStream DAC . <p> I selected the same CD and added it to Playing Now for the other DAC and all the tracks played through from 1 through 12 without any problems . <p> This makes me believe my NAS and network are OK and I have a problem with the Network Bridge . I started a new thread with the details of what I did today in my test called " DirectStream DAC with Network Bridge does not playback continuously " . <p> I have the same experience with my Qnap server. - Also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database back in the Mac . The Macbook doesnot give me any problem. - I am also looking- for a solution . Do n't  know if its a Jriver only problem . <p> I 'm not running Jriver on my qnap . TS253-pro . That is not possible ( Linux ) Macbook has Jriver and Qnap the database . Which is now also on my Macbook . ( The music files with covers ) Macbook plays without any problem all the songs throught the bridge into the Directstream. - Album cover and song that is playing is shown when playing . But I had the intension to put all my music in the Qnap server and play it by Jriver on my Macbook . Maybe bridge 2 will sort it out , or a new software update by Jriver . Time will tell . <p> Dennis Kerrisk said What Server are you running on the Qnap ? Is the the built in qNap server ? If it is try it with minimserver , which install on most qnap Nass . <p> Dennis <p> Hi Dennis , <p> I am running MinimServer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenovo laptop . All devices are connected to the same 1GB Ethernet switch with CAT5E Ethernet cables . <p> I seem to have stumbled upon a not so elegant work around : fully power off the DAC from the rear panel switch wait a minute power on the DAC after it is ready but before playing any files - - - - use a web browser to access the Network Bridge web page - - - - - - - - - perform a Reset UPnP Server from the Network Bridge web page <p> I can then play my music files without sudden stops but I still experience the occasional glitch where the music seems to skip and the Album Art display is very erratic sometimes it is there but many times it is not . <p> I just moved my JRiver 21 library to a QNap TS-251 NAS . I 'm running a Direct Stream with a Bridge II . I am having the " one song only " issue as well when trying to stream using JRiver on my PC ( via JRemote on an iTouch ) from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamer and the built in streamer , both with the same result . I tried setting up the JRiver with DLNA on the QNap release . The problem with the QNap version of JRiver is that it does n't  want to run unless there is a monitor or TV connected to the HDMI out on the NAS and the HybridDesk Station is running on the NAS . I would rather watch sports and listen to music than watch a Jriver interface so I 'm not really impressed with the implementation on the QNap . It is supposed to run without the monitor ( headless ) after it is configured but I cant get it to work . I also downloaded QRemote for Android to remotely control HybridDesk Station on the NAS and guess what it does n't  work either . If I go back to my PC and reload the library on the PC everything works fine . Using the reset UPnp does n't  appear to apply to the Bridge II as I have never been able to connect to the IP address of the Bridge II . <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based streaming and I thought that I would give it a try . I certainly agree with Pauls assessments of control point software . <p> I like JRiver and I love the sound of the DSD/BridgeII combo . I just wanted to minimize the effect of all of the other processes interfering with PC based streaming . <p> I 'm not sure as I have n't used a NAS in ages but if you are streaming from the PC using JRMC- you should n't need the server software on the NAS at all. - You should be able to select the folder on the NAS as the library in JRMC ( i.e. , the folder which it monitors and from which it auto-imports ) , just like a folder on a USB or internal- hard drive . Have you tried that ? <p> No , the OP does n't  need JRiver on the QNAP ; but using it on the computer negates some of the ( potential ) benefits of having a NAS. - I think that JRiver running on a NAS is a recent development and it sounds like they still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPs experience makes it clear that the problem is not with the server , since all three have the same problem. - A few other people have reported the same failure to advance tracks. - Have the tech guys at PSA figured out what these situations have in common ? - Some interaction between the users network and the Bridge ? - I also vaguely remember reading about a setting in JRiver , something like " UPnP next transport event " but it was a long time ago and I 'm not a JRiver guy. - Hopefully someone else can help . <p> lesmcl , there is no web page for B2 ( as there was for B1 ) , which is why you ca n't connect. - B2 has more reliable connectivity than B1 and PSA did n't  feel this feature was necessary . <p> I was responding to lesmcis statement that he still- has the " one song only " problem when streaming from his PC with JRMC21 from a library on his NAS . The point is in any configuration you only need to run one server . JRMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another DLNA server on the network but there is no need to do so if you can access the files directly , which he can in this case . <p> I believe the " UPnP next transport event " is one of the two- features recommended to turn off when having problems with songs skipping part way through . I think you access- both settings- by right-clicking the Bridge in the list on the left of the JRMC screen . Those settings are worth playing with to see if turning them off ( or on , if they are now off ) helps . <p> Thanks for the input . To clarify , I am trying a number of separate scenarios all with varying results , namely : <p> attempting to use JRemote to control JRiver on the PC and just loading the library from the NAS , result is one song only , <p> attempting to use JRemote to control the QNap implementation of JRiver built into the NAS , result is one song only while HybridDesk Station is running on the NAS and then no connection when trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JRiver on the NAS ) , ( FYI You need a display using HDMI to see the HybridDesk Station interface that exposes JRiver on the NAS to configure the JRiver DNLA and after configuration it should run " headless " without needing a display ) <p> attempting to use the QNap implementation of JRiver built into the NAS , running headless ( no HDMI but DNLA configured in JRiver on the NAS ) and using QRemote to control HybridDesk Station ( semi-headless just made up that expression ) , result is no connection . <p> attempting to use the QNap implementation of minimserver on the NAS which exposes the Nas library through the minimserver DLNA implementation to JRiver on the PC , result one song only <p> I am aware of the " Stop after each item " option in JRiver and it is set to " Repeat Off " . <p> My preference or goal is to use the QNap implementation of JRiver built into the NAS in headless mode using Jremote ( not to be confused with QRemote on my android device ) on my iTouch as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NAS would be plan B. In other words , ditch the computer . <p> The commonality in all of the above referenced scenarios is that if I can get anything out of the NAS it is one song only . <p> I 'm stumped . I 'm not a NAS guy but the fact that everything works when run from the PC and none of the servers work when the library is on the NAS ( even with JRMC on the PC ) would seem to point to the NAS but I have no idea what the problem would be . Since you have the same problem with all three types of server software ( and JRMC works when everything is on the PC ) it does n't  seem to be a simple server configuration issue ( it could be different issues with the various servers causing the same problem- but that seems unlikely ) . Have you tried the QNAP or JRiver boards ? <p> Since I use a powerful QNAP NAS- instead of the WD Mycloud I have no skips anymore . The MyCloud was so low in processor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various music file update tasks , I guess it even destroyed some files that were unreadable afterwards . Its lightning fast now , I get 110MB/s ( not Mbit/s ! ) - Transfer Speed when copying files and I 'm really happy now to be able to listen tracks continuously . <p> I read above that- - lesmcl and also chip , althought also having a fast NAS , still have the skipping problemsthen I guess there must be a problem with network loadId wonder if skipping occurs while you have a fast transfer rate . Or the difference is , that I use Jriver on a PC currrently . But I also did this with the WD NAS and had the skipping I now do n't  have anymore . <p> Unfortunately we still have no clear explanation for the cause of the- problems . <p> Hobby musician , music lover , long time audiophile , jazz- , vinyl- , and tube nut ( but not dogmatic ) , now also CD/Hires/DSD nut . I use the Directstream DAC on Huron with Bridge II , a galvanic isolation device for LAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NAS drive QNAP TS253pro with 2 x 4GB WD red pro drives and Jriver for QNAP on the NAS with an *. aif/*.dsf library behind . I also use a power line separated from the rest of the house supply and from network components , a few active HF field protectors , a molecular reformatted complete signal chain as well as very sophisticated cabling throughout . <p> lesmcl did you ever get the issue sorted out ? It has been a month since you posted . My QNAP is n't compatible with the JR NAS version but would entertain getting a different one once the bugs are worked out and verdict is in on sound quality . Right now I just stream the NAS library through my Mac . <p> By this time I 'm sure you have done this already , but after I make various and sundry changes to my library , I will also experience the one song only issue . I quit MC21 and restart and everything works perfectly again until I mess around with it . As members here have pointed out to me , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running smoothly . I 'm not sure how or if that applies to the native NAS versioin but you never know .

I may well have just gotten lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty quickly with very little knowledge ( or skill ) . - I do n't  really care what it looks like ( which is where a lot of the complexity comes in , I thin ) so I just picked a basic skin , downloaded and installed the two components that start with " UPnP " ( one is the UPnP server and the other is the foo.out.upnp component JP mentioned ) and also the monkeymote component . I fooled around with a few settings without much luck until I realized that I ( duh ) needed to go into preferences/output and select the PWD ( even my DS still thinks its a PWD for this purpose ) and 24 bits . It really was n't that painful , although we have had members who had problems and I do n't  know that we were able to address them all . All it costs is a little time and a couple of bucks for monkeymote4foobar so there is not a lot to lose . <p> Thanks for the replies !

Other than CDs , all my music and video files are on a single dedicated internal HDD ( not the system drive ) .

I do n't  norrmally use a cell phone or have a tablet . <p> I called PS Audio and they said that the normal cable path is router ( or cable box ) to Bridge .

Here is what 's happening with audio files from an HDD and online streaming : <p> To be clear , are the Bridge and the computer-server running foobar2000 both hardwired into the same router or switch ? I do n't  have any experience with foobar and online streaming . When playing files off your server , does the display also show " foobar 2000 audio stream " for the brief period it works ? - Did you install both of the foobar UPnP components ? When you refer to the " PWD UPnP device " foobar should be set to the PWD ( if you get the Bridges DNS address and put it into your browser , click on " friendly name " and that should be what foobar shows ) . - You mention JPlayare you also running JRiver MC ? If so , you should set up separate players for the Bridge and USB connections as the configurations are different . Or are you using JPlay with foobar , or standalone ? If so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing is happening with different server software I would suspect a network issue but its hard to say . <p> stevem2 , it looks like you did n't  read my initial post and clarifications. - This is a single user Win 8.1 Pro x64 desktop computer system , with a cable modem ( Charter ) . - The line from the modem to computer goes through a router , which is used for a laptop . - PS Audio suggested hooking an ethernet cable from router to Bridge , which would allow me to play A/V off an HDD , as well as presumably online streaming . - I already had an audio oriented USB card , a USB cable and an LPS , but if the ethernet route worked about as well , then I could get rid of the former combo. - So upon receiving the PWD w/ Bridge , I 've hooked it up both ways to compare . - The USB route to the PWDs USB port ( not the Bridges ) works fine with foobar and online streaming , but the ethernet method does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the computer startup , and with the PWD runs the Kernal Streaming output for PS Audio USB 2.0. - With foobar , I can use either the PS Audio or JPlay ASIO device and JPlay driver ( makes no difference re the problem ) . - With online streaming , I typically open Vincent Burrells ASIO Bridge and have Windows Sound set to that as default . - Changing the latter to PS Audio and not using VBs program makes no difference in the problem . - Please let me know if you need further clarification . - Thanks <p> I did read your posts , although I missed the statement in the middle that you were using JPlay with foobar. - You did n't  answer most of my questions . Did you install both UPnP foobar plug-ins ? If your PWD display says- " foobar2000 audio stream " as you state for online streaming , that suggests you have installed the foo.out plug-in and are using that as your output device . Please confirm that is the case and not just for online streaming . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and confirm it is off . - JPlay may not be compatible with foo.out , which is a third-party plug-in . Even if JPlay tells you it is OK , do n't  try using it until you get foobar to work by itself with the Bridge . Try it eliminate as many variables as possible to narrow down the possible issues . Confirm that preferences/output is set to the PWD if you are using foo.out . If you are trying to stream to the Bridge using an ASIO or other driver besides foo.out , I would still disable JPlay until you get foobar to work by itself with the Bridge . <p> Sorry , I must not have been clear enough in my earlier post today ( Friday ) . - I set Output device in foobar to UPnP:Perfectwave Dac , so yes , the plugin is installed . - And the results were identical with or without out JPlay ( service + processes ) . - I also played with other variables , including Windows Sound default setting PS Audio speakers vs . VBs Hi-Fi Cable ( associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JRiver. - Anything I missed ? <p> Thanks for the clarifications ( that is what I thought from your prior posts but some of the prior wording was slightly ambiguous- as a lot of settings sound alike but have quite different results ) . Its good that foobar is working with the JPlay ASIO driver . Have you tested gapless play ? It sounds like JPlay- may just be passing the foo.out output , as suggested by your display . Btw , part of my concern with JPlay is that you said it loaded on start-up . I was concerned that some part of it was still running even it you werent trying to use it . In any event , that part seems to be working . <p> I suspect that the other programs you mentioned just do n't  work with the Bridge . One of the reasons they tried to develop WaveStream was that , in theory , it should be able to play anything that the computer could play , including online streaming and everything else . Your display is probably staying on " foobar2000 audio stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understood . Without WaveStream , the Bridge only speaks to UPnP compliant players . <p> My understanding is that the gapless problem is taken care of by foobars UPnP driver , but am not sure if or how that applies to other computer audio playback , online or with A/V media players . - What is Wavestream ? <p> JPlay runs as a service and process , and become active with the appropriate ASIO driver settings , such as in foobar. - Since that option is n't there with online streaming and other A/V , Vincent Burrell in France developed some programs to provide ASIO playback for that , in my setup Hi-Fi Cable and ASIO Bridge ( http : **34;1019;TOOLONG ) . - With USB , I can use Hi-Fi Cable as the Sound default and open ASIO Bridge for non-foobar audio . Right now with ( PS Audios ) Bridge , no matter what the default setting in Sound , i.e. , Hi-Fi Cable or PS Audio , there is no audio ( apart from foobar ) . - <p> @highstream : - You might look into using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter for internet radio with the Bridge and it works fine ( I have never tried online streaming services , but if the technology is the same as internet radio it could very well work ; you could ask in the MinimServer forum about this. ) - You would lose gapless support ( MinimServer supports gapless if the renderer Bridge does , otherwise not. ) - No reason of course you could n't use both , keeping foobar for playing your local files. - Link : http : //minimserver.com/ <p> highstream , your Windows sound settings affect what your computer is playing ( and some connected devices , such as the PWD by USB ) , but would n't affect the Bridge . <p> WaveStream is virtual sound card software that PS Audio was working on for a long time to address the gapless issue and also to allow people to send to the Bridge anything their computer could play . There is a Windows beta version available ( see http : **25;1055;TOOLONG .. -released/ ) . I could n't get the latest to install but its basically the last beta version ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy to use ( others did use it , however ) . I do n't  know if the beta handles internet audio . <p> Magisters suggestion of minimserver is a good one . I did not know it did streaming . Its free . JRiver MC may also work but costs money . I do very little streaming and that is with a USB connection so I do n't  really know what works with the Bridge . <p> Thanks for the suggestion , and I just posted there . - I installed MinimServer to take a look , and from what I can tell from its operation and the user guide , its specific content oriented. - That is , it wants file locations on the computer to be specified . - That would apply to a movie file or Spotify or a radio station , so I asked about how that would or would not apply to online streaming . - And to be clear what I mean by the latter , it might be a news clip , a YouTube video or a sports event . - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAC ( or what ever the DS bridge is called on your machine ) as the output driver in foobar2000 then I 'd recommend that you simplify the universe and only install UPnP MediaRenderer Output ( foooutupnp ) - It has virtually no configuration and just seems to work . <p> If you are going to drive foobar2000 with a UPnP controller or need either foobar2000s UPnP Server or Browser then you have to deal with UPnP/DLNA Renderer , Server , Control Point ( fooupnp ) <p> With fooupnp installed I often get long timeouts in foobar2000 when first getting things to run with the bridge. - If I wait a minute or two things seem to work , but a misstep will cause another very annoying wait. - It is possible to get it to work reliably , but I 'm not the one to say how . <p> Ted , I did install the UPnP MediaRenderer Output component in foobar , which I assume is how I 'm getting the UPnP choice in the Output Device setting ( it was n't there before that install ) . - Are you proposing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio to start and stop/pause , but I just assumed it has a few rivers to cross between HDD , router and Bridge that is , until I got to Wavestream ( below ) . Perhaps I 'm not understanding your post entirely , as I 'm not clear how all that applies to the main audio problem we were discussing . <p> As for Wavestream , the good news is that the other types of audio are now working ( ! ) . - The bad news is that audio takes 4 seconds to start and then picture/audio are out of sync about that much. - <p> One other thing : I installed Wavestream from a link on page 1 in that forum and though the MS Resdistributable shows as x64 , as is my computer , WS installed in the x86 folder . Ok , that happens , but when I go to the SourceForge page and try a WaveStream version that says it was updated five days ago , I got the following error message on install : " A newer version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of that ? - ( http : **25;1082;TOOLONG .. source=dlp ) <p> highstream said I installed MinimServer to take a look , and from what I can tell from its operation and the user guide , its specific content oriented. - That is , it wants file locations on the computer to be specified . - That would apply to a movie file or Spotify or a radio station , so I asked about how that would or would not apply to online streaming . - And to be clear what I mean by the latter , it might be a news clip , a YouTube video or a sports event . - <p> I hope Simon ( developer of MinimServer ) will give you a more definitive answer. - Heres what I know , and I 'm not the most technical guy in the universe . <p> Your basic idea about MinimStreamer is correct. - To play internet radio , I locate the URL of the stations I want and put them in a playlist , using the format specified in the MinimStreamer documentation. - I assume that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , could also be played. - I do n't  know how Spotify etc. work. - The nice thing about this approach is that the internet radio stations can now be played from within MinimServer , just like my albums ; previously I had to run a separate internet radio app . <p> I see you reposted the WaveStream comments in Denniss WaveStream thread , which is the best place for it . Btw , i got that same message when - I tried to install WS on my Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium system . I did not find a workaround but did n't  much care . <p> Teds point may have been aimed more at those of us who were suggesting to people that they should download both of the foobar2000 UPnP components . I did n't  think the " UPnP/DLNA Renderer , Server , Control Point 0.99.48 " component was strictly necessary if you were just using the Bridge but was n't sure and it did n't  seem to hurt . Ted is correct that you only need " UPnP MediaRenderer Output 1.0 beta 4 " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh install on my old i3 Win 7 64 bit Home Premium machine . The steps : <p> In preferences/media library , point it to your music folder(s) ( loading the library was the only step that took much time and even that is pretty fast ) . <p> In my case , I use the monkeymote4foobar iPad controller so I installed its component ( when you purchase the app from the App Store , it will tell you where to find it ; you get it from the monkeymote site and it installs like other foobar components ; you need to restart foobar2000 after installing it ) . <p> That was it . I opened monkeymote on my iPad , selected that machine , and music played ( without gaps ) . - As Ted said , it just worked and there was almost nothing to configure . <p> highstream said Not entirely clear what you 're saying , since the few radio stations I listen to all have their own streaming links , which I put on the desktop or as a bookmark . - Does MinimServer help with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listen to music ( at least I try not to . . . ) so I do n't  use a web browser for internet radio. - My music , and MinimServer , are on a NAS that I control with my iPad. - MinimServer ( with MinimStreamer installed ) let 's me access internet radio stations from a playlist. - So I open the playlist called " Internet radio " and then select the one I want. - No need to leave my control point. - <p> stevem2 , Do you have any audio-video sync problems with A-V players or streaming other than foobar ? - I 've been using foobar since last summer , so I had those install and media library steps down , thanks . - <p> Like with Vincent Burrells ASIO Bridge program , foobar quickly comes to a halt when output setting is UPnP and Wavestream is running ; one has to use DS:Speakers ( Wavestream ) instead or close Wavestream altogether . - Will have to compare the two settings sonically , as well as against my USB set up . <p> After all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Looking closer , it had quit recognizing the dac. - Then , I found the UPnP MediaRenderer Output plugin in foobar had dropped off foobars output device list , even though the component is installed . - A system restore did n't  solve it , so I uninstalled Wavestream and the UPnP plugin and reinstalled the latter . - UPnP then appeared in the device list , then dropped off on next look . - Strange . - On the PWDs Bridge screen , no output device shows , i.e. , no foobar or PS Audio stream . - USB plays ok. - Makes me think the PWD and Bridge need resetting or foobar needs reinstall. - The first would seem easier . - That make sense ? - How does one reset it ? - Thanks , <p> I do n't  use the Bridge for video so syncing is not an issue for me . There is invariably a delay when the Bridge starts playing ( at least in part to load the buffer in the Bridges digital lens ) that is obviously problematic for video . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for 192/24 or 176/24 files , the delay is about 12 seconds in my case . <p> The easiest way to reset the Bridge is to get its DNS address and put that into your browser . ( On your touchscreen , bring up the list of inputs and scroll to the Bridge ( may just say PWD ) , press the green button on the right and then the network settings button to get the address . Mine is 192.168.1.9 but yours will likely be different . - There is also a free iDevice app called Fing that will sniff out all the devices on your local network . ) The PWD browser page has a " Reset UPnP Server " button that often works . - There is also a reset button that you will see if you follow my instructions to get the Bridge DNS instructions . If all else fails , turn the PWD off and back on using the switch on the back . <p> When you say the " output plugin n foobar had dropped off " do you just mean the PWD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connection problem , which unfortunately is not unusual with the Bridge . Resetting the Bridge should do the trick ( start with the web page and then the on/off switch if that does n't  do it ) . 
@@23909370 @3909370/ <h> My Kingdom for a DAC <h> Quibbles and Bits <p> By Richard Murison <p> One of the nice things about digital audio is that it 's so simple to understand . We sample ' ( measure ) the analog waveform many tens of thousands of times a second and store the results as binary numbers . When it comes to playback , we simply use the binary numbers to recreate the original waveform . And we can refer to whats-his-name 's theory to insist that the process will have perfectly recreated the original waveform . So much for digital audio . Now let 's move on to politics . <p> If it were as simple as that I 'd be out of a job " albeit an unpaid job . So let 's take a closer look at one aspect of nice-n ' -easy digital audio " how a DAC works . As usual , I 'll stick with the CD Audio format to illustrate my explanation . So we 're looking at a stream of 16-bit numbers , 44,100 of them every second , and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents an immediate challenge . We can very easily figure out what the actual voltage is that our 16-bit number corresponds to . The challenge is not only in setting the output voltage to precisely that value , but doing so within 1/44,100th of a second . <p> It turns out that there is a very simple circuit that can do that for us . It is called an R-2R ladder , and I 've included an example below . Basically , you have a chain of resistors all wired together that have values of either R or 2R ( it does n't actually matter too much what the actual value of R is ) . One of the 2R resistors is tied to ground , and each of the others to an input formed by one of the bits of our audio bit depth . Each 2R resistor is linked to the next by a single R resistor . So for 16-bit audio there are 16+1 of these 2R resistors and 16-1 of the R resistors . When each bit of the 16-bit number is applied to its respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0V is applied , depending on whether the bit is a 1 or a 0 ) the output of the ladder magically becomes the actual voltage encoded by the 16-bit number . The R-2R ladder appears to be the perfect circuit for an audio DAC " or is it ? <p> In order for the DAC to be accurate , it requires that each of the R resistors must be absolutely identical , and the 2R resistors all have to be exactly twice the resistance of the R resistors . What accuracy do we need ? Well , if we are dealing with 16-bit audio the resistance values need to be accurate to one part in 2 to the 16th , which is 1:65,536 ( and correspondingly tougher for 24-bit audio ) . As best as I can tell , the most accurate resistors available commercially are rated at -0.005% , which corresponds to an accuracy of 1:20,000 , or 14-bits , which is not good enough . <p> Furthermore , the resistance value changes with temperature , which means that to maintain that accuracy the resistor needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the act of measuring the resistance involves passing a current through it , which has the unavoidable effect of heating the resistor . At the limit , this heating effect perturbs the value of the resistance by more than the accuracy to which you are trying to measure it ! The problems do n't stop there by any means , but my description of them does . <p> These and other problems make it extremely difficult for a DAC manufacture to implement a real-world R-2R ladder DAC , which is why there are so few of them on the market , and also why they are so costly . So what is the alternative ? <p> Well , we 're apparently stymied by our inability to generate output voltage levels with sufficient precision . But we 've come across a problem like this previously at least we have if you 've been diligently reading these columns ! , and we already know the answer " by massively oversampling , followed by low-pass filtering , we can generate a high-precision signal even though it is obtained from low-precision constituents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSD and generate our analog output voltage as a high-frequency pattern of 1 's and 0 's " which wo n't depend on the accuracies of resistors . When we pass this through a low-pass filter we will recreate the original analog signal at something close to the original precision . <p> This , in a nutshell , is how virtually every single modern DAC works , but with some variations . First of all , strictly speaking , the term DSD implies a sample rate of 2.8224MHz , and almost no DAC chipsets will use that sample rate . Most will use a sample rate up in the 10 's of MHz . Secondly , DSD is a 1-bit system , and ( for reasons I wo n't get into here ) most commercial chipsets utilize multi-bit ( typically 3-bit to 5-bit ) data . These DACs use on-board SDMs to convert the incoming signal " whether PCM or DSD " to its own internal DSD-like ' format before converting to analog and filtering . Although the level of signal processing required is truly prodigious , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be reduced to a single IC , which can be manufactured in volume for pennies . It makes for a compelling argument , one to which virtually all DAC manufacturers now adhere . <p> Now we can move on to politics . <p> Richard Murison enjoyed a long career working with lasers , as a researcher , engineer , and then as an entrepreneur . This enabled him to feed his life-long audiophile habit . Recently , though , he started an audiophile software company , BitPerfect , and consequently he can no longer afford it .

The less the computer has to do in the background , the more it can concentrate on what you really want it to do ( such as network processes ) . That 's the theory , at least . I do n't  do a lot of tweaking myself ( I mostly use a Mac and found a script that turns a lot of stuff off but have n't really noticed much of a difference ) . I suspect the tweaking has less of an impact on network playing than USB but that 's just a gut reaction , which means its probably wrong . I 'd suggest trying one or more of the cheaper/free tweaks and see if you hear a difference but , in any event , I would n't obsess about it . Remember to enjoy the music . <p> Since my Netbook is dedicated to my music server , I could literally turn everything off that is not necessary . - I will Google options , but I am also appreciative of any information my forum friends can provide i.e. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find this hard to understand.Believable , yeswhy though ? - Were talking about transferring digital data to a renderer , where everything is re-clocked and scrutinized by a highly sophisticated digital lens , then converted to DSD .. - <p> This is a great topic and we have covered it here and there in other threads . There are many factors involved and many ( most ? ) we really do n't  understand yet . Commercial servers are often small , low powered ( CPU-wise ) embedded systems . How they are powered ( power supply ) and filtered varies and storage is either spun or HDD . Software may be Linux or a variant of Windows and either will then run music server software from a variety of sources ( some , I suspect , in-house but many use either commonly available programs , like JRiver , or perhaps variants ) . This capsule description is overly simplistic and there are systems out there that do not fit in these broad categories . My point is that there is not any " magic " inside these boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on the open market . Some look " computerish " and some do n't  but that is essentially all that they are . <p> There is little disagreement on whether big CPUs or little CPUs are better . Either can be made to sound pretty darn good but it takes some experimenting to get there . Remember , just because many servers are low powered systems does not mean that this is the only way to go . These companies are looking to make a profit and that style of hardware is really , really cheap and compact in comparison to , say , an i7 based machine . I 'm not saying that one is superior to the other , just that if I was going into the server business , I would choose the more economical solution . I use bigger hardware because I am more familiar with it . I have just gotten a new i7 K processor that I can under clock and under volt . Hopefully I will come up with similar improvements to what Wijnand has gotten with his setup . The CPU under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under clocking may be an even bigger jump . Of course all that may be just peeing in the wind in that it just brings the big , electricity hungry processors down to Atom processor range at greater expense. - <p> If you are working with a laptop , your range of tweaks is limited . IMHO , the easiest way to get to better sound in your situation is to try Fidelizer with the music player software of your choice ( I use Minimserver ) and shut down any other programs running , like Explorer , Word etc Give the free version a shot . I use the Pro version and it does sound better . I had previously done my own surgery by shutting down processes and services and tweaking other Windows functions but Fidelizer sounds better to me and , frankly , the computer runs smoother this way ( extremist mode with networking ) . I do n't  use my server for anything else other than music btw , and I run Win 8.1 . Eventually I will try Win Server 2012/JPLAY/AO but I am concentrating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to say . It all adds up and in many , many ways it would be much easier , and probably cheaper in the long run , to go with a commercial product . But its not just a hobby , right ? Its an obsession <p> Sorry that this is a lot of vague stuff . The details are pretty daunting , especially if futzing with computers is not your thing . My point is that the computer end of things makes more than a little difference in your sound and is definitely worth pursuing . <p> Gordon reports that he also prefers B2 to the Aries when using a Mac Mini with minimserver ( my main setup ) but thinks they are basically equal when using a hard drive connected directly to the Aries with a good USB cable . I need to do some more comparisons with direct connections ( unfortunately I do n't  have any high end USB cables with a Micro USB connector for the HD side ) . I use the Mini/minimserver approach because I 've found it more reliable when adding new music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wire makes a sonic difference . Not necessarily better or worse but different . <p> I was running JRMC to Bridge2 and found it a bit " warm " and dynamically dull IMHO . <p> I preferred Audirvana + on the Mini to B2 , but ONLY in simple HOG-MODE . <p> I listened for a while to Aries using JRMC as the library , then Minim server on the mac . Neither rang my bell . <p> Since Auralic activated the USB input on the Aries I have been there ever since . My best guess is that I have eliminated unnecessary components and their cables and that has resulted in a better SQ from my rig . It also results in flawless performance from the Lightning control app . HD , Tidal , and tons of internet radio . <p> My rig is now reduced to Aries , Amp and speakers . Again less cables and power cords to deal with . clean and mean and everything just works. - Still could trade my JR amp for BHK mono-blocks , perhaps- : &gt; <p> G , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini/JRMC 20 and the Aries with a direct connection to a WD 4TB drive ( using the stock USB cable on the hard drive , Kimber silver USB cable from Aries to DS ) , in my system the Aries did n't  come close . With the Bridge things just snapped into focus ( exact same reaction I had when I went from Mac Mini to DS via USB to the Aries to DS via USB with the same cable ) . Just goes to show that every system is different and people will get different results . The Aries is a very nice piece of kit with some great features and I could happily live with it as my main source . For now , I prefer B2 in my system . That could change with the next firmware update , cable or hard drive change , or full moon . <p> Either way , one thing for sure , every little change of anything seems to make a difference so I guess that is all part of the enjoyment of our Nirvana journeys .

There 's too many solutions out there that are pretty much turn key with little to no setup or usage hassles .. V.2 has too be as good. - <p> I had an Aries for many months and it sounded very good and better when fed from a USB drive hooked right up to it .. My Aurender N100H sounds better ..

I have asked and have been told dirt might come in during shipping and the rubber pad can cause the hole on the plastic bag while shipping . <p> And now , one of the 2 fans started to make a constant noise when it runs ( like- noise by a- fan of an old desktop PC or when it touches a wire when running ) which is very annoying .

He does not know that the fans are only kicked in to run when heat is up at certain level and off again when heat is down. - If load is too low then chances for fans run again soon is low . Give the box enough load and wait a bit- and he can see the fans run . Is he qualified to open the box and tested before shipping the " new " device to me ? Is he qualified to test and run warranty ? How could you let an distributor like that to serve the customers here ? The fact he has the right to test new devices and package before shipping out to customers are bad thing . He has all types of ex-demo , open-boxed which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importer here and has his own hifi shop to sell those PSAudio things . How can I trust him after all this ? Do you control him well for the sake of consumers ? Do you care about PSAudio image ? Before I bought mine , I thought PSAudio did the testing/product verification/quality assurance/quality control . I found out everything is done with him when I- exchanged emails with one of your staff at PSAudio- after I found my box was with damaged plastic bag and- tiny wood dust inside the plastic bag when I unboxed it- upon delivery . Now my- P5 is just about one month old . Why does not he run the test more carefully and replace the Indonesian fans inside ( I can look inside thru the heat sink opening ) .

Mike at Magenta is one of the very best distributors we have and has always been fair and honest. - <p> There are any number of things that could cause what you 're seeing and I am trying to make heads or tails of all this . The fans on the P5 are there for a reason . Its rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , they can and do come on to cool the unit if the loads too much or the ambient temperature in the room is high , etc . From Mikes technicians report it looks like the P5 is running exactly as it should. - <p> The hum in the transformer does sound like DC to me as well . If its not present until the heater or air conditioner kicks on as I am gathering from your note , that would be clear indication the line is changing and becoming unbalanced which can cause DC on the line and subsequent transformer hum in the P5 . The P5 will block any DC to the equipment itself , but its internal transformer can mechanically vibrate if it gets DC on it . That another piece of gear does n't  may be because its on a different circuit or running a very different load or any number of extenuating circumstances I am not privy to . <p> As for the 225 volts , I am unclear what the issue is . There is a limit to how much you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an instrument , after all , and while it can do what you ask of it , it is n't always possible to not have other consequences in making those choices . Can you try Mikes advice and adjust it back up to 230 to see if perhaps that helps the issue youre seeing ? <p> We want nothing more than to have you happy , but making threats like this is n't perhaps the best way to go . I am sure Mike will be happy to work with you . <p> I think its good that the distributor opens product before sending it out to dealers and customers . They can check for any shipping damage , and update any software . Regarding their tech assessment , they can only test it " as received " so if it turns out your local power supply is causing the behavior then its no surprise they cant replicate the fault .

The first thing we played was a solo piano piece which I believe was Robert Silverman on the John Atkinson Stereophile recordings ( excellent work ) . <p> The piano sounded as if it were live and in the room . On one instance Silverman hit a single note and almost startled me out of my seat so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I simply had never heard anything like it . I was stunned . <p> The next track was a female vocalist . I was equally stunned because this sounded so unnatural as to be unnerving . <p> How is it we can go from perfection to head shaking in a matter of only a few moments ? <p> Clearly the benefits of the horn were many but distortions in tonal balance were so off the charts that I simply could not live with it . <p> The question then is what level of compromise are you willing to accept to get something amazing ? I , for one , cant get over the tonal aspects to gain the speed and dynamics . In the same way , I could never live with electrostats because their lack of dynamics in trade for transient speed is n't worth the price asked of me . <p> Considering there are no perfect anythings where will you draw the line ? 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 12 COMMENTS <p> In all respect to your expert hearing I do not think it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avante Garde alone . For your information I use TAD driver with the horn . I never felt cup around mouth effect . <p> Horn speakers , like any kind of speaker , have many different versions and models , some probably do n't  have these issues . The point of the article was n't to bash horns but to try and point out every speakers system has compromises we have to choose from . Where do you draw the line ? <p> Paul , I had the exact same experience with the Avante Gardes at a dealer showroom both pro and con . Their colorations were so bad it is hard to believe they 're commercially viable . Yet at the recent RMAF , the JBL 1400 Array did n't  sound horn-y at all . I once owned the original Quads amazing speakers , but talk about no dynamics At the same RMAF show I heard the Sanders Sound Model 11 ( an electrostatic hybrid ) , which was one of the most dynamic speakers of any type I 've listened to ( plus all the electrostatic goodness ) . This all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . <p> Any engineering endeavor requires tradeoffs , but generally products that balance the major parameters will enjoy more success than those that turn up some parameters to " 11 " while letting others drop around " 0 " . A great design has fewer tradeoffs in general many " 8 " s and " 9 " s with no parameters dropping below say " 5 " . With all that said , each person has their own set of priorities . I look for speakers that optimize parameters important to me while doing " pretty well " at everything else . That is usually where I get into trouble underestimating the long-term importance of " everything else " . Within the relatively short span of an evaluation , it is easy for me to get focused on my priorities and neglect the other parameters . Over time though those shortcomings start to wear on me . It was n't that I did n't  hear the problems initially its that I undervalued how much theyd bother me . Then for a time I listen mostly to music that favors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened to a lot of choral music . With that they had Amazing Grace . But how long do you want your system to dictate what kind of music you listen to ? <p> Great picture to accompany the article Paul . But seriously , the Avantgarde Acoustic horns were the FIRST horn speakers you ever heard ! Seriously ? Had you never been to a concert before , attended a live theatrical performance or even gone to a public movie theater ? Or are you just younger than you appear at somewhere around 10 years old ? Seriously ? How could one go through life being a music lover and had so few experiences with horn speakers ? WOW . <p> Mentally or physically ? : ) Good point , as every theater and concert uses horns . Most concerts sound dreadful but a lot of theaters are OK . As I mentioned , the point of the article was all about trade-offs and compromises and where you draw the line that we must inevitably draw . <p> So to directly answer your question , that experience I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high end system in many years . My actual first introduction to high-end audio was on a pair of JBL corner horns and THAT experience got me hooked for a lifetime . <p> At nearly 50 years old now its a novel idea and science fiction dream to be 10 years old again but that is actually about the age at which I was first romanced by the immediacy of a horn speaker . I remember it being like a sonic beam of light opening up a window to a level of detail and dynamics I never knew existed . I actually collect old vintage gear and have in my collections many a pair of Altec 604s , JBL and Klipsch compression drivers and the likes , but have to agree with you Paul . It seems every time I listen to a horn design my first impression is that of like seeing the brightest most vivid TV on display at the local big box store , but , shortly thereafter my ears ( much like my eyes in the big box store ) start to hurt and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how much EQ , " soft " amplification , room acoustics taming or gentle source material you throw at them , I too just can not comfortably co-hab with them for even more than a few hours at a time . But you have to admit , they are the sonic equivalent of being broadsided by a Mac Truck from the first note played and if that does n't  get ones attention and wake you the hell up from a listening point of view nothing will . They definitely have their place , just not in my 16+16 foot listening room . I have settled in with Martin Logan Electrostatic hybrids for nearly 15 years and simply love them . Especially with the advent of high resolution 24 bit music now available . For the first time ever I am hearing more detail and resolution in the same monitoring system than I ever thought imaginable ! <p> Believe me Paul , I know the " head in a vise " feeling all too well ! Actually with electrostats , it+GGs more like " head balanced on the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forwards , side to side , up , down or move in any direction and everything changes . But I am so detail conscience and spoiled by the resolution and depth that I hear in electrostats that I just can+GGt hardly listen to any other basic loudspeaker design without feeling immersed in the music . Plus I 'm sort of a loner when it comes to serious listening most of the time anyhow so locking down for listening is not a big deal anymore . I guess I should stop being so blunt and quit asking my guests if they came over to listen to some music or to talk over the it . Shut up and listen and you might actually HEAR something ! Sometimes I think the best thing to do in a listening room is to put up a curtain that hides all the gear so people are n't  distracted by all the pretty lights and spinning wheels . " Pretty lights and spinning wheels as opposed to great sound " . Maybe that could be a cool topic of discussion . LOL <p> Paul , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like horn speakers . I 'd wondered what people meant by " horn-y " sound . In the past decade or less , Avantgarde re-engineered " innards " behind the large midrange horn ( pricey upgrades are available for owners of previous models ) . Imaging became pin point laser sharp ( when correctly set up ) ; I strongly suspect you 'd find them less " horn-y " now . Take some newer Avantgardes for a test drive and let us know what you think <p> I 've got a pair of Avantegarde Uno Nano horn speakers in a small room and love the spaciousness they give the sound stage . If this is tonal coloration , I want to wrap it around me and snuggle up ! So what if they are n't  scientifically " neutral " ? ; I 've listened to highly reviewed yet boring speakers with an RIAA curve flat enuff to play pool on . <p> My limitations ? Well I enjoy electrostatics , but dislike listening to a 12 foot long acoustic guitar ( if you know what I mean ) . I enjoy headphones , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of my skull . I 'd also miss the elegance of low power SET tubes . <p> Having happily lived with my horns for 3 years , I 'd rather not be chained to the " boxed in " sound of conventional loudspeakers . They often seem constrained , even " TV-ish " . Its kinda like going to Utah and being forced to drink 3.2 beer . While supposedly beer , something vitally important is missing . <p> The positive qualities you describe are the very qualities that characterize live music . No wonder you were startled . The cupped hands phenomenon has been ameliorated by the use of tractrix horns . Add to this the use of wood t.o make the horns and any colouration.added by the horn material is removed . Voices are produced so realistically it can be unbelievable . In fact direct radiators sound threadbare and bleached in comparison . Give it a try . You may be pleasantly surprised . I have tried them both . <p> While I agree with you that the amazing dynamic range is more like live music than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the speaker that makes it so . Now one could argue that it takes a horn to be that efficient but I might argue that its all that 's worked so far . 
@@23909387 @3909387/ <p> I referred to the owners manual for assistance , which has n't  lead to me making any progress to get my DS to play anything over hardwired ethernet . <p> Using eLyric on Mac the DS " Playing Status " web UI correctly sees what it is supposed to be playing , and eLyric sees the DS , but no noise comes out . I know eLyric has been discontinued , so I tried VLC and despite some effort I have no idea how to get it to work with DS Bridge . <p> I have music on my MacBook Air , which connects wirelessly to the local network . I want to use the MacBook Air + whatever software as the music renderer and have the music come out of the DS . If possible I do n't  want to buy any software to make this work , and I do n't  want to use USB ( yet ) . I have no idea how to proceed . The other thing is ( as far as I know ) my local network does not support UPnP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is this problematic for network streaming via Bridge ? Certainly when UPnP devices on my network search for other UPnP devices on the network they cant find any . <p> My DS has 400+ hours in use . I just ca n't pick any sonic differences for 44.1/16 content via coax to the DS , compared with connecting my source player analog out direct to the pre-amp . So I really need to get this DS network streaming to come to the party and bring me some new capability , because as a DAC for red book CD content the DS is not really doing anything that my CD player ca n't already do ( as I say , they sound virtually identical and impossible for me to reliably pick whether the DS or CD player is doing the D/A work ) . Obviously my CD player is very good , but it lives in its own network ecosystem that does n't  allow content on my MacBook Air to be turned into music . For that I need the DS . <p> And the other thing . I loaned my DS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do a long term in-home demo . Unfortunately the gloss black top came back with a deep scratch . I could black out the scratch with an artline texta and it would be less obvious , but this would n't restore the gloss top coat . Can the piano gloss top be purchased separately as a spare part ? - <p> The Bridge does rely on UPnP so that sounds like a problem . Alternative free software you could try includes minimserver . Others on the board are much more conversant on that topic than I am . It also relies on UPnP , however. - I 've never heard of a router before that deliberately wont pass UPnP . Is that something that can be changed in the router settings ? Otherwise you might be able to stream directly to the Bridge from your Mac using a wireless access point on the Bridge end . I 've never tried it so ca n't really help with the setup- but I believe it is possible ( I have heard of people connecting Macs directly to the Bridge using Ethernet ) . <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I regret to tell you I had so many connection problems I finally bought a NAS and put my music on it with Minimserver , which is a UPnP. - Since then I have basically zero connection issues or drops . - I too have never heard of a router that would not do UPnP. - As a controller I use mconnect HD on my iPad , I 'm not crazy about some of its features like the art but it too is very stable . <p> I suspected as much Roger . I think the answer here is likely to address the routers inability to handle UPnP , either by adjusting the routers settings or by replacing it , or possibly- setting up a separate music-only network with a different router for the Bridge . <p> I contacted Fortinet Support and confirmed what I suspected . Fortigate routers block all UPnP traffic by design , and there is no way around it . <p> Has anybody tried connecting an access point in client-bridge mode via ethernet to the bridge ? The MacBook Air would therefore connect on a dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus bypass the router . <p> How do I give the Bridge a static IP ? I opened the Network Configuration web UI , entered the new network settings ( LAN DHCP = NO ) , " Save/Apply " then restarted DS , but it has come back up on the network with a DHCP address and not the static address I gave it . <p> I have not done mine for awhile but this sounds correct . I was thinking there was a guide on the PSA sites Support/How To , but cant find one now . Others more network savvy can probably assist you better than me at this point . <p> I have tried connecting the MacBook Air directly to the DS Bridge via both straight and crossed ethernet cables . Both are on static IP . Selected Bridge input on the DS . Ca n't get it to work . <p> Computer audio is so frustrating . I just revert back to connecting the CD player directly to the pre-amp , it works every time , oh the joy of the simplicity . <p> If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@23909393 @3909393/ <p> I am setting up a Mac mini server based on the how to section . The problem that I am running into is that the Devialet is on my living room wall and the server is in the basement so the cord length is around 24 feet which is way too long for the USB . If I have the Devialet on the home network would that eliminate the need for the USB connection ? Previously I was using a Moon MIND to access the files with a XLR connection between the Devialet and MIND , but I really like the simplicity of Pauls recommendations . <p> Part of the reason that Paul uses USB is simplicity and portability . His server and DirectStream travel and that is a good solution for connecting . He needs only a short cord for that .

@@23909394 @3909394/ <p> Just want to confirm whether it is not at all possible to play DSD files directly ( through USB ) from MacMini to DirectStream using JRiver . <p> - <p> It works perfectly well when I use bridge . But when I use USB ( selecting Player on left hand navigation pane of Jriver ) I hear louts of white noise . Even when I play a PCM with 196/24 through USB I can see the rate to be 192 . But the bit is shown as 16 . <p> - <p> Is it because of inherent limitation of Mac OS of not having capability to play did or pcm over 16 bits ? <p> It is certainly possible to play single rate DSD ( DSD64 ) and 192/24 PCM over USB from a Mac Mini to a DS using JRMC . This sounds like a configuration problem , particularly with the bit depth . Check Audio MIDI Setup ( in your Applications/Utilities folder ) and make sure it it set for 24 bits ( I 'm not sure this matters when using JRMC but it could n't hurt ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something not set right in JRMC . <p> Right ( that 's 100% in JRMC , the DS can be set at any volume ) . If everything is getting truncated to 16-bits , DSD would not play and to me that sounds like a settings issue . Also , can run the bit perfect test but it would almost certainly fail if nothing has changed . <p> Glad that worked Sourav . JRMC is using DoP ( DSD over PCM ) to send the DSD files to the Direct Stream . Those files are packaged to look like 176/24 PCM . That 's just they way the DSD data is bundled but if they get truncated to 16 bits , the Direct Stream can not recognize them as DSD files and cannot- properly decode them . <p> Ca n't you set the Options in JRiver to DSD bitstreaming and get the raw DSD stream to the DirectStream ? - The reason I ask is that I set up JRiver to do just that and it still is listing the input as DOP . <p> Actually the guys at PS Audio would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only input that supports raw DSD at this time. - But as stevem2 says DoP is just a DSD container and is bit perfect so there 's no acoustic benefit to using raw DSD instead of DoP with the DS. 
@@23909395 @3909395/ <p> I recently upgraded- to Mac OS Sierra and could get no audio output to my DS , so per Jeremy at PS Supports suggestion I adjusted the midi settings and got Audrivana and Jriver to work but Roon , Tidal , Fidella , and Amarra still did n't work . So I rolled back again to OSX El Capitan and noticed the same problems with those exact apps , so I began to revers engineer my system with the changes I made recently until the apps work , and fortunately the first and most recent change fixed all the USB problems , and that was the removal of the Lan Rover . When I tried adding it back the problems re-occurred immediately . I doubt that Tidal , Roon , Amarra , and Fidella will modify their code to support one USB transport device ( and since PS Lan Rover- device fails on 4 out of 6 OSX programs ) , I think PS needs to solve this problem . Last time called PS Support Jeremy very- coyly told me that I called you for simple problems I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the midi settings ) , well that 's what support is for when you spend 7,000 USD on a DAC with a bridge , considering my only other calls have been about their P3 regenerator frying 3 Amplifiers immediately upon plugging them in 3 days in a roy ( I think self trouble shooting is an insane thing for him to suggest ) . - Anyway when I use any of these applications I need to reboot entirely to get audio working at all via USB and the Lan Rover . - I can revert back to the Iatona USB isolater with the Uptone Regen which is somewhat comparable to the Lan Rover , but lacks the dynamics , so I would greatly prefer to use the Lan Rover if possible , but obviously I cant limit my software and music collection buy 65% to do so . <p> If anyone else has a Lan Rover and any of these applications please try them and post your results and hardware / software configurations here . <p> Have mine set the same now , the problem seems to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 441000 but when they are at that level my DAC generates no sound through - the AMP , any level above that and I can produce sound ( using the test configuration and test speakers environment in Audio Midi ) . It works fine like this without the Lan Rover , and it also works fine in exclusive mode without the Lan Rover , for some reason the Lan Rover does n't  like 441000 for the sample rate . I assume if you look in audio midi that 's what you 'll see ? <p> Removed the Lan Rover and put in the Intona and everything works fine in Exclusive mode at every sample rate , will leave the Intona in until someone at PS can help me trouble shoot the issue , the problem seems to be that the Lan Rover wont allow you to operate in Exclusive mode ( it does in Jriver and Audriavana ) which I 'm okay with , but my particular Lan Rover goes dead silent when the sample rate droops down to 441000 which automatically happens in my ROON and Amarra versions , which appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an Audience USB cable for the 1M cable and the short 200 mm cable is a curious cable and I 'm using the power supply and Lan cable that was provided with the Lan Rover . <p> It must just be something with my unit , or some setting on my computer that were missing . <p> sethwarsh said I recently upgraded- to Mac OS Sierra and could get no audio output to my DS , so per Jeremy at PS Supports suggestion I adjusted the midi settings and got Audrivana and Jriver to work but Roon , Tidal , Fidella , and Amarra still did n't work .

PS Audio says they have seen this problem on post 2015 Macs and its a known issue . I prefer USB sound to the bridge because I have a fantastic cable and with the Lan Rover the music has more punch , range and is meatier than over the bridge . My Lan Rover stops all audio output even system audio when Audio MIDI hits 441000 , cant even configure speakers and play test sounds , need to reboot and raise them to anything above 44100 . I sincerely appreciate the input though its greatly appreciated . <p> That brings me back to my original question is there anyway to get ROON to not drop Audio MIDI to 44100 , which I am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue with some computers having a problem with the Lan Rover at 4410 and they are working with the manufacturer to come up with a solution to the issue . <p> Again , thank you all for your help and feedback , its greatly appreciated . <p> I have the same problems with using the LANrover with Amarra for Tidal-no sound output . <p> Tidal by itself works fine with LR and Amarra adds a nice improvement to Tidal so it is a shame that I have to change the USB cable from the LR to direct to the NuWave DAC in order to play Tidal using the Amarra platform.This is somewhat strange since Tidal runs at 44.1 <p> So any time a program resets the Audio Midi rate down to 44.1 the LR goes silent. - <p> Both PS Audio and SonicStudios are very aware of this . It would seem that the LR needs some kind of tweek to function with a 44.1 setting . I do n't  know if PS can do this . I ask the folks at PS if this is tweet is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Amarra for Tidal which reset Audio Midi settings would have a difficult time adjusting their platform for a multitude of third party products. - <p> I think that PS is working with the developer of the Lan Rover to come up with a solution to the problem . The Lan Rover is supposed to pass the USB 2.0 signal just like an ordinary USB 2.0 cable or extender , something funky is going on with the device when deployed in certain environments ( according to PS support its limited to certain environments ) . I expect that they will be able to fix it , because there are numerous USB products like the Intona Industrial USB Galvonizer for example that does relatively the same thing as the Lan Rover ( minus the conversion to TCPIP and back to USB ) , but they will most likely have to provide a firmware update ( if its physically possible with the device ) or a hardware update to address the issue and to make it support the full USB 2.0 protocol . If the device supported the USB 2.0 protocol as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the same as plugging in your USB cable directly . I suspect that PS Audio would update anyones device that was having any issues when and if they come up with a solution . I cant imagine them not resolving the issue though , they are a world class audiophile company and have some of the best talent in house , they went outside for this one product and I would suspect that they will not settle for a sub par product , they will simply work with the developer of the product until they are able to resolve all of the issues . This was a product that they were very proud of as well , rightfully so , because it sounds great . I really cant imagine them letting this be an issue where they tell customers were sorry this just is n't going to play friendly for you . I 'm confident they will solve the problem , it just may take a few weeks . <p> The problem is not related to the OS .

" <p> I also use Vinyl Studio with my NPC and highly recommend that combo. - Jeff , you could sell your current phono stage and get an NPC and not end up with an additional box. - That Tascam is pretty big. - I do n't  know about you , but real estate is at a premium in my listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power supplies , power regenerator and such things that I 've been buying. - Ah for the old days when an audio system consisted of a turntable , a preamp , maybe a tuner , and an amp . <p> While space can be an issue , the DA-3000 is not big. - It is only one rack unit high ( 1.75 ? , one-half the height of the DirectStream ) , the width is the same as the DirectStream , but but the DA-3000 is not quite as deep. - <p> I think of it as small , particularly given all it can do and the raft of connectors on the rear ( including word clock and BNC SDIF-3 inputs and outputs for DSD ) . <p> By the way , Michael Fremer used the DA-3000s predecessor for digitizing vinyl and raved over it . <p> radioclash said I have transferred the bulk of my vinyl collection to DSD using the nuwave phono converter . - The sound is outstanding through the DS. - No need for PCM conversion for me , ticks and pops are not a concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of its phono stage and digitize it in PCM ( up to 192/24 ) or DSD ( single or double rate ) . You just choose what you want on the NPCs- front panel or in the software ( I use Vinyl Studio ) and the NPC sends that to your computer over USB , where the software captures it . <p> Linvincible , I think you may be talking about two different pieces of equipment . The DS will only accept pure DSD ( i.e. , not encoded as DoP ) over the- I2S input- ( although I thought the plan was to add that to USB at some point ) . - Was it in the DS manual that you saw the reference to DSD only streaming over I2S ? - On the other hand , the Nuwave Phono Converter takes an analog input ( usually a turntable ) - and converts it to PCM or DSD and then outputs the files to the computer over USB to be recorded , as Paul said . <p> My Tascam DA-3000 just arrived and I 'm anxious to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure about . - Reference Level and Input Volume . - To anyone who has recorded with it , where do you set those ? - For the time being I 'll use trial and error . - I 'm not sure of the purpose of the reference level setting . <p> Reference level is a little tricky to understand if you are not familiar with studio equipment. - When setting the reference level , you are calibrating your digital inputs and digital output level to equal , for example , -18dbFS when being fed 0dBVU. 0dBVU is the " 0 " midpoint level on a traditional analog VU meter . <p> The confusing part results because 0 on a dBVU meter is not the highest signal level a system can handle , it is just a reference. - There is a lot of headroom available above 0dBVU. - On the other hand , 0dBFS on a digital system is 0dBFullScale , the highest level a digital system can handle before distortion . <p> Thus , you need to calibrate a digital system to a reference level that makes sense. - -18dBFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a digital dBFS meter reads 18dB below full scale when it receives a signal which a dBVU meter reads as 0dBVU. - <p> On the DA-3000 , the inpout and output reference levels can be set to -9dBFS , -14dBFS , -16dBFS , -18dBFS , or -20dBFS. - The default is -16dBFS . <p> Now that you are thoroughly confused , you can enjoy knowing none of this will matter to you . - <p> Feed the DA-3000 an analog signal where the peaks do not reach over 0dBFS indicated. - Aim for peaks of perhaps -6dBFS on the DA-3000s meter. - You can later increase the overall volume in your recording software in production ( after the recording is done and ready to be processed ) . - When recording live concerts , I aim for peaks at roughly -12dBFS. - This allows of lots of headroom for the unexpected burst in the excitement of performance . I can always later raise the level later in software . <p> Typically you will not use the input level control on the DA-3000. - The preferred method is to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can be a microphone preamp , board console/mixer , or ADC. - Only use the input level control if your source does not have a level control and then only if you must use it to get a clean recording that is not compromised by a low S/N. - Remember , you can always increase the level in software later. - <p> Keep in mind you can not hurt anything. - The worst thing that will happen is that you make a recording that stinks. - And this will teach you something. - Start by recording an LP track at a time and get a sense of how everything works before starting to work on full albums. - And remember you can record a CD , or any other digital sound. - This can be great practice. - Also , remember the DA-3000 is a good DAC as well and the headphone out is decent . You can setup how everything works together in many different ways. - Be sure to play with DSD as well . <p> 2 ) So peaks that do not reach over " 0dBFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DA-3000s meter ? - Seems strange to me that the 0 mark is way over to the right with only 2 markings above , " +3 " and " Over " . <p> 3 ) If I leave the reference level at the default of -16dBFS will that be the level on the meter at " 0dBFS indicated " ? <p> I know I should just start recording without any concerns , but just curious . <p> FS = FullScale. - When recording PCM , 0dB on the DA-3000 is 0dBFS. - It means the absolute top/highest level for PCM. - If you are getting +3dBFS you are over driving the ADC chip and will get distortion . <p> It gets more complicated as it is different when recording in DSD . <p> DSD peak-meters are aligned to 0dB DSD. - The DA-3000 meters switch over to this mode when you change it to record DSD . <p> 0dB DSD is defined as -6dBFS PCM. - However , DSD final masters can have very brief levels as high as +3.1 dBDSD ( that is , -2.9dBFS PCM ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum level allowed by Scarlet Book specs. - ( Scarlet Book is the SACD equivalent of CDs Red Book ) . <p> Leaving the reference level at -16dBFS or changing it does not change the input level itself or the levels shown on the meter. - As I recall , it changes at what level the meter LEDs change color. - Try settling the reference level at -20dBFS , record something , change the reference to -9dBFS and record the something with no other changes , and compare what the meter does while recording and during playback of the two tracks . <p> Perhaps Ted will chime in. - He is very good at explaining levels , much better than I. : ) <p> 0dBFS DSD from an SACD player will be the same level as 0dBFS PCM from that same- player ( with rare exceptions . ) <p> 0dBFS DSD ( on SACDs ) is -6dB from the full rails , i.e -6dB from what you would get with all 1s or all 0s. - Another way of saying this is that 0dBFS DSD on SACDs is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modulator has more distortion and becomes more unstable the closer you push it to the rails. - By defining 0dBFS as a 50% modulation level you can design single bit- sigma delta modulators that are stable up to about +3dBFS . <p> I keep saying DSD on SACDs because tho 50% is Scarlet Book , other DSD devices are n't  necessarily Scarlet Book and arent- necessarily at the same levels. - DSD from various DAC chips can be ( and often are ) at higher modulation levels ( since they use multibit sigma delta modulator and multibit sigma delta modulators are more stable than single bit modulators for SACDs and hence follow different rules . ) <p> Thank you , Ted , especially for clearing up that 0dBFS DSD is the same level as 0dBFS PCM , and that the " extra " 6dB of DSD is actually above 0dBFS. - I appreciate your correcting my misunderstanding. - It is hard enough to keep this stuff straight when I have it right , much tougher when I screw it up . <p> I only have a passing knowledge of Scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips can additionally vary. - Neat stuff . <p> Wow ! Thanks guys . Yet another glimpse of a subject that I did n't  even know was out there ! You two covered some critical concepts that are very helpful to me . I already knew the part about making a recording that stinks , though- <p> Elk , one thing you mentioned : " Typically you will not use the input level control on the DA-3000. - The preferred method is to control the output level of your source feeding the DA-3000. - This can be a microphone preamp , board console/mixer , or ADC . " <p> My source feeding the DA-3000 is my preamp , currently connected with the tape out jacks , and of course the volume control has no affect on those outputs. - There are two sets of main outs , one goes to the power amp and I could use the second to the DA-3000. - Would that be a better choice ? - <p> Typically , the volume controlled preamp main out will provide you with better sound. - But try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what sounds best . <p> The second may be better on a practical basis as you can monitor the source output through your main speakers , changing the listening volume if you choose to do so. - If you use the second set of main outs you may forget , change the volume , and mess up your recording . <p> Regarding ripping in PCM or dsd its a choice , but if your intention is to retain the vinyl soind its dsd and for this its why almost all vinyl rips done now are dsd. - PCM while its sound is still music and I love this soind as well its not analog at all . It has byte or almost snaps mAking it - like analog . Now I M not saying analog or vinyl is not dynamic its just smoother and has less snaps or fast peaks . Its why the better dsd pLYback like a direct stream does can be plYed louder . Mytek also makes a good ad converter as well . Pro line . From there , there is some crazy price stuff real ultra high end studio stuff . - -

@@23909404 @3909404/ <p> Lately I decided for the QNAP HS-210 . It is small , good looking and fanless . No fan , no disturbing noise expenditure . That was my thinking , and it works well . I use this NAS with two 3TB WD disks in Raid 1 . Additionally I bought a 240GB SSD for my music PC . I copied most of my favorite HiRez files onto this SSD and created a separate library for these files in JRiver . So only if I want to listen to some files not included in this library I have to refer to the NAS , which contents about 2 TB of music . But even if I use the NAS , which is sitting about 1m beside my listening seat , I can only hear the discs " working " while loading a new track . So , out of my experience , I can recommend the QNAP thing . If you want to , you can even use this NAS with two SSDs , since it is also capable of 2,5 ? discs . Hope this helps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a ds214+ with 4 4tb drives in raid 1 for storage . The ds213+ works silently and efficiently . I use the energy saver feature on all of it . It wakes on lane and stays up till inactive for 30 mins . All my CPU , s and music servers find it easily . <p> I heard stories on the net that the QNAP HS-210 produces a humming sound <p> I use a set of three cones beneath the HS-210 . That decouples the NAS from the stand ( currently the top plate of my Genesis bass amp ) and makes it dead silent . You can hardly hear the HDs spinning ; but using the NAS exclusively for the playback of music via JRiver , the HD spins only for a second or so when loading a new track into the RAM of the PC . For me it is the best solution for playing music using a PC . <p> I have often been tempted when buying larger ext drives to get a NAS . I have a Mac Mini with two drives 3tb each plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first drive has my library and my second drive is backed up by Tome Machine once a week or whatever setting I request . If I add any new files I bring home my " off site drive , also 3tb and swap it for my second drive . Other than for mirroring , which I do not need , what advantage is there with a NAS if you use a small , silent and " attractive " computer right at the Audio rig ? <p> My jiberish wearing thin hahahaha . What I meant was if you use a NAS you can have solid state hard drives . In multiple drive Nas you could have more than one drive for acess . As in a four bay ds413+ . Now for me I have two music servers controlled for I pads that do not use a CPU at all . One is the KRELL and the other is the UMT plus . One lady thing all my stuff is static no DHCP is used Al <p> Your NAS , by the way , also is a basic mini computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course play to your rig or just supply to your Krel player etc . So the set up with a Mini with a drive or two plugged in can also daisy chain the drives is essentially the same thing but with more functionality , if desired . My mini also streams to my tv for youtube , movies and surfing when not being used for music . It also feeds my Sonos for whole house broadcast when desired . With the Mini as the server AirPlay can also stream to better speakers B&amp;0 example and Sonos can end up with your kids or a friend . The only reason I can see for the NAS , is for mirroring or for replacing a power hungry PC . <p> Gordon I swear I have some kind of issue getting my thoughts across . It is so bad honestly that I had my self tested more than once . They said why was I there after the tests , not joking . Maybe I just do not put the concentration into it .

@@23909408 @3909408/ <p> Listening to a Haydn Piano Trio as I write this through the DS . More on the DS later . <p> I went with a - coworker yesterday to audition some Magneplanar loudspeakers ( the 1.7s and 3.7s ) . He had always wanted to hear them based on my telling him that it was the best midrange transducer I 'd ever heard , other than the- original Quad ESLs , of course . <p> I have a dream system in my mind that I 've always thought would be a killer : Maggie 20s with a pair of REL sub-bass speakers , driven by really , really good high-power tube amps VTLs , Carvers , or McIntoshes . Its a pipe dream , I know , but the quest for great sound is never ending. - <p> We spent about three hours listening to some high-res stuff I brought , some regular CDs , high-res files , etc . While my friend loved the sound of the Magneplanars , he came to a similar conclusion as I did when I almost bought the 3.6s six years ago : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough space to make them bloom . Alas , his living room , and my music room , just are n't  it . <p> However , the most interesting result from our visit was this : we both kept comparing the CDs we were hearing to the DS DAC and found the DAC they were using ( an inexpensive Jeff Rowland DAC in a preamp ) wanting . The DS DAC , assuming you 're playing a well-recorded disc , just nails the presentation of just about any music . We came back to my house and replayed one of the CDs we had played at the store and were convinced of what our ears told us. - <p> The DS DAC continues to impress and delight <p> George Moneo lives in South Florida , with his wife , his son , and lots of little furry mammals .

Both setups were fueled by Jeff Rowland amps ( the Corus pre and the model 525 - amp in the main room ; Capri S2 and model 125 in the other room ) <p> I trust my dealer when he says that a room &gt;25 square meter ( with &gt;2.5 m hight ) is good enough even for the 20.7 . His room was about 4.5 x 8 x 2.5 m and the Maggies were really singing ! But the 3.7 couldnt compete with the big ones. - <p> The most impressive thing for me was the bass performance of the 20.7 .

Outstanding performance of a planar bass panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs and again I was impressed by the performance of the DS with this kind of source material .

@@23909409 @3909409/ <p> With the release of the new Direct Stream DAC , how are you planning on playing the DSD layer of the SACD disc directly from the universal player ? I was planning on upgrading the MKii but noticed the DS does not have any method of directly accepting the DSD stream ( only HDMI ) from a universal player . I would have expected a new DSD based DAC to include an HDMI input which accepts a player 's output stream . Many of the newer DACs are having HDMI as an input option . <p> Presumably Ted and PS Audio would have to develop an SACD transport with an encrypted DSD output to achieve what you are asking about . And then get in the business of selling and supporting such a SACD transport/player . It may be beyond the scope of what they have in mind for DirectStream in the future . <p> It would be a waste of time for PSA to develop a SACD transport ; universal players already have this capability so there is no need to pay a high premium for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input to the DS to accept this stream . <p> Sony again ; not going to waste any more money on Sony backed ventures including SACD discs . <p> What is the easiest method of moving the DSD layer off the disc which does n't  involve a mystic game console running during the full moon ? Standard hardware ( that I am aware of ) will not read this layer . I assume it will need to be converted to DoP as well . I have eLyric running on a desktop currently connected to the MKii . <p> Will be on holidays the next week so will check back once I return . Thanks ! <p> I 've never heard of a way to rip the DSD layer off of a SACD other than using a PlayStation 3 running a specific firmware version . There may be conversion services that will do it for you . If anybody has any other suggestions I would be delighted to hear them . I only have a handful of SACDs myself . <p> You can get it done professionally for $25 each by Puget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs SACD player , and capture the DSD datastream . There is a thriving PS3 based SACD ripping community though . <p> One of the things I hate about SACD rip is the lack of a system like accuraterip to verify the accuracy of the rip . Optical reading is not a perfect thing . Even CDs ( and SACD for sure ) do n't  last for ever and can have factory defects to , and you will never notice until you try to accurately rip them . <p> There are SACD transports available ; Esoteric , DCS , and EMM ( may be others ) make them , but I think they all use proprietary data links to connect the transport and DAC . I checked into Esoteric and they use i.Link which is a Sony implementation of IEEE 1394 . While I have heard of this I do n't  know much about it . I do n't  think its the same as I2S , but perhaps there 's a way to convert it ? I would suspect this is not something PS Audio would take on , but maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SACD there might be a chance they would back off and let someone develop a converter ( for a royalty fee of course ) . I do n't  think standard HDMI is an option though , I believe its converted to PCM before sending out ( find it hard to believe those home theater receivers can handle DSD ) . <p> There are SACD transports available ; Esoteric , DCS , and EMM ( may be others ) make them , but I think they all use proprietary data links to connect the transport and DAC .

It is also important to distinguish between electrical characteristics and communication protocols over the same link . As an example , the industrial RS485/422/232 is not a protocol but e.g. Modbus RTU is one . <p> Al , if the UMT is sending DSD data over I2S do you know if it is encoded in a way that only the MSB DAC can decode it ? Obviously you do n't  have a DS yet , but if it could read the DSD data stream that would be cool ! <p> Frode , you know far more about this than I do . I did n't  think I2S was the same , but are you saying the IEEE 1394 and FireWire are electrical standards and the i.Link is a communication protocol ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is n't an affordable way ( and ca n't be a way ) to send DSD from an SACD to the DS .

And second .. a guess Italian customers like me probably can not benefit of the upgrade KIT . <p> PSA is still actively working on the clicks and pops issue . Its just that the Direct Stream is getting the most attention on the boards . Paul has made it clear that the project is ongoing . Kits will be available outside the US but supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how many PWD are affected by this problem ? Knowing that those using a preamp or having some tweaks in JRiver to avoid resolution change are may be thinking they are not affected . Just to know if our PWD are exception or not <p> It appears to be pretty common but the severity seems to vary . People ( like me ) who use a preamp often do n't  notice it unless we look by turning the PWD volume way down and the preamp way up . The PSA team is actively working on it but admittedly it is taking far too long . <p> Some people even love the vinyl clicks and pops . And not many ask the manufacturers to fix them once and for all : D <p> And some automobil manufacturers even design in engine noise when shifting gear and throttling . But I guess this analogy will not help the situation . I am a bit stomped that a pre inbetween will help .

Would you be happy to buy a fast and luxurious car and never able to goes up to the 2nd gear because of the car ? <p> @fabio060673 I quess the trouble with clicks and pops are partly in the hardware . The PS audio team has worked a long time on this problem . But every ( new firmware ) that should solve the problem had its own problem namely the SQ . The latest firmware 2.4.3 in my opinion has the best SQ ever . So the clicks and pops brought someting special ! . I have tested ( like most of us ) lots of firmwares and tested it in many , many setups . I decided on a certain moment is not going to work and added a preamp in my settup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but explore other possibilities like USB . The SQ of USB has surprised me many times , and in many occasions I even liked USB better than the bridge . The protocol USB is far less unstable than ethernet and in a certain ( the solid sound ) way it sounds more like our good old cd player ( for the people that liked the solid sound ) Theres no problem with dropouts and I had far less clicks and pops using USB . <p> At the moment I use a pc card connected with one of the I2S ports of the PWD . The sound improvement is enormes it is even bigger than the upgrade from the MK1 to the MK2 maybe twice that big . The only problem with this card is that it wont work on low ress because of a tech problem ( difference with the I2S protocol of the PWD ) but using Jriver upsampling all files to 176 and 192 on the fly the PWD only has to switch between the two samplerates . The clicks and pops are far less attended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will help to enjoy using the PWD you will even have gapless . For the best SQ you have to leave your bridge in the PWD using USB with firmware 2.4.3 if else the sound will be thinner . No clue why ! With all these bumps I still would not have missed the evolution . For what concerns the PWD its now time to enjoy ! <p> one and another excuse is the root that you want ? If yes , then you can keep asking PSA for such question otherwise its really make no sense . Because all of us know that we have raise such issue for at least one and half year . And next time it might have a perfect solution called indirectstream incase something happens on the new directstream .

@@23909415 @3909415/ <h> Complements <p> One of the reasons people tend to like the sound of single device amplifiers is inherent in their very design : a single sex device . By sex we are referring to the type of device ( in the same way as we might describe male vs. female ) . Tubes have only one sex but transistors have two : positive and negative devices . When both sex devices are used to form an amplifier we sometimes call this topology Complementary Symmetry because of its use of both sex transistors to amplify the music . <p> A classic complementary symmetry amplifier can take many forms , but the most common is the output stage of the amplifier . This is typically the current amplification stage and a simple schematic for this looks like this : <p> The vast majority of modern amplifiers and preamplifiers use a version of this classic design for their output stage . Not everyone is in agreement it is the best sounding topology . <p> I remember reading a paper by Nelson Pass on the beauty of designing a one sex amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music than any hed ever heard before . That it had major heat issues was n't a concern , not when the incredible sound was taken into consideration . Nelsons adventurous ( and one of the best designers we have today ) - and his- single sex device was his- foray into the exotic , but not his standard . Most of his designs incorporate both sex devices , as do mine and many others . <p> The way this circuit works is by splitting up the duties of amplifying the music into positive and negative halves . In the drawing above the transistor labeled NPN amplifies the positive half of any waveform while the PNP handles the negative going half . By splitting up the duties we gain much in terms of efficiency , as well we solve the problem of single amplifying devices I brought up a few days ago : their inability to push and pull power at the same rate . This complementary pair does symmetrical amplification all day along . But there are several- hitches ( is n't there always ? ) . <p> Tomorrow well see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 5 COMMENTS <p> I always have to grin when people say they would listen to an amplifier . In fact they are listening to a pair of loudspeakers and its room and amp interaction . I wonder why there is no common " listening-standard " . However there is no standard loudspeaker and no standard listening room , I assume . ; - ) <p> Ive read more than one time that a problem with complementary devices is that they 're not completely complementary . And that why some designers sometimes use PNP devices in pushpull ( push/push ? ) designs . <p> As an addition to my previous comment today . Tube amps are obviously done push/pull with non-complementary devices since they do n't  exist for tubes . I do know that David Berning and Murray Zeligman researched using FETs as a complementary device to tubes many decades ago . And patents were issued . But this was only for small signal tubes at the time such as 12 AX7s , not for output tubes . <p> Understanding how transistors work is much harder than understanding how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire between two electrodes controlling the flow of electrons in one direction between them . Understanding how transistors work requires knowledge of quantum physics and is much harder . It is also much harder to manufacture two opposite type transistors that have the exact mirror image characteristic curves than it is to manufacture two of the same type that are identical . Perhaps this is why most hi fi audio power amplifier output stages are quasi complimentary symmetry and not true complimentary symmetry designs . If they do n't  match exactly you have the same asymmetric harmonic distortion disadvantage you have with class A amplifiers . Why are they usually both NPN and not PNP ? I do n't  know but I 'd hazard a guess that its because the bias voltage polarity is the same as for tubes and it was a kind of holdover from the transition in the early 1960s . It has proven to be a good design for the last 50 years , a kind of workhorse that is reliable , well understood , and cheap to build . However while much more efficient than class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D and similar amplifier designs . Those amplifiers can deliver much more power in much lighter packages for much less money . I think they will eventually replace class AB amps as the ordinary vanilla design with digital signals straight through to the driver stage . Sorry to say it but I think the age of analog audio is drawing to a close just the way analog video did . Eventually it will be an historic curiosity for engineers to marvel that analog worked as well as it did . 
@@23909417 @3909417/ <h> Why does the DLIII DAC sound so much better than other DAC+GGs ? <p> Most DACs ( Digital to Analog converters ) regardless of their price use very similar D to A chipsets from only a handful of manufacturers like TI , Cirrus Logic and ESS ( Sabre ) . <p> While there are certainly differences in these DACs its unlikely any one would be singled out as significantly better sounding than the others . It turns out that the big differences we hear between DACs has far more to do with their analog output stages than anything else . A DAC has two parts as you might imagine . A digital side and an analog side . For a digital side with the same resolution and bit depth ( 44kHz to 192kHz and 16 bit to 24 bit ) the digital sides will be very similar . <p> The analog side is where the big differences lie . The type of circuit ( solid state or tube ) , the implementation of that circuit ( class A , high feedback , low feedback , IC or discrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds . <p> In the DLIII PS Audio leveraged its long history of DAC designs to great advantage ( we released the worlds first DAC to the high end ) . By eliminating all ICs in the analog output stage and implementing a fully discrete , class A , low feedback JFET design , the PS Audio DLIII manages to sound more open , sweeter , warmer and more like music than just about any DAC at any price . To pull every last bit of music out of the DLIII we also use a very large power supply . <p> The secret is in the analog stage and power supply and when evaluating DACs this is where you should be looking first .

@@23909421 @3909421/ <h> Downsampling <p> In yesterdays post 192kHz ? I explained how we wound up with the different sample rates . A convoluted story at best . Today I thought it might be interesting if I touched on a little known problem with pretty much all CDs . Downsampling . <p> Nearly all master digital studio recordings are made at higher sample rates and bit depths than a CD can handle , even if its only 48kHz . For example , Keith Johnson at Reference records all their materials at 176.4kHz/24 bits and nearly every recording studio is making masters at 96kHz/24 or higher . When a recording engineer is making a master recording of a group , a copy of a master analog tape etc. he is naturally going to make that master at the best possible resolution he can . Not at the lowest needed . <p> So what happens when we want to go make a CD version of that master tape ? The original master is downsampled to 44.1kHz/16 bits through a sample rate converter . Depending on what the engineer started with , downsampling clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . <p> How much of what we recognize as inferior playback of the CD , relative to high rez media , is due to this downsampling process ? <p> This practice , I am convinced , is one reason many CDs sound worse than their high resolution counterparts . If you read any of the thoughts by recording engineers on this practice , there are many that believe recording at higher rates and downsampling sounds better than keeping everything at the intended use rates . And then there are those that prefer upsampling . Clearly , there 's not much in the way of consensus . <p> In a conversation with Keith Johnson ( whose ears I trust completely ) he told me the single worst thing that ever happened to any of his work was the downsampling of the master tapes to CDs . He hated the results and I am sure this must have prompted their subsequent release of their HRx series with exact copies of the masters . Ill bet our friend Cookie Marenco of Blue Coast might have similar misgivings about downsampling . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PWT is obvious and immediate . But I do n't  believe it has as much to do with the increase in dynamic range and frequency response afforded by the higher resolution format as it does by the lack of downsampling . <p> Downsampling may be one of the worst things to ever happen to the CD and one of the central reasons we judge it so harshly . <p> It may also partially answer why we can make a digital copy of an analog event without much in the way of loss . We do n't  have to mess with the final result of the conversion , just play it back at whatever sample and bit rate we recorded it at . 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 5 COMMENTS <p> Thank you for the mention , Paul . I agree that downsampling does n't  help the sound of the CD . For that reason , we always mix simultaneously to DSD and 44.1 . In our commercial studio , we use the 44.1 to create the masters for disc replication . <p> We began doing the comparison tests about 20 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 48k to 44.1k and comparing that to the 44.1k . There was enough of a difference that we felt it better to record at 44.1k . Many audio engineers prefer taking the analog outputs of 48 and re-recording into 44.1 over the conversion . <p> When making a decision as to which audio to release for downloads , it can become quite complex . Many audio engineers , who I have deep respect for in our community , choose to mix/master the CD completely different than what might come out for SACD or high resolution . They feel they are optimizing the CD to compete with other CDs in the market ( like loudness , for instance ) . Another reason that comparison tests without knowledge of the source of the masters can be deceiving . <p> Regardless of anyones opinion of DSD vs PCM , we feel that releasing the audio from the mixes , provides the music listener a sonic experience the way the artist and engineer intended without conversion . Of course , the music listeners playback system makes a tremendous difference . For that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm working on a how-to paper for " Comparison Listening Tests " for our studio use . I 'll let you know when its done . : ) <p> Whatever data the recording was made at , native that is , is the best for playback . We need to return to the assumption that everything is audible ( even if we cant hear it right now ) . Also , you might want to consider if once downsampled , can the losses be recovered by upsampling ? I do n't  think so . I do not own any of Cookies downloads , so the next is from that place : <p> With due respect to all in the DSD camp ( an I am one ) , there are PCM recordings , ie , AIXs , that perform very well , arguably just as well . While I admit to questions still left , one has to look at remastering or mixing a digital recording in analog and why this " shortcut " for want of a better word is being used . Just as digital has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its technology , and those distortions and noises will be added back into the final digital product , no ? <p> As long as the music transports me , I do n't  really care what the media is . I do care why thoughand I do care to move the art forward . <p> Yes , downsampling causes an audible degradation . My friend Barry Diament of Soundkeeper Recordings has written that downsampling from 24/192 to 24/96 causes the biggest degradation ; going down to 16/44.1 is only a little worse . My own listening comparisons with sample tracks made from pristine , purist 24/192 or DSD masters and then downsampled to various rates has me agreeing with Barry . <p> But there is no question that mix studios by recording and mixing at 24/96 or higher and then downsampling for CD release can create better sounding CDs than they did when 16/44.1 or 48k was the professional digital standard , all else equal . Of course , its not exactly equal , because now they 're using much more dynamic compression . 16/44.1 is not so bad unless you add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , level riding ) and mix multiple tracks together . The digital artifacts are pretty bad . Working at 24/96 results in much , much cleaner-sounding mixes . Downsampling is audibly trivial compared to mixing with 16/44.1 tracks , given all the processing that typically goes on in a mixing session . <p> Ironically , one of the reasons that modern mixing and mastering sometimes sounds awful ( even on the 24/96 master ) is that engineers can push the compression to ridiculous levels without introducing obvious distortions of one type or another . The " credit " goes to better hardware and software working at higher bit and sample rates . The engineers could n't get away with that sort of compression in the days of tube compressors or 16/44.1 ProTools projects . <p> Perhaps it would be helpful for folks to learn why SRC might damage sound quality ( ignoring changes in resolution ) . Ultimately , how the conversion is done can make a big difference in my experience . I suspect that this will have to lead to a discussion of digital filters . Oversampling , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many computer audio playback softwares now allow for oversampling in the computer . Some DACs now accept 352.8 and 384 rates ( via async USB ) . Most DAC chips usually have a first OSF step that takes incoming data up to these 8x rates . Sometimes , one can do a better job with that first 8x OSF in the computer , with a custom filter setting , than what the 8x OSF does internally in the DAC . The playback software Audirvana for example , has very , vert sophisticated user configurable DFs where one can experiment with all kinds of filter configurations . In any case , seems like a discussion on digital filters , and the tradeoffs inherent in their designs would be appropriate here . Might be nice to use this as also a comparison between the differences between DSD/PCM.

@@23909425 @3909425/ <p> Exactly . However , with the PWD , as with almost every other DAC available cable quality counts . I will leave it to others to make specific recommendations . <p> Mind you , if you are planning on getting a DirectStream DAC it is reported to be very insensitive to cables , or even which input is used . You might save the money from a high end cable purchase and put it toward the DAC purchase . A number of us hope to verify this starting some time late April . <p> In order to feed the DirectStream DSD data from a SACD player , I wonder if some custom cable builder could construct a HDMI cable that conforms to the standard HDMI pin out pattern on one end , and the proprietary PS Audio I2S pin pattern on the other end . If the wires can cross over to the correct pin out to make the signals compatible , theoretically , could a DSD output from the HDMI DSD output be fed into the DirectStream ? I understand that both the Sony SCD-5400ES SACD player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSD . Any thoughts ? Or should we all be quiet about this before Sonys lawyers get involved ? <p> It is my understanding the Sony SCD XA-5400 utilizes a Sony technology called HATS , which is turned on , on the- 5400 HDMI output- at all times. - The receiver must also be equipped with HATS technology and on the receiver the HATS switch must be toggled to the on position , unlike the SACD player . The last HATS equipped receiver is now long discontinued- and at this point in time , like Sony always does , they have abandoned HATS , so the ultra nice multi-channel HDMI output on the 5400 ca n't be used , its completely useless , all that player can be used for is stereo , no multi-channel as there were no analog outputs on that model , as there were on the older Sony XA900ES , and I know this because I have both models , and I really jabbed at Sony for abandoning another technology ( HATS ) rendering that HDMI output worthless , just as they abandoned SACD ( DSD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the nerve to refer me to an old , out of date " expensive " receiver that had the HATS technology to use with my SCD XA-5400 SACD player , and obviously , I 'm not interested in any Sony receivers , period !

The reason for this- is more for the feature set similarity than sound similarity . <p> To my ears Sprout is just a better companion to my secondary listening room . I can work at my desk and listen to music all day long on Sprout . If someone comes in to chat I just turn the music down . With the NAD ( which is packed away to go to a vacation home ) , I was more likely to turn it off . Sprout is better balanced and crisper IMO. 
@@23909431 @3909431/ <p> I just received my Sprout tonight and have been impressed with the initial experience . I 'm streaming lossless files over bluetooth in two ways and am noticing audible difference in quality. - First , using JRiver Media Center on my Mac Mini , I connect directly via bluetooth . It sounds fantastic doing this ! However , the second route I 'm taking is using my iPhone 6 , which has JRemote ( JRivers iOS app ) . This streams the songs from my music server to my iPhone via wifi , then I am connecting that to Sprout over bluetooth . Going this route , I notice a drop in speed and impact in the way music is delivered . There 's just a bit less life . I 'm wondering if going the latter route is causing the audio files to go through the iPhones 6 DAC instead of being processed by the Wolfson DAC in the Sprout . Any thoughts ? <p> The reason I want to stream through my phone is because the music server is two rooms away , just a bit too far to access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files using that distance .

@@23909433 @3909433/ <h> Which parts matter most ? <p> Turntables can be expensive propositions , but the bulk of expense often lie in the table and platter themselves . <p> Yet sound quality wise , I would imagine the arm and cartridge to be bigger contributors . <p> Its the age-old question of where to put money : in the chassis and connectors or the circuitry they serve ? The table and platter , or the arm and cartridge that do the- reproduction ? The transport mechanism of a CD player , or the output circuitry it feeds ? <p> Of course , we understand it all matters , but decisions must be made and it can be confusing knowing which parts matter most . <p> My advice is to put your trust in the judgment of the companies building the kit you desire . <p> Let the results of the overall product be your guide . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 23 COMMENTS <p> I agree that with turntables ( assumed the table/platter has a certain level of quality itself ) arm and cartridge are more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily times where a big investment in the mechanical drive of digital was meaningful is over . <p> And I trust manufacturers ( definitely not all , but i.e. PSA ) that they make the right decisions , even if from my very superficial , unprofessional standpoint I might have expected slightly different approaches sporadically . I trust ( especially when talking about electronic design ) because I definitely have neither detailled experience nor knowledge in it . <p> Back in the day the conventional wisdom was that the beginning and end of your system were the most critical parts , so you spent your money on a good cartridge , then a good turntable , and got the best speakers you could afford . The amplifier , unless it was a complete dog , was less important . As for cables and interconnects , I can not ever remember any serious discussion about them other than that the cable into the pre-amp should be well shielded and earthed ! <p> With the transition to digital inputs , starting with the CD , the balance began to shift because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on the circuitry used to process it ; the buffering , error correction , and DACs . The electronics became more important . The trend has continued into the age of rips , downloads , and streaming . <p> At the output end the changes have been less radical , although small speakers seem to be capable of generating a much more acceptable sound than they could forty years ago . For me the choice of speaker is now the most important one you can make in determining how well your system sounds , and that should really be the focus of your attention , and your cash . However , as Paul says , everything matters . <p> Thanks for this comment , hit the nail right on the head regarding my feelings on things . I still think this way with much of my kit , the speakers being far more important from my point of view . As for the table , I have kept the same table for 40 years now but continue to upgrade and change cartridges . Great insight . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies building the kit you desire . " <p> That is a very good proposition to buy all the electronics from one manufacturer , and there is no reason why they should be in more than one or two boxes . <p> The market demands this . DACs , for example . In my short recent experience of 7 years or so many manufacturers have gone from basic outboard DACs , then included volume control ( like the PWD Mk2 I had ) , then further features such as phono as well as line inputs , networking , headphone outputs and finally streaming software on the network card . Having efficiently combined several components into a unit where they all work together seamlessly , they can work on the price and drip-down technology . For example , the leading quality DAC manufacturer in the UK developed its FPGA DAC for its top end product at a Directstream pricepoint and its top seller is now an FGPA DSD headphone DAC that costs less than the PSA Sprout . <p> With regard to turntables , most manufacturers and certainly the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Linn , Rega , VPI , Clearaudio , Pro-ject , SME are the ones I can think of . To mix and match is , I suspect , purely for the audio hobbyist . <p> With turntables , I consider the phono preamp as part of the front end . In my experience , the phono cartridge &amp; phono preamp combination is more important than the cartridge &amp; table . I have a VPI Traveler with a Dynavector 20x2L cartridge . The DV cartridge is a lot of cartridge for the lower level Traveler . <p> I recently changed my main preamp to one that has a very simple onboard MM phono stage with 2 12AX7 tubes . I needed MC capability for the DV cartridge and purchased a K&amp;K Audio MC step up transformer . That setup totally blows away the Simaudio Moon LP310 through a normal preamp input . So much so , that I sold the Simaudio . I doubt I could have gained that level of improvement with an upgraded table . The problem with trying out new tables is the setup . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mess with it . <p> Paul , I believe there is a parallel between vinyl playback and the PS Audio emphasis on AC power quality . The sexy , more variable pieces of the puzzle lie in the tune arm and cartridge ( and phono stage ) , as in the overall system the DAC , preamp , amps , and speakers ) , However , without a good foundation ( stable platform and very constant rotation , and proper dampening of the impact of the stylus in the groove as it propagates through the vinyl ) in a LP playback system , the sexy parts cant perform at their peak level , just as the overall system can not perform at peak level without high quality A.C. <p> The best way I found to eliminate vibration is put the turntable on a shelf screwed to a brick wall . This worked perfectly for me for years until the turntable went into a cabinet . Now I just avoid jumping around when I listen to records . A very popular vibration damper is a $50 platter mat . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like felt . Along with Sorbothane cut out of old pairs of trainers , it is a really good cheap fix . <p> I own a PS Audio P3 . I fully accept that it does a good job cleaning up poor power , which is important for some devices , but not all . However , the job is done by the power supply in my current unit , so the P3 is in its box in the loft . It is something that splits opinion . Besides being dependent on whether your equipment really needs clean power , at my own audio dealer there is one person who thinks clean power is absolutely vital and others who think it a pointless waste of time . <p> OK , I admit that the sorbothane that I put under the feet of my turntable was purchased from a spares shop . If I started cutting up my kids shoes there would be hell to pay , but they are made of the same stuff . <p> Speaking of turntables , and referring back to the last few days worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Memorial Day weekend was slow for my real estate business , with many of my clients out of town , so I took the opportunity to rip a couple of vinyl LPs to digital , which I had wanted to do for some time with some of mine not available on CD . Project went well enough , but , thinking of the " What if " segment , I made a short 30 second video of what I was doing and posted it on my Facebook feed . <p> I received five likes , and no comments . No one said , " what is that about " or " hey , I am into vinyl too , tell me more " or anything similar . No reaction whatsoever for the most part , and I have over 600 people in my feed . <p> My post about grilling a roast received dozens of comments and many likes , as did the post about my dog first experiencing water in the pool I brought home . Regarding audio.nothing . <p> Certainly tells me where peoples interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average person , teen aged and older , listens to music 3+ hours a day . Certainly they do , but as an auxiliary to other things as we have lamented and discussed . <p> Facebook is also quite insidious with their feeds . Once I posted on my vinyl subject and audio , I started to receive " suggested ads " from audio sites , specifically a component and speaker manufacturer I had never heard of out of Canada called Fluance . Those algorithms to drive ad dollars are something else ! <p> When it comes to real highend hifi I have stopped blindly trusting companies or brands but rather trust the design engineer and his knowledge of both technologies and ( ! ) psychoacoustics . Controllers rather care for the profits and budgets spent than for the quality . Sales guys rarely have any clue about the optimization process behind the product and finally have to ask the experts when there is a technical problem . What are the core technologies and USPS of a company in a globalize world where suppliers and subcontractors sell their core technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strength today in emotional selling propositions . Finally technical services has become that expensive that the endusers rather trade in for new product generations . <p> With me returning to vinyl arena I have gone with pieces that are easy to setup . I have found Pro ject to be a good fit as well as the Ortofon carts . I currently own the 1.3 Genie table with a 2M blue cart . I like the idea of the interchange option with the 2M series . As for a phono stage I own a Acoustic Signature Tango that has a outboard power supply that uses a iec plug vs the wall wart supplies found on most . No doubt a entry level setup but musical . The Zu Audio mission ICs used between the table and phono stage are a step in the right direction thus far . At some point I would like to upgrade the phono stage , cart , and ICs but not in any rush . <p> The parts that mater most for a turntable are starting with the most important and where cost is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without this it will not work . 2 The on off switch . Even with an operating power cord if this part malfunctions it still wont work 3 The motor . If this malfunctions it wont work 4 Belts or idler wheels , again critical to operation . 5 Cartridge mounting and tonearm wiring , again critical to operation <p> All other parts will give varying degrees of results . I have my favorites , you probably have yours and I 'm sure we do n't  agree . <p> This question is like the blind men and the elephant . In audio and acoustics ! everything matters . The signal is sacred , everything that touches it ( including epoxy circuit boards ) adds distortion* , and once damaged it ca n't be fixed . <p> What makes this question a theoretical exercise is that distortion compounds geometrically and interactively . Distortion of distortion sounds worse than distortion of signal . This increases the complexity of sorting out where the distortion originates and its impact , because changing your speakers affects the audible distortion of the amplifier , and vice-versa . Transducers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and speaker impedance can trigger nasty sounds and even kill amps . Turntables are a finely tuned collection of resonances , from the cartridge compliance to the ground it sits on . Few are out of reach of post-industrial vibration , electro-magnetic and radio frequency interference , and rejecting those is important too . <p> Further , all recordings have their own stew of distortions . I have been through two complete rounds of chasing the distortion and come to the same conclusion : the performance , recording and the rooms matter the most besides outright incompetence . These factors are the least controllable by consumers . This is why you quickly hit diminishing returns , confusion and contradictory results when comparing music to reproduction . The amounts of money spent and the appeal of shiny objects conspire to produce false satisfaction with the latter , not to mention the near universal overbearing and annoying sound at live events that is not worth emulating . <p> I have a listenable system on my desk that cost $500 . With six figure systems the reproduction is usually better , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording . <p> The distortions that bug me the most are : <p> 0 ) Clipping and digital file compression . ( 1 ? dome tweeters clip on real musical transients ) 1 ) Digital reverb 2 ) Other digital processing EQ , limiting , compression , gating . Note that digital processing inherently smears timing and phase and produces thousands of rounding errors . Even if each individual process is nearly transparent , a chain always develops fatiguing " digititus " . 3 ) Multi-tracking and mixing mixing is spatial distortion , all audio chains should be one mic to one speaker 4 ) Splicing and overdubbing performances need to be simultaneous in one continuous take with all the performers in one acoustic space , no separators or headphones . They need to breathe the same air . I can hear the INTENTION to splice , it changes the attitude of the musicians as they focus on the notes instead of the overall arc . Overdubbing changes the conversation into a series of reactions . Only a psychopath or a computer can record a " perfect " take but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close miking , colored mics . Typical are Neumann U87 and Shure SM58 " vocal mics " , which were developed for singers who ca n't sing . 6 ) Wrong room for content , like recording Bach in a Catholic cathedral or symphonic hall . He was a Lutheran , dammit ! I also found the Cowboy Junkies " The Trinity Sessions " ironic and anomalous , playing the Devils music in a house of worship . <p> I got the 2L 2-records-set of ENGEG+RD QUARTET playing Franz Schubert , Benjamin Britten and Joseph Haydn . Very fine recorded . Nevertheless I prefer " Rosamunde " for instance on the old EMI Classics played by the Alban Berg Quartett . Even the 4G CD touches me more than the 2L recording . Like so often one gets the premium artists on the big labels . A second thought I would miss a lot of my favourite music from ABBA to ZZ Top if I do not want to hear multitrack and mixing . Maybe that does n't  matter to you but to me . <p> Once I see something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  change unless it is broken beyond repair or I see something I like much better . Of course I 'm a sucker for something good at fire sale prices like anyone else but I do n't  go out of my way just to see what the latest and greatest according to ads and reviews are . As far as turntables and cartridges go I 'm still very happy with my Empire turntables and Empire and Shure cartridges . Even after decades and seeing turntables that cost many times what mine cost I would n't think of trading . I 've also got others and they work fine too but those are my favorites . Best one , Empire 698 with a Shure V15 type V MR . Also the nicest looking one Ive seen ( IMO . ) Built like a tank . Even the base and dust cover are real teak and real glass . <p> The platter is like an iceberg . What you see is a trim piece . What you do n't  see is an 8 pound individually balanced aluminum casting with an individually matched huge journal bearing machined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced ( the center of mass is at the pivot point ) and the bearings are sapphires . Tracking force is applied with a long mainspring , not a weight imbalance . <p> With turntables we need " good . " There is no " best . " Its an illusion to think there is . No turntable and arm combination can be neutral let alone the cartridges . Having owned a Merrill Heirloom TT and the Grado Signature arm ( with litz phono cables ) .. I speak from experience . And , several other high end tables . As long as you do not hear rumble , nor wow and flutter ? There is no best . <p> Just choose your toppings . Maybe try a few different table combinations to find the colorations that pleases your DNA . Then , you found the best for you . And , enjoy ! ; ) <p> Acuvoxs ( 6 ) is priceless ! But a fair point . Jordi Savall has a habit of recording in the original performance location 400 to 500 years ago , which is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit unusual in that it was made by a non-audio company and is the only audio component they ever made . They are precision engineers with CNC and other equipment that audio engineers would only dream about . They fabricate mostly for the aerospace , medical , subsea and such industries . How they came to make it is a long story , but one thing is for sure , it is probably one of the highest manufacturing quality audio items you will ever see . It is not for the tweaker . The arm mounts are individually manufactured ( in CNC aluminium ) to the precise length specified by the arm manufacturer . Audiophiles would be driven crazy by it . <p> I 've had the same arm/cartridge combo on a number of different tables and I can attest to the fact that the table is a bigger contributor to the overall sound of the front end than the arm/cartridge combo and not by a little bit . A better table let 's any arm/cartridge combo perform better than the same combo on a lesser table .

@@23909439 @3909439/ <h> Bleeding music <p> In my post of a few days ago , Steve Hoffman , he mentions on his cheap Henry Mancini CD there 's really good bleed that he likes to listen to as a means of evaluating equipments ability to resolve small details . Several of you caught that reference and asked me to explain what he meant . <p> Bleed refers to tape bleed a ghosting you can hear on some cuts of music . A good example is one I 've used often , the Shelby Lynne title track Just a little lovin . In the middle of the song , the band stops playing , there 's a pause and Shelby sings alone just for a moment . If you listen closely when she sings : <p> This old world , - would n't be half as bad , - It would n't be half as sad , - If each and everybody in it had , yeah <p> Half a second before the first line quoted in the lyrics , you can hear a ghost of her singing This old world just before she actually sings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tape bleed happens when the tape has been around for a while and the layers of tape sit close to each other on the reel . Because tape is a magnetic medium , each layer slightly magnetizes the layers above and below when tightly wound on the reel . If they sit long enough on the reel , this bleed happens to every turn of tape . You only hear the bleed when the musicians stop playing for a brief moment . <p> Thats tape bleed . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 22 COMMENTS <p> Fine description of tape bleed/print through , but I think Mr. Hoffman is actually talking about Microphone bleed , especially with his references to hearing the room . When they used to record everybody all at once in a big studio , and the engineer was less than careful ( or purposefully less than careful ) about where he placed the microphones , you got " bleed " : the guitar mic picking up some of the drums , say , or the mic placed in front of the background singers getting some of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy accident ( or again with intent in the hands of the best engineers ) . You get the room , you get an aural picture of the recording space . Think classic Blue Note , or Brubeck/Miles via Columbia in the 1950sgreat music , but also great recordings with a sense of where the players actually were as they played . Holy holographic ! <p> Right . More commonly known as " print through " , " bleed " usually refers to instruments feeding into each others microphones during recording . There is another phenomenon related to print through that occurs on LP records where the outer groove wall is effected by the adjacent modulations of the inner groove wall next door creating a ghost image that predicts the sounds to come . Usually happens when its quiet right before the song begins . <p> I am with j Haynes . In this sorry Paul . But tape bleed is what you state . And in so we are showing both our age and having good systems . What they do in studios , to stop bleed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from studio , s often in recordings . Hell its sign of good equipment as only the good stuff gives us these little deatils we cherish so much . If the setup and recording g is good enough you can here the echo reflect a second time . Such a cd is Kansas City shout on Pablo rec , count Basie . Even with just voices if setup right you can here his voice echo as he sings . Al <p> Yes , the " bleed " Steve refers to is the microphones pickup of adjacent sounds and the acoustic environments . One can hear this effect clearly in all classical recordings and mostly older jazz and pop recordings because of the relative distances of the mics to performers on such recordings . Modern pop and quite a few modern jazz recordings do n't  have " bleed " for several reasons : 1 ) the mics are usually quite close to the performers or instruments , 2 ) the performers/instruments were isolated from each other at the studio , or 3 ) individual instruments may have been recorded piecemeal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " performance together ever took place for the recording . #3 is how almost all modern pop production takes place and its been that way for decades now . <p> As described previously , there is analog tape " print-through " where the magnetic signal from one layer of tape is transferred to the next layer . On vinyl , there also can be a pre- and post-echo effect which can sound much the same as analog tape print-through . The groove modulation of one revolution is transferred or impressed upon the next or previous revolution ( or two ) of the disk . This effect happens when 1 ) the groove pitch is too tight ( the groove spacing is too close ) when the lacquer master is cut , or 2 ) the record press pressure is set too high and the grooves are distorted during the pressing process . During the cutting of the lacquer master , the disk mastering engineer ordinarily will expand the disk cutting pitch for several revolutions at the beginning of each track to minimize pre-echo , especially if the opening notes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting . Post-echo at the lacquer cutting stage is prevented again by setting the cutting pitch appropriately . If a loud sound precedes a quiet passage , the cutting pitch is kept coarse by at least one revolution to prevent the loud sound from being impressed upon the following quieter passage . The cutting pitch and groove depth is continuously adjusted throughout the disk side by the disk cutting computer which is fed by the preview signal of the analog tape deck or digital playback source . The preview signal is one revolution ( set by the disk rotational speed ) ahead of the recorded signal . The cutting engineer can make manual adjustments to the cutting pitch and depth as needed . <p> Pre- and post-echo caused by record press pressure is prevented by press operation of an experienced operator who knows to look for such problems . <p> As I understood it , what you heard was called " pre-echo " and it was said to be the result of " print through " on the tape . I always wondered if this was the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead due to the cutting stylus deforming the previous outer groove in addition to the one it was cutting . This possibility occurred to me because I never heard a corresponding post echo which should occur with print through of the tape . I did n't  need a very good sound system to hear it , it was audible with a Sonotone 8TA cartridge and later with an Empire 880P cartridge . I think one record you can hear it on is Harry Belafonte at Carnegie Hall . This is one kind of distortion you NEVER get with DDD CDs . The only way to know for sure would be to listen to the tapeor a CD made from the tape in a later re-issue to see if it is present there too . I never cared enough about it to investigate it myself . I agree with the others who say you misinterpreted what Steve Hoffman meant when he said " Many of the songs have great bleed , you can hear the studio , the chorus , etc. in a real space . " While I may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can even hear it at all , one thing I can hear and can focus on is real space as expressed in sound.and these recordings and sound systems do n't  have it . I think anyone with normal hearing can learn to hear it . Just ask Daniel Kish , the blind man who taught himself to see using sound if it is n't true . <p> I 'm a show me kinda guy . I 'm a little dubious about tape " print through . " To magnetize a magnetic tape requires a high frequency bias superimposed that 's from 40 kHz to 150 kHz and at least ten times more powerful than the recording signal . I 'm not saying it is n't possible that tape print through happens but I 'd like some documentation of someone having studied the phenomenon just to let me know its more than one more unproven theory . http : **32;1299;TOOLONG <p> here 's a reference to tape print through . It can happen but to what degree does it occur when the vinyl recording is made not long after the tape has been recorded and using 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or polyester ribbon ? http : **37;1333;TOOLONG Notice that print though is also referred to as bleed through . Ya larns sompin new everee day . <p> I hear music as a conversation , and separating the musicians in space or time destroys the interaction . The biggest selling bands in history were the house bands at Motown and Stax Records , and the Wrecking Crew . At Motown everybody crowded into Berry Gordys basement , and Phil Ramones trademark sound was locating a mic or two in a place in the room where all the sound was bleed . Likewise the Stax crew , AKA " Booker T and the MGs " or the Blues Brothers band recorded together in a converted movie theater making hits for Otis Redding , Wilson Pickett , Sam &amp; Dave , Isaac Hayes et al . The Wrecking Crew were an informal group of studio musicians who traveled around LA making most of the 60s hits from that town . The " music factory " approach had the whole album captured in a day or two , like recording in the Big Band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preceded it . The advent of commercial multi-track tape decks coincided appropriately with psychedelia , which was about fantasies . If you want to get real , you have to play the whole song from beginning to end together in the same room with room " bleed " . <p> The print through phenomenon is/was quite common in recording . In spite of the thick backing which was applied to improve contact between the pressure roller and the capstan , it was also there to reduce print through effect . To further reduce the effect , we would allow the reel to " wind off " as if playing to the end and leaving it on the take-up reel . The now new empty reel would become the next reels take-up reel and so on . The reason this was/is done , was so the print through would be reduced when the reel was rewound for playback , mixing of the multitrack or any time the 2-track master was used . <p> Take this with a grain of salt if you wish , but this is what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording as a gofer/2nd engineer in the studio . Those guys were gods to me then and I took their words as gospel . Auditioning the reel after the rewind secured this technique in my repertoire for future use . I could hear a reduction and that was good enough reason to use it . <p> I 've occasionally dabbled in multitrack recording of friends bands . In a real studio there are more options for instrument placement than at someones garage or practice space . Ive used mic nulls to minimize , but for one group ( who shall remain nameless ) the guitarist/singer did not want to overdub . Problem was , the instruments were as loud in the vocal mic as he was . In mixing I had to leave the vocal mic up throughout each piece and tailor the instrument sound around the bleed . If I tried muting or lowering the mic track when he did n't  sing , it was painfully obvious . The results werent pretty . " Good tone " went out the window <p> I 'd have used a supercardioid or shotgun mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mike was pointing away from the instruments , and maybe put the singer behind the instruments . Or you could just have dubbed the singing in separately using sound on sound . Watching people perform at recording sessions with headphones on , it seems to me a lot of recordings are made that way . <p> I was using a hypercardioid . No chance to move anything around in a 12 ' square room full of 3 bands equipment . Barely room for me and my small kit to squeeze into the area by the door ; had to move my case to go in or out . They also played quite loudly . To be fair , this was band practice I was recording . We all agreed that to do anything serious something would have to change . Then the band broke up <p> I was very easily able to hear the " bleed " ( regardless of how it got on the recording ) with my headphones on all three of my home stereo systems including my iPhone at reasonable listening levels . I was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume levels far far above what I would ever listen to . I generally listen with my volume set to send about 60db at my listening position maximum , what kind of volume levels are you listening to in order to hear this easily in your system , or do you also have to turn it way up to hear the bleed ?

My apologies to PSA for interfering with commerce but it seems to make sense at this point in time . <p> After getting an OPPO-105D 6 months ago , I was told by their tech dept. that there was no way to output the digital stream from SACD , that it was copy protected . I have a large collection of CDs and SACDs which is all I play . When the DS DAC was announced , PS Audio said nothing about decoding SACD-only CD , which eliminated this DAC from my consideration . <p> Now I find out that the OPPO outputs SACD DSD through the two HDMI ports which are not copy-protected by Sony- and that the DS DAC has an HDMI input . It took the Follow-UP article on the DS DAC- in the current Stereophile- to clue me in on this . So what the hell gives ? ? Why is SACD decoding kept as some big secret by the manufacturers- ? ? Or is SACD decoding not worth PS audios mention in all their promos of the DS DAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has I2S inputs that use HDMI cables but it would not recognize or decode- an HDMI signal . To the best of my knowledge , SACD audio over HDMI is encrypted- and- manufacturers who build receivers that accept it are paying royalties to Sony . There was no easy way to incorporate SACD playback into the DS or they would have ( Ted Smith has a lot of SACDs ) . The DS can play DSD files ( SACD is essentially single-rate DSD ) that are purchased as downloads or ripped from SACDs ( a process that is not easy ) . <p> Ned , Stevem2 is correct , SACD must be encrypted when output over HDMI or another proprietary link . Esoteric and Meitner are a couple of manufacturers that use a proprietary link to send raw SACD data from their transport to their DAC . PS Audio never brought it up since it is in violation of Sonys patent to send the data unencrypted . NO ONE sends it unencrypted in a production unit . The only exception , which Paul says is illegal ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vanity board upgrade for the Oppo 103 ( not the 105 ) . Do a search if you 're curious . There are also ways to rip an SACD with a hacked PlayStation 3 , but that too is of questionable legality ( Computer Audiophile has a Very long post on this ) . - Paul and/or others here have also said to allow the DS to accept an encrypted data stream would require a license from Sony and possibly for the HDMI receiver if they chose that route . This would entail significant cost and was not what PS Audio wanted to do . Now if someone could just convince Sony the encryption is no longer a necessary requirement ( unencrypted DSD files are easy to find now , which was n't the case when SACD was introduced ) we would be golden ( yup , I 'm dreaming ) . - <p> I think that I understand what you all are saying . I was misled by OPPOs response as follows ; <p> " Most DACs are using digital coaxial and optical , which will not allow you to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use HDMI , however , you can send DSD or PCM to a compatible receiving device , which would include any de-embedder or DAC which has HDMI inputs " . <p> I thought this meant that OPPO was sending- the signal- un-encrypted allowing the DS DAC to read it w/o a license .

@@23909454 @3909454/ <p> After playing records through the NPCs phono stage for a couple of weeks , last weekend I made my first attempt at ripping a record using Vinyl Studio ( http : //www.alpinesoft.co.uk/ ) . I ran into one problem ( see below ) but think I should mention two resources for those who , like me , are new to this process : <p> a ) Vinyl Studio is definitely worth a look . I have n't tried all the other software out there , but I can say that Vinyl Studio is well organized and provides a logical workflow much easier than Audacity , which can be made to work but is not really designed for recording records and is limited to 16/44 . <p> b ) there 's a nice discussion of the process of ripping vinyl at http : **25;1372;TOOLONG .. izing-lps/ . While I do n't  agree with his decision to record MP3s , the article gives a good overview of what 's involved and would be useful for anyone just getting started at this . <p> Now the problem : my first recording has crackling sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad . I 'm not sure about the source of this noise . It could come from : a ) an incorrect setting in Vinyl Studio . I read the manual carefully and think I got everything right , but I could have overlooked something . b ) an issue with my laptop . Its a Win7 machine , very basic , purchased at the office supply store and not tweaked for audio , although it does have 4GB of memory . c ) RFI being broadcast in the vicinity of the NPC . My Synology NAS and an Airport Extreme sit on the shelf below the NPC , and PWD on a shelf to the right . No issues when playing through the NPC phono stage , though . d ) the USB cable ; its a new AudioQuest , so I doubt this is the problem , but who knows . e ) a problem in the NPC ; I would suspect a-c , but again , its a possibility . <p> I do n't  have another laptop to use for testing . Any ideas about what 's causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rip vinyl ? If so , please share your experiences . <p> It is hard to describe noises of course , but from your description I bet it is a clock synch problem between the NPC and your computer/recording . This is a constant , pulsing noise which sounds a bit like slowly tearing fabric a " ripping " sort of noise . You can hear the music fine as well , but would not want to listen to it . <p> I suggest increasing the buffer size in the recording software , as well as the latency if you have this to adjust . ( You do not care if there is a bit of latency as you are not going to record anything on top of the LP , such as singing along . ) Check all your other audio input settings as well . For example , check to be sure that the sync source is set to the correct digital input Turn off all unused inputs and outputs , if you can , etc . <p> Make sure the sample rate of the NPC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the software to sync to the incoming clock . <p> Perhaps there is a gain staging issue ( where the input level expected by the software is lower/higher than what NPC is providing . ) Make sure , for example , you are not recording line level out into a mic input . While this is an analog example , there are similar issues . <p> If you can post a snippet ( five to ten seconds will do ) we may be able to help diagnosing the issue . <p> If you record " silence " ( no record playing , but everything hooked up and on ) do you get this noise ? Have you tried recording another source , such as digitizing the output of a CDP or MP3 player ? <p> Do you have a mic with a 3/8 ? jack you can plug into the laptop and record this ? ( change the input setting on your recording software to mic in ) . This bypasses the NPC all together . If this records cleanly it probably is an interfacing problem and not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum somewhere . Have you posted your question on their forum ? <p> I have the gain in the NPC set almost to the maximum because I have a fairly low output cartridge . Even so , the level indicators in Vinyl Studio are showing only 30/40% nowhere near the red line that you do n't  want to cross . This seems odd to me but I could n't figure out what to do about it . <p> I 'm going to be away for a couple of days on business . This weekend I will try recording silence from the NPC and also try a mic . The latter is a good idea because it will help me figure out if its a vinyl studio problem or an issue in my computer . I think I did adjust the buffer size but will doublecheck that . Thanks for your suggestions ! <p> Let us know how your additional experiments work out . It appears so far that you are doing things in the best way possible . <p> The 30 40% level indication is very suspicious . My guess is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably an input ) and by cranking up the level on the NPC an input is being overloaded . This will result in digital distortion which is crackly as you describe , much nastier than analog distortion . <p> Is the signal going through a Windows control panel , such as Realtec ? Are you using ASIO ? ( ASIO bypasses everything Windows ) . <p> I suggest checking the levels set in Windows ( Start menu-&gt;Control Panel-&gt; Sound ) . Make sure the levels for the USB device is set at 100% , no enhancements are on , etc . <p> I also have a new NPC. love it for playing vinyl directly into PWD and then into an Octave V-110 . Sounds great ! I want to try ripping now and I am looking for recommendations for software . I am aware of audacity , but have heard it is not for the novice . What else do any of you use and why ? I plan to dedicate an audio PC to the task , but I also have a mac as well . Thanks <p> @magister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchecking Use WASAPI for recording in VinylStudios Check Level dialog and see if the problem goes away . WASAPI , although the preferred option , sometimes misbehaves . <p> If this works for you , you should also change Windows shared recording format to match the settings you are using in VinylStudio . This is done in the Sound section of the Windows Control Panel . I can provide more details if you need them . <p> Thinking about this further . . . As he is using an ASIO driver , which bypasses WASAPI , it makes sense to try actively " turning off " the programs access to WASAPI . If the program tries to talk to two layers simultaneously ( WASAPI and ASIO ) there could easily be issues . <p> Reading these posts made my day . Its terrific that Vinyl Studio will support DSD , and a big thanks to Paul S. for getting involved in this forum . I have the PS Audio driver set as my default in Windows , and it appears ( if I recall correctly ) in the pull-down menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ASIO and WASAPI business I do remember seeing an ASIO driver in the folder I unzipped before installing the NPC software from PSA . <p> As I said in my original post , I 'm away from home right now . Ill be back on Friday but am going to a concert that night ( live music : ) ) so Ill mess with the NPC on Saturday and post a sample if I cant get things to work right . The comments here suggest that its a software issue , not a hardware problem , which would be niceeven though I am looking to get a new computer for audio purposes to replace the laptop , I 'm still shopping and do n't  have an alternative at the moment . <p> WASAPI ( Windows Audio Session API ) is the Windows way of talking to audio devices in Windows Vista and later . You can turn it off in VinylStudio , in which case it falls back to an older mechanism supported by Windows XP called MME , or multi-media extensions . As I say , this sometimes works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control Panel to get the best results . <p> ASIO ( Audio Stream Input/Output ) is a third-party mechanism designed by a company called Steinberg which allows applications to bypass Windows completely and talk to the hardware essentially direct , at the cost of needing an ASIO driver provided ( normally ) by the hardware manufacturer . <p> As Elk suggested , I would give ASIO a try . Nothing to lose . I 'm not sure how you install the NPCs ASIO driver , but that is a requirement . Also , as already suggested , when using the Windows driver try unchecking Use WASAPI for recording in VinylStudios Check Level dialog . So you have three options . Let 's hope one of them works : ) <p> As promised , I experimented on Saturday but could not access the PSA site until today . Heres what happened : <p> Unchecking " Use WASAPI " eliminated the static sound . The Input Source is the default recording device , which is the PSA Audio driver that I had previously installed . IIUC , PSA supplies an ASIO driver , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Problem #1 solved . <p> Problem #2 was the gain level . I had the slider all the way to the top but the loudest passages in my test recording only got halfway up , nowhere near the red zone , with most passages between 15 and 30% . I play most classical music between 45 and 55 , as shown by the volume numbers on my preamp . Despite the seemingly very low level of my test , also a classical album , I played it back around 60 so the level was apparently not as low as the check level indicators suggested , although I would like to record at a somewhat higher level . Because of my low-output cartridge , I have the gain in the NPC set pretty high for normal LP playback ( third level from the top , out of 20 or so levels of gain available ) . Turning the gain up one level in the NPC helped a little , but not much . <p> In the Vinyl Studio help file under " Record Level , " above the third screenshot it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vista or later , the Check Level dialog might look like this . " I have Win7 and the NPC is obviously a USB device , but I do not see the item " Set digital gain to 1 ( recommended ) " that is shown directly under the input source in the screenshot . Nor could I find such a control in the menus . Could this be involved in the low recording level ? <p> It make sense . After you get the level issue resolved I suggest you go back and make sure you are using an ASIO driver and Windows layer . It will sound better than going through Windows which I believe is happening now . <p> I do not have an NPC , but my experience suggests using all of the available gain of the NPC . There is no reason I know of to throw away clean source gain that is not overriding an input . <p> I have never used Vinyl Studio either ( I know , big help am I ) . I hope Paul comes back to assist with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting digital files that when played back are comparable in volume to the original analog source ? If so , your overall gain staging is probably pretty good . You will know fi there is a problem if the digital files is noisier than the original ( noise floor too high ) or if there is distortion on the loud passages ( an input being oversaturated ) . <p> If the file sounds good , but is quieter than you prefer you can always boost the overall level of the digital file later in post . Vinyl Studio appears to have a very easy to use normalization function . A simple volume post in the digital realm will not affect the quality of the sound . <p> Elk said : There is no reason I know of to throw away clean source gain that is not overriding an input . <p> Interesting . Somewhere , years ago , I picked up the idea that one should not set gain in a phono stage higher than necessary . Do n't  remember the reasoning at this point . Setting the NPCs gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to be for ripping vinyl ( as opposed to playing a record for regular listening ) . <p> Elk said : there is a problem if the digital files is noisier than the original ( noise floor too high ) or if there is distortion on the loud passages ( an input being oversaturated ) <p> Certainly no distortion , and not much if any noise . But I would not call the recording comparable to the original since I play the record in question at about 50 ( preamp volume ) for regular listening but had to play the rip at 60 to get it to sound about the same . <p> Elk said : Vinyl Studio appears to have a very easy to use normalization function . <p> Yes , I saw this in the Vinyl Studio manual . So there is a workaround if I cant actually get more gain . <p> Elk said : A simple volume post in the digital realm will not affect the quality of the sound . <p> Thanks , that is good to know . I am a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> magister said : Somewhere , years ago , I picked up the idea that one should not set gain in a phono stage higher than necessary . <p> This is because phono pres are very sensitive and can pick up lots of RFI/EMI . If you do not need the gain lower gain settings may pick up less noise , keeping your noise floor lower . You then can make up for the lower overall gain by turning up your preamp . This is a great example of dealing with gain staging issues . <p> Here , I am assuming the level control you are changing is digital as you wrote of 20 levels of gain . There are usually only three or four analog gain setting on a phono pre . I infer from 20 that it is a digital volume control and thus one should use all of the gain if you need it . ( Of course , the NPC may have digital switching of analog gain devices or something else going one that allows this level of control . ) <p> I believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the gain stages are based on the Gain Cell design and the gain control is not in the circuit path . The phono gain is set with dip switches on the back panel , thus the steps . <p> I believe that there should be a separate gain setting for the A/D too , probably accessible from the menus and probably also from the USB connection . This should be double-checked if it has not already . <p> Unchecking " Use WASAPI " eliminated the static sound . The Input Source is the default recording device , which is the PSA Audio driver that I had previously installed . IIUC , PSA supplies an ASIO driver , so maybe there was some conflict between that and WASAPI . Problem #1 solved . <p> In the Vinyl Studio help file under " Record Level , " above the third screenshot it says " If you have a USB device on Windows Vista or later , the Check Level dialog might look like this . " I have Win7 and the NPC is obviously a USB device , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( recommended ) " that is shown directly under the input source in the screenshot . Nor could I find such a control in the menus . Could this be involved in the low recording level ? <p> I have now got my grubby paws on an NPC for testing and I have finally got to the bottom of this . The short version is to avoid using WASAPI in VinylStudio with the NPC under Windows until we work around a driver problem , which we will do in the next release . Essentially , the driver lies about the buffer size which upsets VinylStudios polling mechanism , but , as I say , we can fix it . There is also another issue which makes using WASAPI undesirable with the NPC but I will pass over that for now . <p> So , in the meantime , either : <p> uncheck Use WASAPI for Recording and set Windows shared recording format ( sample rate and bit depth ) to whatever settings you are using in VinylStudio <p> use the ASIO driver ( select ASIO as the Input Source in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first solution has the advantage that you retain control over the recording level via the slider in VinylStudios Check Level dialog , which is useful . The second is simpler . To set Windows shared recording format , see the following link kindly provided by one of our rivals : ) <p> Do n't  worry about the Set Digital Gain to 1 thing . That 's for budget USB devices that offer no control over the recording level . With such devices , Windows scales the incoming data in the digital domain unless you do this , which is highly undesirable . <p> uncheck Use WASAPI for Recording and set Windows shared recording format ( sample rate and bit depth ) to whatever settings you are using in VinylStudio <p> use the ASIO driver ( select ASIO as the Input Source in VinylStudios Check Level dialog to do this ) <p> When I unzipped the file I downloaded to install the PSA USB driver , I noticed an " ASIO " item along with other stuff . So I 'm guessing that an ASIO driver is built into what PSA supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no separate ASIO choice , just the PSA driver . With my test recordings using the PSA driver , I did have control over the level using Vinyl Studios sliders , although the level was lower than I expected it to be ( as I explained earlier ) . <p> Paul , do you have any comments on the recording level issue ? Could the fact that I was recording at 24/96 have an impact on the level ? In another thread on compression and the NPC , Paul M. mentioned that he needed to raise the gain to take advantage of 24/96 is this the same issue I experienced ? <p> magister said : So I 'm guessing that an ASIO driver is built into what PSA supplies , <p> Yes , it is an ASIO driver . <p> magister said : Could the fact that I was recording at 24/96 have an impact on the level ? <p> Not unless there is a bug in Vinyl Studio which screws up the volume when recording 96/24 . I am certain this is not the case . : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22/8 and any other digital resolution and bit depth are the same . A greater sampling rate or bit-depth merely allows one to record with finer granularity , greater detail ( and quieter sounds ) . The peak volume , RMS volume , lowest volume all are the same . Regardless of format . <p> One does not , and can not , " raise the gain to take advantage of 96/24. " 96/24 can not record a louder sound than 44/16 can . The peak level of 0dBFS ( full scale ) , the loudest possible digital level , is always the same regardless of bit depth or resolution . <p> Of course , if the sound you want to record is less than 0dBFS you can always raise the input level to make a louder recording . Again , this is the same regardless of digital format . For example , if the peak level of the recording is -6dB , one can raise the level by 6dB . This is true for 44/16 and 96/24.

@@23909462 @3909462/ <h> Back to Basics <h> Simple Subwoofer Setup <p> Very few loudspeakers are full range . Yes , - nearly all extend- higher than we humans can hear , but rarely as low . <p> Audio setup guru Jim Smith , in his continuing series on Subwoofery , is covering a lot the specific details on why you need a subwoofer and what 's involved in its setup . For the rest of us its helpful to start at the beginning , keeping it simple . <h> Why speakers measure one way and sound another <p> Though full range loudspeakers may advertise their low frequency response as going down as low as- 30Hz or even 20Hz , it is rare they achieve this in your room . <p> When speaker manufacturers measure the response of their- products a microphone is placed a few feet from the speaker ( 1 meter , to be exact ) . This close , speakers can produce very low frequencies , but those low notes do n't  necessarily reach your listening position " where it counts . So , nearfield measurements of the kind speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is one reason most speakers fail to deliver low bass in a typical room . <p> There are two main reasons for this : too small a woofer to effectively couple the air in your room , and placement . It is to the latter issue we will focus our subwoofer basics column . <h> Bass reproduces differently in your room <p> Bass is not consistent within your room . Depending on where your speakers are , compared to where you are , the bass may be very different . - Heres an experiment you can easily make . Find a track with good bass on it . I like Brian Brombergs Wood . Its an excellent recording and should have deep bass with great presence . As Bromberg is playing , walk around your room and note just how different the strength of bass notes are . Make sure you walk into the corners of the room too . Notice anything ? Sure , bass collects up in the corners . You might also notice that in the middle of your room , there 's likely very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front wall , the corners , and the bass will be stronger . <p> Everything we hear is actually sound pressure changes : - air pressure that comes in waves . High frequencies have short waves ( often measured in increments of an inch ) while low frequencies have long waves ( often measured in many feet ) . - A 20Hz bass note is approximately 50 feet long ! Air pressure waves of this length bunch up at the boundaries of your room , like walls and corners . <h> Do you need- a subwoofer ? <p> Unless your loudspeaker has a built in subwoofer , chances are excellent your system would benefit from the addition of an aftermarket sub . <h> Where do you place- it ? <p> Our first inclination would be to place the new subwoofer in the same place our existing full range speaker is . That 's typically exactly where you do n't  want it to be . And here 's why . <p> The best place for imaging and mid to high frequency reproduction from a loudspeaker is almost never the best place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never where you 're sitting , either . <p> Now that we understand the subwoofer is likely not going to be placed where our speakers are now , the obvious question is , where to place it ? <h> Simple way to place it <p> Since we know the- best bass reproduction in your room is likely not where the speakers are , - nor where your listening position is , we have to find the right spot to place our new subwoofer so we get perfect bass in the listening position . <p> here 's the trick . Place the subwoofer where your listening chair is , crank up the music , and then walk behind the main loudspeakers until you find where the bass sounds perfect . Bingo ! <p> Now , move the sub into that exact spot , behind the loudspeaker , and when you play music again , bass at your listening position will sound identical . <p> Its that easy . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> You bet ! Adding a subwoofer to a planar is a very good idea , and using this trick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind and to the sides of the Maggies to find where the bass sounds best is still an excellent method of determining subwoofer placement . <p> I would encourage you to add the sub , big or small . Few speakers have low bass , most do n't  . Subwoofers add the foundation and realism of music and make all the difference in the world . <p> Choose whatever sub you want and then use the volume control to add as much as needed . The trick with a sub is to not hear it . Turn the level up to where your main speakers sound like they have bass . Too much level and you 'll notice the sub , which is what you do n't  want . <p> I find this article to be a bit of a head scratcher . Its presented as back to basics , but is n't that what Jim Smith is writing about ? And as Jim Smith will tell you , basically low bass is also stereo , which obviously a single speaker ca n't deliver . It seems like the purpose here is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford , has room for , etc. only one sub . If so , should n't it have been presented that way ? <p> Maybe basic , basic ? My goal was , and is , to help the uninitiated ; the person who has n't  yet even considered a subwoofer in the first place . For that person , it would seem a stretch to add stereo subs , when even the notion of a subwoofer might be way over the top . <p> Jim writes to Audiophiles . I am trying to write to people on the verge of becoming one . Those just dipping their toes in the better sound waters . <p> Fair enough . My reply comes from the first two paragraphs not really saying that . In context , it comes across as a bit insulting to Jim , when it appears intended to fill in something Jim did n't  speak to , and perhaps had n't  been told , was needed . <p> Indeed it does , and in hindsight it was a mistake to run both articles in the same issue though my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this would have been better run in some later issue and with better intent spelled out in the intro . <p> If your intent is to add a subwoofer and not spend much effort at making it integrate with the system and room as well as it could , Pauls suggestions are OK . <p> My question is why would you even make such a purchase if you did n't  want to improve your system ? Honestly speaking , I simply never run across such folks in my work . So maybe I am missing a segment of the audiophile community . <p> Along those lines , do we think that Coppers readership includes a number of " non-audiophiles " ? Perhaps I do n't  have access to that info . <p> That being said , the notion of placing it at the listening seat and then determining where it sounds best is fraught with peril . In fact , I 'd say that over 90% of the systems I 've been exposed to where this approach was tried fell short of what was possible , often far short . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACK category I mentioned in issue 12 . FWIW I had actually planned to warn readers ( in the set-up section ) about thinking this technique was sufficient . So Paul and I can agree to disagree . <p> Still , its a lot better than simply popping it down and adjusting levels and calling it good enough . <p> Oh , and I do agree with Pauls Brian Bromberg mention . In fact I have licensed one of his cuts for the CD included in my **29;1454;TOOLONG Through the Sound Barrier project . <p> Thanks Jim and I did n't  mean to step on any toes here . Jims the expert in setup and if you 're considering the addition of a subwoofer to the system , by all means follow his advice , ignore mine . <p> What 's not been made clear in my post is who the targeted reader of the post was . Coppers audience ranges from the curious , the occasional dabbler , to the all out high-end assault system and everything in between . Back to Basics is a column for those that have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little help installing something on a Saturday afternoon . <p> You have nothing to apologize for Paul . Either I 'm well into serious half-heimers or Jims written what ? 3 columns , keeps promising much to come , but has offered nothing of substance except that if you cant afford two subs , do n't  have any , the logical extension of which is that if you cant afford two and Jims ministrations , do n't  bother with a component system at all and listen to Pandora on a laptop . <p> I think my objection to Jims criticism is that it assumes that serious audiophiles must necessarily seek more advanced subwoofer placement methods ( or must add a second sub ) to properly integrate their system . Plenty of audiophiles use the crawl technique to place their subs and are happy with the results . The implication is that those folks are simply missing out . <p> Well , Paul did acknowledge Jim as " the expert , " so perhaps they are missing out . But to be fair , Jim is selling his expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for proper room integration of a subwoofer could be seen to be self-serving . Perhaps had he revealed aspects of the placement techniques he employs or explained why the crawl technique fails so often I would have had an easier time accepting his criticism at face value and been less disposed to view it as a veiled attempt at marketing his books or seminars . I 'm not saying Jims obliged to give away his erudition for free , but neither should he then imply that freely given and entirely useful advice is worthless for serious audiophiles . One may wear the hat of a teacher or that of a fee-charging service provider , but not both at the same time . Just my two cents . <p> Excuse me ? A fee-based audio setup consultant calls out the author of an article giving free subwoofer setup advice for being too rudimentary for serious audiophiles and I 'm the one being snarky ? <p> " If your intent is to add a subwoofer and not spend much effort at making it integrate with the system and room as well as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is why would you even make such a purchase if you did n't want to improve your system ? Honestly speaking , I simply never run across such folks in my work . So maybe I am missing a segment of the audiophile community . " <p> Was that not snark ? Or does Jims acknowledged expertise in the audiophile community afford him some kind of free pass ? Lesson learned . <p> This is a perfectly viable approach if someone does n't  have an RTA and test tones to facilitate the installation of a subwoofer within a room . You will find the peaks and nulls within the space using this manner , and its probably just as effective as using an SPL meter , which is not the tool to use for subwoofer integration . Arguably the fine point maybe the starting point of the subwoofer . Some recommend placing the sub about a third of the way down the wall from the corner to minimize boundary reinforcement and adjusting placement from there either closer or further away from the corner or to the wall . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is based on Harmans famous white paper on subwoofers . <p> What if your goal is to have the most even low frequency response across the room , or at several different listening positions ? This is where I find the idea of multiple subwoofers interesting . Thoughts ? <p> Paul my room is a little different . I can not get behind my main speakers ( at least without some difficulty ) so what I did is place my sub firing across the room ( left to right ) . It actually sits between my listening position and the main speakers . As you noted one should not hear the sub and with the level I have set at I only hear it when the music calls for it . It does make my stand mounts sound like they are producing more bass . Good post . <p> Paul , even for an article focused on Basics ( or possibly more so for such an intent ) , a definition of terms seems to be important . You reference full range speakers extending down to 30 Hz or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range you intend for a subwoofer . Personally I consider subwoofers to extend the first octave , sounds below 40 Hz . But that is based upon my assumption my " full range " speakers will extend down to roughly 40 Hz . Someone with smaller stand mounted speakers may not have reasonable output below 65 or 60 Hz and their perspective will be a bit different . <p> I mention this because of your recommendation for " Wood " , the Bromberg recording . His instrument is a vintage 4-string acoustic bass . So far as I know the open E string ( lowest ) of an acoustic bass is 41/42 Hz . I have that disc and agree it is a wonderful recording but I wonder how beneficial it may be in tuning a subwoofer if someones " full range " speakers extend anywhere near 40 Hz ? <p> Sorry if this goes beyond your intent for Back to Basics and would be better directed to Jim Smiths column .

Only thing you would probably want is channel trim ( although this could also be done upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a digital MCH D/A converter preamp , offering D/A conversion , input switching , and volume control . You would have 3x AES/EBU , 3x S/PDIF , 3x I2S , USB and possibly HDMI inputs . You could make HDMI optional , so avoid adding cost to units that do n't  need it .

I immediately fell in love with it . <p> To me , one of the single most frustrating parts of computer based music is the lack of a good interface . Computers should n't be fiddly or need to be learned . Theyre supposed to make our lives easier , not frustrate us to death . <p> Roon was the first such program to make me smile and I knew we had to include- it in the PS lexicon . Over the last two years we 've worked hard and close with the folks at Roon- to make that happen in a way that serves our customers best . <p> Roon requires a computer or music server . If you have one connected to your DAC through USB , you 've been able to use Roon for some time now " though sound quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through- USB . I 've written on this subject before and we 've just launched a new product that finally solves the- USB/DAC- connection problem , called LANRover . But even if you fix USBs problems with such a device , you 're still dependent on your computer for sound quality " a weakness Bridge II solves . <p> Those of you fortunate enough to have- Bridge II- can now enjoy Roon and uncompromised sound . And that 's saying a lot . <p> If you are n't  yet a Roon subscriber , and have a Bridge II , you can use the following code for a free 60-day subscription . Just use this code : <p> P500-N382-H4P5 <p> when registering for Roon and you can play all day for free . The code expires on August 15 . <p> Have fun ! 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 28 COMMENTS <p> Great service with the code . Although I 'm a happy Jriver user , making extensive use of its flexibility , elaborated Remote interface and its availability for my NAS , I 'm interested in the cross-networking features for background information of Roon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a second alternative . Do n't  know if I can connect the Bridge to both , but I guess . <p> a distantly related question : i continue to use my old dell computer with windows xp because i have a very nice sound card in it ( turtle beach santa cruz ) that wont go beyond xp. this is hooked up to a decent amplifier and speakers , so i can enjoy music while i am on the computer . my question is do the new computers have built in sound that is much better than that of the older computers so that i can get the same quality sound from them without a sound card as i do from my old rig ? thanks . <p> I have researched this exhaustively and can tell you that the sound quality of the onboard sound cards in any off the shelf computer is poor for the purposes of the readers of this blog . <p> Its always a good idea to bypass the internal cards . You could instead put a nice USB DAC in between your computer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal card ( if it has one most onboard cards do not ) to again send the signal to an external DAC for processing . If you insist on still using an internal card for processing do n't  do it with the onboard motherboard based card in a computer , get a nicer upgraded card instead . <p> Prices of good quality sound cards are a fraction of what they used to be and you can get good quality ones for around $100 US with optical out for 5.1 support , full hi-Rez playback and other features . Certainly not the ultimate quality of an external device I do think but can be satisfying depending on your musical type . Ditch that old computer and move up , do n't  let that sound card keep you held back ! <p> That 's a tough one because computer hardware matters to sound quality . I wish it werent true . The amount of RAM , the speed , etc . And , much depends on what program you 're running and how you 're connecting . If through USB , as I 've said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are reduced . <p> Hi Paul , just a question of what you said in this post about LANRover : " But even if you fix USB 's problems with such a device , you 're still dependent on your computer for sound quality " a weakness Bridge II solves . " <p> It seems that musical quality problems continue with your product and that his Bridge II resolved . What aspects are not resolved for LANRover ? <p> There are two separate issues at play . The one , which LANRover solves , is the USB interface with the DAC . Tying the computer to the DAC makes DACs sound bad adds noise etc so the challenge there is somehow get the information out of the computer and into the DAC , without the physical connection between the two that causes pollution . <p> LANRover fixes the first problem . <p> The second problem is how computers sound when playing music . This , LANRover can not fix . Using the Bridge instead of the computer to process the sound helps a great deal . <p> Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being using my iPad or computer to control the program which then sends the music over my WIRED network to a Yamaha receiver via AirPlay ( I was confused about this at first thinking AirPlay was only a wireless protocol ) and the second being to use Roons Squeezebox emulation to send it to a Squeezebox Duet feeding an Audioengine D1 DAC optically for playback to my main vintage system . Both of these methods deliver the music via Ethernet and I thought in a way that either the DAC in the receiver or external DAC via the Squeezebox were doing the rendering since nothing is connected to the computers sound card in any way . Is this also what Bridge II now does ? BTW I am saving my pennies to swap out that Audioengine D1 for a NuWave DSD in the next couple of months hoping for a big sonic improvement there as well . <p> Brilliant . It is just beginning to dawn on me that networking audio equipment is/should be obsoleting USB . Remember the early days of touch tone phones ? On some phone exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotary phones used . <p> Roon does not work very well with classical . I was seriously turned off by its inability to recognize a classical piece that was played by Miles Davis something like a dozen times . I do not think that is very obscure , do you ? <p> Artur9 I 'm a new Roon user , and I have to agree with you 2/3 of my collection ( about 1,400 albums ) is classical , and there are huge gaps . And then , on the pop side , I was surprised to see no notes for Roy Orbison one of rock &amp; rolls key founding singers . <p> But here 's the thing Roon never was worth $112/yr it to me for the metadata stuff that 's a " nice to have , " and I believe their database will be growing over time its a huge project . What sold me was the sound . I got a microrendu a few weeks ago , which like the Bridge II , is Roon Ready . So I tried it . Roon sounds way better than the DLNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter also had stutter issues on 24/96 recordings . Bubbleupnp had a habit of " forgetting " which renderer or server you had selected , so there was a lot of re-selecting . <p> With Roon , the experience reminded me of going from Windows to Apple ( I 'm just talking about software , not audio ) . Its an elegant design in which everything works . It remembers where you were when you re-start , etc. , with none of the hiccups described above , which heretofore were endemic to computer playback . Little things that complement the #1 reason sound quality . <p> It did not work on my iPad either and I was forced to go buy a new one . Roon will only operate on the current and prior generation of iPad . I had the original one and the iPad 2 . I really wish they had an iPhone version of the interface as well . <p> Like all software out there one finds things that do or do n't  work for users and they always try to find a happy place that works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good at remembering where you left off , what your settings were and so on . I wish there were some more global settings to tweak ( like using MY cover art for all albums globally not just setting that for each album individually ) but those are small issues for me at least . <p> JRiver still remains my go-to for the majority of my playback but Roon is creeping in there as a close second . The only reason JRiver probably still gets the nod is that I am on it far more to rip , tag and organize files and it becomes easy to just hit " play " from there rather than jump to another program . <p> Well , so there is ! I installed Roon last year prior to the release of the iPhone version ( which I see was released in September ) and recall distinctly checking but nothing was available . After that time I never went and checked again , only used the iPad app . Good info , so , I will give it a spin and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version better , as the additional real estate enables better reading of the notes , etc . But if I leave the iPad at the other end of the house , the iPhone is app great ! You can use both at the same time without problems . <p> I fiddled with this early this morning and agree with you that it is very functional , yet the iPad app does provide that extra impact due to more screen size . <p> I find this to be true of most of my other music apps as well , JRemote or iPeng primarily . The extra screen real estate adds a lot . I have a few apps I use on the iPad that are obviously just phone apps doubled in size , as you can expect those are pretty substandard products since the developers seem to devote minimal resources to making them better . <p> Larry I still use JRiver for tagging , too . I do ripping on my upstairs office computer . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wish there were some more global settings to tweak ( like using MY cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each album individually ) <p> Try " defining " all the albums in your library there 's simple way to do this , but I forget what it is . ( Sorry , I 'm 64 , and some brain " playback features " ai n't  what they were . ; &lt; Then , you can invoke the edit features and tell it to use your art as default . Hopefully that will work . More generally , roon forums seem pretty responsive . <p> davidz1 I certainly have to admit that I have not played around with the settings a lot and I am sure there is much to know . I open the program and do find it quite easy to navigate and play the files . I forgot my golden rule ( on a Windows machine ) to " right click " and have learned a lot of things from the extra settings that come up via that method once I discovered it ( or , two finger tap for the MAC users ) . <p> I have also found the forums helpful when I had an early problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the software updates to the program resolved that .

The Roon guys did- a really nice job during the integration of their server with our unit . They gave use access to three volume control options and included DSP features for devices that need them for compatibility . From the GUI in /settings/RoonReady you can select the three volume control options ( none , software , or hardware ) . You can also select to resample DSD by not enabling DSD/DoP output . This feature can be used with DACs that do not support DSD and it has been tested with Roon server resampling DSD64 down to 16 bit 44.1kHz . Having the resampling done server side means the unit is keep low power and glitch free . <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@23909476 @3909476/ <h> The LANRover <p> I have been hinting about a special device that improves the sound- of USB audio for some time . Now its time to let the cat out of the bag . <p> When you connect your computer to your DAC through USB there 's a lot of problems getting the sound right . This is because your computer is a hostile environment for delivering clean audio data . Think of your computer like a noisy crowd and the music like a lone musician trying to be heard at a cocktail party . Its near impossible unless- you separate him- from the crowd . <p> One trick you can use is to connect the computer- through a USB hub , using two USB cables " one between- the computer and the hub , the other between the hub and the DAC . While it- may seem counter intuitive to improve something- by adding another element in the data path , it works . In fact , the idea of a purpose built USB hub is what the famous Uptone Regen essentially does and it works well improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regen , offers a degree of isolation between the computer and the DAC , though its not complete . Think of this degree of isolation as a doorway separating the noisy crowd ( our computer ) . Our beleaguered musician is close to the open door and we hear him more clearly than before . <p> If we wish to remove even more of our imagined- crowd noise , we can filter it by adding something like the AudioQuest Jitterbug for even clearer sound . <p> But if we want to eliminate the crowd noise altogether we need a completely new approach . Enter the LANRover . <p> The PS Audio LANRover leverages network protocols to fully isolate the computers crowd noise from the music . The LANRover employs two boxes : one connects to your computer , the other to your DAC . Between the two boxes a computer cable , commonly known as a CAT5 , is used . The miracle of this technique is the near 100% isolation between the noisy computer and the quiet needs of a DAC . <p> By converting the USB data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , near perfect isolation cutting- the- computers crowd noise and jitter levels so effectively- the level would be acceptable in a quiet library . And that has HUGE sonic benefits . Second , once converted to network audio , as opposed to directly connected USB audio , we can place a great deal of distance between- the two boxes if we want to " the computer can be anywhere in the house and connect to your DAC anywhere else . We can do this even over WIFI . Imagine your computers no longer in the listening room , but upstairs in the office where it belongs . Bingo ! <p> I 'll write much more about this revolutionary- new product in the coming weeks . For now , here 's a video presentation I made to the Colorado Audio Society a week or two ago . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 48 COMMENTS <p> I have n't any idea what the ST USB2001 is but I can tell you this is a special built unit for audio only . There is definitely nothing like it on the market , though there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  know . <p> Oh Paul , this company of your is blowing me away every time with " things I need " which in my case probably soon enough will equal to " bankrupcy " : ) Each product and each new launch seems to have a reasoning , an issue that needs to be adressed and you guys to it and put up the resulting piece of equipment . Kudos . <p> If you 've come across any of my posts , I just got the DSJ after getting rid of my previous dac/preamp ( wo n't name any names in order not to discredit them he-he ) since I was hoping to " analogize " my digital music collection , if that is a word . And it seems to me that we are achieving that and that 's very pleasing . <p> Then I got a nice cat 6 cable from Furutech trying to connect directly to the Bridge II using that connection , but as you refer to on the vid , then you are " stuck with " certain programmes , music software that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.i . though I try and I try , I can not bring myself to really like JRMC and every time I play stuff I can see Audirvana + stare at me for this love affair and I 'll get A+ back again " if shell have me " LOL . <p> When LAN Rover ( ) becomes a proper product and you guys launch it , I think I would be able to dump the evil mistress ( the Glenn Close of audio software ) and do just that . Play the tunes I want over the LAN and using the software that I want via USB , right ? Very cool , as what will happen would be the exact description you made -extract the ( preserved , isolated ) music files from a computer in another room actually in the upper floor . Precisely what I need . <p> Now in terms of SQ for the listening experience , with the addition of the LAN Rover we have an extra option and it seems to be a really cool one . No jitter . No noise . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that context , in what order do you feel we should go inputs wise to guarantee the highest quality among PS Audio options ? : <p> Ill leave optical out ( a lots been said about that input huh ) as well as coax , as I 'm using that to go from my Olive server to the DSJ . But out of the three , would you say that would be the way to go in order of quality ? : <p> I2S is still the best sounding and the Bridge is next as you have indicated but the LANRover brings any USB audio within close spittin distance of the Bridge . Most people would not be able to tell the difference . <p> Also , the LANRover will enable ANY DAC to become an end point to a computer , not just a PS Audio DAC . <p> I enjoy my USB audio old PC into a Schitt Bifrost through a Jitterbug , mainly listen to ripped CDs using Foobar . I am on a budget . I want to try a USB hub . Any old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Any hub will improve your sound quality , some more than others and even the power supply used to power them matters . But you should be able to have good results with any one of them . Just make sure they are high speed USB 3.0 is best , but 2.0 is fine . <p> This setup requires the two separate boxes , one of which draws its power via the USB connection from the computer you are using as a server , and the receiver box pretty much has to have a wall wart . Unless I 've got that reversed . <p> One thing for sure digital is a techno-freaks paradise . People must spend sleepless nights figuring out how to do the same thing the digital way but since digital is an artificial man made technology non- existent in nature it is not surprising that every time something new is made it leads to more problems . Will digital ever replace nature ? Obviously not . But yes it certainly is a very bumpy shortcut . Have fun . Regards . <p> Paul I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows 8 box in my audio rack ) . Is it possible to use that as the input to the LANrover , and take its USB output to connect to my DAC ? It seems like that would eliminate the need for a second LANrover box , or maybe I 'm missing something . Thanks . David <p> Assuming the end point unit would REclock the USB signal before entering the DAC , may I ask what might be the quality of the clock be ? I ask because as with my experience with Uptone vs W4S , the crystek clock inside the W4S does wonder to the final outcome . <p> Second question is , could I use optical LAN extender between the ROVER units ? <p> Paul , did you mention the price ? I kind of scanned through the video , so I may have missed it . <p> I so want a PMT , a Directstream , the new transport , and a P10 . Do you know anyone who would like to buy a kidney ? I 'm just hoping I can afford a LANRover . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a Jitterbug . I inserted the Jitterbug into the musicplayer a 1TB Toshiba laptop dedicated to music only . At 61 , I was late to PC files party . The options had my head spinning for years . I finally pulled the pin , when I got access to 6 big cartons of vinyl . I use a Linestreamer+ at 24/96 with Vinyl Studio . It is so nice to be able to load up a bunch of converted LPs and not have to get up every 15-20 minutes . Anyway inserted the Jitterbug and ignored it for weeks , then I removed it , took about 30 seconds to know that it was essential . Sounds like the LANRover could be a real improvement , as it will be a long time before I can upgrade to a Nas or a dedicated player . <p> There is a lot of good companies that make good products , but PS Audio seems to be the one that always has something I really want . It took me years to get a used P300 , and in 2006 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now with a manual transport door . The gears to eject , gave up a few years ago . I was using a CAL Delta , and was still reading/hearing that any CD player with a digital output would be all you needed in a transport . The improvement I heard from the Lambda , compared to the CAL was dramatic , hence my desire to own a PMT . I 've got two kidneys , they say you only need one ; - ) So , what 's a LANRover going to set me back ? <p> Great to see more innovations from PSA , but why no DI ? .. would be the best resolution for our PS DACs .. USB and Networked is second rate and resolution is notably diminished no matter how or what is implemented . <p> A USB to SPDIF/AES would be acceptable but considering you already have the i2s connect on your DACs why is there no focus on creating a connect for computer users . Thunderbolt to I2s would wipe the floor with any USB variant . Take a page from Pink Faun maybe ? 
@@23909477 @3909477/ <h> The myth of the asynchronous DAC <p> Synchronous and asynchronous are two buzz words manufacturers realize gets peoples attention . We may not understand what they mean but we 've figured out asynchronous is better than being synchronous . So a new class of DAC has been born , the Asynchronous DAC only its mostly a myth and a misleading one at that . <p> here 's the deal . When you connect a transport or CD players digital output to a DACs input , the DAC is in synchronous mode with the player . This means the player or transport is the master clock that runs the whole shooting match inside the DAC . Thats standard on just about every input on your DAC , all of which are running in synchronous mode . <p> Over the last couple of years we 've seen an influx of USB inputs on DACS , The first of these inputs were synchronous , meaning the computer was the master clock that ran the DAC just like the example we cited of the player . <p> Since players , transports and certainly computers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , if we had our druthers wed rather not have them controlling the audio quality and timing of our DACS and when we provide our own controlling clock , that 's what 's known as asynchronous . <p> Then a few pioneers like Genesis , PS Audio , Gordon Rankin and XMOS started introducing the world to asynchronous schemes that sounded better . Genesis was the first when Bob Stadtherr and I invented the Digital Lens in the mid 90s an asynchronous source for anything plugged into it , followed by our PerfectWave Transport Memory Player an asynchronous transport , then Gordon in his great Wavelength products and lately XMOS a chip manufacturer making it easier for DAC manufacturers to add asynchronous USB . Now , many DACS have asynchronous USB inputs , but that does n't  mean they are an asynchronous DAC . <p> To qualify as an asynchronous DAC , every input of the DAC ( not just the USB ) would be asynchronous where the designer would throw away the source clock and rely only on the DACS internal clock . There are scarce few of these around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark II is one of but a very small handful of true asynchronous DACS where every input is run through our Digital Lens and output with an independent asynchronous low jitter clock . <p> So the next time someone tells you they have an asynchronous DAC , you 're now armed with the info you need to ask the right questions . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 5 COMMENTS <p> The Light Harmonic DaVinci DAC is asynchronous on all inputs , and has received a lot of attention in show-reports for its sound qualitymost recently , check the coverage of the NY Audio Show , where numerous writers mentioned the LH room as one of the shows best . <p> BTW : I have worked with the Light Harmonic crew ( who are all long-time PS owners ) , and I was one of the organizers of the NY Show in the audiophile world , I suppose that makes me doubly suspect ! <p> I can see it is using asynchronous on USB but there seems no mention of this on the other inputs . I 'll take your word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool looking DAC and I like their direction . 
@@23909480 @3909480/ <h> Vintage Whine <h> The Mother Of All Speakers ( MOAS ) <p> I had begun writing a piece about the history of horn loudspeakers ( still to come , do n't  panic ) when MOABthe Mother Of All Bombsappeared in the news . That triggered a memory for me of the biggest , baddest horn loudspeaker of them all , one of the weirder annals in the history of American acoustics : MOAS , the Mother Of All Speakers . <p> At the outset of the first Gulf War , the US Army saw a need for a portable , high-output sound-source that could be used on the battlefield to call for the surrender of Iraqi combatants . The late Dr. Hank Bass- at the University of Mississippis National Center for Physical Acoustics was charged with the project . Dr. Jim Sabatier , now recently retired from NCPA , - helped design what Bass wife Cathy dubbed " the Mother Of All Speakers " , - after Saddam Husseins promise of " the mother of all battles " . - Internally , the project was quickly known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to stand for MObile Acoustic Source , or Mobile Outdoor Acoustic Source . <p> Additional requirements called for reproduction of a 10Hz signal at 140dB @ 1 meter , so as to allow for realistic reproduction of the 11Hz rotor noise produced by helicoptersand maybe the rumble of approaching tanks , as well . And of course , you should be able to hear it miles away . Simple , right ? <p> MOAS , all set up and ready to blow . Implausible , no ? <p> The frequency and volume requirements dictated the basic parameters of the horn , and almost made a mockery of the term " mobile " : a round-section exponential horn , 56 ' long , with a mouth diameter of 10 ' . Regular old drivers could n't meet the required specs , and so sound was to be produced by an airstream modulator , basically a valve controlled by a voice coil . <p> Here you can see the mechanical end of MOAS , with the diesel engine and generator . <p> The pressurized air to be modulated would come from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how does one drive such a compressor in the middle of a desert battlefield ? With a 150 HP diesel engine , of course ! <p> The modulator was the Wyle Laboratories WAS-3000 , still used today in simulations of rocket launches and airport noise-cancellation projects . On the MOAS project it was quickly discoveredand anyone familiar with supercharged engines couldve told them this ! that the compressed air being fed to the modulator would be very , very warm . Warm enough , in fact , to melt the voice coil driving the valve . <p> Just as is often done in supercharged engines , air-to-air intercoolers were installed to cool the incoming compressed charge .

@@23909481 @3909481/ <h> PerfectWave Memory Player <p> ThePerfectWave CD/DVD Memory player is a ground-breaking product that removes all digital sound limitations retrieving everything from your CD collection without any jitter or sonic loss . <p> The PWT plays both standard and high resolution audio and sends perfect digital audio data from its solid state memory directly to your DAC and then onto your loudspeakers . It works differently than other CD players by first extracting music from the CD , then storing to an internal memory and playing from the memory instead of the disc . <p> Traditional CD mechanisms and computer hard drives are mechanical devices hopelessly trying to perform in a world of precise timing . These timing challenges can only be properly handled with non-mechanical means and that 's just what the memory player does : plays from the output of a solid state memory rather than the CD itself . <p> The results are remarkable and deliver better performance on any system by unlocking all the musical magic stored in your CDs and hidden from you until now . <p> It is a minor miracle that a CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the laser , varying rotational disc speeds , disc wobble and the errors that must be corrected for even the best CDs , getting perfect jitter-free music from your CD player is an elusive goal . <p> Until the advent of the PerfectWave Memory Player , every CD player ever built relies on the sameerror-prone mechanical technologiesand suffers the same problems as every other . The PWT Memory Player changes all that forever by first extracting the music from the CD or DVD and then placing it into our Digital Lens memory buffer . When you play a disc you are never listening to the real time stream from the CD or DVD . Instead , everything you hear comes directly out of memory in perfect , asynchronous jitter free fashion . <p> Its easy to see this in action for yourself . Press play on the PWTs front panel touch screen and then press elect . The disc will be ejected but the music continues to play for up to 30 seconds . Its a quick and easy demonstration that will show you how the PWT plays from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this important ? It sounds better . The fact that you listen to digital data as streamed from a precise memory means that data can be asynchronous ( not tied to the CD mechanisms clock ) and unaffected by the vagaries of the CD and DVD mechanisms that read the data in the first place . <p> Youve heard that ripping a disc and storing it on your computer sounds better than playing that very same disc through your transport ? This is the reason and you get the full benefit of a bit-perfect rip and asynchronous output of the Memory Player . <h> High resolution audio on DVD <p> The future of audio is to be found in higher resolution media than CDs which are limited to 44 kHz and 16 bits . The PWT can certainly play standard CDs directly but because the PWT is a high resolution audio transport , it can also read WAV files directly off a DVD and present jitter-free digital music to your DAC with resolution up to 24 bit and samples rates as high as 192 kHz . <p> High resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from FLAC or ALAC to WAV files on your computer , transferred to a DVD and played in all their high resolution glory on the PWD . <h> Cover art and song titles <p> Building the perfect transport means more than just producing the perfect output . The transport should also be a joy to use and answer a higher level of expectation from its owners . <p> 60 years after the introduction of the vinyl LP , there are still very few players that recognize and display cover art and song titles from the disc itself . Once connected to an internet capable network connection , the PWT will display the cover art and song titles of just about any CD you place into it . <p> Imagine how much closer to the music you 'll find yourself with the picture of the artist on your player . <p> Every time you play a disc in your PWT a copy of the cover art and song titles are kept for you on your own private library page , accessed through our website . From your personal page on our website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs information , change cover art and polish your CD collection . <h> Asynchronous audio <p> The PWTs CD/DVD read device is a DVD ROM drive like that in a computer . This type of optical drive allows the PWT to read the music on the disc using an entirely different approach than that of a traditional transport or CD player . <p> To get bit perfect results without traditional error correction the PWT uses a multiple read technique which reads the data on the disc until its verified as bit perfect . Once confirmed as perfect it is then added to the Digital Lens memory . <p> Once in the Digital Lens solid state memory there is no clock information attached to it +G just the raw and pure music extracted from the disc . <p> The output of the Lens is then forwarded to the PWT output through a fixed high precision , low jitter asynchronous clock . The PWT is one of the few true asynchronous transports in the world . <p> What does this mean to you ? Better sound in fact , far better sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . With the Memory Player you hear every detail on your disc and that 's a revelation for many . <h> I2S through HDMI output <p> There are two ways to get the digital audio data out of the PWT : S/PDIF or I2S HDMI . I2S is the preferred method if you have the PS Audio PerfectWave DAC or any manufacturers DAC that can receive it . <p> S/PDIF ( and AES/EBU ) are the standard delivery methods and available on the PWT but are not the best sounding ones . <p> Standard digital outputs take three separate internal clocks along with the raw music data and combine them into one stream to the DAC . This mashup of music and clocks causes the audio to sound flat and harsh compared to I2S and is one of the reasons we designed NativeX on thePWD . NativeX eliminates many of the problems associated with S/PDIF . <p> A much better way of delivering the music is what I2S does and the audible results are stunning . Simply use any HDMI cable between the PWT and the DAC and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of DACS and devices are adopting the PS Audio HDMI standard for digital audio transmission because of its superior audio quality . <h> Digital Lens inside <p> Inside the PWT there is a built-in Digital Lens that stores the music from your disc before playing it . Unlike other approaches it is unnecessary to play the entire disc and place it into memory before listening . Instead , the intelligent Digital Lens stores only what is needed for perfect playback and the user experience is nearly instantaneous . <p> Just push play as you would on any CD player and the PerfectWave Memory Player does the rest instantly . <p> If you wish to see the lens in action , simply eject the disc while you 're listening and note how the music continues to play even when the disc has been removed from the PWT . <p> It is the fact that you are listening to the stored version of what 's on the disc that helps the music sound so lifelike and spacious . CD players all stream music directly off the CD while a PerfectWave Memory Player always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The net results of this technology breakthrough is stunning sound perhaps for the first time on your system . Music played on the PWT is simply breathtaking , full , spacious and alive as no other player can do . <p> The PerfectWave Transport is a revolution in product development and a pure joy to use . <p> It plays both DVDs as well as CDs . It finds and displays cover art and song titles on its beautiful color touch screen and you can connect to this art through your own personalized webpage . <p> It easily handles both standard CD playback as well as high resolution audio files directly in the machine .

My reverie was suddenly interrupted- by the loudest cacophony of angry , chattering , magpies I have ever heard " an easy dozen of the white trimmed black birds all with feathers ruffled . Below them , next to my neighbors fence , was a small bobcat who clearly was unhappy for all the attention , and they chased the poor critter off the property . Man ! That was an exciting morning . <p> I think yesterdays post probably ruffled just as many feathers as that bobcat . I had suggested that up until recently our cherished remote controls corrupted sound quality , a claim I stand by with some explanation . <p> Remote control wands are harmless devices . Neither their infrared or RF signals are bothersome to sound . It is what those wands control that causes me to make such claims .

A murder of crows will band together and chase the predator . Was the Bobcat encroaching on their roadkill perhaps ? <p> Fascinating and I did not know that . There are crows here but they are outnumbered by the magpies and kept away . I notice the magpies gather together to oust any crows that venture near .

Stepping back and looking at the big picture , seeing the forest and the trees , a wireless remote control is obviously an adjustment , a control . Some controls are manual , some are programmed by humans , and some are self adjusting by various means including as a response to sensors or programming . Almost all machines of any complexity today use not only various types of controls not directly adjusted by humans directly but also use servo systems , that is negative feedback . These include some of the most delicate and critical adjustments to achieve their goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , that is a bullet hitting a bullet , the Hubble space telescope staying focused on galaxies billions of lightyears away ( one exposure lasted 11 days ) , a rover on Mars avoiding a ditch , Staying precisely aimed at Pluto to get a sharp image of a faint object even though it is travelling tens of thousands of miles and hour , practically every modern assembly line especially automobiles , you car itself including your anti lock brakes , dropping a JDAM through a vent shaft on a roof to destroy only one part of a building , and I could go on and on and on because the examples are endless . <p> So here is the problem Paul . What are all these people doing wrong that you are doing right ? <p> Hubbles precious time was used to take an 11 day exposure ( while orbiting the earth ) into a region of space that appeared to be entirely empty .

Keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough photons to reveal them required extreme precision of control . It is now believed that there is no region of space no matter how empty it seems that is not filled with galaxies . Paul , have you ever taken an 11 day time lapse photograph ? I think even on the steadiest tripod thered be some shakiness resulting in blur . <p> I wholeheartedly agree with your assessment of remotes and electronic volume controls . Personally I 'm using a 1997 vintage Mac C22 Pre-amp for this reason amongst others . I do n't  mind getting out of my chair to walk across the room to change volume ( my room not being suited to having the pre-amp adjacent to my seat ) just as much as I do n't  mind having to get up to flip the record of one of the many 45rpm re-issued albums I have . I do cheat though when using the DS DAC and make slight adjustments to volume with the remote .

Otherwise I 'll be sticking with my Mac amplification ( including a pair of vintage M75 mono-blocks ) for the foreseeable . By the way " The Accountant " is a pretty good movie . <p> " The question being though would PSA build a BHK Pre-amp for me with a mechanical/rotary volume switch and all the buttons needed to select sources ? And if you could included a good headphone amp in the box in place of these other electronics I would be in hog heaven . " <p> Well , the BHK Preamplifier does utilize a very sophisticated rotary volume control , features an input selector button on the left side of the front panel display and a Bascom King designed state of the art headphone amplifier . The included remote also provides control of those two primary features . <p> Not sure which amplifier and speakers you listen through , but dropping the BHK in your system would be analogous to lifting a blanket off your speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My current preamp uses sealed relays with gold contacts to change sources . My last preamp had a 5 or 6 position selector , with an identical recordas in taping selector , which I never used . With that main selector I had to shut off all other sources , particularly the tuner , as it would be audible even when the selector was on another input . I 'm sure it was a cheap part and better selectors were , and are available . I always wanted to replace it with a Dact . I had the manufacturer replace the cheap volume pot with a stepped one from Dact . The only problem was the steps were too big , so fine adjustments were not possible . It did improve the sound , and the manufacturer said when he tested it , that its matching of the two channels were the best he had ever tested . When just about every high end company has come up with a transparent volume control , I do n't  see it as a problem . I 'd consider it mature technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were some really bad choices , but are n't  we past that ? <p> Some are , most are n't  . The solutions weve come up with finally solve the problems and a few others have as well , but the vast majority stick with tried and true old technology that really degrades performance . <p> Stepping back to get an even more distant view , having to get out of your chair to make an adjustment to your system causes your heart rate to take an up-tick that will help prolong your life . Seems like every month I see a health article proclaiming the dangers of sitting for long periods of time . Obviously , you cant enjoy the music if you 're not breathing . Sorry if this was brought up earlier . I just dropped in briefly . <p> The first photo here LONG ... illustrates the untroubled and near paradisiac circumstances in the early days of the audio industry : no problems with the sweet spot , remote controls , vibrating cabinets and room tuning at all .

Designer Gilbert Yeung builds each ( resistor ladder ) by hand . Indeed , as Paul observes , the handiwork is part of the appeal and the end product is expensive .

Absence of remote is inconvenient but I tell myself that it reduces how sedentary I am when engaged with this hobby . <p> " Early " remote controls may have used motors , but that 's also exactly what your fellow Boulder-based company Ayre does today purely mechanical switches and volume controls driven by motors and belts :

@@23909498 @3909498/ <h> How much power do I need ? <p> Its a great question when it comes to pairing amplifiers and speakers . One that 's often asked , though rarely understood . <p> Most reasonably efficient loudspeakers can be driven from a wimpy SET amp to reasonable levels if you 're ok with distortion . And , you probably are , since SET amps distort in a most graceful manner .

I 'd sooner connect a Stellar M700- monoblock with a pair of bookshelves- than to- starve them for power . <p> The constant misconception is that maximum amp power needs to be matched with speakers " a formula that works in one direction , not the other . <p> Think of the amp like a car .

Amp-Speaker matching plays a role here , too current and voltage seem to play different roles weaker tube amps can sound much better than stronger SS amps <p> Jazznut , there is definite validity to your post , but you are not exactly comparing apples to apples . A 300w hi-bias class A will likely smoke a 100w hi-bias class A in terms of scale and believable dynamics provided they are by the same manufacturer . As for a little tube amp bettering a solid state , I recently heard a flea-watt SET ( 8w/ch ) that I would n't trade for a Musical Fidelity A5cr ( 255w/ch ) I owned ; the flea-watt sounded just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not convinced of that magic midrange , either ; the MF always sounded open , graceful and composed at any volume . But that is two different manufacturers and the latter is all about your mentioned , current ; something flea-watts just do n't  have much of . <p> There are cookbook formulas all over the internet for this . This problem has been studied extensively by acoustic scientists and its solution is used by professional audio engineers . You 'll need to know things like the volume of your room , its degree of acoustic liveness , the loudest undistorted sound level you need , speaker efficiency , how many speakers , etc . You populate the spaces in the spreadsheet and the answer pops right out using time proven equations . If you are buying a general purpose amplifier for unknown speakers youd probably want to err on the side of more power . If you have a love of efficient speakers like Klipschorn speakers buying a 700 wpc amplifier is ridiculous even to fill a movie theater with sound . On the other hand if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I have done and install them in a small room on the live side , a 138 wpc wont cut it by a long shot . Its easy enough to clip it with deep bass . To get the deepest bass it is capable of you 'll need at least 3 o 4 pairs and at least 600 to 1000 wpc . Keep in mind that sensitivity to loudness is logarithmic ( there he goes being technical again . Why does he always have to remind me I flunked intermediate algebra in high school ? I think Soundmind just does it to torture us . Yup ! ) So the difference between a 100 wpc amplifier and a 200 wpc amplifier is just 3 db of undistorted maximum loudness which is barely audible . A 10 db increase say from 100 watts to 1000 watts is perceived as about twice as loud . If you have a difficult situation getting adequate loudness , your best bet is to buy more speakers and more amplifiers . That 's how the pros do it sometimes installing banks and banks of racks of amplifiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better.but what about with electrostatics . I think the Quads ( and like ) are not supposed to be able to take much more than 50watts and have developed a choke to prevent too much current ( or is it voltage ) from impacting the panels . <p> A few years ago I had a 2005 five speed Honda Civic . When approaching the Eisenhower Tunnel going west on the 70 interstate , one finds oneself going up and down successive mountains . Towards the end I would actually have to go down to third gear to make it all the way up . Much like not having enough power to adequately drive a certain pair of speakers . On the other hand , presently I am using a 160 wtt per channel Rega Osiris integrated amplifier to drive a pair of Stax electrostatic headphones with directly . In fact I have found that having an excess of power for ones needs is the way to go . Think of Michael Fremmer with his huge Wilson speakers with its matching Thor subwoofer . The paticular amplifiers that he uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful Following Michael over the years , he always uses extremely powerful amplifiers . Better too much power than not enough . Like choosing the ultimate automible , more power is better . Another thing I have noticed with audio is that with true quality high power amplifiers , one is able to turn the volume up very high , even on say a small pair of efficient speakers , with no distortion . The better quality of the amplifier being used allows one to turn the volume up to much higher levels , but again , no distortion . My Rega-Stax combination is a good example . In fact , with my Rega-Stax combination , that is what I am able to achieve . Finally able to turn Stax electrostatic headphones into rock and roll tranducers . One is actually more likely to damage speakers using not enough power and turning them up too much . The damage will comes from distortion . No , using more power carefully is the way to go . <p> The common misconceptions are : 1 . : " Only power counts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the drivers membranes follow exactly the signal independent of the EM-backforce. 2 . : Two channel reproduction without crosstalk cancellation between left and right speaker . 3. : multi-microphone arrays with crosstalk and incredible phase-errors .

I keep in shape by bench pressing my sofa . Oh , and the first watt is the most important . ( : yes : ) And only one of the above statements is an Alternative Fact . <p> I agree with Paul on this . The need is to have sufficient power to stay below clipping at the loudest level you would listen at in your environment through your speakers . This has not one thing to do with what class the amplifier is or whether it is a transistor or tube type . This approach protects the speakers as well as the ears . <p> Bill , you raise exactly the question I want to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has clipping indicators . Presuming that they are accurate , is the fact I never light them up doing normal listening proof that I have sufficient power ? <p> which raises an interesting follow-on question . The Benchmark amp is not targeted at the audiophile market but rather the professional recording industry . That 's why it has clipping ( and temp ) indicator lights right on the front . Not particularly elegant , but rather practical for the recording engineer . But if all the mysteries of sufficient power could be eliminated by including clipping indicators on amps , why do n't  manufacturers of amps for the audiophile community just include them ? <p> It is tempting to try to find one or two numbers that will allow you to compare two or more things to see which one is better . Unfortunately life is not always so simple . There are a lot of other numbers besides power rating and some of them are even related to power output but are not published or even measured . Assessing amplifier performance is much more complicated than just knowing maximum power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some control by the FTC in the 1970s and revised again for multichannel amplifiers in the 1990s but there 's still much more to it . These specifications and tests do not tell you how an amplifier will perform in real world conditions of use , each case being different . This is where the so called " objectivist " argument among audiophiles breaks down ( sorry Ethan . ) Incomplete measurements , incorrect methods of measurement , isolating one or a few measurements that make it appear one item is better than another fits right into the silver bullet theory of hi fi products and a lot of other things . One thing to look for in an amplifier is the power supply specifications . That includes line and load regulation or lack of it . Another includes stability driving speakers with wacko crossover networks like YG Acoustics Sonja 3.1 , radical reactive loads like electrostatics , very low impedance loads like AR3 , or screwball speaker cables like early products from a certain well known to repair technicians brand . Some of these uses demonstrate poor performance under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One good thing about FETs as opposed to BJTs is that FETs are not subject to thermal runaway like BJTs are . Therefore they do n't  need an emitter ( or source ) resistor to stabilize them . <p> John Wyant , do n't  read this posting . You might hurt yourself . Oops . I should have put this warning at the beginning of my posting instead of at the end . Too late . Hope you have good hospital insurance coverage . <p> That 's ok . I can take the flack , as opposed to some others . I note a change in your pedantic tone today . Surprisingly , you may have learned something from yesterdays exchange . You won , but congratulations anyway on your progress . <p> I absolutely agree more with Paul concerning amplifier power there is no such thing as too much . Back in the early 80s , a good friend had a pair of Klipsch Cornwalls ( 98dB/1w ) and a Soundcraftsmen A2502 ( 250@8ohms per channel ) amplifier driving them . His music of choice : hard rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party and took his stereo outside . The music was only playing at about 15-20 watts ( according to the amps LED-VUs ) , peaking occasionally around 40 which , was plenty loud . As the light began to dim , I was looking at the VUs on the amp , and noticed , that on some of the drum slams , every LED " including the clipping ' indicator " would blink . That was in access of 500 watts per channel ! It dawned on me that those dynamics require vastly more energy than just 40 watts peak power , just as one example . <p> As a long time user of Stax electrostatic headphone systems I have found that the same is true with them . Stax headphones are actually minature small speakers , thus they call them earspeakers . And previously using their own matching solid state as well as tube matching amplifiers , they are all low powered . Using an over 30 year old SR5-SDR6 combo along with a 160 watt per channel Rega Osiris integrated amplifier works great . And most off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , of course , the electronic guitar-screeching lead vocalist is finally there . And that is not all that I have done to get the most out of my modest Stax system . Last I found out that be adding a one foot length of a top end speaker wire between the little color coded wires from my Stax SRD6 box and the spesker connections of my Rega Osiris . Thus I have added , without any modifications , a one foot pair of MG Audio Designstop of the line speaker wires . Actually I first discovered this upgrade using a one foot pair of older Shunyata speaker wires to find out that it worked . I have done no more than one might do with an ordinary amplifier-speaker combination . In fact the MG Audio Design speaker wires that I am using here are identical to the ones that both Arnie Nudell and Paul McGowen ar both uing with their Bascom King amplifiers . Last comment is that it would sound much better if I had a quality Audio Research tube amplifier to hook up to my Audui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is another story . <p> The MG Audio Designs cables are by far and away better than anything I have ever heard in cables . We are working with them right now on a long-term project to offer the same design in a PS product , our first cable in many years . <p> About a year ago Michael Fremmer in TAS mentioned the prices on the wires that he himself uses , and sort of apologize that he was able to have his choices for free , as opposed to most of the rest of us . When I found out that they were only $1600 for a meter of their top of the line interconnects it seemed too good to be true . Later I found out that I could order a half meter pair for only $900. also that there was a 10% discount for additional orders . And later when I accidently damaged one of them I sent them off to Lee for repair . He not only repaired them for free plus paid return postage on them . It still seems too good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things " to be warry . Just a warning . Seriously , it still seems too good to be true . A .6 meter pair of Nordost Odin 2 interconnects go for $19,995 . One could purchase a decent small brand new automobile today and possibly have enough left over to pay for the first years registration as well . I am also using their top of the line speaker wires as well , in conjunction with Jenna Labs 18 gage hook up wires . Jenna Labs is another small wire manufacture that is well known by many in the industry . I am just an average retired guy . I can not afford the big name stuff . So I have to seek out the best that I can afford . It is that simple . All I can say is that I am able to achieve fantastic results for the amount spent . I am good friends with Rick Duplesia of Audio Alternative from Fott Collins . I can not aford the better Audioquest interconnects or speakers even though they are very reasonably priced compared to their competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand I am currently using two of their $1000 Niagara strips as well as many of their power cords .

However , once the link between the Lightning App and the Aries is lost , the music stops and then starts again at the beginning of the song . The drops can be for only a couple of seconds but someimes it is permanent in the sense that I can get the connection back after rebooting the Aries .

When I play from the JRiver library it plays awhile and then stops . When I tried some 176/24 and 192/24 files they started out OK but after a couple minutes they started to distort heavily ( in one case it seemed to be speeding up and slowing down but that may have been my imagination but there is also stuttering ) .

Just trying to rule- out one possibility . <p> Wondering if u people are finding that the sound quality of Auralic is better than current ps audio bridge . I run DS with bridge with minim server running on qnap nas connected over wifi with extender ( ds with bridge connected to the extender with ethernet cable ) .

Is it better sound quality ? <p> There are a number of reasons people might choose an Aries besides sound quality . The Bridge ( 1 or 2 ) is limited to single rate DSD and 192/24 while Aries does double rate DSD and , I think , up to 384/24 PCM . It plays gapless ( which Bridge 2 will do too when it comes out ) without having to use foobar2000 . You can plug a hard drive directly into Aries and not run a computer or a NAS . Aries has a Tidal app and provision for other internet streaming ( Bridge 2 may eventually be able to do that if Paul can get the mconnect people to develop those capabilities but it can not at this point on its own ) . - I have not done much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the Bridge 2 beta at about the same time as the Aries . My initial impression was that Aries beat Bridge 1 on sound quality , particularly the soundstage , but that was not based on- head-to-head real time- comparisons . I 'm not prepared to comment yet on Bridge 2 versus Aries in terms of sound quality beyond saying that Bridge 2 is very promising . Another reason some people might get an Aries is because a lot of us like toys and the Aries is a nice toy . ( In my case , even if I decide Bridge 2 sounds much better and decide to use it exclusively with the DS , I have two other systems now using Squeeze Box Touches where I could use the Aries. )

@@23909514 @3909514/ <h> Stepped attenuators <p> Controlling the volume level in your stereo system is an obvious and important function . The element used to turn the level up and down is important as well . <p> If you look inside a preamplifier you 'd discover its one of the simpler devices in your chain . Most consist of only three blocks in the signal path : an input selector , a volume/balance control and a gain stage . <p> The input selector is nothing more than a switch that connects the input you wish to listen to into the signal chain . This switch can be a mechanical one requiring you to turn the knob to choose or a series of relays that act like switches . Relays are simple switches that use a small electro magnet to open and close their switch contacts . This allows designers to send a tiny electrical signal to control the relay , rather than relying on mechanical force to move the switch from one position to another . There are even electronic versions of switches that use a transistor as the switch ( usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to listen to is connected to the preamplifiers volume control ; the subject of this post . Most preamplifiers use what is known as a pot to control the volume . " Pot " is short for potentiometer and is a simple device consisting of a resistive element and a contact point ( known as a wiper ) . The resistive element sounds fancy but it too is simple and made from a material that resists electricity like carbon or certain types of metals that do n't  conduct too well ; also known as a resistor ( because it resists electricity ) . The contact point is a simple piece of good conducting metal that touches the resistive element ( like silver ) . When you turn the pot up or down , you are moving the contact point ( wiper ) along the resistive element in a wiping motion . <p> The sound quality of this device is dependent entirely on the quality of the resistive element and the contact material of the wiper , once implemented properly . A good pot can be extremely expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wiper is dividing the resistive element in two . In the example I show , A is a smaller area than B as divided by the wiper . This means that A has a smaller resistor value than B. If we were to actually measure these values we 'd see that A is probably 25% of the whole and B the remaining 75% . If the pot is a 10k value ( 10,000 Ohms ) then we could say it can be modeled with two resistors , the A resistor measuring 2,500 Ohms and the B resistor measuring 7,500 Ohms ( the two resistors will always add up to the 10,000 value of the pot ) . <p> I mentioned the sonic performance of this device depends on the quality of that resistive element and the contact material of the wiper . There 's no doubt the best resistive elements can be found in individual resistors and the best contact materials can be found on expensive switches none of which is true of potentiometers . Thus , if we decide to use discrete resistors and a quality switch to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a better sounding volume control . This arrangement is known as a stepped attenuator . <p> You can see in the picture such a device . The switch is nothing more than a series of contacts and , as you can see , there are four sets of resistors : two to make up the A and B combinations of our pot for one channel and another set for the other . <p> The advantages of a stepped attenuator are the possibility of better sound because of the parts quality . The downside of this arrangement is the volume is controlled in a series of fixed steps and you may or may not like the step level . <p> There are pots that can come close to the performance of a stepped attenuator , but rarely do they . <p> Most high end preamps of today use an electronic version of the stepped attenuator , replacing the mechanical contacts of the pictured switch with either relays or electronic relays . <p> Don ; t feel alone , I am not a big fan either . If you use CMOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in 1/2dB steps which is n't bad . There 's always a trade off between the best sound and the best functionality . <p> Sub-groups of the Connecticut Audio Society did preamp comparisons including one session to explore volume control technology . I brought Bryston and VTL models for active potentiometer designs and a Creek passive volume control which were ascending in that order . We then tried a stepped attenuator which was yet more refined but the champion was a stepped transformer . <p> The system output was refurbished ESL63s driven by Charlie Kings sublime amplifier . It is a Dyna Stereo 70 chassis with the input and driver stage replaced by a cascode so there is a single capacitor in the signal path : a PentaCap oil filled , skived Teflon , non-inductively wound structure in a military grade case which is likely the best sounding cap available . <p> My current system is an Ayre AX-7 which is FET switched resistors integrated with the power amplifier , likewise a cascode voltage gain stage driving FET outputs for a solid state replica of the King topology . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  understand how varying the relative distances between the wiper and the two ends of the conductive material controls volume . Wouldnt the signal just favor the path of least resistance , since both paths are not very long ? <p> Good question Mike . It happens because one end of the conductive material is at ground ( and therefore zero signal ) and the other is connected directly to the music ( and therefore 100% ) . So , forgetting the middle wiper for a moment , the resistive element has two extremes , zero and everything and in between , there 's every state between those two extremes . <p> The output of the pot is always the wiper so it is just picking off the signal at a point that 's 100% or 0% or somewhere in between . <p> Paul , I 'll show my electronics ignorance by adding to Mike As question . Does n't  the signal pass from A throughout to W , therefore the value from wiper ( W ) to B is irrelevant ? The total value of the pot , 10K in your example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that value for the position of the wiper ( W ) . <p> I thought only one resistor was needed for each stepped position per channel . <p> Acuvox submitted a correct answer , as did coppy , but I fear it still may not be clear to those struggling to get this . <p> Think of the pot as a single resistor going from A to B on the drawing . A has the signal in and B is going to ground . Ground is zero nada , nothing . If you then move W to the very middle of the pot , halfway between A and B , you get 50% of the level . This works because you 've divided our single resistor in half . <p> So if the pot " resistor " is 10,000 Ohms , when you place W halfway down this resistor , it is the same thing as having two resistors in series : a 5,000 Ohm from A to W and another 5,000 Ohms between W and B. <p> If we ignore that its a pot with a wiper , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5K . At the junction between the two resistors , you only have half the volume this is because were going from 100% volume to 0% volume at the top of the two resistors and the bottom of the two resistors . In between these two resistors you must have half . <p> Think of this instead of music as light . At the top of the string we have a bright flashlight pointing down . At the bottom we have a black hole with zero light . As the light travels from its brightest to the black hole , it is getting progressively closer to zero . Half way there 's only 50% of the light . If you were to tap off of the middle point youd only get half the light . <p> Dioes that get our understanding closer or am I still not hitting the mark as to why we need two elements ? <p> You still need a consistent path to ground for the signal . All of the signal may not exit on the wiper , the the preceding circuit needs to see a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two resistors , before and after the wiper . The resistor ladders simply duplicate that at fixed levels so the signal will see a constant impedance to ground . Think that 's correct . <p> Resistance is the ratio of voltage to current for a two terminal device . If you have two resistors in series as a load for signal , the input resistance is the sum of the two , In the case of a potentiometer this is constant . ignoring the loading of the following stage . With opamps or normal discrete circuitry this is a good approximation . <p> The output impedance is equal to the resistance between the wiper and ground , and so varies with the volume setting . Further , all impedance includes a variable depending on frequency which may account for the difference in sound between types of analog volume controls . ( Note : I count continuous time as analog , as this is the difference between digital and analog in my model of hearing ) . <p> A true stepped attenuator switches both resistors to maintain constant input and output impedance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would take perfect tracking , most likkely with hand trimming via knife or laser . Tracking is also a major issue in stereo potentiometers . The left and right vary relatively , shifting the balance as you change volume . Stepped attenuators obviate tracking errors . <p> Another sonic differentiator is the distortion of resistors . These factors are normally measured as voltage sensitivity ( the change in resistance with applied voltage ) , frequency sensitivity and non-linear dielectric absorbtion . The latter factor is subtle in resistors , but much more obvious in capacitors and cables . <p> The distortion of resistive elements with long life under a wiper means that potentiometers are always a compromise . You could use ultra-low distortion material but it would wear out too fast . <p> For many years almost all broadcast audio mixing boards used stepped attenuators for reasons of reliability . It was not until the 1970s that conductive plastic resistive tracks became durable enough for constant operation ( with , say , 4 audio sources , 2-3 minute singles and 30-60 second commercials , each pot might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Intermittent signal loss and crackly noises are a definite no-no ! <p> Many of these were true works of art . Big as a navel orange , contact studs arranged in concentric rows under a gently spring-loaded rotor , and highly polished shaft bushings . In operation they were quite smooth , with only a light feel of the contacts gliding across the studs . 2 dB steps were most common . A web search for " Daven attenuator " will bring up some pictures , as well as a few used units offered for sale ( not cheap ! ) <p> Even so , these required a regular clean &amp; lube maintenance schedule . They almost never failed though .

Engineers are obsessed with them because it makes for quicker communication of complex terms , and that makes sense , but what 's a poor Audiophile to do ? <p> Recently I have been getting a lot of email questions about DoP ( DSD over PCM ) and most of the questions would suggest folks are n't  understanding what DoP is .

I do n't  think it makes much difference how your remember your digital samples encoded as PCM or encoded as DSD or Apple Lossless or . <p> Nor should converting between these matter as long as one does n't  encounter numeric problems like overflow because such format conversions do n't  affect the data . If you can round-trip a conversion say PCM to DSD to PCM and recover the same bits , the datas unchanged . <p> What does matter a great deal is the A/D and D/A converters used .

I 've had various iterations of source ( e.g. Denon , oppo , Mark Levinson CD and many PCs ) . The TDAs only accept a digital input , XLR has remained my standard carrier ever since I bought them . <p> Do you include software in your transmission , because there are clear differences between the programmes I 've used ( e.g. WMC , XXHighend , JRiver ) and between system modifiers ( for want of a better term e.g. JPlay , Fidelizer , Audiophile Optimiser ) . I 'm currently using Windows Server with no GUI as opposed to the XP/7/8 I have used . <p> Those are the soft components ; I 've replaced the PC PSUs with Linear PSUs .

It separated the men from the boys . <p> Thanks Andy . One of the more intriguing characteristics of this new DAC is , indeed , its ability to render all the details buried in the CDs . The more I listen to this DAC , the more I listen to CDs . I thought it would be different . Yes , I thought with this DAC I 'd be surrounded by oodles of DSD and high rez materials but , in fact , I am increasing my enjoyment of plain old redbook and really enjoying the revelations of just how much is buried on those discs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on analog tape of course , remastered to CD expertly by someone of Buddy Holly singing True Love Ways . Its the first or second track I 'll play for people interested in hearing the system . Youd think I 'd play a DSD , but no , its CDs that rule right now . <p> I reckon that if the bits is different , the music will sound different . I suspect that Pure Music ( for example ) provides different bits than iTunes.May just be the theoretically below the noise bottom 4 bits ( on a 24 bit system ) which mayhap the software recomputes because it thinks it knows better what the dither should be.But if you have the same bits , what matters is the DAC . <p> And yes , using power amp DACs is likely to sound different from classical DAC into class A/B amp different DAC , and different conversion process ( if I recall correctly , self-oscillating as a result of a comparison feedback loop rather than combo ladder DAC/delta-sigma as Burr Brown etc might use ) <p> Luckily , I 'm no expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be for too bloody complicated , with driver upon driver getting in the way and doing weird sh*t to the bits .

@@23909518 @3909518/ <h> Bi-wire <p> I suppose that since we 've come this far- in our discussions on bi-amping we owe it to the knowledge base to write of another form of synergy tweaks , bi-wiring ; the use of one amplifier and two speaker cables . <p> Like bi-amping , we need to separate the loudspeakers inputs : tweeter and woofer . As mentioned earlier , these two inputs , if available separately , are strapped together for feeding with one power amplifier . Like this picture shows . <p> Remove the straps and what used to act as one , now form two separate inputs . <p> If we take the same approach to wiring , as we did with amplifiers , we use separate runs of speaker cable for each input : one to the tweeter , the other to the woofer , both terminating at the amplifiers single output . <p> Heres a- picture that shows the difference between bi-amping- and bi-wiring . <p> Bi-amping has two power amps , two speaker cables , two connections- between preamp- and power amp . <p> Bi-wiring has one power amp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power amp . <p> So , why would you consider spending twice the money on speaker cables in order to bi-wire ? Improved synergy . <p> Cables sound different . Some speaker cables work great at lower frequencies , others excel at higher ones . Few work great at them all . By choosing cables that are optimized for best performance within a specific frequency range , you can improve the musicality of your system . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 26 COMMENTS <p> Again , Paul , if the designer of the speakers has optimally voiced his speakers bi-wiring with a desired " cable sound " could only compensate for defiencies of the endusers amp compared to the reference amp of the designer ! ? Or the designer did a poor job and I would recommend here simply to replace the speakers ! <p> Yes and no , Paul . While I agree with you in general , there are cases where we can help the overall musicality of the sound with synergistic changes like bi-wiring . Not everyone is able to just wholesale change amps or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> Also , change to what ? There are no perfect anythings and we may want means to tweak . <p> Lastly , I do not practice this myself , though I think its valuable to bring the techniques out into the open so people understand what 's going on . <p> Nor I do , Paul . The biggest improvements I got by either " tweaking " the mains power supply including power cords or by exchanging my speakers . Thus I had four exchanges on the amp side ( from a stereo integrated to mono vacuum tubes ) but a dozen speaker exchanges . <p> Richard Vandersteen wrote a very informative article on the advantages of bi-wiring , based on his testing . I seem to recall that using different wires was a very bad idea . I personally found bi-wiring with identical wiresmuch superior to single wiring with a jumper strap . I do n't  understand the respected Nordosts preference for the latter . <p> And for good reason . Vandersteen made a compelling argument that with a Hall Effect probe , he determined that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that modulated the smaller signals of the mid/treble . This modulation was eliminated by at least a two-inch separation of the wires . This sounds straightforward enough . He further stated that all cables in a bi-wire set must be identical , otherwise it will interfere with the proper blending of the woofer and mid-range drivers through the crossover point . <p> here 's our old friend the telegraphers equation . LONG ... For some reason audiophiles do n't  understand or do n't  believe this equation although it is well grounded , existed before electronics , and has proven itself countless times to be very accurate at correlating with laboratory measurements . Instead they come up with preposterous theories including strand jumping and in the case of one JC the Fermi velocity of electrons . If you are a hammer every problem is a nail . If you are a physicist , every problem is rocket science . If you are an electrical engineer , every problem is a circuit problemunless it is a field problem . If you 're an audiophile wire salesman , every problem is a wire problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audiophiles probably just did n't  know about it . Can vibrating a wire alter its electrical signal ? Not unless it is in a magnetic or electrical field . Can placing a wire on an electrostatically charged up carpet affect it ? Maybe . I do n't  know but it probably is n't by much . <p> Can changing from one type of wire to another have an effect on electrical signals ? YES ! There is no question about it . The equation and the accompanying schematic show why . Increasing series resistance can lower effective amplifier damping factor . This can result in a bass boost at the woofer resonant frequency . The series inductance and shunt capacitance can result in high frequency dropoff . Skin resistance which is a well known phenomenon is represented by this high frequency filter . Generally the lower the better . The shunt resistance does n't  apply . It is always too high to matter . <p> Can bi-wiring alter sound ? In theory there is a rationalization for it but not the one Paul and audiophiles usually give . In practice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some resistance ( except superconducting wire at nearly absolute zero degrees . ) With single wiring , the back EMF from the woofer is applied directly to the midrange and tweeter at the crossover network input . With bi-wiring it must first encounter the low impedance output of the amplifier which will act to shunt it out before it reaches the midrange and tweeter . The series resistance actually helps especially between the amplifier and the midrange and tweeter . But the crossover network for the midrange and tweeter should filter out the back EMF from reaching the other drivers anyway . So this method MAY be more effective than not using it . I 've never tried it myself and have no interest in it . <p> I am convinced that the telegrapher equation is nothing but a huge oversimplification of what is really happening . An equation for engineers to handle most simple tasks of signal transfer . The fact that nobody really understands the nature of electrons and one has to introduce the strange particle-wave character or even dark matter or dark energy shows that the physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Maxwell was in contrast to Faraday . Fluid dynamics show that the reduction of a particle to a pure mass point can not reveal all kind of fluid particle interaction ! And things must be even more complex in the realm of electrons and their cousins ! <p> You 're fighting a hopeless battle against well accepted basic physics of electrical and magnetic fields explained by Maxwells four equations one of which is Faradays law of induction . Theyve been accepted for well over 100 years . You can google the telegraphers equation to see how it is derived directly from Maxwells equations . If you can prove your thesis that these equations are wrong even if you cant come up with an alternative , you just might win a Nobel Prize in physics . <p> All man made conclusions about the universe are oversimplifications . None of our mathematical tools are exactly accurate but they are the best we 've got . They usually serve us well enough to control our environment and predict what will happen . But as they are a purely abstract closed system of logic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real world 100% . I think for the purposes of audio equipment they are close enough.for government work as we sometimes say . But what you say sounds good.if you want to justify an expensive wire purchase . <p> I do know there are many proponents of using single wired speakers and jumper cables made of exactly the same speaker cables ( rather than using ant solid , metal " connectors " . Or at least similar ( same manufacturer , same quality to better ) . In this case think of it a bi-wired , just with a really short parallel speaker wire pair . There 's also a school of thought that connecting the tweeters ( or the woofers ) to the " long " speaker pair can have a varying effects on the sound . <p> Anyone who wants to experiment with low skin effect resistance wire that does n't  cost a ton should look into VFD wire ( its a generic type . ) This wire is intended for motors with variable frequency drives where it is desirable to allow harmonics to flow . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many different gauges for different size motors , some with an additional pair of wires for a tachometer that you wont need . Some are shielded and all of them are specially insulated to handle up to 2000 volts to prevent damage due to corona effect . Belden makes them , so do many other manufacturers . <p> In the bi-wire configuration , you 're doubling up on the load from the amp ( 8 Ohm Nominal ) thus 4 Ohm load on Amplifier . If the speakers are 6 Ohm Nominal , wo n't that place a 3 Ohm load on amplifier . Am I going to have to break out my old Nikko boat anchor or Soundstream Home Audio 200W THX ? <p> I am sorry , I am not sure how you are doubling the load ? If you 're thinking that by adding the two wires and " each has the same load " that it doubles , this is incorrect . It does not . The load to the amplifier is identical in either case . But , perhaps I misunderstood your question . <p> Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported how a pair of BHK amplifiers configured as monoblocks handily outperforms a single stereo BHK from a qualitative perspective , and have discussed why that might be . Fine , I get that . <p> Can you now augment the current discussion with a comparison between two BHK monoblocks in bi-wired mode , and a pair of stereo BHK amps in bi-amped mode ? I 'm thinking that a pair of stereo BHKs represents a comparable cost outlay to a pair of BHK monoblocks , so the comparison has good dollar-for-dollar equivalence compared to the $7k discrepancy when comparing a single stereo BHK vs a pair of BHK monoblocks . With , for example , my B&amp;W 802 Diamonds , which seem able and willing to reveal the benefits and limitations alike of most any amplification strategy to which I have subjected them , which of these configurations do you imagine would sound best ? And why ? <p> Great question , Richard , and that 's not the first time its been asked . If I had to do some quick hand waving , I 'd suggest a pair of monoblocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two is the same . <p> I can only venture a guess , as you 've asked , and here goes . I believe the parallel configuration of the monoblocks is what makes it sound so significantly superior to the stereo unit . We parallel the input tubes , the output stage and the power supply . These actions have a number of impacts : lower output impedance by half , twice the current capability of the power supply among them . <p> Now , take the example of the two stereos in bi-amp . Each channel still sounds the way it does and in the stereos defense , I would suggest this is one of the best sounding stereo power amplifiers in the world ( price no object ) . BUT is does not sound as good as the monoblock . Removing the load of the BHK , as you would in a bi-amp configuration , would not necessarily improve its performance . In fact , the BHK is more than capable of loafing along on your B and Ws so easing its already easy load is n't going to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ? Probably not . <p> But the monoblocks holy crap they just are amazing , however you configure them . <p> Good . And that makes sense . One good amp is better than multiple lesser amps and all is well in the world . <p> Extending this argument to active loudspeakers is key to explaining the core issue facing their advocates . At any given system price point an active loudspeaker will be equipped with multiple lesser amplifiers , and the designers hope is that the active aspect of the design is going to be able to make up for those shortcomings . As a long-time convertee to Ivor Tiefenbruns GIGO philosophy , that looks like a fundamental problem . <p> Much as active loudspeakers appeal to me on an intellectual level , these are significant practical challenges . 
@@23909520 @3909520/ <h> Slap echo <p> To diffuse something means- to pour out and spread , as a fluid , or scatter widely and thinly . And that is the best way we have of taming a rooms problems . We can absorb unwanted sound , but its always better to keep what 's broadcast by the loudspeakers , and spread the energy around to keep the room live , though most people seem to over damp their rooms . <p> Yet , both damping and diffusing have their places in listening rooms . Dampings great , if used sparingly , to eliminate slap echoes . Clap your hands in a live room and you 'll hear the quick retort bouncing off walls , - and this is called slap echo . Its not something we want as it can smear the stereo image by wreaking havoc on phase relationships .

If you find echo , have an assistant place a pillow or a heavy blanket where- you suspect it is reflecting from , to identify the problem area . Once you 've located it , and there may be several , you can use any number of tricks to reduce it . For example , - you can damp it or change the angle sound is reflected back at parallel walls . I did this in Music Room One when I discovered the junction between the wall and ceiling were culprits . I placed some wide trim at a 45- angle along the junction and eliminated echo- by refocusing the return energy , dissipating it into the room . I could also have absorbed it , but I prefer absorbing as little as possible . <p> Whatever you do to eliminate slap echo , just make sure you start one step at a time , add/change as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-damp the room .

Now imagine this method of hunting . You go out into the forest where you think there might be an animal you can kill , you are armed with a shotgun , not a rifle because it shoots over a wide area improving your chances . You put on a blindfold , turn around 3 times , and if you hear a noise you start firing in all directions one after another after another . Think there will be a feast at home that night ? I would n't count on it . Not much of a hunting method ? It gets worse . even if you knew you were hunting elephants you 'd be equipped with a squirrel gun . And if you ever chanced to encounter live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I find audiophiles so funny . This is how they hunt down their perfect sound system . But do n't  feel too embarrassed . The pros do n't  often get it right either . Avery Fisher Hall is living proof . Fifty years and god knows how many millions of dollars and how many tries and it still sounds awful . Bigger guns , more ammo , but just as blind and ignorant . <p> The clapping test is an inexpensive crude variant of an impulse test . You propagate a sudden burst of sound energy and see what happens . It has its uses . If you hear an echo of your clapping in your small room you know something is so wrong it must be fixed . What 's the optimal fix to do better than just curing the clap ? I du n no ! All I can tell you is that for understanding the acoustics of a room , for all the instrumentation pros have available , the impulse test has severe limits . It ca n't show you the full picture . The pros used blanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now some of them have graduated to dodecahedral ( twelve sided ) speaker arrays . What is the ideal room for listening to recordings ?

Happy hunting ! : - ) <p> Soundmind , not quite sure what you are saying here . I get the point that trying to fix an acoustic problem by clapping your hands and willy nilly applying damping or diffusion is as likely to work as shooting the shotgun in your example . But what 's the alternative , scientific analysis ? You frequently cite science as the proof that your way is better , yet your own example of Avery Fisher Hall shows science ( and probably a fair share of willy nillying ) has repeatedly failed to solve the problem . So what 's your solution for Paul to present ? <p> I do n't  have one However , I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reduced or increased by installing sound absorbing and reflecting materials . And that can be measured . If you can hear an echo from clapping your hands in a small room , RT is too long . You need to absorb some of the sound . The science is still primitive and there is a lot of trial and error , especially error . Recall that Pauls Helmholtz absorbers in Room 1 did n't  work very well . <p> There seem to be a lot of theories . Some years ago live end dead end rooms were all the rage . You do n't  hear much about them these days . <p> There was an interesting experiment done on a grant from the European Space Agency . Their goal was to encode hundreds of different alarm sounds into a pair of headphones because the response was faster than visual stimulus , and the vision was taken up by the astronaut looking where the spacecraft was going . <p> They put tiny microphones inside the ears of the test subject and held his head in a low profile vice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anechoic chamber and recorded impulse responses of the individual Head Related Transfer Function ( HRTF ) . <p> The various alarm sounds where then convoluted with the impulse responses and a physical model of a reverberant environment and fed to calibrated in-ear microphones . They documented ONE DEGREE spatial resolution in the forward medial plane . This is accurate enough to shoot a bow and bring home game if you are a good stalker , and people who live in the forest all their life with no speakers and motors in the vicinity can stalk at night too . <p> This brings up one of my best examples of Natural hearing and how much the post-industrial environment stunts our hearing . There is a tribe in the Amazon Rain Forest flood plain where there are no hills and no rocks . The visual horizon is around 2 meters , every path they cut is overgrown when they return and all the light is heavily filtered . They are hunter-gatherers ranging over an area of square miles chasing game . They navigate and hunt by HEARING the configuration of tree trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization get physically i 'll from the dis-orientation of invalidated visual direction sensing . <p> Ok , cant argue with that , but I got a different " tone " from your inital repsonse that made me think you knew the answer . Perhaps I read more into it than I should have . I think Paul was getting at the same thing , but I asume out of necessity he does not delve too much into specifics . I will say , science aside , there is a certain amount of fun and satisfaction for some people to just experiment , even if they do n't  know the science behind what they are doing , nor do they follow a scientific process . Trial and error does work , just not all the time . <p> There are specific room acoustic requirements for my own designs to work because those designs incorporate the acoustics as a critical and inherent part of the system . I cant comment on how to optimize other designs . All I can say is that even the pros sometimes have difficulty that leads to failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of millions of dollars building a new concert hall . On the other hand , sound reinforcement systems and public address type systems such as for sports arenas are practically an exact science . You pop the numbers into the computer software and the design pops right out . One major advance for this type of system was the development of controlled directivity speakers . This allows for uniform coverage and maximum gain before feedback . <p> Lincoln Center is too big and the wrong shape . The Schroeder limit ( where the reverberant energy equals the direct energy ) is around the first row . The stage is so big that the musicians cant hear themselves . <p> The best way to project into the audience and provide aural feedback for the players is to move them back against the wall and preferably add some side walls and a somewhat lower ceiling above them . Some conductors have figured this out for the Starr Theater , to avoid the acoustic anomalies that remain even after re-modeling by the best acoustic consultants in town . ( again , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : music and human hearing evolved in tribal cultures . Concert halls should be no larger than a large tribe . The biggest hall that maintains spectral balance and articulation for every seat is Zankel Hall , with a capacity of 600 . It also has proper geometry : narrow , deep and tall like Boston Symphony Hall and Viennas Musikverein . <p> The emulate this shape in the home requires diffusion on the walls and ceiling between the listener and the speakers . Discrete echoes in the 10-50 millisecond time frames kill any spatial information in the reproduced sound field . Too much absorbtion reduces envelopment . <p> The amount of time that audiophiles spent reading purple prose and near-meaningless scalar measurements of sound ( specifications ) would be better applied reading Leo Beranek or Barry Blesser . <p> There are a lot of theories about what is wrong with Avery Fisher Hall .

In fact even Beranek who originally worked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different times . It seems practically every major acoustician took a crack at fixing it and failed . One theory has it that the deep parallel side walls on the stage cause phase incoherence of the instruments due to excessive reflections . Maybe all of them are right , who really knows ? <p> Is there such a thing as " optimal spectral balance " for a concert hall ? The only clues to spectral balance is RT versus frequency and ILG fan test results . Many halls have weak bass . All halls have treble falling off at about twice the rate at 8 khz as at 1 khz . <p> Interesting article in Wikipedia . Originally Avery Fisher Hall then known as Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center was to be a near clone of Boston Symphony Hall with a capacity of 2400 seats . The managers went for it but The New York Herald Tribune pushed for a larger hall . Eventually BBN was told to make it larger and I think the capacity is around 2900 . BBN told the managers this would invalidate their original calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to them at the time they could n't predict how . And as we know it was a disaster . Still I think the volume of the room is roughly the same as Boston Symphony Hall . I cant remember where I saw the data but it surprised me , I though it was much larger . I think they are in the range of about 670,000 cubic feet . Carnegie Hall which is a much better sounding hall Than Avery Fisher is around 900,000 cubic feet . <p> You cant get the same acoustic effect from recordings in your room at home unless you find a way to build a machine that does the same thing a much larger room would do to sound but by a different method . That 's what I did . Short of that no hi fi system will ever sound anything like a live concert at a large venue . <p> Paul , today you reminded me of a demo from at least 20 years ago . About that time I was trying to learn a little about room acoustics and how to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business from his home brought in four reflective panels . As I recall they were about 5 ' tall and 2 ' wide . Each consisted of a light weight wood frame ( so easy to move around ) over which was stretched a thin mylar sheet . He placed these at side and rear ( of the room ) reflective points . They were angled rather than parallel to the walls . He said the intent was to retain sound energy in the room but to redirect it away from the listener , rather than over damp the sound with absorption panels at those points . <p> The result sounded pretty good but the panels were not attractive for a living room and I 'd forgotten about them . Hummm ? <p> Paul knows I get carried away talking about Diffusers ! But I actually want to mention something he brought out about taking care of the corners of your room with absorption !

I did the slap test and was pleased ! Worked out better than I thought ! So the combination of the two Diffusion and absorbers work hand and hand ! ! <p> Just curious Epsilon . What is the diameter and length of your tube ( bass trap ) . This sounds like a cheap alternative to commercial offerings . If it does n't  work in my room , no big financial loss .

Another unique feature is the adjustable diffusion grid built into the TubeTrap .

@@23909524 @3909524/ <h> Walls without reflections <p> Loudspeakers are designed in rooms without walls called anechoic chambers . At least they used to be , but most speaker companies have n't an actual room with walls that do not reflect , and so today they create virtual anechoic chambers with software . None the less , speakers are designed to work in perfect rooms , rooms that do not exist in- homes , then voiced to work as well as they can within a large room . <p> In yesterdays post- I suggested what- would happen if you placed a pair of speakers too close to the wall behind the loudspeakers . The tonal balance gets whacky , music sounds unnatural , the imaging is shoved forward , and our ability to hear a three dimensional illusion of sound diminishes . <p> Our next step in- learning how to make loudspeakers disappear- so they may create a- three dimensional image will be obvious to you : start pulling the speakers away from the wall behind them . As you do this the impact of the rear wall is reduced , the tonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and we reach a point where sound now comes from the plane of the speakers themselves . <p> One thing to pay particular attention to is how tonal balance is affected with increased distance from walls . As I explained earlier , speakers are designed without walls yet our rooms have them . A speaker far away from walls will have a tonal balance closer to what the designer intended . As you move them away from the rear wall you continue to improve the tonal balance , from bumpy to flat . If you have followed my example and the sound now comes from the speaker plane itself , your setup is still too close to the rear wall and tonal balance has yet to become flat ; the anomalies that push sound forward remain . <p> Contemplate my last paragraph carefully . I 'll continue tomorrow . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 18 COMMENTS <p> Hello Paul , Interesting article , but how about Hornspeakers . I have A pair of Avantgarde Uno hornspeakers and according to the importeur of Avantgarde in Holland you can place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . <p> The problem with placing them too close to the rear wall remains with even horn speakers . The lower frequencies are longer in wavelength than higher ones and wrap around the speaker . Too close to the rear wall and they reflect off the wall changing the way the speakers sound . Some speakers are better than others at this , but generally we want as little room interaction as possible . <p> In my experience , it does not seem to be as simple as in your article . What I have found is that there is a point away from the rear wall that sounds best with sound reflected from the rear wall to reinforce those from the speakers . Further away could result in the rear wall reflections canceling some of the sound from the speakers like what happens in a Boss noise cancellation earphone . As to the reflections from the side walls , one will need tube traps or some other sound absorption material to reduce the reflections so that they will not adversely affect the imaging from the speakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do well . Making speakers disappear is only the basic and is not difficult to achieve . I use a pair of Infinity IRS Beta speakers which are rather difficult to place well as the distance and angle of the bass speakers in relation to the mid and high panels is critical . <p> Yes , but your speakers are dipoles. only the bass is in a box , and this article is specific to boxes . Further , your speakers have amazing imaging properties and are easy to make invisible , other speakers not so much . <p> What I am hoping to achieve with this article is to help people first understand speakers should and can disappear , second , to keep their image behind the loudspeaker , not in front . There are too many misunderstandings about imaging at least the way I see it . <p> I forgot to mention about the relationship between the two speakers if you are only using two . They can enhance the sound of each other as well as cancel some of each others sound . One should therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best sounding spot . I know it involves a lot of work and a lot of try and error . But to me it is the only way to get the best placement for your speakers . <p> As I posted yesterday , there is more than one way to look at a problem . For 99.99% of audiophiles , you would probably do well to follow Pauls advice . If your speakers were designed within the last 20 or 30 years they were designed with this installation concept in mind . That is how they will work best . But that is not the only way to look at it . As an experimenter and someone who likes to play with math and physics I use a different method . <p> The way room acoustics affects sound as Paul described it is real and alters the sound you hear greatly . The reflections do not have the same spectral balance as the sound coming directly from the speakers . This occurs for at least two reasons . First the speaker does not radiate sound uniformly in all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any size beam their sound to an increasing degree as frequency increases . This is related to the size of the driver but also to the way it is constructed . Second , the materials your room is made from do not reflect sound to the same degree as frequency changes . therefore even if the speaker were omnidirectional and had flat FR in every direction the reflected sound wound not be flat . <p> Ironically the dome tweeter was invented by Edgar Villchur of Acoustic Research because among other things it could be made to have very wide dispersion at very high frequencies . By making the dome half a hemisphere , not recessed and only 3/4 inches in diameter Roy Allison invented the second widest dispersion tweeter I know of for AR3a . It is only down 5 db 60 degrees off axis at 15 khz . Even that was n't good enough for him . In LST he used four of them two of which were on panels angled 45 degrees , one towards the left , one towards the right . Later he invented a tweeter under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison todays dome tweeters are typically 1 ? , are not full hemispheres , and are recessed into the baffle to increasingly focus their sound in a narrow beam as frequency increases . As a result , frequency response changes radically as you move away from the speakers axis . One more advantage of dome tweeters compared to cone tweeters that were previously used is their high strength to mass ratio . A dome is very strong for its weight and can therefore be made very light to have low inertia at high frequencies without breaking up the way cones do . <p> Another problem is the woofer . The closer the woofer is to reflecting surfaces , the louder it will play and therefore the less distortion for a given input signal level at a given frequency . As the speakers are moved closer to reflecting surfaces the bass becomes increasingly loud . So the least bass will occur when it is placed in the middle of a room halfway between the floor and ceiling . The most will occur where it is placed in the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By pulling the speakers away from the wall and placing them at ear level deep bass will all but disappear . The cure has been to either build a tower speaker with the bass drivers near the floor or to use an outboard subwoofer . The problem here is that when the subwoofer and the rest of the speaker operate at the same frequency in their crossover region but from different locations there are significant phase interference problems creating irregular FR for the listener , often a loss of mid bass . This is true for all such speaker arrangements including Infinity IRS . <p> What are the alternatives ? A speaker that has the following goals , flat FR from the directly arriving sound over a wide angle , flat FR from the reflected sound , reflected sound arriving at the listener over a wide angle including vertically , the ratio of direct to reflected sound controllable without moving the speaker , reflected sound traveling the same paths at all frequencies to arrive at the listener . How can this be done ? Not with an omnidirectional speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generate the required reflected sound compensating for variables in the front radiated sound and the frequency dependent absorption characteristics of the room these design criteria can be closely met . In this design the direct and much of the reflected sound are controlled independently of one another such that they match . As I see it , this is the best one can expect from a speaker for a stereo sound system . Is this the best that can be done ? No . For very specific cases where different speakers are used for each instrument in a recording and special recordings are made , Acuvoxs design is superior . However , for general purpose use with recordings we have played in a home , his concept is not feasible . <p> This is a formula for fitting reproduction speakers into an existing room , and only work if the room has sufficient absorbtion and diffusion to make the criteria achievable , including bass leakage . Further , it ignores phase which is the dominant component of spatial perception in persons who hear physically generated sound daily . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party effect " where people follow a conversation int a noisy , crowded , reverberant room . It has been shown that an arbitrary amount of precision in microphones and DSP power cant equal humans in this task . Phase and microsecond time perception also help explain why some humans can hear ten times better than theoretically possible according to the Fourier Uncertainty Principle . <p> My speaker criteria are flat frequency and phase response at all angles . This is not possible at realistic sound levels , so I have chosen to mimic the spatial radiation pattern of physical instruments , which can be replicated accurately by speakers the same effective acoustic size and shape as the original sound source . Two key design choices make this possible : first , dipoles have flatter off-axis response than any other configuration of pistonic radiator ; and second , the Heil transducer has five times the radiating surface of the aperture area . <p> Reproduction of mixed signals introduces a large amount fo compromise into this equation . The drivers have to be simultaneously large enough to reduce Doppler distortion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recorded instruments . I see the Allison multi-facet approach as the best solution , but it needs to be more complex than his or yours . <p> This has to be matched with absorbtion and/or diffusion at all first reflection points in the room . This means acoustic modification of the ceiling , floor , front and side walls with special attention to corners and room edges which are strong reflectors and furniture edges which are strong diffractors . <p> This perceptual phenomenon proves that imaging is artifactual and that conventional rooms cant present a real image from pan pots with an arbitrary number of channels . The purported stereo illusion that comes from level differences between left and right ( or LCR , or 32 channels of ATMOS ) is fake . Further , this experiment shows that frequency response is not the answer it is necessary , but insufficient . The frequency response away from the walls still has narrow band resonances , they are just so numerous that measurements average them out . If your MLS software allows it , look at the raw , unfiltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/12th octave resolution and nobody publishes better than 1/3 octave . The 1/3 octave rule is due to really bad audiological science that assumes the cilia are tuning forks . Also , any more accurate pictures are bad for marketing . <p> Speakers optimized by physically or computationally anechoic configurations will of course not work correctly in hard walled rectangular rooms playing music but at least they work for MLS tone bursts ! I remember the instructions for the Dunlavy SC-VI as reported by Steven Stone : the speakers should be in a 60 degree triangle with the listener , at least ten feet away from the listening position and walls , and the listener should likewise be ten feet from walls . This means Dunlavy was specifying the minimum room at 30 feet length and width , and I suppose sixteen feet high so the ceiling was ten feet from the top of the speakers . He tested his speakers in an anechoic chamber , as befitting a retired antenna designer who had a brilliant career controlling waves that are more easily specified and measured . John Dunlavy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate assessment of audio fact coupling his optimization of transducer to optimized acoustic environment for music reproduction through speakers designed to this criterion . If you follow his instructions , you are rewarded with nearly perfect frequency and phase response for a few tandem seats in a thousand square feet of enclosed space . I have a trio of SC-I , and yes they are that good in the right acoustics . <p> Roy Allison pointed the way to speaker design that works correctly with one wall and is as far as possible from the others . The AR LST and the iterations of Allison Research speakers had an audible improvement over conventional speakers in transmission of imaging and in-room spectral balance , yielding a larger sweet spot from " up against the wall " . If you learned to hear music from boxes or towers located a few feet from the wall , this may not sound correct to you because it reduces the artifacts that most audiophiles and reviewers hear as " pinpoint imaging " . <p> The Boston crowd advantaged by a pre-eminent concert hall placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall on the floor or on shelving and marveled at the improvement in reproduction . Incidentally , real live acoustics is not " pin-point imaging " . Try this experiment : buy tickets to front and center for a symphony , and then close your eyes and try to count the violins as some reviewers claim they can do with six figure systems playing CDs through sharp edged speaker cabinets . <p> Paul , I understand you comments but you 've ignored designers who worked to utilize the front wall to enhance response . The AR-LST ( already mentioned ) , the Tannoy ( corner horn ) , and various models from Sonab , Snell , Linn , Naim , etc. were all designed for near-wall placement . This is not to say they imaged as well as others that worked well out into the room . But as you 've commented other times , no single solution in audio design solves all issues and some designers have intentionally worked to take advantage of room boundaries . <p> Now an interesting point is these are all older designs . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ todays market and rather than design speakers that can perform well at or near the front wall the focus has been more for smaller , less obtrusive designs . And maybe that is because of the interest in imaging . <p> Of course , gilding the lily of a sonic illusion like stereo is largely futile and contentious . Apart from low bass issues , any soundfield pattern in a stereo or 5.1 listening room has a major audible spatial distortion defect . That is , no matter where the frontal image between the speakers seems to be , the room reflection pattern is fixed in directionality and frequency response . This early reflection pattern may differ slightly in level depending on which speaker is louder or softer , but the fixed ILD , ITD , and pinna cues for every player in the orchestra or actor in the movie , tell the brain that the soundfield is not normal binaural . Normally when a sound moves in front of you it produces early reflections from the side , ceiling , front , and the rear that also move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lots of different ways . Some brains may like one fix or another and sense more depth or space but this kind of tinkering can only be marginally effective . The normal binaural sense of depth , realism , or space is sometimes called envelopment . There is a tweak for this to make the early room reflections dynamic that I call Envelophonics . For me anyway , it eliminates the need for most room tinkering . But DSP or software are not for audiophiles , so this is not a likely tweak for the readers of this particular forum . Maybe in the next generation of listeners . <p> You are of course correct Ralph , two channel stereophonic sound gives you only two fixed ITDs and ILDs where live sound will give you different ITDs and ILDs for every individual source . The problem for the installation of two channel stereophonic sound systems is to somehow make the first seem to be the second . Under highly contrived circumstances this is possible but usually only for a very limited region of space . Very wide dispersion seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow dispersion at high frequencies where it matters a great deal . <p> Despite its obvious shortcomings the market has overwhelmingly approved stereophonic sound as superior to monophonic sound . The proof is that with the introduction of the stereophonic phonograph record in 1958 and FM stereo multiplex broadcasts a few years later the market has grabbed hold of it and never let go . <p> Recognizing the limits of stereophonic sound the industry tried to extrapolate its achievement in the 1970s . If two channels were good , four should be better . But it did n't  work out . It failed because it was a technical failure that magnified the shortcomings of stereophonic sound without producing the desired and promised results . <p> here 's a paper by Leo Beranek , one of my best sources for knowledge of concert hall acoustics about Listener Envelopment Value ( LEV . ) I hope you find it as interesting as I do . There are also four other papers on Beraneks own site . <p> Note that on page 2 it had been established relatively recently that late vertical and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 60% respectively compared to early lateral faction . BTW , I do not agree with Beraneks definition of BQI which he asserts is 1-IACC . Instead I propose d(IACC)/dx where x is the lateral position of the source on the stage . If Beraneks definition were correct , then for a listener in the central line of a concert hall and a performer at stage center , IACC would be 1 and BQI would be 0 . Acoustics would be awful . We know that 's not true from experience . <p> You do n't  need to know how concert halls work if you just produce such a soundfield at home from a hall impulse response or a properly made 4.0/6.0 recording . You also do n't  need perfection to go a long way to beating ordinary 60 degree stereo this way even when you start with the existing library of LPs and CDs . 2.0 files do not need to be reproduced using speakers at 60 degrees and indeed should not be played back this way . New and older products from Xivero , NeutronMP , Miniambio , Theoretica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance . Stereophiles should just think of this as another tweak . <p> I think we are going to agree to disagree on this one Ralph . As I 've posted recently , there can be entirely different approaches to analyzing and solving a problem . My approach is radically different from yours and unsurprisingly obtains very different results . <p> My analysis began with trying to understand how concert halls work , that is to understand precisely what they do to sound that arrives at just one spot , the one you happen to be at . Not having any formal training in acoustics but having the tools to analyze this problem I came up with my own unique solution to it , an novel approach . This then led me to understand what I would have to do to duplicate its effect by other means . It also led me to think long and hard about how hearing works to differentiate different kinds of acoustic effects and I came to different and novel conclusions there too . I 've also tried to understand the significance of these difference , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just different . <p> As each of the novel approaches breaks new ground trying to advance the state of the art through greater understanding than is commonly accepted including by " experts " I have great respect for those who even dare to challenge the common wisdom whether they succeed in their efforts or not . This is why I respect you and your efforts even though we disagree . <p> Hi , We always speak of a the listening triangle parallel to the rear wall = triangle pointing downward ( or upward ) within a square representing the room . Did someone experience a triangle shifted 45- where the rear wall and the left ( or right ) wall are at 45- of the spekaers plan , allowing the corner of those 2 walls being farer of the speakers plan ? I believe it should sound better , no ? Thank you

It was the ugliest bit of kit you have never seen . The considerations which led to its replacement were almost completely aesthetic , plus the ability to lift the amp without risking a hernia . <p> As I have said before , I am a fan of the design of Dieter Rams .

As I spend more money for a product , I expect all aspects of that product to be of higher caliber.including the case , faceplate , etc . As an example , I think the look of the PASS amplifiers are killer . His amplifiers are n't  cheap , but the silver face with the dimmed blue accent lighting and layered aluminum is a joy to look at ( in my opinion ) . I 'm sure his view from the start was n't " Let me build this cool looking product " , but rather " I now need to make the the amp look up to par with its performance " a no stone unturned kind of deal .

I wanted one since the Sean Connery Bond days . I pulled the trigger when I was at a place where I could comfortably afford one . What I found was that the watch ultimately gained or lost a few minutes base on my activity level . They have a motion based winding mechanism . Several jewelers explained that this is to be expected . Personally , I have 1 ask of a productthat it do its primary function . As much as I liked wearing that watch , it ultimately annoyed me so much I sold it . To others , the fact that it loses &amp; gains a little time is overall less important .

A ground wire is a low impedance connection to ground so that in an electrical fault current flows through the ground wire in preference to flowing through you to protect you from injury and death . 100 milliamps can be sufficient to be fatal .

@@23909538 @3909538/ <h> Rediscovering music <p> One of my all time favorite operas is Verdis- Don Carlo with Pl+cido Domingo and the Royal Opera House Orchestra , Covent Garden , conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini on an EMI Classics recording . The work is- an utterly inspired 1971 recording of the five-act Italian opera . The cast is stunning , with Domingo as a brash Don Carlos , and Sherrill Milnes as a volatile and virile Rodrigo . <p> I had been listening to my favorite sections , acts 1-4 , - on my headphones for some time now and it sounded like a rich and full-bodied recording " so I was eager to play it in Music Room One . The only version I had was a direct copy from a friends 3-disc set stored on my Mac Mini server . The richness and warmth I heard through headphones was all there , but the rest left me sad . Where the moving strains of low strings should have lifted voices off the stage and the tympanis power almost frightening , I was left with a sense of emptiness I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a poor recording . It was , after all , 46 years old and on analog tape . <p> By chance , a friend brought the actual CD set by and we slipped the disc into the DirectStream Memory Player just to hear the difference . I nearly fell out of my listening seat . The power , glory , and richness of this CD was overwhelming . Neither of us could stop listening to Giulini presiding over the company of Covent Garden . It breathed , it came to life , its power unmistakable . How could this be so different from the same CD copied onto my hard drive ? <p> I made another copy and we tried it again on the server . Flat , dull , and the same as before . So much so I deleted the files from the drive and spent the $89 for a copy of this rare CD on Amazon . Fingers crossed it arrives soon enough . <p> If you have yet to hear what CDs truly sound like , nows your chance . Check out the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're not in the States , drop me a line and I 'll see what I can do to help . <p> Rediscovering what 's on these silver discs is the most fun I 've had in some time . Too bad most of my great music is trapped on the hard drive . <p> Got ta fix that . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> Last year you had the same deal , also with the DMP and DSJ combo , and I tried to benefit from that . But since I just had bought the DSJ a month before this " campaign " started , bad luck for me . Had I been a psychic , I would have waited a month . And something else . What about the promise you made 10 days ago : " Less than one week later , we 'll release Huron for DirectStream Junior " . I still see Torreys . When can we expect this new version for DSJ ? <p> Sorry to be a pain but all you 've proved is how poor your server is ! OK I have n't got a DMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge II ) beats the PWT , so potentially you should be much closer on SQ with the DMP if your server were improved . Indeed I suspect that if the latest lens technology in the DMP were included in the Bridge you 'd be hard put to tell the difference . <p> It might seem like that but I disagree . My servers long been the best source in my system . In fact , up until the DMP , anything ripped to the hard drive sounded better than through the transport . Now that has reversed itself and not because the server got worse . It is unchanged . <p> OK but I still believe the fault lies with the server : you probably have not yet realised the best SQ from this source . I think I 've posed this question to you before how do you isolate the crud generated by the server ( airborne and wireborne ) from the DS DAC ? <p> I 've found that a pair of ethernet wire-to-optical fibre converters connected back to back and separated by 3ft of optical fibre gives a noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all wireless devices removed to at least 6ft away . <p> That 's probably an accurate statement . I know that with our upcoming server and all the pains we 've gone to it should be possible to best even DMP , but I have yet to hear anything actually do that . Time and work will tell . <p> Providing the rip is perfect the bit image on a server should be identical to that on the CD . Any differences you can hear must be due to the differences in the processing applied to music coming from the two different sources . The question then becomes what are you doing wrong with the handling of streamed sources . <p> My streaming service allows up to 24/192 download and offline storage ( into hidden non-transferable files ) . The Don Carlo is at 16/44 . The tablet I intend to use is a $150 Samsung thing I purchased in a supermarket , but it has a slot with a 128gb micro sd card fitted . The portable DAC has to be connected with a wire , although they have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped on the end , the whole thing still has the footprint of an iPhone and the thickness of a packet of fags . Even sitting in the garden , I can get the data off my NAS drive ( QNAP ) wirelessly . There does seem to be an almost endless number of ways of getting the same digital data into a D/A converter these days . I must admit that I moved on from using lasers to extract it about 7 years ago , which to me seem almost as archaic as scraping plastic with a bit of old rock . My only concern would be for the extent of remastering . The Don Carlo was originally remastered for CD in 1986 , so presumably excellent , and was remastered in 2000 . <p> I know this is an old post but I 'm hoping you get this email . So I actually got the EMI/1986 master of this opera from my local library . I have the three disc EMI set in my hand along with the book all in Italian LOL <p> So , I will admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opera but I am curious what you all listen for and what raises the hairs on the back of your neck , if you will , in listening to something like this ? What volume level or otherwise , what should I listen for in trying to grasp this recording ? The volume level may be of particular importance , do you listen at live concert levels or just as a quiet listening environment ? <p> I ripped it to flac on my computer to listen via NAS streaming . I have no real CD transport in my house other than Blu-ray players and their optical out . Anyway , I hope you have a great day and I will look forward to hopefully hearing something from you . <p> I 'm no opera buff at all , I go to about 6 or 8 a year , and avoid seeing the same thing twice . I see far more ballet and dance ( went last night ) , music then theatre . This is the first opera I can recall listening to at home . I have a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I adored live and wanted to watch again . I can appreciate fine playing and singing , I think anyone can , just as anyone can go to the theatre and enjoy a play . Ive come to consider live opera to be perhaps the ultimate art form , there is so much that stimulates the senses ( music , singing , acting , dance sometimes sets , costumes , lighting ) . There is no mystery to it . Sometimes the human voice can impart so much emotion it almost stops you breathing . Jessye Norman is one , more recently I went to a recital of songs about despair , loss and death sung by Matthias Goerne accompanied by Daniil Trifonov , that was so captivating , it is difficult to describe . I 'll let someone else do LONG ... That may not help , you just have to go with the flow . Best to try and get to an opera or a live broadcast in a cinema ( which I also do its 10 times cheaper ) for the full experience . <p> Great input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live opera , and honestly not sure they play in my town often . I think I will give this a listen at louder levels to start , so will wait a day or so until my significant other is out on an appointment lest she yell downstairs and wonder what is going on ! , , <p> I am not certain its anything wrong , but perhaps a matter of what is right . Clearly , the bits are the bits and that 's not at issue . How those bits are delivered in terms of timing and noise is what likely makes all the difference in sound quality . <p> Noise might be an issue , Paul . But there are USB-connections with galvanic isolation today . And as far as I understood the DMPs USPs it is a memory ( ! ) player , thus the bits are send from a RAM as in most music servers . You often hinted to the best size of the RAM capacity ! But maybe you have a secret here that should n't be revealed . But could you specify the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the same spot in the rack as the DMP ? <p> You write , " How could this be so different from the same CD copied onto my hard drive ? " Since you 're working on a server that can be connected to your DAC , you must have some thoughts on this . At AXPONA you had mentioned that you heard differences when the same DSD material was played from disc and computer ; presumably the new product you 're working on would allow the material to be played " correctly , " with no audible difference between the two . Can you let us know how things are progressing in this regard as you develop the server ? <p> My local library has it available to check out and listen to , thanks to my tax dollars funding the library system quite well . I just reserved it for pickup tomorrow ! Of course I have nothing very sophisticated to spin the discs with but will be anxious to hear how it sounds ! <p> In case a proper setup Bridge II really sounds flat and dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future developments . <p> From a PS Audio business standpoint I could understand , if first larger numbers of DMPs and maybe the upcoming music server equipped with a new digial lens would be planned to be sold before a new Bridge on the same level with probably much less profit is going to be published . <p> I have no doubts this happens not too far away , as the DMP is a great solution for a currently still existing limited demand , but surely not what a large crowd of todays listeners need , not to speak of tomorrows listeners . My guess : hardly anyone of &lt;25 year olds still reminds physical media , half of &lt;50 potential customers migrated to streaming or waits to do so . <p> I just think as the DMP plays from memory instead of network drive , it somehow must be possible to isolate or buffer the music from the network drive , too , before played , if this is the trick together with an improved lens . <p> I just would n't delete the ripped storage because some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at least until another streaming device does not match the DMPs performance , there 's no reason for PS Audio to improve the bridge . I keep being patient , let PSA sell the DMP to those who want the improvement now or stick on physical media and see what time will tell <p> Not to forget the DMP is the only official and permitted solution to play SACDs to the DAC ( as long as new SACDs continue to exist ) . <p> Your bundle deals never seem to find their way to the UK . The distributor always says margins are too tight I have , finally , arranged for my DS combo to be delivered this Thursday and would have loved something off the price ! <p> John777 I understand your plea . Being in the same position I tried last year , but it did n't  happen for me , although I wrote PS Audio and the distributor for my country an email . But like I said , I already bought the DSJ , some weeks " too early " . So I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not exactly a bargain . However , I wish you all the succes and luck ( you 're gon na need it ) in the world to convince your distributor . <p> Well , unless something miraculous happens I 'll be waving the bus goodbye , no longer working and the projected price in Australia is a little too rich for my blood , so the PWT is going to keep friends with the rest of the PS gear DSD , BHK pre and 250 , P5 . But there is a new bit of gear that has breathed quite a bit life into the cd collection and downloads and that 's a Melco N1Z , 6tb of storage , 2 power supplies rips , sorry imports cds with ease and produces a sound that I did n't  think possible from a cd . Looking forward to downloading as there are a number of sites that one will be able download direct to the server , which will be interesting . I 've done the J River on Mac , Synology NAS , Minimserver and now something that 's built for music . Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feel of people re-discovering vinyl once again , except the price of entry is considerably steeper . It will be interesting to see if there is any trickle down from this , but I fear there may only be trickle up technology to follow . <p> I am ! And , a rebel too ! I am the guy that does n't  stop at stop signs in the middle of nowhere , and if someone gives me a ripped copy of music and I like it I keep it and play it . <p> Until recently when I discovered how much better the actual disc sounds than the server version , that 's a lot of what I did . Now , I am on the hunt for the actual physical disc . I am only a pirate when it is to my advantage and ca n't be done another way . <p> @badbeef I 'm not sure how you can make such a pronouncement , when you have yet to update to Huron on your DSDjr. -And the update to the Bridge II is forthcoming , enabling the total unfolding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heeded your advice regarding USB , but still use a Lanrover to stream Tidal to my DSD , along with some pretty good MQA masters . My PWT still sounds better overall , since Huron , thru the I2S input , which is lacking in the DSD USB input . My quandary is whether to spring for the bridgeII and full MQA unfold , or invest in a DS memory transport . ( I have a nice CD collection , but no SACDs ) I would appreciate your opinion . Regards , John <p> You mean , " Discs sound best " ? rgallos question was whether flash drive on the DMP sounded as good as disc . I think if you go over the DMP boards you would likely find a lot of owners feel that discs win , and as I recall , so does Paul . <p> If you 're a fan of what MQA does with the sound , that will only function through the Bridge II , and is unrelated to the DMP . So in the sense of the original question I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to " What 's the best sound or way to play it " , as it does n't  exist until the B2 update coming later . <p> My guess is some folks will think a disc on the DMP via I2S to the DSD sounds better than MQA via the B2 , and others will feel the opposite . But they are two very different animals in my mind . Pick what you like best . Its another format and allegedly different master . <p> If you 've read the MQA Controversy thread , you know the reasons Paul , myself and others are leery of it . I 'm still open to hearing valid comparisons of known source material , and itll be interesting to compare . <p> And a Bridge vs. a DMP is also an " apples and oranges " deal as well as vastly different cost . If you 're excited about MQA , get a Bridge II , you can always sell it if you decide MQA is n't worth it . <p> Thanks for that , Badbeef . I admit I have n't followed the discussions about the DS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm leaning in that direction . I have no allegiance to MQA and have only heard the first unfold thru Tidal . It does seem to be a thinly disguised attempt to herd the recording industry . At this point , I 'll sit back and watch the antics of that industry . -Too bad the artists will get the short end of the stick whatever the outcome . -John <p> I can always depend on you to take a dig at all things analog , " It was , after all , 46 years old and on analog tape . " Paul , some of the greatest recordings ever made were made over fifty years ago , on analog tape . Just saying ! <p> Oh , somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright , The band is playing somewhere , and somewhere hearts are light ; And somewhere men are laughing , and somewhere children shout , But there is no joy in Mudville " mighty IRS struck out . <p> Ive been trying to tell you that RBCD IS the best method for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , HD , and the rest of it either adds things of no value like extra dynamic range and FR beyond the audible range or lose something . How nice people do n't  want CDs anymore , happy with their ipods , iphones , and earbuds merrily merrily merrily gently down the stream . You can buy them used in perfect condition for a song . And then there are no controls left to fix anything . Hats off to the countless engineers who fleeced audiophiles out of god knows how much money to get them where they are . By the way , what were those headphones you liked ? Beats ? Do they work on Android phones ? Ya know what , I 'm sticking with my two pairs of original Sony MDR V6s . If you buy a pair , be careful , there are fakes out there and they do not perform nearly as well . What review prompted me to try them out in the first place ? Consumer Reports . My neighbor had a pair and I loved them . Recording engineers still use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons they 're used in location audio recording work is the vocal-region response hump makes it easier to discern vocal issues , even in noisy environments . No one I know would use them for engineering a studio recording , as they 're not flat . Though some engineers are fairly deaf in that region : ) <p> If the DMP is doing something special to both CD and SACD AFTER extracting the ones and zeros from a disc and putting them into memory , why bother with the disc ? Just get the data from a hard drive or the Ethernet . I have no doubt 16/44 can sound absolutely wonderful , as I experienced with dCS Vivaldi 4 years ago ( it was the audio equivalent of receiving the Stigmata ) . Although that device and its predecessors can extract the digital data from a SACD , as the DMP now does , SACD was not necessary to demonstrate how transparent and refined a sound can be produced from digital data . The Problem with SACD , I understand , is that its benefits only arise ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSD or encoded from the original tape . Not that common these days , I know only of Alia Vox , Pentatone and one or two others who do . It was of course conceived for multichannel. dCS did n't  bother with SACD in their latest device . Ironically my streaming provider is doing DSD in 3 or 4 months , I 'm not entirely sure why they bother . Then someone can compare streamed DSD with SACD , not me , I 'm too busy . <p> What we 've seen so far is that the DMP does its best stuff right off a shiny disc for some reason . Seems like a silent flash drive with the same bits on it should be better , but its currently a USB connection , which is where the deficiencies likely reside . <p> I 'm puzzled . Badbeef says cd sounds better than usb using DMP . If both mediums end up going through the same buffer , etc. why is this so ? Is there more info being extracted from the cd or is the usb inherently inferior to begin with ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible for digital audio this is revealed by the fact that you can keep hanging dongles on it , galvanically isolate it , put linear power supplies on these devices , etc. and you can keep making it incrementally better . If it was good to begin with , none of these tweaks would help . And then you have Frankenstein cable rigs ( " Its pronounced , Fronkensteen ' " ) everywhere , which may fix some issues , but add to the complexity , which is rarely an indicator of a great solution . <p> My bewilderment on the usb input in Dmp stems from my own experiences with a modified Oppo-105 SE . The noise floor is much lower with the mods . I 'm not sure what work was done on the usb inputs , but I hear no difference when playing cd vs usb with same music . When I play sacds vs dsd via usb the flash drive sounds noticeably better than the disc . This may be an apples and orange comparison since the dmp/ds dac are vastly superior to begin with thus perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul often mentions the resolving power of the component or system . If your telescope gives you awesome images of the Inner planets , but vague , fuzzy images of Planet X , it resolves to some level below that . Its really good , but not for viewing planets at the distance of Planet X or greater . When you look at it with Hubble , you say , " Duh ! " <p> That should go in the new ad copy the " DMP is the Hubble of all transports " . I 'm not sure how much better they have gotten , or if a couple grand in mods does it , but the better my gear got , the more obvious it is that the Oppo 83se may be a very good value , but compared to even my old PSA Lambda with the Benchmark Dac2 they ai n't  all that good . And I do believe at their price point , you get a lot , I 'd even buy a new one for watching Blu-rays and DVDs , but they are n't  giant killers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not wait for the next generation of the player , which is then based on the latest , the current version of the OPPO drive ? Then the last curtains will be removed again and you can listen even deeper into the music . The fine-dynamics will benefit greatly and the sound colors are as natural as never LONG ... After that were waiting for the next upcoming version . That one will remove curtains , which we did not know they even exist .

So far , we 've succeeded in- getting music onto our Mac or PC , edited- the information so its accurate and good looking . Well next need an easy , slick way to control and browse the library . Well then connect to our DAC and do what we can to get the best sound . <p> One of the reasons I still use iTunes as my main music manager- is the ease and simplicity of its interface . Are there better ones ? Not many . JRemote , the mobile app that control JRivers good , - but JRiver is n't the easiest program to get along with for the uninitiated . We routinely recommend JRiver to our Bridge customers who do not use a NAS . Many users have great results . But , for those who are a bit computer adverse , JRiver can be challenging . Then , there 's Roon . Ahh , Roon . Roon is near and dear to my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers with a brilliant product . The king of kings when it comes to the user interface .

Roons perhaps where you want to graduate to : like Harvard or Yale . But , in the meantime , for those getting their feet wet experiencing the joys of a first music library , there 's iTunes ; free , easy , approachable . <p> We can control- iTunes through our desktop mouse , keyboard and video monitor . But that 's not really in the spirit of how we want to interact with the music in our listening- room .

You can sort by album , artists , song , genre , playlist and more . Its pretty intuitive so I wo n't waste space explaining how it works , but if you get stuck and I doubt you will email me and I 'll be glad to help . You can also use a laptop to connect remotely , but that may be beyond the scope of this tutorial for now ( though its easy ) . <p> Whenever I travel to shows , group meetings or presentations to audio clubs , I bring a little wifi router ( just to connect to the iPad ) , my Mac Mini , and an iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JCat USB cable , - and play extraordinary music to everyones delight .

In an earlier post you described the improvements of the sound quality by adding a jitter-bug or Regen . Now you add a WiFi connection . Wouldnt this drastically degrade the sound quality you just had tweaked by switching off some routine functions of the Mac Mini and spending a big RAM ? <p> My recollection is that you thought the sound improved noticeably when you turned wi-fi off . I remember reconfiguring my own Mac Mini to use an ethernet connection instead of wi-fi after you blogged about it . <p> Of course , the problem with iTunesand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high resolution audio . So all of that money I spend buying HRA from HD Tracks would be wasted if I did n't  use J.River . <p> I think J.River is complicated because they are trying to be more than they should be . They want to control all of the media files on my computer . They would be so much better off if they offered a version of their product that just focused on sound ! <p> iTunes handles high resolution audio just fine . Not sure what you mean . But , perhaps you 're a Windows user ? The problem then is true its a pain in the butt for Windows users having to change the sample rate each time you want to play high resolution audio in iTunes . here 's where Mac owners have a free ride . iTunes , using a small add on program , is bit perfect for any sample rate up to 192kHz and we can play DSD . <p> If you are planning on playing high resolution audio and you have Windows , then yes , I would agree with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have a Mac , high resolution audio and great sound is easy and in my opinion , better than JRiver . <p> And remember , for $500 you can buy a Mac Mini and turn it into a dedicated , headless music server . You can even use Roon instead of iTunes . That 's not a big price to pay for a dedicated music server of that quality . <p> On the Mac side , there are several third-party apps that convert iTunes into an excellent audiophile music player . I use Pure Music ; Paul wrote about Bit Perfect on this blog some time ago . There are others . Are there no PC apps that transparently convert iTunes into a perfectly-fine high-def player ? Is JRiver the only game in town on a PC ? <p> I have searched high and low for a Windows based add on or secret formula to help Windows users enjoy bit perfect performance with iTunes but sadly , to no avail . Maybe someone reading this will have a suggestion . <p> If you set the sample rate and bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed mostly of CDs , iTunes and Windows works great and is essentially bit perfect . But if you play a higher sample rate track , it outputs at the fixed sample rate you previously set . iTunes and Mac does exactly the same thing , just that people have written programs that fix that . <p> Remote is a very nice app. dsarinci1 points out that he uses a high resolution player ( Pure Music ) . I use Amarra as my high resolution player . I have never tried playing high resolution files through iTUNES in fact , I was not aware that one could do that . However it is widely stated that iTUNES is " not a good high resolution player " . So , would one hear a difference between iTUNES and say Amarra or Pure Music ? Something that I may experiment with . That is probably a debate that features good solid comments and a number of religious statements . <p> I have found that Splashtop , which enables an iPHONE or iPAD to replicate the screen of the computer player with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player ) that is cable connected to the DAC , is satisfactory ( but not perfect ) . In fact , I understand that for best quality ( certainly with a separate player ) one needs to disable the iTUNES volume control that means that one can not control the volume remotely . <p> Comments on the audio quality capabilities of iTUNES with high resolution files AND controlling the volume remotely ( which is only possible , I believe , if one uses iTUNES as the player ) might be relevant . Might this be a situation where , as the intent of your posts is , that iTUNES is step one and when one goes to Yale or Harvard ( or better , Oxford or Cambridge ) one graduates to a dedicated high resolution player ? <p> Re : " Comments on the audio quality capabilities of iTUNES with high resolution files AND controlling the volume remotely ( which is only possible , I believe , if one uses iTUNES as the player ) might be relevant . " <p> Perhaps Paul will chime in , but here 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iTunes bit-perfectly without add-ons if you manually configure the Audio Midi Setup for that purpose . Audio Midi Setup is an Apple app in the Utilities folder that 's intended for professional musicians and recording engineers , but it can be used with a high-end DAC and iTunes . I remember that Barry Diament confirmed several years ago that iTunes is in fact bit-perfect at high resolution as long as the computer is configured properly and the iTunes volume is not moved from full up . I use Pure Music to manage that configuration for me . <p> I also use my DAC without a preamp something I know Paul disagrees with , but " your mileage may vary " so my volume is controlled within either Pure Music or iTunes . I asked Rob Robinson of Channel D ( he s a friend ) whether using the iTunes volume control in the Remote app or via iTunes directly on the Mac would negate his dithered , high-resolution volume control . The answer is no . Pure Music always handles all playback functions . He said that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user interface for the iTunes volume control . In older versions of Pure Music , as I recall , the volume control was automatically set to max and disabled ; in newer versions , the volume control in Pure Music is emulated by ( or tied together with ) the volume control in iTunes . <p> If you use a preamp with a remote control ( or a " DAC-pre " with a remote ) this is a feature that probably is n't important , but for those without a preamp , its a nice thing to make volume adjustments via Apples remote without degrading the sound ( unless you routinely lower the level a lot ) . <p> I would recommend not using the remote control volume on the remote app . For one thing , if bit perfect resolution is your goal , achieved through a program like Bit Perfect , then using the control at anything other than 100 wrecks that . If I remember correctly , Bit Perfect disables the Apple remote volume control anyway . <p> I do n't  think this is true . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate but you can not make it follow what 's being played and that 's the job of the add on program Bit Perfect , among others , that I mentioned . <p> Its unfortunate but I know no other way to get iTunes to be bit perfect . <p> Yes , that 's what I meant but did n't  make clear , perhaps . As you 've said , Audio Midi Setup must be manually configured every time you play a new track with different sample rate than the one before . A real PITA . <p> I do n't  see anything difficult about using Gizmo with JRiver . You simply download the app to a smartphone or tablet then use the code generated by JRiver under Tools and put it in your device . You can put in multiple codes for all of your computers and even install friends codes to control their systems when you are on their network . It works great and even allows you to watch any movies and view photos you may have loaded on JRiver with your hand held LONG ... <p> http : **33;1524;TOOLONG I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50.00 you can install it on up to 5 computers and JRiver gives nice discounts for new versions and free updates . The interface is not as good with an Apple device so far but may improve . With a Mac there is no Theaterview or direct ripping without going through iTunes . <p> Like you I use a dedicated MacMini as my music server running one of the third party apps like Audirvana , Bitperfect , or Amarra . Even though most of these are Bitperfect as tested on my DirectStream DAC , they all sound different in my system . Recently I 've read reviews from Stereophile and TAS that dedicated Music Servers like Aurender or Antipodes sound better than using a Mac as a server . I am thinking of trying one of these to replace my MacMini . <p> Have you compared any of these dedicated servers with your tricked-out MacMini ? If so , have you found any of these to sound better than your Mini ? <p> The very best ( sounding ) server is Aurender . Way , way better than a computer server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison : Aurender is way , way more expensive And you can not rip cds with the Aurender ; its just a very luxurious music computer with harddrives and SSD , but without all the disadvantages of a computer . The very best ripcodec is EAC ( exact audio codec ) from Germany . And that is only available for Windows But its for free . <p> yes , but now you 're mentioning one of the most expensive models . There are several other ones , a lot cheaper . The fun starts with about 3000 USD for the same quality , only less storage and without SSD . But if you got about 600 USD to spend , the Macmini is a good choice ( IMO ) , although there are more and more competitors nowadays to give Apple a hard time . <p> I 've only just picked up this thread . In his post Paul said : " I connect to the DirectStream DAC through my favorite JCat USB cable , and play extraordinary music to everyone 's delight . " I 'd suggest if Paul has n't  tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac laptop and the Bridge II in the DirectStream DAC , install MinimServer on the laptop and play music via his favourite control programme ( my choice would be BubbleUPnP on an Android device ) . I 've compared USB vs ethernet connections and the latter can give better sound quality . As regards servers I 'd suggest that the least expensive option would be a NAS , also running MinimServer , and connected to the Bridge II . A wireless access point for playback control would also be necessary an Airport express is an inexpensive choice . <p> Bridge II sounds better than the Mini setup , indeed . I do n't  bring this up enough , because I do n't  want to just toot our own horn and this blog has a broader appeal than just PS customers . But thanks , I love the sound of the Bridge . <p> Im surprised no one is making any statement about Roon however this funny provoking post mention it . When I first heard about Roon I was shocked by the price but I wanted to give it a try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends not to do the same . here 's the story . <p> I took an old Mac Mini and put it between my NAS and my DAC for the occasion . I configured Roon to watch some folders on the NAS and connected it to my Tidal account . Then I installed the Roon client on an iPad while letting the server scan all my DSD and have a beer <p> Comfortably installed I started to play with the Roon interface on the iPad . Before even pushing the play button I was just amazed by what I had in my hand . My own library was seamlessly mixed with the Tidal catalogue as an extension of it . Both were warped with a set of features I was dreaming about when I gave my first talk about the promises of the semantic Web . <p> Ok , I finally pressed the play button and what I heard was really good . However how young is this software you recognize who are the people behind this . Tidal was just sounding so great that for the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . DSD playback is good as well but not at the quality level of the extraordary rich front end experience the software is offering . I compared it with HQ Player then . HQ won ! To test the quality of a player you have to put music where instruments have a similar sound . ( Same goes for testing any so called audiophile improvement ) With HQ is like going from mono to stereo in that field . Room is n't reaching that perfection , yet . However , if I had to score its user experience with its SQ and do a math mean it would be an all round winner . <p> Roon is now my favorite companion when its about discovering music , and the experience is equally rich when it comes to classical music . I do n't  know any competitor in that field . I trust the guys to make it sound better to compete with HQ for file playback any time soon ( I 've been told they would potentially integrate HQ in a near future ) <p> So you 've been warned not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks a year . <p> Roon is great and for those that already have a ripped library , highly recommended . However , there are two issues with Roon that I caution folks . First , Roon is fundamentally a server and as such has its own sound . On some machines it sounds quite good , others not as much . Overall its good though . <p> Second , Roon requires a computer and that computer needs to be next to the DAC because USB is how they connect . <p> I must say I was quite pleased with the sound however not as good as HQ Player as I wrote ( good idea for a continuation for a more advanced section in your nice serie ) In my specific case I can also use Ethernet to the DAC as its a Devialiet . Still have to compare Devialet Air with its asynchronous USB . Ill also try Dirac software and if excited I 'll purchase the MiniDSP Dirac Series LONG ... The input too the MiniDSP is coax or XLR . Yet another problem to solve however I 've a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with iTunes I also need a ripped library Right , you are speaking about the ripping itself , sorry , I forgot the initial statement of the thread . <p> How Roon would be more a server than iTunes ? This is quite the same configuration is n't ? So how would it have its own sound for that matter ? <p> I 'd like to improve the sound quality of my Mac Mini without going nuts in the process however how much I know hell is in the details . Both software and hardware hints are welcome . <p> Where Roon really shines is about its Tidal integration . That brings a great level of versatility and then we do n't  need to RIP anything but our rarities in our collection . <p> All servers have a sound to them . What comes through , the bits , are heavily influenced by the server . Its at the core of how things sound in computer audio . The Bridge , and other network devices , do n't  experience as much of an impact from the server , but nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn about , so I 've eagerly awaited this part of the series . The post and comments are well appreciated ! <p> Paul , you made me have to open iTunes . Ive been resisting of course I had to make a couple of detours first . Having MediaMonkey on all my PCs , I first had to try MonkeyMote with that . Downloaded the " lite " version and spent the next 20 minutes mucking about in my firewall settings . Got it connected and found the feature set , ah , lacking . $2 for the full version did n't  sound too bad but the results were still disappointing . It works , but is n't pleasant or intuitive . <p> So off to the iTunes Store to get Remote . Should have listened to you and started there . Opened iTunes , it immediately saw my phone . From there it was click , click , and Bobs your uncle . Played a few tracks , found a couple more pesky metadata errors Looks like the artwork will take some time to load . <p> So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one chair , that facing a desk of mixing gear , where no one but myself ever goes <p> Had to run a couple errands , but when I got back home I patched an output from the PC to the mixing board that feeds the little FM transmitter , after a couple minutes setting levels I was sitting on the back patio playing tunes through the boom box . Not hi-fi , but convenient and fun . <p> Actually , though , the signal from that little TX sounds better than a lot of commercial stations 
@@23909543 @3909543/ <h> Diffuse <p> Four parallel , bare walls- reflect audio- in ways detrimental to music , recorded or live . Furniture , pictures , carpets , and objects of any kind help scatter- and absorb what walls reflect . For many homes it is a simple matter to install a good pair of loudspeakers and stereo system- for great sound , but its not always easy nor optimum . <p> Rooms contribute greatly to musics reproduction . My loudspeaker system will sound dramatically different in your room than mine , even if everything else is the same . And so we spend time positioning speakers for best sound , something wed not likely do if they were outside. - - As I 've written in these past few days , its often better to tame sonic reflections with diffusors than absorbers . Absorbers work in a similar manner to- colors , - absorbing some frequencies , reflecting others . If you place a blanket across the sidewall of your listening room , higher frequencies will be absorbed while lower frequencies remain unaffected , forming a type of unwanted filter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than attempt to eliminate it . <p> There are readymade diffusion panels routinely used in recording , mixing and mastering studios . Here is a picture of diffusion panels in the mastering room of the late Bob Ludwig . <p> Note this famous mastering lab has n't  foam or absorbing panels that deaden the room , instead , diffusers are used between the loudspeakers . <p> Diffusers work by scattering sound rather than absorbing it . The ones pictured are from RPG , and there are many others as well . In the rear of PS Audios music room One are two identical panels as well . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <h> 18 COMMENTS <p> I did consider building diffuser panels into the room but decided against it because I do not have enough confidence in my room design chops to install them permanently , preferring instead to experiment with movable panels . <p> Paul , here is a link to a great website that has a lot of information about diffuser design and use as well as some DIY plans so you can build your own : http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great work . <p> Agreed and I never heard this room , so and I also know that many engineers have their own wants and needs for sound that would n't necessarily please an person at home , but serve their mastering needs perfectly . <p> As pointed out by ssol , those are the rear channel Eggleston speakers driven by the Cello Mono amplifier above inside the enclosure . My assumption is the speakers are placed on a roller platform that allows them to be pulled into the room when mastering 5.1 channel DVDs . <p> I think the engineer did a decent job of breaking up standing waves and antinodes in the rooms rear corners . <p> Like Doug Sax , Bob Ludwig also has an impressive resume in terms of his body of work . <p> The most effective and cheapest way to improve sound dispersion in your listening room is to create clutter . That 's right , just leave a lot of stuff around that you 'll get to later , put furniture in around anywhere you can find wall space , maybe some cabinets for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking pipes on the walls , a sofa here , some chairs there , stacks of papers , phonograph records , CDs , whatever and before you know it , you 'll be highly diffused . However , if you are a neat freak with OCD like Felix Unger and I think a lot of audiophiles are , you are going to have problems . You need help even if part of you denies it , there is part of you that knows the truth . So try to be more like Oscar Madison and you can spend your money or recordings instead of diffusers . Just relax and accept the reality that the world is n't perfect . Youll be a lot happier if you do . : - ) BTW , your significant other who is not an audiophile and puts up with you thinks your sound system itself is clutter . <p> It really needs to be said- Diffusion can be very effective BUT can also be dangerous as it can add upwards of 3dB to the level of the reflected energy thru constructive interference . Lining all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also- " overdamped " is usually an issue because its near impossible to absorb all frequencies equally , so what you have when you use a bunch of 1-2 ? absorbers is a room that absorbs high frequencies but leaves the mids and lows untouched creating a " muddy " room which gets called " overdamped " . <p> I still will not agree that speakers need a room to sound good or create a soundstage in theory , nothing a particular room adds to the sound was meant to be there unless you are listening in the exact same room it was mastered in and you can recreate what the mix engineer heard . BUT- we have walls , floors , and ceilings and they must be dealt with because its reality . The trick is to effectivly use treatments to minimize the effects of the room while not creating another set of problems to deal with . That 's the rub and where science and art come together . Ive been doing it 20 years now and every time I get a chance to design another room or come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from previous expierence . Its like raising kids , there 's not single " manual " with all the answers , each situation is unique , which also makes it fun ! <p> Generally a good starting point is hitting the points of first reflection with some type of treatment . That probably gets you 80% of the way there . <p> And I missed the " slap echo " discussion , but I need to add to that- walking around the room claping your hands and listening to them is a flawed process . Do you listen in the room with the speaker in your lap ? You will tend to get more flutter echo when you clap your hands and listen because the your ears and the source of the noise are going to be aligned between two parallel boundries . To better evalulate the room in a non-scientific type of way , sit and listen at the listening position and have a friend clap where the source ( i.e speakers ) will be . This still is n't a great process , but its much more useful than clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get truly flat FR from the speakers and from the early reflections there is only one way I can think of to do it . Once you 've got the room so that is is not so live and echo-y that you can pass the hand clap test , the speaker must be designed to adjust to the room and not the other way around . To do this the reflected sound must be adjustable independently of the direct sound . The speaker dispersion must also be controlled . Generally very wide dispersion is desirable IMO because this is how real musical instruments produce sound . Even horns ( brass and reed instruments ) which may be among the most directional instruments are generally not aimed at the audience but indirectly to avoid blaring at someone . Therefore even their sound is diffused . <p> The most diffused sound from any commercial speaker offered I know of was from Bose 901 . The first two versions were acoustic suspension which allowed them to produce very deep bass within their power handling capacity . Starting with version 3 they were ported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sacrificed the bottom octave . But the speaker had 3 problems that needed to be engineered out of them . The first two were easy , just equalizing out the 7 db upper bass hump and equalizing the too rapid falloff of the deep bass which descends at 12 db per octave and crosses the 1 khz output at around 90 hz . This correction produces a boost on average of 26db at 30 hz , not 18db as the Bose equalizer alone produces . This easily clips my 138 wpc amplifier and shakes up my well suspended turntable without a LF filter cut . The other problem is the treble . There is n't any , at least not the top octave . A 4 ? midwoofer makes one stinkeroo of a tweeter . It took me four years to figure out how to fix this and get it right . The system is now a 2 way biamplified system with a directional array of tweeters that propagates about 95% or more of reflected sound compared to about 5% of direct sound above 9 khz . They have both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89% / 11% direct-reflecting propagation ratio . The Bose equalizer actually needs a one notch treble cut for the midwoofers because the " flat " setting actually has a rise in the lower treble range . Gordon Holt was right IMO , the problem is the inertia . There is no amount of power you can pour into those speakers that will get them to produce satisfactory treble . The reflected array has a rising treble response compared to the direct tweeter to compensate for HF absorption of the walls so when the reflected sound reaches the listener it also has a flat FR . Two of the 6 tweeters per channel aim up at the ceiling . It does n't  produce much sound but it seems to make a great deal of difference . In fact listening to the entire tweeter array reveals that it does n't  produce much sound but what it does produce is so critical that it needs to be adjusted for each recording as does the rest of the spectrum . The overall effect is to retain the attributes that made the speaker so attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found so objectionable ( no highs , no lows , its Bose . ) <p> To achieve the same LF loudness capability as a pair of AR9s with a 60 wpc amplifier , I 'd need at least three pairs of original or series II 901s and a thousand watts per channel . But it does really go deep when you have enough power and equalized this way it does not have to be deafeningly loud to hear it . The speakers are widely available on the used market and the original cloth surround CTS drivers have held up very well without any evidence of rot or air leakage . The putty used to seal them to the wood cabinet however has hardened and leaks . I fixed that with a bead of clear GE Silicone caulking around the joints where the driver frame meets the wood and on the screw heads . Its easy to work with and it is easily removable if I ever need to . <p> How do diffusers affect or help remedy slap/flutter echo ? I can understand how they help with beneficially altering the reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments ; however , I am having a problem wrapping my head around their affect on the rooms inherent echo . <p> Paul , " the late Bob Ludwig " ? Is this recent news or might you have been thinking of Doug Sax ? <p> I 've seen a diagram of his Gateway Mastering monitoring room and his speakers were not placed in the corners as shown in your photo . So I wonder if that might be his DVD monitoring room ( without a screen dropped ) rather than music monitoring . <p> But the point is the great care given to his monitoring response and his extensive work with RPG in designing all his facilities . <p> Wallace Sabine who invented the modern science of acoustics back in 1895 at Harvard University discovered that the Reverberation time , that is the time necessary for sound to decrease by a factor of one million or 60 db was proportional to the volume of the room and inversely proportional to the coefficient of absorption of the room boundaries . He defined the coefficient of absorption of an open window as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave unchanged the RT of a room depending on how its coefficient of absorption compares with the wall behind it that it blocks . <p> Sound obeys Snells law of optics , that is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection . ( No it was not Peter Snell of Snell acoustics . Way before his time . ) Diffusers reflect sound in different directions breaking up planar wavefronts . Surfaces that are convex diffuse sound , surfaces that are concave focus sound . Under the Capitol Dome in Washington DC there are supposedly two spots marked on the floor below the dome where two people can hear each other whispering even if there is a lot of noise around and between them . The most effective focusing shape is a parabola ( remember high school math ? ) That 's the shape mirrors are made for reflector telescopes . They used to sell a device that had a parabolic reflecting surface with a microphone at the focal point . an amplifier , and earphones . It amplified your neighbors fighting in their house so you could hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Acousticians like diffusion for rooms for music . Their figure of merit SDI which stands for surface diffusivity index is estimated by inspection . Floyd Toole found the same thing about loudspeakers that acousticians learned about concert halls , people like early lateral reflections . That has its own figure of merit , lateral faction or LF . <p> here 's my version of diffusion I use in my listening room . I like to think of it as the " poor mans " diffuser . They are called scatter blocks and and absorb and diffuse ( " soft diffusion " ) at the same time . I only used 5 of these on the wall behind my speakers and have found they work reasonably well . Total cost for 5 ( 12 x 12 ? ) blocks was , if I remember correctly , about LONG ... I did however added some larger 12 x 48 ? absorbers to control the first set of side wall reflections . If I were to do it all over again and budget allowed I would probably go with Pauls diffusers. 
@@23909545 @3909545/ <p> So recently I changed firmware over to 243 in my PWD II . In general , I thought the sound was more detailed , cleaner but with reduced bass and more importantly less dynamics . I ended up switching my long preferred filter setting of 3 to filter setting 5 because this seemed a little more dynamic , music had a little more punch with 5 . <p> On a whim , I decided to try different setting and was shocked to hear how much better plain old " 44 " sounded with CDs . Experimenting a little more with standard redbook as well as high rez stuff ( 16/88 , 24/192 etc ) I found that the native rate without the " benefit " of SRC or the lens sounded MUCH better . Leaving the setting on " Native " compared to " NativeX " results in MUCH more dynamics but also greater timbral accuracy . <p> With the native setting , it just sounds a lot better . Now horns have that blatty sound that they can have , drums kick you back , instruments sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different level . <p> NativeX now sounds dull , smaller , homogenized . The sound is akin to what I hear from a lot of cheap " audiophile " power conditioners with lots of ferrittes , ie cleaner , smooooother , smaller , more focused but ultimately more boring . <p> I do not remember hearing this when I first got my PWD II , my recollection was that NativeX was clearly superior to Native and the rest of the settings . I did add a dedicated Bryston BIT-15 sound conditioner for my PWD II but nothing else has changed in my system . Very strange . <p> If you are running 243 , try some redbook 16/44 and try listening to " 44 " then compare to NativeX . See what you think , I initially thought there was a 1.5-2.5db volume discrepancy between the two setting ( with NativeX being quieter ) . <p> I just end this by saying that I find myself much more involved with my music now , the PWD has so much flexibility that you are bound to find some setting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native over NativeX for a while now too . It seems to be better balanced , focused , etc albeit also a little drier . On that note I have been running NativeX again for no other reason than experimentation . I tend to make changes and leave them alone for awhile to let overall impressions form . I will try to come up with some further details of the differences I hear when I go back . Its hard to understand why NativeX would n't easily trounce Native on the USB input . I would love to hear others weigh in on this . I am running USB from a Mac Mini with 2.0.2 on the PWD . <p> Sorry guys , I do disagree . Although , that is not to say anyone is wrong . When I listen to Native I do n't  get the natural deep soundstage where the walls disappear . I use 2.4.3 and I would n't go back to other fmwr versions . <p> Sorry guys , I do disagree .

I use the I2S input not the bridge at the moment . When I pull the bridge out . Than the bass reduces on the USB and I2S inputs . The 2.4.3 is not the best firmware for me without a bridge installed I prefer 2.0.2 than . <p> So I reinstalled the bridge for the use of this firmware with the I2S inputs : ) <p> Wow , now that is strange . I do not use the bridge either , but it is installed . I use the i2s input as well From my offramp . Its is hands down the best I ever heard this dac sound . It is overall just a different dac . <p> Maybe . But my offramp bests the bridge and the transport hands down . I think the dac is very good but is sensitive to synergy , possible this is cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From reading all the discussions on this site about different firmware , I 'm coming to the conclusion that its a " To eachthere own " . Everybody on this site has a different audio set up , and each update is going to sound different on different systems . So I would say pick the best one that sounds good on your system , and get over it . : ) To me , 2.4.3 on my system , the midrange is so prevalent that its like someone took an ice pic to my ears . Ill stay with 2.4.0 . That 's why I say again " to each there own " .

He comfortably slotted into being our ad manager , our marketing guy , our publicist and show managerall of which he did superbly , if a bit tardy most of the time .

We were blown away by his outstanding job at the NY HiFi show just last month . We had all the press in attendance and the best looking room . After the show , I brought him home to my place in the Chicago area for a little vacation . He had a rough 2016 ( health issues ) and needed a break .

@@23909555 @3909555/ <h> Fixing ground loops <p> Weve been discussing how to identify a ground loop . Now its time to fix what we 've identified as a problem . But let me warn you of a couple of things : reread what I have written about identifying them ( make sure it actually IS a ground loop ) , secondly , - the cure can be dangerous if not done properly . <p> To review . There can not be a ground loop with only one piece of equipment . It takes two . The difference in ground potential between the two ( ground being at a different level for each ) is what causes the hum . Further , you can have one piece of equipment in a many-piece set that is at a different level , while all the others are at a proper level . You will still get hum . <p> To remedy the ground loop we must do one of two things : find the source of the ground difference and correct it ( that 's the best way ) , or float the offending piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most common ground loop problem comes from a cable TV . Their grounds are rarely at the same level as our homes grounds ( although they are supposed to be ) . Connect the little CATV connector to , say , a cable TV box that is also connected to your stereo or home theater system and bingo ! Youd got a ground loop . Remove the CATV connector and the hum goes away ( so too does the picture ) . So , how do we fix this ? One quick example is to use a TOSLINK optical cable between the cable TV box and the stereo system , if your system has a DAC . This works because the optical cable can not have a ground problem since it is optically isolated from the system . here 's another , less desirable way : use a cable TV isolation transformer between the input CATV connector and the cable box . This works for isolation and hum elimination , but with modern high speed internet and cable streams you might lose some quality . These are just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a pure audio system , yet we still have hum . We suspect a ground loop because of two facts we 've discovered : the hum is a higher pitched buzz- relative to a low smooth hum ( I have placed audio examples here ) and the two suspect pieces are plugged into different AC outlets . Our first task is to narrow down the offending piece . This is where we want to use our method of elimination , starting at the loudspeaker again . Remember ? Connect the power amp to the loudspeaker making certain you have n't any inputs on the power amp here I am being very literal . I do n't  mean no signal present . I mean , NO INTERCONNECTS attached . Even without a signal our grounds would still be attached . Is there hum ? If there is , you have a problem specific to your power amp , one requiring you to return it to the manufacturer for repair . No hum ? Okay , now connect the preamplifier with the same restrictions . NO INPUTS . Hum ? No and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the culprit . Hum , yes ? Then you must find out if that hum goes up and down with level of the preamp . If it does , its not a ground loop . If it does n't  , it may likely be . <p> Let 's leave of till tomorrow the next steps ( I do n't  like the posts getting too long ) . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 10 COMMENTS <p> Paul . This whole series has been invaluable . When you started , I thought to myself , " heckI know all there is to know about ground loops not likely to learn anything new here " . Wrong . In fact you just helped me solve an embarrassing problem . I have a somewhat aged AV receiver connected to satellite / subwoofer speakers ( 5.1 ) , a Blueray player and an LED TV . No CATV . On hot and humid days , I would often get an oppressive hum that would come and go . It *seemed* correlated with the electric stove cycling , or sometimes not . Often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would diminish or go away . Sometimes not . It did n't  usually happen in the winter but then sometimes it did . <p> I rerouted and shortened speaker wires , I wired in a dedicated circuit and connected *everything* through a high quality power filter . No dice . I disconnected everything and still got the hum ( on and off ) with just speakers connected . Disconnected the subwoofer , could still hear the hum . <p> In your column you mentioned that maybe its time to return the receiver to the manufacturer . You also initially distinguished between a buzz and a hum . Induced radiationhmmm . This morning I yanked the behemoth out of the rack and guess what I found behind it in a giant pile of dust ? Yep . I counted 3 pairs of the cheapest RCA cables each connected to one of the analog inputs and the other end just dangling there in the dust next to all the others . Who knows how long those orphan cables had been connected . At some point I had connected a number of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum free for the time being . I 'm also a bit embarrassed about how sloppy I have become . <p> Identifying ground loops is a good thing , no matter whether one can hear hum or not . However , I 'd like to return to the underlying problem you 're trying to solve , because I do n't  think you 've clearly stated it . Last night to the previous post , I raised the question as to whether some level of hum is acceptable , perhaps even desirable according to one person in the field , to which you responded testily this morning that if you cant hear it , its not a problem ( " so what " ) . That 's how I look at it too , practically speaking , at least at my desktop computer . But let 's take a step back here : before chasing ground loops , what exactly is the problem you 're trying to solve : <p> Is it helping and satisfying people who call and complain about hum ? Is it that audible hum detracts from the comfort of the listening experience ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound and thus the quality ( and comfort ) of the listening experience ? That 's what I cited Jim Smith raising question about ( if I understood him correctly ) . And to the degree its the latter , i.e. , about sound quality , what makes audible hum worse than inaudible hum ? Is there some testing or some studies behind the answer to that ? <p> I realize that I 'm being annoying here , but so what ( smile ) : shouldnt defining the exact problem , and why its actually a problem , along with any assumptions you 're working from , come first ? <p> First off , sorry if I came across as testy . I did n't  mean to and apologize . Probably had some lame excuse or another : ) <p> Its hard to know who needs or benefits from any of the info I present . There is always a danger I will make some people overly obsessive in their quest for better sound . I suppose that 's the risk of presenting general information to thousands of people . <p> Not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to give a few disqualifiers . <p> One way testy happens for just about all of us is when were legitimately pushed in a direction we werent expecting , at a time and in a way we werent expecting it , usually about something we had n't  thought about or skipped over , all upsetting our best laid plans . <p> What do you mean by disqualifiers ? My suggestion/questions were aimed at getting you , the troubleshooter , to define your specific goal(s) and the reason for pursuing them . In this case , what do we really know about the relationship between hum , sound quality and comfort , other than at a certain level it bothers most of us ? <p> Ground differential is technically not identical to a ground loop . For example , there can be substantial ground currents in the soil such that one side of the house is at a ground differential to the other . OTOH , you can have a ground loop with all battery powered components . This is because a loop is an antenna which can pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have too many ground connections . The ideal is a star ground , where every piece of gear has one ground that goes back to a single point , preferably a good sized chunk of copper . This is rarely the case in audio because single ended stereo connections are inherently ground loops from the two parallel returns and it requires disconnecting the ground at one end of every interconnect . I find that the triple RCA cables that come with video gear can be pretty good audio interconnects ( assuming all three are the same construction ) because a wire that passes even baseband video has to have reasonably low capacitance , inductance and dielectric absorbtion . The three wires are molded together which reduces the potential for ground hums LITERALLY . This is because the pickup of noise by the antenna is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop . If the wires are maintained in strict proximity over the length , the pickup is almost always inaudible . Another source of hums is transmitted noise from the power line . The best cure for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformer , which has many advantages . I use capacitor isolators for the cable service , which also reduces the risk of lightning damage from the cable entry .

Of course , it is first and foremost important that the products have good components and careful layout to make them sound as good as possible . I think that the cost , which an accomplished product designer brings with it , is still well laid out . How many brands do you know , where the recognition value is so high , so that you can recognize an amplifier , for example , from a distance immediately ? I think you agree with me that there are only a few . Take from those who have a great recognition value those whose design is really good , then really only vinous products remain . <p> I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier is an outstanding product when it comes to its sonic characteristics . Does the amplifier look good ? Well that is a question of taste . <p> I think the big price/performance thing in audio is is mostly due to production efficiencies . For people who want hand made limited production products , its going to cost , just as it would to have a tailored suit rather than a mass produced off-the-shelf suit . The difference is that a lot of mass produced audio is extremely good , just as good as the hand made stuff , if not better . Moreover , there is the labour cost issue . USA labour probably costs 20 times as much as Chinese and is probably no better . A Saville Row tailored suit would be nice for $4,000 . My favourite suit was hand made to measure in Udaipur , India by a guy called Rakesh and cost $150 . Ultimately the manufacturer has to make a profit margin to stay in business and will price accordingly . <p> The mass audio market is highly competitive and the hi-end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few audio companies , it is difficult to make a profit at both ends of the spectrum . So I do n't  think the audio consumer is generally being ripped off , it just seems that some audiophiles enjoy spending money on things that do not add to performance . Of course the manufacturer may market them as performance-related when they transparently are not , but anyone who believes the marketing/reviews deserves to pay . <p> " These preconceptions of price , heft , and glitz , are so ingrained that they are nearly impossible to overcome . " Actually , not at all . Put all your audio out of view ( in my case in a solid wood audio/AV unit ) and all these issues disappear . The last audio system I had on display was quite bling and matching colours . It then went into my current cabinet and was steadily reduced in price , with increased performance , to the point that the final system cost about one third of where I started . The resulting system was spectacularly ugly , but " cant see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot and went Devialet , ultra-bling , but still hidden out of sight . It is assumed that Devialet is sold on the bling factor . There may be a point to that . The same could be said of the MacBook Air , but I consider it to be a spectacularly good product . I was after an all-in-one the family could use and sounded great , and was the best and most affordable of the available options ( Auralic , AVM , dCS etc ) . <p> High end audio equipment manufacturers use every manufacturing technique possible to drive cost up . There is no economy of scale . They often use high priced customized parts instead of all off the shelf parts . They use exotic parts . If they manufacture in the US they use expensive labor . In reality they sell the sizzle because there is little or no steak . And they want to be paid for their time as trial and error tinkerers as though they were real scientists and engineers . In fact their are few electronics or speakers that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap . Even where off the shelf parts are used , they are disguised in ways that make them difficult to identify except by people who know these product lines well . We know these parts . Morrell , Scanspeak , Focal , are some of them . Dahlquist DH 10 used an Advent woofer , Phillips midrange , Motorola horn tweeter . Genesis is using what appears to be the same midrange ribbon array as Bohlender Graebener sells as a midrange tweeter array . Round ribbon tweeters can be bought for cheap . There are a lot of very good woofers out there but unfortunately the best types designed specifically as acoustic suspension woofers like Tonegen 1259 are no longer available but they can be had . Transformers of every type , precision resistors , all types of capacitors , transistors , all available off the shelf . Tubes too . You can build these by reverse engineering them and get comparable results at home often for 5% to 10% of their retail price . As for physical appearance , that is strictly a matter of gingerbread you pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden enclosure to look like a shiny lacquered surface that can be done for cheap too . <p> Excellent post spot on . One of the most expensive low volume costs is third party CNC machining of facias and enclosures . When done in house in high volume , the cost is reduced dramatically . I suspect in some cases the hi-end enclosure can cost more to manufacture than the contents . <p> Proprietary drivers is an interesting point . For some companies ( Dynaudio , Harbeth and to an extent PMC ) their proprietary drivers are the lifeblood of their products and are not sold to third parties . Focal does sell its excellent drivers to other manufacturers , but their speakers have other major selling points both in design and bling . Audio Note makes a wide range of proprietary components , making their products absurdly expensive but strangely popular . <p> You guys confuse the hell out of me . So , what , anyone with common sense and a soldering iron should be reverse-engineering their own components and laughing all the way to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cheap chassis ? <p> I do n't  know if either of you have tried to create , build and sell anything . I suspect not , because if you had , you would have more respect for those with the guts and vision to see something through to fruition . You do n't  have to buy it . I do n't  understand why you feel the need to protest it . Just vote with your money . <p> I know SM has " tinkered " and could build his own reverse-engineered speaker , but could you , Steven ? I 've tried , and there 's more to it than stealing ideas and assembling components in a box . <p> I can just about wire a plug . Harbeth drivers have a secret formula coating for the drivers , developed with the help of some PhD students in the mid 1980s , fully patented . Ca n't be reverse engineered . Same with Dynaudio , they tried recently to improve on them , went through about 200 formulas and gave up , sticking with the same formula they developed when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can build a Class A amplifier in a day from a bag of bits . The level of engineering in something like Devialet , which is manufactured using state of the art automated processes in climate-controlled labs , can not be reverse engineered either . <p> I spoke to a guy the other day who writes and reviews for a European audio site . He told me that he spoke with some cable manufacturers at the Munich show who privately admitted they price their high-end cables at what the competition does , even though they could sell them for far less . Their concern is just what Paul points out , that if they are not priced in the same realm , then they are perceived as not as good . Expectation bias to the max ! <p> I had gone on to say that I do n't  notice this same expectation in reading my photography or auto magazines . While price of products is always listed there is no overall consensus that stratospheric price equals stratospheric performance . Lenses are spoken of in terms of speed or sharpness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation that is obvious to me that the best in those categories will always be the most expensive . Audio to me seems quite unique in this respect . <p> Audio is unique because the scientists have completely flubbed on objective criteria . They keep measuring ears as if they transduce like a microphone , and keep telling us that we are listening to " perfect sound " , while fixed channel audio is three orders of magnitude less information content than human cognitive capabilities . <p> I know of a case years ago about a company that no longer exists who produced triode tube mono amps rated at 400 watts that sold for $10,000/pair . Dealers told them that the problem was many buyers could n't believe the amps could perform as stated for that price ( they were actually under rated ) and asked for a revised version using just a new fancier front face and a new name but double the price . They thought theyd actually sell more amps at the higher price even though there was no real change in the amps . The company did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were constructed . <p> I can give two examples that I presently am using . First is MG Audio Design interconnects . There one meter top of the line interconnects cost only $1600 , and yet they are competing against products that cost far , far above their cost . In fact a single pair of interconnects can cotst as much as a brand new compact automobile . That is a fact . In fact I can , and do purchase a half meter pair of the same MG Audio Design interconnects for only $900 . That is also a fact . So , in fact , most likely if they charged more for their latest product they would most likely sell more . After all , how can they be competitive in todays market if they sell them so cheap . Even todays top end audio reviewers get their wire products on " loan " as we well know . Even they can not afford them . I myself can not compare them against the big name cable manufacturers , but I know that they are far superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former top end Audience 24AUSE interconnects . My second example is my Rega Osiris $9995 integrated amplifier . Because the Osiris is made by Rega and it itself looks like a well built $3000 integrated amplifier on visual inspection , it has never sold very well . Thus I was able to purchase a demo unit from a local audio dealer for about 34% of its list price . Now I do not know how my Reg Osiris can compete against competing integrateds in the same price range , but I do know that it is very good for the price that I paid for it . Due to Regas reputation the Orisis has basically been overlooked by the audio community . Who is willing to spend $10,000 for a Rega product ? Not me . There is no way I could have afforded it at list price . In the end it does n't  matter so much as to the price charged , it is the price paid . Once again , the MG Audio Design interconnects are possibly the deal of our time in regard to interconnects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for anyone to notice them unfortunatly . <p> I 'm sure Im in the minority . I really do n't  care what it looks like , as long as it sounds good . There is nothing cooler to me than having some piece of gear look like nothing special , but blows away some piece that looks like it was designed by NASA . <p> " I really do n't care what it looks like , as long as it sounds good . There is nothing cooler to me than having some piece of gear look like nothing special , but blows away some piece that looks like it was designed by NASA " . So , in fact you secretely do care what it looks like . <p> At this point when everything is good almost , without good looks its hard to sell and even harder to justify a high price . But like everything built and sold there is a 5X markup in order for a company that pays employees and power and rent to make a living . Huge companies like Yamaha and Sony with lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact they are using their own engineers and pushing new technologies all the time . <p> Sounds good .. for what usage ? To fill your large room with the sense the orchestra is seated right there at one end of your room ? <p> Or ? That you are sitting in seats rows back at a concert where the musicians appear to be half the height of your thumb ? Like an artist holding up his thumb when translating the distance perspective onto his canvas ? <p> My opinion is , its a bit like with camera lenses . If you spend a reasonable amount , it should also have good mechanics and looks . If great lens glass is put into a plastic housing and costs 4000$ instead of 6000$ its a nice cost saving , but longterm ( which such products hopefully are built for ) it needs some esthetics matching a certain price to stay satisfied . <p> I like understatement and I like the PS Audio design and its relation to the achievable sound . More built quality and design is nice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ( DS ) and like the black PSA components , but I do n't  rate the finish of the black on the same level as the silver ones , could be nicer . The BHK pre grille for the tube section should be on the level of the top plate for my esthetics ( peanuts , but I 'd diy it if I 'd own it ) . <p> So for me the PSA design and built quality is great and given the fantastic sound quality just right with no reason to complainbut there 's only little air below for me . But most important is it fits my taste , nothing worse than expensive and ugly , trashy designs . <p> As jb4 I 'd always prefer a less opulent design with better sound to the opposite , but an expense of 8-25.000$ should have more than adequate design and built quality ( but certainly most important adequate sound ) . <p> I 've started collecting Leica as I like using it and cant bear to sell any ! I use lenses 40+ years old and the only risk is from fungus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of camera viewer marks . Modern lenses are so hard they never mark ( I wear Nikon Varifocals ) . Camera lenses from the 1950s like on Leica III will mark using a fingernail . So a combination of excellent engineering , materials and technology can result in products that will last a lifetime and can be passed down generations . Fashion become so irrelevant , products hold their value and cost of ownership becomes quite cheap . It makes audio seem a very expensive hobby . <p> Yeah , I 'm not " collecting " them but I have 4 Leica lenses of which the two best are a 50/1 Noctilux and a 135/4 Tele Apolyt . They really have great haptic . <p> A difference to audio for sure is , that their technology does n't  get outdated , which besides their built quality contributes to making them last a lifetime . This would be more difficult for a DAC whatever its built quality is ; - ) <p> Do you mean the Apo-TelytM ? Cheapskate me has the Tele-Elmar 135/4 , a -250 bargain for a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a real cracker . Normal people do n't  have a clue what were on about . <p> Essentially price is set by what the buyer can afford . The trend of adding a lot of glitz and charge unreasonable prices was started by the suggestion that audio equipment should be made like very expensive sports cars and have that special something that make them collectibles . So many of the manufacturers ran with the idea pricing their products at astronomical levels ably helped by reviewers many of whom consider thirty or fifty thousand not very expensive . Add to this the fact that simplistic thinking that every thing very expensive is automatically very good and heavy pockets , sense of insecurity and less than adequate knowledge of what really good sound is makes for ideal price gouging market . Icing on the cake is ego satisfaction when people gasp at the exorbitant price paid . Remember , a sucker is born every minute ? Its not my opinion just read high end audio magazines . It will be obvious . Be that as it may do not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PS Audio for a very sensible approach . Regards . <p> " Form follows function " had been a commonly accepted design principle . Thus a tractor from Porsche did look most different than a roadster from the same company . But how must the form of an amplifier be designed having to follow the amps function ? : - ) I would have no problem having the amp or every component being controlled via a tablet pc hidden somewhere . I rather would prefer having the budget invested in circuit design efforts relevant for sound quality . The turntable and tonearm business proves the craziness of todays designers . How simplistic is the design of the outer appearance of the laser turntable from ELP Corp . : - ) <p> Late to the game , as usual I suspect most of the consumers of High End gear have very little ability to build their own gear , much less reverse engineer a successful design . And many of those who DO have a modicum of expertise become hot-rodders of existing/vintage gear . A very few build gear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own car to commute to work ? Not likely , but every six months or so I do crawl under my daily driver and change the oiljust to reinforce my appreciation of those who really know what they are doing . <p> Its the $100.00 cup of tea scenario . It must be better because it is more expensive than the $1.00 cup of tea . I remember a manufacturer who made a 300 watt amp with a rack mount black face plate . They changed the top and face plate to a one piece , non rack mount , brushed aluminum top face plate , and charged $3000.00 more . There were no changes to the electronics inside , but the new amp got rave reviews in the magazines and sales improved . <p> Then there is the " Wife Acceptance Factor " . If you were to say , have your amps in a white powder coat with copper trim with a gauge on the front based on the IWC Da Vinci watch with the royal blue face plate and white hands , charge say $5000.00 more , your sales could escalate . 
@@23909559 @3909559/ <h> In My Room <h> Four Ways , No Waiting <p> By Scott Freimann <p> I 'd prefer not to dwell too much on the name brands of electronics ( of the front end , but sure , as they pertain to the speakers ) at this time , but rather concentrate on the room and speaker system that is built around it . <p> The pre-amp source is a Parasound Halo P-5 . This feeds into a vintage Pioneer SF-850 electronic crossover , which is set at 250 and 8k Hz . <p> The low pass in turn feeds into an Audio Control Richter Scale III , which sets the additional crossover point of 60Hz . In this manner , the mid and hi frequency section are only affected by the Pioneer unit . This is a superb vintage unit , and by far the best that I have tried , with respect to analogue devices . I have no desire to use any sort of dsp at this time . <p> The subs for both channels can be seen in the corner . Each separate enclosure utilizes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 250 Hz to 8 kHz ; and the Stage Accompany ribbon tweeter runs above 8 kHz . <p> For 60Hz and down , the stereo low-pass signal is fed to a pair of Crown K2s , of which each amplifier channel drives a pair of Acoustic Elegance AE-IB 15s ( 8 total ) set up in an infinite baffle , manifold mounting , configuration . The I.B. construction was done in a jutted out room corner , reconfigured to provide a structure at a 45 degree angle to the room . The volume behind the drivers is set up by a very large closet , and provides approx 500 cubic feet of air space . The upper quad of 4 receives the right cahhnel , the lower is the left channel . I have experimented with a mono signal , but , to me , it does n't  make much difference . The wavelength of 60Hz corresponds to the room dimension adjacent , so at this point , and everything lower , it simply fills up the room . Localization is impossible . The room is 19+21 feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is NOTHING between the speakers . NOTHING . <p> Close-up view of the slot-loaded midbass enclosure . <p> For 60-250Hz , I built a pair of push-pull , slot load devices(ppsl) each containing- a pair of Eminence Definimax 4012HO . They are sealed enclosures built from double walled mdf+plywood , and in some areas they are triple walled . I sized the enclosure to provide a critically damped Q= .5 , and with the very close coupling of the drivers , the Fs dropped from 46 hz , to 40Hz . The resulting mass loading of the drivers also raised their respective Qts , thus , the oversized enclosure compared to what would be required of a stock mounting technique . Bryston 7B mono blocks power the ppsls . <p> For mid-range , covering 250-8k Hz , I mounted a Tang Band W8-1772 in a large round vintage Jensen Peridynamic horn , circa 1941 . I modified the horn throat , flange , and body , with copious quantities of damping materiel , and a nice coat of red paint . The back wave of the 1772 feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUCH better sounding than any sort of " open back " . The driving amplifier is a custom built unit , but based on a Harman Kardon Citation 12 . This was done by Palm Beach Acoustical Fidelity . <p> The highs , from 8k Hz &amp; up , are done with the Stage Accompany SA-8535 , driven by a custom built tube amp , again , by Palm Beach Acoustical Fidelity . <p> As might be visible from the pictures , the room is well treated with acoustic damping . Yep , its a man-cave like room , and does not have to meet any sort of approval for its aesthetic qualities . ( No one complains , because , with most audio gatherings , yours truly does some fine b-b-q ) . <p> The system is superb sounding and utterly effortless in its dynamic prowess . It culminates 44 years worth of effort . If I may borrow the saying : - Its not that I have been taken to the venue , but rather , its that THEY are here . <p> A reminder : we invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear and room treatment are a must , as are CLEAR photos .

@@23909560 @3909560/ <h> Ripping it up <p> In one of my earlier posts Taking things for granted I mentioned being confounded by the results of making a CD copy , which turned out better than the original . <p> I understand some of the ideas here : copying to a hard drive and then back again to lower jitter , cleaning up the source etc . Problem is , hard drives do n't  have jitter nor clocks . Neither do DVD burners , or CDs . Yet the differences between the two discs are there for evidence . <p> Even the new discs I use , which are the Mobile Fidelity gold discs , are supposed to sound better when copied to , but why ? I am simply out of answers . Every possible solution I come up with makes no sense to me , in the end , and I just want this one to go away and not be true . But it is true . <p> Many of you have written me and asked for the details of how I made the copy . I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fancy program or part of the answer lies in my methodology . Perhaps that 's true , but it certainly is n't by design . Heres what I do and you may find this surprising simple . <p> First off I am a Mac guy . I gave up on Windows years ago and can never go back . A lone wolf , other than Terri , in a sea of Windows computers throughout the rest of the company . However , I have tried this on both the Mac and a Windows machine with the results being close ( the Mac better by a smidge ) . <p> here 's the drill : I place the original CD into the Macs internal DVD drive and copy the files onto my desktop . Once copied I open iTunes , drag them into iTunes making sure the iTunes import process is WAV . I then place those files into an iTunes playlist , insert a Mobile Fidelity gold CD in the same internal DVD drive and click " burn CD " . <p> When its finished so too am I. I can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , its not rocket science and I have no clue why it works . <p> Certainly feel free to share any theories . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 51 COMMENTS <p> I get very close to the original doing this . I use 2 cd rom drives one for the original and one for the burningof the blank , I burn on the fly from disc to disc , not going via the hard drive , the simple program I use to do on the fly burning , is Clone CD I also burn at 4x <p> It would be interesting if you would isolate down as close as possible to only one variable the MF gold CD vs pressed CD and then test if you still ( unsighted ) discern such a significant difference . Not saying you wo n't <p> 1/ make a disk image of your original music CD 2/ burn that dmg to a MF gold CD ( yah , try different burn speeds , burners ) 3/ enlist a co-conspirator , test original and gold unsighted for differences and 4/ rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MF gold CD created from dmg in /2/ ; perform unsighted comparison <p> From my for what its worth department , here 's a theory . Having done just a very small a1mount of research on RBCD standards and methods during the discussion about jitter I learned a few interesting things . While making a digital to digital copy of a file should invariably result in a perfect copy every time such that the 1000th generation copy is indistinguishable from the first generation ( this is what really scared the recording and movie industry ) the process of reading and making an optical copy is not perfect . There are at least half a dozen different types of errors anticipated and corrected for in the process . One is interpolative errors to deal with dropouts . This is a smoothing process , an electronic guess which can reduce brief high frequency noise spikes and alter FR . Those discs or processes which are more prone to errors such as by applying a thin , practically invisible haze of Armorall residue or some material will corrupt copies in ways that make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect works , make multiple sequential generation copies , that is take the disc that 's the result of copying the original and make a copy of it to make a first generation copy . Then use that copy as the source and repeat the process making another copy . Keep repeating the process . If each generation makes changes , by the time you get to the 20th , 50th , 100th generation the changes should pile up to the point where there is a very significant difference from the original . If its a one time process then the 100th generation and 1st generation copy should sound the same and something else is happening . If you try this , let us know how it comes out . <p> Another thought , if you have a cue review feature on your CD player , you can easily synchronize two copies of the same disc on two different players ( here of the same model player ) to make a direct AB comparison . I was surprised when I first tried it as I 've reported elsewhere that two entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was actually a DVD player ) playing duplicate factory made discs sounded identical to my ears so differences between the two of the same model players themselves are not likely audible . <p> I do n't  copy CDs to CD media , but when " playing " CDs the way I do they sound far better than playing the original in any CD player I own or have owned . Granted , I have never owned an " exotic " CD player , nor anything like the " Perfect Wave " combo , nor anything over $2K . My current system has no CD player in it at all . <p> Here is my technique . I rip each CD on a Dell Laptop and use Dick Burwens " BOBCAT " software . The ripped file is then a WMA file ( as required using BOBCAT ) . I then use JRiver to convert the file to FLAC and transfer it to a 3 TB hard drive . This hard drive connects via USB to a Bryston BDP-1 Music Player , which in turn feeds my DAC . Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 days , 7 hours , 58 minutes and 22 seconds of music ) , including plenty of 192/24 FLAC files , but they are all easily found and selected for play via iPad control of the Bryston . I buy 192/24 FLAC files when available , but I am amazed at how much detail there is in some 44.1/16 Redbook CDs . Just for overkill , I have some albums I truly love in one or two prints of vinyl , CD media , ripped CD using BOBCAT , ripped CD without BOBCAT , and hi rez FLAC . All of the digital media versions stored on my hard drive sound better than spinning a CD in my system . <p> As reported in an earlier post , I have the opposite experience : I recorded favorite CDs to my Dell hard drive from its DVD drive then converted them using Foobar2000 to FLAC , the standard format for my downloads . When I then play the files using eLyric to the same PWD that my PWT plays to , the computer file is sufficiently lacking that I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stored file plays back with a distinct lack of resolution , though the sound is pleasant enough . <p> I was under the impression that anything we burn onto a cd or DVD has a limited lifetime unlike original copies . If that is true , people might not want to throw away the original CDs or especially their family photos that they have put onto disc . Just food for thought . I could be wrong , just forwarding what I was told years ago . <p> I was on the way to a New York Stereophile show with my friend George Bischof ( Melos , Pipedreams , Scaena ) when I 1st heard about ripping CDs for improved sound . George told me had a speial treatment for CDs that improved the sound . I was skeptical . <p> We went into the Merlin room and had Bobby pick 2 CDs for George to copy onto his treated CDRs with the lap top he brought . I recall one was gladiator . I was amazed . It took me less than 5 seconds to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George sold teated gold CDs with minor success . The gold was n't the important part . The treatment was . He used gold because they were supposed to be more robust and they looked good . The treatment worked on any CD material . <p> What is very interesting is that George took it along torecording companies , especially to those that did audiophile CDs and offered the treatment inexpensively to them . They all heard the difference . And even though it would only add a small amount to the cost of manufacture , they all turned it down . I 'm mystified . I understand regular companies doing this in a way . But audiophile companies when it was cheap to do and hit you over the head obvious/ I makes one wonder . <p> The idea is out there for companies as Bud Fried used to say , for those who really care . <p> It does not surprise me at all that the process you describe results in audible differences , although those differences could be either positive or negative . The process of audio CD playback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately from the disc , and the same data delivered with a jitter-free clock . Reading the data from the disc is more or less the same problem you describe in your posts on the Digital Lens and the problems of extracting a jitter-free clock from a noisy incoming synchronous source , except the source is way worse . <p> The CD player directs a laser beam onto the surface of the CD . This beam reflects off the CD and the reflected light is focused onto a photodiode . The signal from the photodiode then has to be interpreted to determine whether it represents a " 1 " or a " 0 " . The nature of the signal coming from the photodiode will be determined by the physical properties and condition of the disc . Whether it was the first or the last disc off the stamper . Whether the polycarbonate coating is scratched or otherwise damaged . Whether the laser beam was properly aligned with the pit . Whether the laser is wearing out . Other factors too . This process is inherently fraught , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for it . Furthermore , since the clock is derived directly from the data stream , and therefore ultimately from the players mechanical motor , it is virtually impossible to make it as accurate as a clock designed to read out from a memory buffer . When ripping to disc , the ripping software has the option of re-reading any data which it has reason to suspect may be erroneous ( special ripping modes like " CD Paranoia " take this capability to its logical extreme ) . This is why data files read from a CD-ROM very seldom contain read errors . Therefore ripping a CD to hard disk can be expected to result in a more accurate readout of the audio data than real-time playback . <p> When it comes to writing the ripped data back to a blank CD , the result obtained when playing back that CD will be governed by the exact same physical parameters . Except now you have some control over the physical medium . You are burning with a laser , not stamping . You are using a brand new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurately positioned pits ( or it may not ) . By using MF Gold CDs you are probably tilting those variables in your favor by using disc stock designed and manufactured for excellence , as opposed to just meeting the specs at the lowest possible cost . <p> However , when all is said and done , the most accurate playback will not occur when you re-write your ripped data to a blank CD not even a MF Gold CD . The most accurate data is the ripped files on your computer , and the most accurate playback result will be obtained by playing them directly to a DAC . Preferably one with the " Magic " properties you have been describing . <p> I can tell you that Sony and Memorex brands that were burned using a stand alone consumer cd recorder have digitally " disintegrated " in as little as five to seven years . There is either complete skipping or a chuffing/ticking going on under the music that makes it unlistenable . I never used Mobile Fidelity blanks but Maxell Music Pro continues without failing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  but applying a thin coat of Amour All and buffing it ( cotton balls ) to a shine results in an audible improvement to the sound . Again it seems that increasing the reflectivity has audible improvements . <p> If my memory serves me correctly . It was a product where you had a spray bottle and a microfiber type pad . You sprayed it on the CD and then scrub it/polish the cd with the microfiber brush does that sound correct ? Supposedly , it polished out surface scratches and the liquid had the ability tolower surface reflections so the laser could was able to read the CD better . I remember using it and thinking that it helps but it was such a pain in the butt to go through the whole ritual that I gave up on it . <p> I use the MARIGO AUDIO signature 3-D stabilizer V2 which is very easy to use and seems to give me satisfactory results . Seems to smooth things out and add a little bit more fullness and three dimensionality to the midrange . In general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it . <p> BitperfectRichard above has it right ! It is about the reading of the CDRs being better at playback time . <p> Easy to prove : Just rip the original and the CDR copy back to your hard drive ( please do n't  use Pauls method of dragging the files to the desktopuse iTunes with " error correction " on , or EAC or XLD , whatever ) . Then compare the sound of the rips . Assuming a decent computer audio setup , both of the rips will sound better than realtime CD or CDR playback , and will sound the same as each other . <p> Years ago I used to copy CDs to CDRs all the time ( using a Marantz dual-drive player/burner ) . And yes the copies sounded better ; and yes the quality/dye-type of the CDR discs had an effect as well . So this is all old news I am afraid . <p> I think that an interesting experiment based on your findings thus far would be to then take the better sounding copy of the original and put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to first delete the first copy from your Mac and iTunes so that it will rip it and not just say that you already have it on your computer or in iTunes . You could then compare the original to the first copy that you say sounds better and then compare them both to the copy of the copy to see if you get a further increase in performance . You of course would want keep variables the same as far as settings on your Mac and type of CDR you are using . It would be interesting to see if performance got better , same or worse on copy of the copy . Or if it is only a performance increase is from original to first copy . <p> As a CD is an optical device , any substance that is applied to its surface compromises the clarity of the protective plastic layer applied over the aluminum reflective surface even if it is just residue invisible to the human eye . It also risks chemically reacting with it both short and long term . If any gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably in for big trouble . <p> CD scratch repair kits work by applying a mild abrasive substance that smoothes the edge of the scratch . The sharp edge causes the laser light to refract interfering with the pit reading process . The substances should be removed thoroughly with mild soap and water after its used . <p> Many substances and even rings applied to the edges have been marketed to " improve " the sound of CDs . They do n't  really work . Degradation of the signal may sound better to some but altering the optical or physical properties of the disc is risky business at best . Electronic means to alter the signal where there 's a problem is a much better solution being more effective , consistent , controllable , and predictable . <p> My experience is that RBCD standards are adequate for recording and retrieving the electrical signals that are analogs of music in the recording schemes we use without audible noise or distortion , namely two stereophonic channels . Useful improvements to the performance of high fidelity sound systems will not come from bettering RBCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do away with physical recordings entirely . Each one will degrade with time and use although RBCD recordings have proven much more stable and resistant to damage and change than vinyl phonograph records or magnetic recording tape . <p> Once part of my job was to evaluate CD drives for reliability . I had a known test CD that I could play and capture the digital output and look for errors in the bitstream using a computer program I wrote for the job . There were about 6 common errors that transports would make to some greater or lesser degree and I could hear them all . The transports were not consistent , either , and could perform flawlessly on one day and badly the next , repeating the same errors in the same place . There is some seriously bad engineering done for reading Redbook CDs , and Ive seen 10k+ transports with them . That said , the CD copy could be quite different in its bit layout from the original . <p> It shouldnt surprise anyone . Even the tiniest speck of dust will change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Ive been reading paper after paper trying to understand how oversampling is achieved , whether its done optically or electronically with the bit stream . If its optical that can reduce read errors . If it just multiplies the optical readout electronically then it repeats the error X times . here 's a paper written 20 years ago . I do n't  think there 's much new under the sun about it since then . I just wonder how many people who buy or even manufacture CD players understand the standards and methods completely . I know I do n't  . I consider my knowledge remains very vague and sketchy . <p> So how do you evaluate a CD player ? The only way I can see is to measure its analog output using test discs for performance and consistency . If the tests are designed well , all of the problems of noise , phase shift , and high frequency distortion of the early CD players should show up . <p> The author of this paper also deals with jitter . Read what he has to say about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The push for more space shrinks the bits until they have a " manageable " error rate , which means the trade-off between redundant bits and errors gives them the most bits per square millimeter . <p> Every time the bits are read , they go through layers of error correction to arrive at a verified RAM based copy . This is then used to re-write the bits . There is no such thing as " perfect bit-for-bit copy " , only one that regenerates the verified bits . In audio hard errors are acceptable if they are deemed " inaudible " . Of course , all the digital artifacts that were supposedly inaudible have been proven audible in blind listening test by the likes of Ole Chistianson , Alexander Lipinsky and now Paul McGowan . <p> When you play a Redbook CD , there is a limited amount of time to get the bits out because they have to be streamed to the DAC . When you rip a CD , the drive can go back and read as many times as necessary to satisfy error detection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithms . <p> Your gold discs are presumably are optically superior after burning to pressed CDs and use different molecules than regular CD-ROMs . The doubly regenerated bits ( ripping original and reading the HD ) are maximally clean from the source , so the error correction is not working so hard on playback of the MoFi . <p> Where is the proof of that ? The fact is that when a copy sounds different from the original , that difference by definition is distortion whether you happen to like it or not . Why is it that when there is a need to distort ( deliberately alter ) a signal for legitimate reasons audiophiles always choose the methods that are the most unreliable , least predictable , least controllable , and most expensive ? Engineers try to do exactly the opposite . <p> The original bits are blurry , like the line at the optometrists you get half right . If it was sentences , you can figure out which lettter it was supposed to be from the context . Sometimes even that is ambiguous and you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page . <p> If you are reading aloud to an audience , you do not have time to got back and find out what that letter was supposed to be so you make your best guess and move on . <p> Ripping and copying is like a scholar going over the text to determine each letter , and then re-typesetting the whole text . If you use better paper , you can now read with ease and your expression and rhythm are better as well as getting all the letters , words , sentences and paragraphs correct . <p> You 're right . I 'm missing the point . I 'm not one for analogies and generalizations to begin with . Ultimately I 'm only convinced of arguments when they are backed up by facts , measurements , the theory behind the measurements . And then I put them in context of other facts I know to see if they make sense . <p> Blurry is a relative term . How blurry ? What is the required performance to accurately read bits and how does the equipment stack up . If what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like music at all . Yet even the cheapest players are very close to the most expensive ones except to the degree that the expensive ones have been deliberately compromised in the analog domain . <p> There is a point where every letter in every book is readable to those with normal vision . Youd be hard pressed to find a book printed in the last 100 years that is n't damaged where you cant read even some of them . No further improvement in paper will matter . <p> Engineers including those who devised the RBCD system are trained to think in specifics . In fact we even call those documented thoughts " specifications . " Required performance specifications , claimed performance specifications , measurements to prove them . If there is a problem , then the specifications are inadequate and must change but there will still be specifications . <p> When something does n't  work the way you want it to , if you do n't  understand how its supposed to work , how what you have works , and why it falls short , the only thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you think works better . This is what a lot of people in this industry seem to do and this is their idea of research . They expect to be paid for their efforts as though they actually are scientists and engineers . Lucky for them they do n't  have to depend on me to put dinner on their tables . <p> The RBCD standard encodes a single linear bit stream . This means the left and right channels alternate . When the first review samples of the first Philips CD player went out to Ole Christianson for review , he heard something wrong . Checking with a scope , he found that the alignment delay had been applied in the wrong direction so one channel lagged the other by 22.7 microseconds . He called Philips , who acknowledged the mistake but insisted that he could not hear it . They came to him with a modified player and engineers who conducted a blind listening test where he identified the production model with 100% accuracy and refused to ignore the flaw in his review . <p> They were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been packed for the release of the brand new format . <p> The engineers are still insisting we cant hear this or that level of jitter , the jaggies from filtering of decimated words , etc . On the musician side , the differences between RBCD , higher sample and bit depth PCM and DSD are readily apparent while audiologists and engineers claim otherwise . <p> And here is the crux : just because you , your friends and family , and 99.9% of the population ca n't hear a difference , it does not mean the difference is inaudible to all humans . I am taking my production intern through a transition now . He is a skilled cello player but expanded his knowledge of music listening to AAC on Apple earbuds . After six months of hearing live acoustic music six nights a week , his hearing is reverting to his acoustic training and everything is sounding different . <p> I intend to run full blown audiological testing on the few conservatory players who resist iTunes and PA speakers , or to get volunteers to stop listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reources become available . <p> I can say that since all audiology since 1932 is based on subjects who listen to music through radio , phonograph and PA speakers , none of the existing science disproves my hypotheses . OTOH I can explain all of the anomalies between audiophiles , musicians and general population that provoke discussion threads like this . <p> Let 's for a moment accept that you are in that 0.1% of the population that can hear a time based jitter of 0.2 picoseconds as you claim . You will admit that for the other 99.9 % to pay the kind of price to reduce it to below your audibility would be ludicrous . It would be additional performance they ca n't use because they cant hear it . Of what benefit would it be to them if they could be " trained " to hear it ? Then all theyd benefit is something new to complain about that did n't  bother them before . Pay the big bucks or live with it . The usual sales pitch for high end audio is that anyone can hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales a whole lot though , this is still a very small niche market . What I do n't  understand is how audiophiles can hear such infinitesimal differences but accept the vast difference between live and recorded music or still pay the big bucks endlessly searching for magic bullets while claiming nothing will ever be perfect ( also an unproven assumption . ) They also like the most absolutely awful music and musicians . Ca n't they hear that Barbara Streisand ca n't sing on key or that many pop singers have no voice ? To each his own . <p> Practically every new technology has problems . Small surprise Philips made some gross mistakes at the beginning . I knew there was a problem at high frequencies when I saw the first oscillophotographs published in one of the now defunct three reliable consumer audio hobbyist magazines . The photo of an impulse response showed the same kind of high frequency ringing some of the worst phono cartridges did . These problems are now ancient history . I immediately liked CDs for their clarity , range , and freedom from noise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until about 1989 that I found one that was listenable due to the shrill high end caused in retrospect to the distortion created by the analog brick wall filter before oversampling fixed it . <p> I am also going to concede here for the sake of argument that you and others hear differences you claim are more accurate than RBCD . However , you have not made a case for attributing those differences to reduced clock jitter or increased bit resolution . To demonstrate that would take impartial well designed tests where only the one variable under test at a time is controlled . AFAIK , that has never been done . <p> I have been reading Pauls columns for a few years and have come to trust his ears because he scores high on my audio survey markers and I have heard some of his gear . His comments on circuit design are also concordant with my decades of experience designing state-of-the-art industrial sensors and researching audio electronics as a trained electrical engineer and musician . <p> The observation of copy improving on original is the cause of cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be re-done . Science is what is true when you do n't  believe it and do n't  want it to be true . It is subject to constant revision as new data contradicts old theories . In this case , the most likely cause has been published since the first magnetic and optical disc drives . <p> The fundamental difference between digital data storage and audio storage is asynchronous vs. synchronous . For audio storage , you have to get the data out on schedule or there will be a glitch in the sound . Although computer media is capable of high data accuracy , it ca n't be achieved in real time . <p> Another difference is that audio format does not account for bad sectors the way that digital storage does . There is not enough time to seek back to the directory when you are on a time budget . The only way to get flawless play is to get it right the first time . <p> This is analogous to the difference between live and studio recording . I record live in DSF format that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compression , reverb etc . The musicians have to play each track together in the same room from beginning to end . If there is a mistake , there is no fixing it other than starting over from the beginning . <p> I can tell by the feeling and sound of a track if studio techniques have been used to " fix it in the mix " . Because I record 150 live performances a year , I no longer have time to listen to such musically inferior practices . <p> I trust Pauls honesty . I think he believes what he says when he says it . The only ears I trust are my own . <p> Paul has changed his opinion of his amplifier three times already . First it was excellent . Then after comparing it to Arnies it was no good , it lacked a high end ( someone else who visited him made the same comment . ) Then he said there were great improvements . And finally he said while it was excellent it just was n't good enough to market but we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counter claims about audio equipment in my life that turned out to be false to not believe any of it . This years darling is next years ho hum and the following years dog . This is n't a moving target . My reference , real music which means live music not electronically amplified . And no , its not good enough for a recording of a piano to sound like a piano . I do not accept that a recording of a Steinway sounds like a Yamaha . <p> Ummm , may I disagree on this one Mark ? The amp , on the original Magneplanar system that I first heard it on and reported it to have sounded excellent , did indeed sound excellent and served well in service of the music . After getting the higher resolving IRS system I started to question its high frequency performance . It was then I went and had the opportunity to test it and compare it to another amp I trust on another system I trust . This showed up its flaws . <p> But you 're right in that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to retract some of it when I was able to compare it to other references . Its tricky . <p> I refer you to my posting of February 11 at 8:58 AM on the threat called " The Designers Dilemma " <p> " Amplifier A sounds better than amplifier B+G-on speaker #1 . What if amplifier B sounds better than amplifier A on speaker #2 ? Which is the better amplifier ? This is why I don+GGt understand it the way audiophiles explain it . " <p> I could add to that . Reviewer 1 likes amplifier A much better than amplifier B. Reviewer 2 likes B better . What if their systems are different ? What if they 're the same . Certainly their rooms are different . Surely their recordings are different unless they restrict themselves to a few " audiophile tracks " like Anne Bison singing Winter in Toronto . <p> Amplifiers like other equipment once praised to the stars by reviewers are now considered junk . Forget designing or even reviewing an amplifier , I have no rational way to shop for oneexcept on specs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take all opinions about audio equipment with a grain of salt . Sorry . However , there is an advantage of designing and building just for yourself . You have nobody else to blame , nobody else to please . Simplifies things a lot . : - ) <p> I agree with you , Mark , that amplifier reviews are not a reliable way to make a good purchase decision . The problem is relativism that pervades the audio ecology . Each component of the reproduction chain needs to be compared to an acoustic event , and theoretically should be compared to other components of the same type in a reference system starting with the best reproduction compared to the real thing , and substituting one part at a time to look for improvement or flaws . <p> Of course it is not that simple , because there is interaction between parts , most notably speaker with room and amplifier . Regarding the latter , it is my feeling that competent speaker design includes engineering relatively flat impedance curve and minimizing phase angles . Competent amplifier design includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> I had a case where a very good sounding , large HT speaker that dropped to 3 Ohms at 45 degrees caused an amp to fail , taking the tweeters out along with the output transistors . I had the opportunity to review the database of an amplifier testing company that showed this amp limit corresponding to the published speaker curves . The amp manufacturer had nothing in the published specs to indicate this limit and should have been on the hook for those tweeters from the chain failure ; but it was hard enough to get them to replace the amp under warranty as they blamed the speaker manufacturer . Fortunately the speaker manufacturer had a good relationship with the dealer and just replaced the tweeter . <p> My understanding has always been that commercial CDs have a metal layer inside that has depressions in it , and the depth of the pits is 1/4 of the wavelength of the laser . As the laser tracks the disc , light on the mirrored surface reflects directly back , but light that hits a pit travels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back out of phase , and much reduced in apparent brightness . It is the on/off contrast of the light waves that provides the stream of ones and zeroes that make up the digital data . My impression of what happens when you burn your own CD is that your PCs laser is basically printing a series of dashes on a smooth surface as it goes . I 've often wondered if it was easier ( and possibly more accurate for playback ) to have a CD player reading distinct black vs. white dashes of varying lengths , rather than recognizing differences in fractions of the wavelength of light . I suspected that the pit depth recognition might somehow be fuzzier . Just a laymans speculation , but that 's my guess .. <p> Thanks for all the great speculation and conversation . Its been a treat to read . here 's where I still have a problem . Let 's suggest that indeed , a commercially pressed CD is fundamentally different and inferior to a writable disc . And that a laser has an easier time reading the writable disc than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version would then possibly sound better because the CD players laser is happier ( big broad brush strokes here ) . The problem I still have is that the original data was initially played back through the commercial system on a laser that were guessing is struggling to read it properly . <p> Perhaps its the actual process of reading the data that makes the difference . Hmmmm , maybe this is worth exploring more . <p> here 's my problem . Once again you have this propeller head baffled . What is the purpose of a system of recording and retrieval whether its an LP record , magnetic tape , or cd ? To a propeller head like me it is to retrieve a copy of an electrical signal at some arbitrary future time that is as close to the original signal as possible given the parameters required . These parameters include frequency range , dynamic range , resolution ( smallest required incremental change to each . ) The deviation from this ideal is by definition distortion . We define them in certain ways that can be analyzed as mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonic distortion , intermodulation distortion , broadband noise . When the system produces a change , particularly an audible change that is considered by we propeller heads an undesirable defect in the system . Is this assertion that sometimes this defect is an asset ? Before our discussion many did n't  realize that in making vinyl phonograph records the electrical signal is of necessity distorted and that was its asset . What puzzles me is the inconsistency of thinking that accepts and even embraces certain types of distortion that are unintended , uncontrolled , unpredictable , and in some cases expensive while rejecting other means that accomplishes a desired end in ways that are controllable , predictable , reliable , and often inexpensive . Nor do I see that these desirable distortions are studied to understand them . It seems a wide open field that is the substance of endless trial and error . That 's a very expensive and inefficient way to achieve a goal . Like a dog chasing its tail . <p> A further thought . You reported that you can burn an exact duplicate of a vinyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a different duplicating process to try . Play the CD on a separate CD player and use its analog output to feed your CD burner just as you would if the source was a phono preamplifier output . Do you still get different results ? If the duplicate is the same the error in your process is in reading the CD or storing in on your hard drive . If it is still not the same , then the error probably comes from writing the duplicate because that CD is beyond the capabilities of the CD burners write laser . <p> The problem with specifications is they are based on machine parameters . Machines are very good at creating and measuring tones precisely , but not so good at large dynamic range and short term transients . Ears are the opposite . The longer a tone persists , the more accurately its level and frequency can be determined by machine . Perception ignores anything that is constant ( like neighbors ignoring the roar of Niagara Falls ) and focuses on minute changes . We can even hear echoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . <p> In music as in speech , the way that sounds start and stop ( the consonants ) contain less than 5% of the sound energy with respect to repeating waveforms ( vowels ) , but the transient information is over 50% of the meaning . These ratios are even more extreme when it comes to sensing the acoustic environment . <p> My work is focused on transient , temporal and spatial distortion in the reproduction chain . There are no numbers for these , and they are unlikely to be adopted because the present state of the art generally has poor performance in these audible parameters . In fact , spatial accuracy ca n't be achieved using a fixed number of channels and one model of speaker in fixed locations . <p> The Schroeder model of hearing predicts the best compromise for two , five or six channels looks like certain audiophile boutique labels recording process , so the " cut and try " evolution has worked in some cases , although slow . My work has been less than a decade as full-time equivalent , including tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This acceleration in progress supports your assertions about proper engineering . The problem with the audio engineers is they believed the audiology based on radio engineering theory and technology . Biology is always far more complex than mineral science , and the analogies are wrong in most cases . Frequency response , dynamic range and harmonic distortion are necessary but insufficient criteria . <p> " Machines are very good at creating and measuring tones precisely , but not so good at large dynamic range and short term transients . " <p> I do n't  agree . Machines can detect and measure events that are far too short for humans to detect with their senses over a far wider range than humans can detect at one extreme or survive at the other . Atom smashers can detect events and particles that last billionths of a second . As far back as 1945 Edgerton took this photo with a shutter speed of one one millionth of a second . This is the beginning of a blast of the worlds first atomic bomb explosion . In the photo in the upper left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am not saying it is impossible to build a machine to equal the sophistication of human hearing . I am saying it has not been done yet , and the metrology of audio is crude in relation to the information content of acoustically trained hearing . <p> The bulk of audiology canon was established in lieu of machines with the transient capability you describe . For example , time perception has been documented on impulses on the order of 3 microseconds and dynamic range is documented to 120+dB . This is equivalent to at least 22bit/352K sampling and exceeds the best microphones , which have a 10dBA noise floor . <p> Human hearing can detect frequency to greater accuracy in a shorter period of time than measurements made with fixed Q transducers . It also can correlate acoustic reflections of transients over a wider dynamic range in a complex sound field than existing audio software , including multiple reflections that are quieter than the broad band diffuse field in reverberant environments . This is equivalent to a phase coherent auto-corellator which scientists have built for other purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My statement also stands on a relative basis : machines are better at steady state measurements than transients , and ears are better at transients than steady state . The focus on steady state measurements like frequency response and harmonic distortion are Red Herrings based on historical evolution of audio from radio engineering like vacuum tube oscillators and speakers , rather than building on mechanical measurements of hearing like King and von Bekeszy . <p> First of all , in a dead quiet concert hall , the background noise is 27 dba by AIA standards . In an occupied hall it will be much noisier . Therefore microphones with a noise floor of 10 dba are adequate by a factor of 500 . The loudest claimed sounds heard in the audience for acoustic music I can find is 105 dba . This means a dynamic range of 78 db is adequate for acoustic music if it is properly used . If CD standards are 90 db or 95 db that 's more than enough . <p> " The focus on steady state measurements like frequency response and harmonic distortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio engineering like vacuum tube oscillators and speakers " <p> No , they are based on mathematical analysis resulting from the work of Fourier . Sine wave frequency response , square wave response , impulse response are all different mathematical ways of presenting the same information . It is a standard exercise for undergraduate electrical engineering students to be given one of them and derive the other two . There are however practical problems with impulse testing which was partly described by John Atkinson in his video about how he measures loudspeakers . One factor he did not mention is that a true impulse in the real world is impossible since it would have a time span that is infinitesimally short . Real world impulses take a finite length of time . This factor alone made them useless to me for my own ideas . The so called Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) is the poor mans fudge for the real thing . This is why Atkinson uses it . He cant afford an anechoic chamber to do valid testing . IMO his measurements are highly suspect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are probably far more awful than his data shows . <p> Harmonic and intermodulation distortion show up in Fourier analysis as output components not present in the input that are whole number multiples of the fundamental ( harmonic distortion ) and not whole number multiples ( intermodulation distortion . ) So called transient intermodulation or slew rate distortion would show up as frequency response distortion IF the tests were carried out at full power with real world loads instead of the antiquated bench test methods still in use . <p> Maybe the laser ( and associated software ) are indeed happier with the ripping process than with playback . I know that my own Italian skills are pretty rusty , but at one point I studied it enough to still retain my pronounciation abilities . If you were to ask me to read an Italian passage aloud , I could do a passable job of making the words sound approximately right , even if I did n't  understand what I was reading . But , if you wanted an English translation , not only would I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to figure out the meaning of each one , then figure out how they all come together to give meaning to entire sentences , and only then search for the best English words and structure to correctly communicate the content , not just the separate words . Ripping may be the equivalent of just reading words aloud fairly straightforward because not much thought is involved , and , because its not a real time operation like playback , perhaps ripping software has the luxury of moving over the pits at a more leisurely pace . I wonder if commercial CD playback is inherently more difficult than simple ripping the laser is n't just reading bit depths and passing them along for immediate translation its reading a disk that 's spinning at a constantly varying speed , buffering data , comparing that to whatever mechanism it has for doing error correction ( making some potentially nasty scratches completely inaudible ) , and only then doing the digital to analog conversion . All of this happens without the luxury of being able to leave any kind of noticible time lag before the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , perhaps the whole playback process is easier ( less work to do ) when using a purely visual layer on a recordable CD , rather than dealing with pits . So , maybe the benefit of ripping is that it is able to be done at its own pace , yielding a product that has fewer complications during playback than the commercially produced original .

I build speakers using Heil/ESS AMT1 tweeters which have the equivalent surface area of 40x 1 ? domes and lower inductance so they are faster . With a supertweeter that goes to 40KHz they do an excellent job of reproducing your pot lid , both the delicate nuance of the harmonic structure and the visceral impact of that much energy exploding into sound . <p> Great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this limitation of ordinary loudspeaker solutions . And even greater to learn from you about the phenomenon behind and a speaker design tackling this challenge . Congratulations . <p> All of the sound described by Mr Reichert was amplified , so I would put all the differences down to the size of the listening space and the power of the amplification , and nothing to do with the fidelity of the recording . I 'm not sure how to take he reference to Tina Turner . I do n't  particularly like really loud music . I go sometimes with one of my kids . I did not enjoy U2 at Wembley Stadium just a wall of noise . I preferred Coldplay doing an acoustic gig for 300 than the full affair for 70,000 at the Emirates Stadium . In recent years Radiohead at the Millennium Dome is the only one that I really enjoyed , and I am really a bit jealous as I have on my desk a couple of tickets for Radiohead in Tel Aviv in July and he s going with my wife . That said , Radiohead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home listening is completely different . The balance of musical sources is completely different . It is not meant to be the same at all . I went to a Massive Attack gig last year and it was really quite moderate not loo loud , not quiet to the extent that you could actually talk to the person next to you . It was hugely enjoyable , you could actually hear the music or just phase out . Massive Attack is the only one I like to play really loud at home , so it was a bit of a surprise . There was a time when a significant number of LP releases were live recordings . No more . Everything now has to be studio perfection . I was lucky enough to see Genesis at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1977 ( we could walk there from school ) , much of that tour songlist finding its way onto " Seconds Out " , one of the few live albums that in often better than the studio version ( mainly because they toured with two drummer/percussionists , then Bill Bruford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins ) . The venue was smaller and the acoustics excellent . I listen to it occasionally loud but even 40 years later what is really missing is the emotion of the live show , which no audio system can reproduce . <p> Its a 5 hour flight for us but as ELAL live up their name ( every landing always late ) , under European law we collect free compensatory air tickets . Radiohead tickets had to be paid by Israeli credit card , so easy to get and for once grateful to my mother-in-law . Ive been to concerts in Hayarkon before , great fun , just did not have time for this trip . Hope you have a great time , it should be fantastic . My son saw them open air at the Berlin Festival last summer , also at the Roundhouse in London a few weeks earlier .

If wed aim for most live sound wed have less fun otherwise . <p> I agree . We are n't  after recreation of live , we are into something else . I do n't  even know what to call it but contrived . Its why no one agrees on " good " . I was at a wedding reception recently where the DJ had a nice system with powered monitors , etc . It sounded more like a live event than my system . <p> Exactly . No wonder amplified Pop/Rock sounds more live when played back over PA equipment . In every club each miserably recorded track sounds just right in tonality because they level it to proper sound . With high end equipment such tracks mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s . Were not always up to the task with high end . <p> In my school years , when my father had Magnepans , which we together chose for classical music at the time , I remember when I heard the omnidirectional Shahinian Diapasons ( which were used in the music room ) with a symphony at school . This was what I called closest to classical live sound then . Later I heard some German Physics speakers of the same concept . Surely by todays standard they must have other weaknesses ( and they definitely have in imaging ) , but I think the omnidirectional concept outweighs other aspects here . <p> Horns . More than likely the DJs speakers had horns and most live sound systems do also . My old Klipsch Hersey II were very good at reproducing a live recording realistically . The key was ( and is ) to play the music at realistic volumes . I tend to listen to listen to music louder than many people . I have heard music played live in small jazz clubs to various rock venues including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me music sounds most realistic played at a " natural volume " . By that I mean at level that is what you would hear if sitting in a room with the musicians . It does n't  mean it has to be a ear bleed levels but if you sit in front of even a acoustic jazz trio its louder then most people would play the same at home . <p> There are no musical instruments that are omni-directional , so omni speakers do not reproduce any live experience . Also , omni speakers guarantee that any room problems get heard . <p> PA type speakers have one virtue , that is they beam away from the boundaries and cut down on the reverb of large , hard rooms . It is too bad that sound engineers all either add digital reverb to the mix , crank up the gain on dozens of mics and at least half a dozen speakers until there is a distorted electro-acoustic reverb , or both . <p> Let 's say it that way : there are no instruments that radiate their sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multidirectional instruments , some mainly but not fully directional , but no solely directional or only front/back directional . Aside of the fact that instruments as omnidirectional ( which mostly actually are multidirectional only ) speakers cause more room problems than directional speakers , my opinion is that radiation of omni/multidirectional speakers is closer to the radiation of instruments . <p> Live music , even amplified rock &amp; roll can be very instructive as to what good sound is . In the last few months I had the good fortune to have floor seats about 14 rows back at MSG in NYC to see and hear first Eric Clapton and then Billy Joel with approximately one month between the two . The two concerts could not have been more different . The EC concert was simply wonderful . Eric still has it although he did not play as long as he has in the past , however , I am a few years younger than Eric and I do n't  play as long as I use to either . The Billy Joel concert was almost a waste of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound levels . I am an old baby boomer who has typical age related high frequency hearing lost . If I want to hear a pure 12 KHz tone I have to stick my ear right up against the tweeter or be wearing good headphones . At the Billy Joel concert I had to stuff my attenuating ear plugs into my ears and I still heard every note they played just not at bombastic sound levels . Of course , the ear plugs do nothing to attenuate the low frequencies that travel through your bones and are heard that way . So I felt and heard every bass drum note as if it was right next to me . <p> So the lesson I learned was that the EC concert can happen in my listening room , but the Billy Joel concert ca n't and thank goodness for that . I would go back and hear EC as long as he and I are both still kicking , but I really have no desire to see Billy Joel again . <p> If I was disrespectful to Herb I apologise . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

To be honest , over the years some of the concerts I look at most nostalgically revolve around the theatrics or pyrotechnics or whether I got to hang out with the band and not about how the show actually sounded . Having said that , I remember really bad sounding shows such as the time Spirit played a local venue using only guitar amps and the distortion was so bad I could n't even make out " Natures Way " until it was halfway over . Reading this I find that statement interesting , that of all the hundreds of shows I 've been to I remember the bad as it relates to sound but honestly cant remember the good as it relates to sound for most of the others ! <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if they are past their prime as they come to smaller , more intimate venues .

Compared to listening at home a live concert is so much better ( I 'm not sure about Tina Turners sweat though .. ) . The last concert I heard was a Melody Gardot concert in an acoustically excellent hall . One thing I remember ( besides her wonderful performance ) is the double bass player giving a solo of about 5 minutes . Magical . Real bass . Tight and deep . Not boomy at all . Nothing like the baby sound we hear at home . Live concerts make you realize music is not all about sound quality . Its about ambience , atmosphere , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go to live concerts every week due to financial and/or geographical propblems . So listening at home.we shall have to make it do . <p> Could it be that in concert halls and stadiums there is no problem with room modes exited by powerful bass notes ? ; - ) In normal listening rooms you have no chance to play higher volumes via full range speakers unless you have heavily invested in room tuning accessories . <p> Of course there are room modes in a large hall but you know that . I sat high up and toward a corner for Steely Dan at the Chicago Theater , and you could n't separate the bass from the drums . It was a drag , as you could see the bass player churnin and burnin , and you knew he was goodbut.LF mush . <p> Another Meoldy Gardot fan here , did her the honour of buying a couple of her albums on vinyl . There was a " louder the better " period in the mid 1970s , reached its peak with a The Who gig at The Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now demolished , but it was a big open bowl and allegedly they got crowds up to 120,000 people ( according to a friend , lifelong Charlton Athletic supporter ) . I remember a TV documentary , Roger Daltrey going on about how mad it was . Now it is simply about money . From the early 1970s things just got bigger and more , crazier and more outlandish , such as Rick Wakemans King Arthur on Ice , which lost a load of money , and reached its peak with Pink Floyds " The Wall " ( which I saw at Earls Court ) , which cost so much they sold all the tickets and merchandising and still lost a fortune . It was absolutely marvellous , mind you . Concept shows died a death and it then just became filling stadiums for the cash . I must admit the U2 " 360 " set-up was impressive , apparently 120 tour buses were needed . The acoustics and sound generally just become irrelevant . Personally , the best sound I can recall at a gig was Elton John and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I think ) . <p> Some people here seem to get to see a lot of gigs as they are in the music business , my angle was that my uncles best mate for about 50 years was probably the most successful music promoter in the world for the best part of 30 years . I worked with my uncle for the about 15 years and the promoter was our main client . He used to phone and offer tickets , sometimes we just had to ask . I studied and have always worked in London and went to hundreds of concerts often last minute tickets discounted to $3 . Tonight I was at the ballet , better seats and inflation but still best seats about $40 . The world has changed a lot since then . In those days established stars would gig in pubs ( Wakeman in Isleworth and Elton John in Watford ) . Concerts were advertised in the evening newspaper or music magazines and you used to send a cheque or go to the box office to buy a ticket . No internet or Ticketmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember when " Cats " first opened we read the reviews in the paper and called , box office and booked tickets for a few days later .

If I wanted to up the ante I 'd tell you the story about the day Bob Geldof came in the office with his scruffy little dogs and said he wanted to raise some money for famine relief . <p> Yesterday I accidently pushed the Enter button a bit too soon , before adding and changing a few lines . Well I guess you do like music , I was probably a bit silly there . But as far as Melody Gardot is concerned , you may or may not like her music , but she is anything but " boring " . I 've seen her live a few times and she is one of the most flamboyant and energetic persons Ive seen the last 10 years or so , and so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rock and jazz . But of course its all in the eye ( and ear ) of the beholder . For me American football is so " boring " , but for a lot of Americans probably not . Oh and btw. , do n't  bother to find artist I " SHOULD " care about . Given the aforementioned your taste and my taste probably live in different galaxies . <p> But as an example of what happens for regular , non-reviewer people : I could n't even see the Rolling Stones from my assigned seat in Vancouver , BC behind a large support column . Staff moved me to a high altitude seat where the sound was so bad that I literally could not even tell what song they were playing for the first minute or two . Now that do n't  happen at home ! <p> We go to many concerts and I have been a musician for many decades . Just because you go to a concert , it does n't  mean it is going to sound good or it is the ultimate experience . There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you go home and enjoy it more on your audio system . The sound managers at concerts for at least a couple of decades turn up the bass where it is so loud , muddied , and overpowering compared to the rest of the music . I had front row seats to the Who 10 years ago and I thought my pants were going to fly off it was so loud and not very clean sounding . Some of the best concerts for sound that I have been to have been : Joe Bonamassa , Robert Cray , Acoustic Alchemy , Yellowjackets , and Toto . They just got it right ! Some of the worst : Aerosmith , Dave Mathews , Doobie Brothers . <p> I once caught Chris Calloway , Cabs daughter , at a show in San Francisco . They had a full 15 piece big band on stage including players like Herb Stewart ( of Four Brothers fame ) and John Handy . The moron they called a sound engineer had the bass player and the kick drum so cranked up you could hardly hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . <p> I stress that volume and palpability are a requisite for home stereo listening . Much of what we define of the " live " experience is visual not auditory . For my wife we need to " go out " to make it special but not for me . <p> I have no previous knowledge of the author and based my observations on the paragraph as posted . That paragraph makes only one reference to music:l " play the blues . " Even there the authors verb is " saw . " I 'd suggest " heard , " <p> Feeling the pressure of a kick drum tap amplified with millions of watts during a sound check is n't insightful and only peripherally related to music . Its impressive , but pointlessly obvious under the circumstances . <p> And I do n't  hateeveranyone . I often feel disappointment , pity , fear , disgust , and such but not hate . <p> The problem with yall is that you just buy your records , put the needle down and expect perfection . Youve only worked half the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few to many , many thousands of dollars and youve only worked half the audio reproduction chain , and now you 're complaining it is n't dripping sweat . <p> Buy some microphones and a means to record onto , go out and record something live , then bring it home and listen . Learn the different methods of making recordings . Learn about the different kinds of recording gear . I have one of the all-time lowest cost recording systems money can buy and I get some VERY good recordings . I have a pair of Behringer C-2 small diaphram condensor mikes , run into an M-Audio USB audio interface into a $200 Windows laptop , using the free open source Audacity recording software . I master at 24 bit / 96 khz resolution . Total cost for everything comes in at about $400 . <p> How many of you even have a phono cartridge that costs less than $400 ? <p> Here . Take a listen to a recording I made of my wifes group , the Temescal String Quartet . All are working professional players who work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first movement of the Brahms Clarinet quintet . It is an mp3 , but even so , it sounds pretty damn good . If you must have it in 24/96 , let me know and I 'll upload that to my server in your browser . <p> Russ , thanks for making that piece available . It did sound good , and very real . At 128kbps there were many noticeable mp3 artifacts . If you could make it available as a FLAC , even 16/44.1 , I would appreciate it ; I think it would be well worth the download . <p> Many thanks . I downloaded it and converted the WAV to a 24/96 FLAC , which reduced it to 192mb . I have just been listening to it on my system . I love a string quartet so it was an enjoyable experience . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sounded great to me ) or the piece itself , but I was struck by the channel separation , which seemed more marked than I am used to with other recordings of quartets . It was as if one was sitting almost on top of the players . I liked it . <p> I have uploaded a photo of this performance , which also shows the mike placement . When you have the mikes spread apart as seen in this image , with the capsules about 17 CM apart , its what is called the ORTF configuration . <p> As you might expect with cardiod mikes , instruments on the left will be louder in the left mike than the right . Their sound wave also arrives sooner in the mike on the left , so when it is reproduced on a home system , you get two aural cues its louder in the left channel and it comes out sooner . You can get some very good imaging from this technique . <p> I downloaded the piece and have taken a listen and enjoyed it as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my normal type of music to listen to . The photo and the personal connection via this site probably enhanced my experience ! ! Thank you . <p> How did you get the " play " icon to appear in your original post as just a slider and a play button , that was kind of interesting to see , I am used to just seeing links to photos or webpages and all . <p> None of the sounds referred to in Pauls post today are anything I would want to experience live or recorded . They are not permitted in my house and if I 'm somewhere in earshot of it elsewhere , I leave until the noise stops.or I just leave and do n't  go back . <p> But there are things worth listening to live , unamplified , and are of great beauty at least to me . I 've heard the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie hall as well as many great artists like Jascha Heifetz and Andre Segovia . I 've heard great operas at the New York Metropolitan Opera and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venues including large churches and cathedrals . These sounds are so pleasing to me that they are worth trying to duplicate from recordings . <p> The admission of abject failure by those honest enough in this industry and among hobbyists is a fact . The best they can reproduce is a pale and easily distinguishable ghost of the real experience . Still it can be very enjoyable to them . Those who wont admit it are either inexperienced or lying . Those who say it ca n't be done at all are trying to rationalize failure . Then the question arises why bother trying at ever spiraling cost ? Audiophiles keep " trading up " hoping for a magic silver bullet that never comes . Their newest toy that is supposed to fix everything soon bores them and they begin to look for the next magic silver bullet . That makes them ripe pickings for people who sell fake magic silver bullets . <p> What is the difference between a 1960 Zenith stereo console and the equipment in PS Audios music room 1 or virtually 99.9999% of all the other audiophile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts are identical . What is the difference between a 1974 quadraphonic sound system and the newest and best 5.1 channel sound system . Other than adding a monaural center speaker for dialog when it is used for watching a movie and a sub woofer again its only the execution that 's different , the concepts are identical . <p> It should therefore be evident that the root problem is not the equipment but the concept . It ca n't be made to work . It just is n't good enough and no amount of improvement of the equipment will change that . Is this true ? Just go back a few years in these postings when Paul came back from New York City where he heard the Metropolitan Opera and then listened to his best sound system when he got back home to Colorado . " Curses , canned music . " The best efforts of some of the best people in the industry resulted in no more than canned music . Their colleagues and counterparts elsewhere can do no better . <p> In 1974 after a great disappointment in experimenting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently worked on it using all of the technical knowledge I had . At that time it was considerable having only recently successfully completed as tough a science and engineering course of study as you could find anywhere . Then a few days later like a bolt from the blue my subconscious mind handed the answer to my conscious mind . It was one of the most startling and memorable experiences of my life . It also changed my entire perspective . Among the problem with building a machine that addressed the problem with scientific accuracy was not only the enormous cost ( far more than even the most ambitious home audio system ) but the complexity was and still would be a nightmare . The only other scheme I know of that successfully addresses the technical criteria has the same problem . Sound systems of this type if they are ever built will not be used for entertainment but for scientific study of acoustics , psychoacoustics , and architectural acoustics . <p> Nevertheless , I was determined to see what I could do to improve what was possible by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expected little or nothing to come of it . In short I expected to fail . But to my surprise I did n't  . Although not accurate in a scientific sense it creates the qualities of sound that are missing entirely from other ideas . And it is highly adjustable in many ways . I learned a lot from it , experimenting with it , thinking about it , wondering why I was able to solve it when no one else seemed to be able to , and what it all meant . To test whether or not this was a significant discovery or just an audiophile tweak I sought out willing test subjects who had little or no experience or interest in live or recorded music . Such people do exist <p> I 've played with it for over forty years having built only two prototypes . There is no commercial interest or possibilities for it . The patent on this variant was all but worthless as there was no interest in it . The science and math behind it remain rock solid as far as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with very few people . Paul was one of them . I wish I had captured the look on his face when he first heard it . It was clear he heard something he was n't expecting . It is very different from what other sound systems including my own other sound systems sound like . One thing I learned was that with existing recording technology where nothing about the acoustics of the space recordings are made in are in the recording , there is no such thing as accuracy as every seat in every place has its own unique sound . But these missing qualities are adjustable in many ways even in this primitive prototype . One thing it is not is canned music . I admit that there is still much about it that I do n't  know or understand . <p> A few weekends ago my wife and I flew up to Boston to visit family and enjoy Anne-Sophie Mutters performance of Tchaikovskys Violin Concerto , with the Boston Symphony playing in Symphony Hall ( said to be one of the top three concert halls in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my CD with Mutters performance of the same concerto , it definitely sounded " good " ( yes , I do have a very nice music audio system and listening room ) , but just came up short of the sound and experience of enjoying the same " live " . <p> The cats out of the bag . Once hooked on really good audio its never going back . Audio has reached a stage that there will always be die-hard audiophiles and audiophiles in general do n't  care who thinks what of them . As far as audio is concerned naysayers do not exist . Audiophiles are different from the rest because they not only like music they have to have it sound as close as possible to the real thing and technology is making that possible . So with so many things in their favour there is nothing to worry about . Relax and enjoy . After all every one is not gifted with this ability . Regards . <p> I believe Paul quoted Herb to make the point that there are certain things recorded music is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats ( 1/3 from right side ) at an orchestra concert last season that had us looking straight at the double bass section . Bummer ? No . Studying their techniques , how they shifted on their stools ( the same pattern every time , but different for each musician ) , how facial muscles tightened ( always to the sides of the mouth only ) and watching as they dug in with their bows ( if several strands of gut broke , playing was adjusted almost imperceptibly to maintain their contribution to the Philadelphia sound ) . I am indebted to those musicians who will enhance my home listening forevermore . <p> In one concert the accompanying piano soloist played notes that seemed to roll out of the bottom of the instrument ( we were in row M ) . At another concert a different pianist played notes that seemed disembodied from the piano , emanating from about 4 feet above the instrument ( same seats ) . At my seat this was not subtle ! As audiophiles , we want our system to help us hear everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accessories , or moving my Magneplanars a few inches this way or that . <p> Pauls favorite seat is in front of the double basses . Mine is much further back in the center so I can hear the hall as well as the instruments . Leo Beraneks favorite seat in Boston Symphony Hall was in the first row of the balcony at the center . When I go there , that 's where I want to sit . <p> Its interesting that the loudness level hardly changes at all when you go from the front of the hall to the back . This is one more proof that most of what you hear at a live concert is due to reflections . Its usually 90% or more even in the rows up close to the performers . This is what is missing almost entirely from all stereo recordings and what little is captured is not correctly reproduced at all . This is why there is no sense of envelopment including from 5.1 and binaural sound played through headphones . This is also why except for binaural sound recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also always wrong compared to live music . Making what you have louder does n't  compensate for what is missing because it is qualitatively very different . <p> Soundmind , you reminded me of something long forgotten . The most enjoyable seats I ever had in Avery Fisher Hall ( I know they slapped a new name on it , but we audiophiles know who paid to rebuilt the interior hall ! ) were all the way at the top , front row , right side . I was so close to the ceiling I could almost jump up and touch it . I was amazed at how balanced and dynamic the sound was . Instead of wishing I was at Carnegie Hall or The Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena , I could just enjoy the music immensely . <p> Avery Fisher Hall , originally called Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts was an acoustic disaster from the day it was build . So many people donated so much money to repair it that many people started calling in philanthropic hall . To this day after many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly regarded by acousticians . I think if you look at Leo Beraneks paper on comparing 58 concert halls around the world it has made the list of the lowest rated group probably included only because it is so well known . <p> Beranek himself was the original acoustic consultant . He had sharp conflicts with those who controlled the money and details of the design . Eventually he was fired . As this was supposed to be the premiere concert hall in the United States , the results were a bitter disappointment . As concert halls go , it is not a particularly good one . <p> Carnegie Hall was once a much better hall acoustically a very long time ago . It changed drastically for the worse when the New York City Fire Department told the managers to remove the oil base paint and replace it with latex base paint . The softer reflecting surfaces compromised the acoustics badly . <p> The wood wainscot on the stage of Boston Symphony Hall does not seem to have very drastically compromised its acoustics . Wood is a poor choice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 2 1/2 inches thick according to Beranek . Evidently there is n't enough of it there to matter much . Boston Symphony Hall is considered by many expert acousticians as the best room for listening to music in the United States and one of the two or three best in the world . Von Karajan preferred it to the also top rated hall Grossesalle Musikverein in Vienna Austria because of its slightly shorter RT at mid frequencies , 1.8 seconds versus 2.0 seconds . This allowed him to conduct at a slightly faster tempo . <p> Yes , the front row at Geffen Hall is over 50% reflected sound , which is why I hate it . Carnegie Hall is good for the music written for it , Romantic and Neo-Romantic , but it lacks articulation . I refuse to go for Chamber Music , except for art song . <p> Most recordings are also swimming in reverb . Microphones do n't  have the ability to separate the direct sound from the reflections like ear , and should be much closer to the stage . The nuances of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberations . <p> A few years ago Paul said he was going to acquire something hed wanted for a very long time , a pair of Infinity IRSs . It must have been an enormous project to acquire and restore them . He rebuilt his best sound room around them . All of the critical decisions he made on all of his products ever since had to pass the IRS test . I thought hed never part with them he s spoken so glowingly about them . But awhile back he said he wanted to trade for something I think does n't  exist yet . I 'd like to know why . What does the IRS do wrong enough that hed even consider trading them away ? <p> Genesis was started by Paul and arnie and now owned by a gary . During that time they were evolving the genesis line array . Owning a complelty redone set of them and having heard many ultra highend systems I doubt there is better in the true sense of the word . It comes down to a different playing field . Assside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be bettered by some standards is speed and a bit more top end . While this is subjective it is what I what was looking for . I considered the new g1.2 to replace them . PAUL seems to feel they are too Brite again its pure objectivism at this level . PAUL has spoke of what arnie has now and does feel they are lol better . I wish PAUL would share some info on arnies speakers a pic as well . <p> None of our stuff even the the best in the world stuff can reproduce real music . Maybe its the recording process or speakers . Maybe its both but even with my IRS v. I have had a simple guitar play some tunes . It all is great till real is infront of you and our stuff becomes pail . Just a simple guitar is so complex in front you that I can not hear each note or all of its over tones . Yet in recordings my best stuff I can . Maybe its my brain being to slow but I think its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ona real level . This is my view and others may feel different . <p> Now on the topic of reviews I love reading them but know while some or even most points is truthful I never put my beliefs behind it . I can not there is one purpose behind all reviews and its sell products . But I do n't  mean to insult any of those who do them . But I do know a few who do reviews and the term find something good applies lol . But finding good and being good are very much not the same thing . <p> To me , the defining characteristic of live music is the liveness . All the players together on a stage conversing simultaneously , playing a set from beginning to end in front of an audience with total abandon , no do-overs or second thoughts . <p> Since I ONLY listen to live music and live recordings , I now can hear the INTENTION to splice and overdub . If the musicians know they can fix it , their attitude is different and it is audibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overdubbing means it is a one-way conversation . Studios are great for experimentation and composition , but they no longer capture my interest . <p> All of my favorite records are live , or at least live in the studio . It does n't  matter if its the London Symphony , Harry Belafonte in Carnegie , Allmans or Humble Pie at the Fillmore , Chic , The Carpenters or Cheap Trick in Budokan . I also prefer Miles " Live Evil " to " Bitchs Brew " , Jazz thrives on live . <p> Peer reviewed research shows that everybody prefers live performance to studio . I also cite producer Jim Dickenson , who said : " A pop band tries to make the live act sound like the record , but a REAL band tried to make the record sound like the live act . " The search for " perfect " recording has led us further from the music . If perfect was superior , computers would play better than humans . 
@@23909566 @3909566/ <h> Cartridge damping <p> In yesterdays post about amplifier dampingwe covered what it meant and what happens when a power amplifier loses control of the loudspeaker you get differences in amplitude that are anything but accurate . <p> There is another type of damping that I reminded of : cartridge damping . Phono cartridges have a problem similar ( and for the same reason ) to the loudspeaker damping issue but in reverse . A loudspeaker is a coil of wire driven by an amplifier while a phono cartridge is a coil of wire driving an amplifier . <p> So in a power amplifier situation we want the amplifier to have a low output impedance so that whatever changes happen in the loudspeaker coil do n't  affect the output of the amp . In a phono cartridge setup we want the opposite the amplifier to have a high enough input impedance so it does n't  affect what the coil of the cartridge is doing . <p> A phono cartridge generates electricity in response to the movement of the needle in the record groove . This occurs because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close proximity to a coil of wire . In the case of a moving magnet cartridge , the magnet is affixed to the needle and the coils are held steady in the cartridge while the magnet moves about . In the case of a moving coil cartridge the opposite is true the coil of wire is affixed to the needle and the magnets are held steady by the head shell . <p> In either example it is then necessary to tame the impedance of the coil of wire in the cartridge either by adding a fixed resistor and capacitor across the coil or simply a fixed resistor . This process is called cartridge loading but more properly cartridge damping . <p> Phono cartridges act like any coil of wire producing a voltage differently per frequency . What we want is a constant output at any frequency so we damp the cartridge with resistors and capacitors . You 're probably familiar with the cartridge loading switches on the back of phono preamps like our GCPH . <p> Now you know . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 2 COMMENTS <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most famous examples of it , the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge .

@@23909568 @3909568/ <h> NAS , the heart of streaming <p> For those interested in the results of yesterdays package unwrapping , Henrys fart gun was a bust . I 've agreed to return it , much to both our disappointments . It does n't  actually do what its name implies . Instead , its a difficult to use gun that puts out a puff of air if you pull back on the rubber stopper " far too difficult- for a 3 year old . Worse , it makes no obnoxious sound . Disappointing to both the 3 year old it was intended for and the 67 year old who bought it for him . <p> Nothing upsets us- more than expecting one thing and getting something else . Like expecting Plug N Play ( UPnP ) to perform as its name implies . It may work for printers and other simple devices , but not when it comes to a DLNA music system . <p> I had- detailed how a NAS is a hard drive with an internal computer built in . It is accessed over a home network through ethernet cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty simple setup . <p> Computers can do nothing without a program to instruct them . Like a car needing a driver to steer it , the complex mechanisms inside computers are powerful tools in need of direction. - When we read that a NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) is DLNA " ready " , it means nothing more than a DLNA server program has been installed and configured to control the NAS . The internal computer does the work , but this DLNA server program tells it what to do . <p> One DLNA server program dominates the NAS landscape. - Twonky . Twonky has been around for a very long time . It was founded by a company called PacketVideo who started business in 1998 out of California . Twonky is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Japans largest mobile phone provider , NTT DoCoMo- . <p> Twonky performs as well as its name suggests . Not well . But , it is stable , low cost , handles most media ( not DSD ) and pretty much is what you 're going to be stuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Synology and QNAP , have their own version of DLNA server that outperforms Twonky I am guessing- hoping that trend will continue . There 's also one available for easy install , by Synology NAS owners , as well as Windows and Mac owners as well " for those not owning a NAS " that is preferred by Audiophiles and is free . Its called Minimserver . <p> So , what does this all important program do ? <p> Let 's first review the three critical elements in a DLNA music system : server , controller , renderer ( player ) . <p> The server , in this case Twonky , can do the following tasks ( among other things ) : <p> Tells other devices on the network what the NAS is , what it is capable of doing and playing , and what it has stored on it <p> Reads the stored contents and delivers a list- when asked to <p> Connects the player to a specific memory location on the hard drive where music is <p> Tomorrow well look at the controller . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reasonably easy to install on almost any Synology NAS do n't  know about other servers , but I believe Minim is supported on QNAP , is robust , regularly updated , and its developer offers excellent support . It is also used by quite a few DS/Bridge owners , as evidenced in the forums . I plan to try Asset UPnP at some point , but MS works well for me . Like many DLNA environments , I still find the controller , not the server , the weak point . Ah well <p> Whether or not a user can install a different server ( other than Twonky or whatever ships with the NAS ) depends on a ) whether the servers operating system allows users to install additional apps and b ) whether the maker of the server has built a version for the NAS in question . MinimServer , for instance , is available for several brands of NAS but Asset only supports QNAP despite requests to support other brands ( why , I do n't  know ) . <p> The ability to install other software and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to go beyond the typical artist/album/track listing format that all servers support . This generally means serious classical listeners and some jazz aficionados . For them , the ability to use different servers should be a consideration when choosing a NAS . One example : Synology supplies a server , called Audio Station , and a control point to go with it . Its fine for pop music . But it can not be customized in the ways that classical music requires . MinimServer stands out for its customizability and its flexibility at displaying tags . <p> The guy that did the original design for plug and play was a new computer science graduate that had way too little experience for the task he did unassisted and unreviewed . After 6 months he presented his ideas and shortly after that it got the name " Plug and Pray " . It had a terrible design for power management levels in particular .

@@23909569 @3909569/ <p> I have been testing my setup with both a preamp ( with PWDs volume level on 100% ) and using PWD as a preamp to directly drive my power amp ( PASS Labs XA 30.5 ) . The sound is significantly different . As a preamp I am using- heavily modified PAS Labs- X2.5 ( external powersupply , output stage- completely tubed ) . I have also tested some other preamps too . <p> In the case of a- preamp usage the soundstage gets a depth boost clearly- when compared to the PWDs preamp functionality in- which the sound stage feels like 2D- very clearly ( is this due to the reason that digital volume control is not bit-perfect at levels other than 100% ? ) . The- space between the instruments increase by a significant margin too ( maybe this is due to the fact that the instruments lose focus in the case of the preamp and sound somehow reverberant ) <p> In the case of direct connection between PWD and poweramp the transparency is on a higher level , this is the only advantage I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marginally higher resolution file However the 2D soundstage was obvious . <p> Regarding the 3D effect I feel when using an external preamp , is this the coloration of the preamp or not ? I know that most editors even think that preamp adds to the sound to justify its existence however I can not get quite sure about it . As I can not 100% be sure about how the original recording was when recording I cant say that precisely that either the preamp or the PWD plays more correct or not However my logic states that if the digital volume control is not the effect of that 2D perception than PWDs sounding is more correct and the preamp in charge is adding significant colorations to justify its existence and cost .

Is this statement true ? What are Ur opinions ? <p> Hi- @alpyoruk , your observations are fairly consistent with what myself and many others have found when comparing the preamp functionality of the PWD to a good preamp. - Personally I use the Coincident Statement line stage . - It is marginally less transparent than DAC direct , but there is improved depth and 3D effect as you say . - The frequency balance is more pleasing as well , with less treble emphasis , and fuller bass . - Some people have heard my system and prefer the slightly drier , more transparent sound of DAC direct . - I guess it depends on the person , the music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not restrict dynamic range when the volume is above 45 for redbook , or about 60 for 24-bit material . - However , in practice , I can hear the loss of 3D soundstaging even just engaging the digital volume control from 100 to 99. - <p> The principle of going DAC direct and cutting out a preamp is sound and makes theoretical sense . - Unfortunately , in practice , it is still not as good as a using a good preamp IMHO. - Opinions will vary though. - <p> The following users say thank you to stereophilus for this useful post : <p> Thanks @stereophilus- Was of great help to hear someone else who has experienced a similar case . <p> So can we sumup and say that the digital volume causes , as U stated , the loss of 3D effect of the sound tough it is more transparent due to shorter sound path ? <p> So all that active circuitry , the preamps transformers effect , the extra interconnect and power cable still sounds more inviting and pleasent . <p> Still with lots of recordings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instruments more faithfully .

Thanks alot before hand , <p> @alpyoruk I understand your desire for information but you are asking for sweeping generalizations that may not have a concrete or useful answer . - Almost any component added to a system will color the sound in some way ( hows that for a sweeping gen ? ) so if purity is what you 're after then go straight into the amp . Just do yourself a favor and make sure that you are enjoying your chosen path . Do n't  let the quest for a theoretical ideal lead you to a point where- you do n't  like the result . Trust your ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you PS Expert level : ) ) <p> My question is especially related with pre amps . I do lots of tests regarding components tests including cables , plugs , spikes , components and etc What I would like to do is that I do n't  want end up building a system which colors much the original recording data available on the CD so I do prefer the smallest signal path at all , actually this is one- reason why I purchased PWD DAC MK2 at first hand to get rid of a longer sound chain including the preamp ( assuming it is an out of date component for ones WHO are looking for faithfullness to the data on my source ) . <p> Do n't  get me wrong me and my girl friend both prefer the sound with the preamp : ) ) but I suspect its faithfullness , ask Audio Research and they will always tell that a preamp is necessary cause they make good Money out of it . I listened the REF 5s and everything was more dramatic with that pre however faithfullness . <p> Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my system , the sound deviates from what I hear when I am listening through Stax headphone tube amps and 7 series Stax Electrostatic headphones which I think would much more represent the data on the source much better than a hi-fi system due to the fact that its drivers mass and electrostatic structure is much more faster and would much mofre faithfully reproduce what is available on my redbooks , and HD media stuff ( please correct me if I am wrong at all , do n't  get me wrong just trying to benefit from U experienced people whom I respect a lot in this forum and have the chance to discuss things ) . <p> Without the pre , the sound from my system is much more like the one in Stax actually very like .

Do we just let go the loaylty part and stick to our subjective satisfactions or should we have more objective criterias ? Thanks alot before hand , <p> Its a really good question and as our newly anointed PS Expert added , a tough one to make broad generalizations about . <p> There are many that believe a preamp always makes for better sound , with instruments sounding more like their personas , voices sounding more natural and so on . - I have heard these comparisons and on many systems they are indeed correct in their assessments they do sound better with the preamp in the mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . - Most I know that believe preamps add to the overall musicality of the system seem to have a tube preamp. - I have a tube preamp. - <p> But then there is the other side to this Gordion knot . - The DAC , straight into the power amp has an openness and aliveness to the sound that is uncanny and unmatched when going through the preamp. - It sounds closer to the source , yet I am not always convinced it sounds as musically accurate . - Yet I vacillate. - Just a few days ago I swapped out of the preamp and enjoyed an entirely new approach to the music I had n't  enjoyed before . <p> I know this rambling is n't much help but the bottom line still remains : we must make our own decision based on our own listening patterns and system choices . <p> As I mentioned earlier , whenever I travel to show off DirectStream I never use a preamp. - I know that displaying the differences in what people are used to hearing through a DAC are amplified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I spend the time to travel somewhere to show off our products I want them in the best light . - And if that meant a preamp , so be it . <p> But in my main listening room there is a preamp and I have the same goal . - Go figure. - <p> The following users say thank you to Paul McGowan for this useful post :

I 'm just not going there . <p> We 've spent a lot of space in this column exploring the history of moving-coil loudspeakers from their creation by Jensen through their development at Bell Labs/Western Electric , the development of the acoustic suspension enclosure and dome drivers at AR , with detours through Weathers , Stan White , and Spica . We 've also looked at electrostatic speakers from Quad and Acoustat , and those funky plasma drivers . It 's only fair that we take a look at horns through the yearsand that will require revisiting Western Electric and its offspring . <p> Writing about the history of any field is a feat of genealogy in which family branches mysteriously break off , enlivened with a sprinkling of illegitimate offspring . Audio is like this , only ever so much so more so . Paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again . <p> In order to understand horn loudspeakers , a little knowledge of their antecedents may be helpful . Going way back , the first horns used for sounding or making noiseI would hesitate to call them musical instrumentswere formed from animal horns . The - " trumpets " mentioned in the Torah , the Old Testament , and the Quran were not the brass , valved instruments of modern times , but likely a shofar or something similar . - Generally made from a rams horn , a - shofar is more like a bugle , really , as it is valveless and the players embouchure is the only control of the horns pitch . <p> The word " bugle " , interestingly enough , is derived from " buculus " , which is Latin for a castrated bullockso the origins of bugles are clear . Like a bugle , a shofar has a conical bore , meaning that the inner sound-chamber is shaped like a cone , whereas flutes and trumpets ( among others ) have a cylindrical bore . <p> The first horns most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore : megaphones , including the rolled-up-paper versions often made in grade school . And of course horns can be used both waysthe hearing horn dating back t0 who-knows-when was essentially a megaphone in reverse . <p> The seventeenth century saw a number of polymaths appear in the worlds of science and engineering , and two in particular focused their attention on horns : Athanasius Kircher was a German Jesuit scholar who seemed to have studied almost everything , including microbes under a microscope . Kircher supposedly built " speaking trumpets " and proposed the use of room-sized horns to amplify the sound of musiciansalthough its not known if such giant horns were ever built . <p> The " speaking trumpet " , shown in a drawing supposedly made by Athanasius Kircher . <p> A proposal by Kircher for use of a horn to " broadcast " the sound of musicians playing . <p> Kirchers English counterpart was Sir Samuel Morland , who created a series of large speaking horns used by church choirs or orchestras . One such horn , known as the " Harrington Vamping Horn " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be fully five feet in length , and still exists at its original church . Two other examples were said to be five and a half and six feet in length . - Morland also worked in hydraulics and developed mechanical calculators and cryptographic machines . <p> A similar tin horn , possibly not made by Morland , is still on display at East Leake church in Nottinghampshire . Eight feet long , it is clearly not of conical section , but is roughly exponential . It was supposedly in use by the church choir until 1855 . <p> In the eighteenth century , theoretical work by Lagrange , Bernoulli , and Euler described the propagation of sound waves through horns , but contributed little to the development of practical devices . The nineteenth and early twentieth century saw conical megaphones used to amplify voices in public gatherings and in the military ; such devices were usually of simple conical section.The term " megaphone " apparently was first associated with a device created by Thomas Edison around 1878 .

In my setup adding some diffusion on the wall at the first reflection point was a revelation <p> Totally agree on this one , I truly believe in form and function if done even remotely right ! I was totally stumped what " chachkies " was however until I discovered it is a website where you can buy products such as you propose filling a room with ! <p> The Wife Acceptance Factor or WAF is a well known problem for audiophiles . You have to face facts , most people do not live in homes so large as to afford separate dedicated music rooms . The best choice from the standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually a living room . But that room is usually used for entertaining guests including your wifes . Frankly , modern high end audio systems make such a room resemble an electronics laboratory , not a pleasant thing to look at . Gone are the days when aesthetics were an integral part of audio equipment design where both equipment cabinets and speaker cabinets were built to look like fine furniture . <p> WAF aside , rooms in peoples homes are often not well suited for audio equipment . Among the most difficult is the L shaped living room/dining room because of its non-symmetry . This was typical of many ranch style homes , apartments and condominiums . Houses in the US are typically built with 1/2 ? sheetrock nailed on 2 ? x 4 ? pine studes 16 ? apart . These walls can absorb a lot of bass energy . Basements if you have them and finish them are sometimes built with thin wood paneling instead of even sheetrock . Ceilings are low but the space can be large . Sound often passes right through walls , ceilings above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and if your house is attached or you live in an apartment house you can easily annoy your neighbors . Another problem is large open archways between room . <p> These are just some of the problems facing audiophiles trying to get the best out of their very expensive sound systems . Most homes designed for the overwhelming majority of people in the middle class are not designed with audiophiles in mind . These limitations make it even more imperative that audio systems be designed to adapt to the room and not the other way around . This takes real science and engineering skill . It also requires careful system planning and calibration of the installed system including the use of " equalizers . " What audio manufacturers do is NOT engineering , it is design which is different . It is based on an already established formula or some intuitive idea that is tweaked but the recipe is hardly innovative even when carried to ridiculous extremes . And it is not even system design , it is design of equipment as stand alone elements . Even there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home as they do even in a dealers showroom . Expensive as all hell , the entry level cost for a high end audio system is at least $10,000 . Is this good value for money ? That depends on what your expectations are . As with many things , incremental improvement costs increasingly more proportionally as the curve begins to rise steeply . For most non audiophiles , that curve is at its optimum at around somewhere between $1000 and $2000 dollars . You can stretch your money by selecting high quality used equipment . These are the discarded equipment high end audiophiles once prized and now would n't take a second look at . <p> You pretty much describe my system to a " T " . I 'm in a 1920 Craftsman bungalow . Its an " L " space because there 's a dining room off to one side of the living room I have the sound system in . But instead of wall-board , my walls are lathe and plaster . <p> There is no space for a dedicated sound room and even if there was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in the living room because this is where I live . My " room treatments " are the furniture , curtains and rugs in the room . When I measure out the room , there 's a nasty " suck-out " at about 120 hz . Other than that , its actually pretty decent and something DSP copes with quite well and EQs flat down to about 15 hz . <p> The one thing I 'll disagree with you heartily on is that a high-end system does n't  have to start at $10,000 . My own rig comes in at around $8,500 . I run Linkwitz Orions which are a DIY system I 've had more than one visitor call " reference quality " . I had my cabinets custom built for me in a Mission style to go with the house . With the cost of the cabinets , drivers , active crossover AND a used 12 channel B&amp;K AV1260 60 wpc power amp to drive it , the total cost of all that was only $5,000 . Add in a VTA SP13 tube preamp at $1500 , an ancient Linn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $300 , Tascam CD player $300 and Linux based laptop $200 , total current system cost comes in at about $8,400 . <p> Key to all of this of course is the Linkwitz system . The current Linkwitz hi-end design is the LX521 which has a driver complement that is about $1000 less than the Orions and you could readily build that system , with amplification , for about $4000 . His LXmini design which images just as well as the LX521 , can come in at $1100 with amplification . Does it qualify as " hi-end " . Actually it does and would truly shock you were you to hear it . It likes to have a good sub to go with it and Linkwitz has a solution for that as well , but the point here is that $10,000 is NOT entry level for true hi-end . <p> Mid-fi is a derogatory term invented by audiophiles to insult people who bought or sell expensive audio equipment they do n't  likeor wish they could own but cant possibly afford . <p> Lo-fi is a derogatory term invented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution , and had to invent his own systems because there was nothing on the market that came close to addressing what he wanted and felt he needed . Therefore from his point of view there are only two kinds of systems , his systems and Lo-fi systems . ( : rofl : ) <p> Many years ago this same engineer moved a rug from his dining room into his sound room two covering a linoleum floor . It took him two days to get the system back to sounding where it was before the rug . Until that point it became a Lo-fi system . <p> So far the Bose system in my new ( used ) car strikes me as Lo-fi . Its okay but nothing to write home about . I still havent explored if there is anything I can do to get it up to mid-fi . The JBL system in my other car is definitely Lo-fi too . I did n't  buy either car for its sound system . I 'm not big on car stereos . <p> Ive been at this audio game since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows and have seen and heard many , many price-no-object systems . Ive run horn systems , Maggies , Falcon Acoustics DIY gear , full-range curved diaphram electrostatics , as well as my current Linkwitz Orions . I 've used both solid state and tube gear . <p> I recently set my ancient LP12 up against a Well-Tempered Reference table and was surprised at how well it stood up to the WTT . <p> And my ear is the only one that actually counts for me . But you go ahead and drop the Big Bucks . Its a free country and you 're free to needlessly drop that loot and I 'm free not to . <p> You misunderstood me . I 've got nothing against your equipment or opinion in this matter . Just a general remark/question . What do we call " hi-end " . Where do we draw the line . For one $3000 is hi-end , for another $30.000 . So for you AND me your set can be hi-end , for my uncle maybe not if he owns a $50.000 set . And to focus a little on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with good acoustics sounds better than a $30.000 system in a room with bad acoustics . And for me also my ear is the only one that actually counts for me . I 've said that many times already . I do n't  spend a lot of money if it does n't  sound better . Besides , I 'm not rich . Correction , I 'm rich because Im healthy . ( : yes : ) <p> Spot on what you said . Its all about the intent , not so much about money . For example one of my acquaintances has a small budget , be is a true audiophile ; someone who wants to hear music in his room as beautiful as possible within his budget . The most expensive part of his system he ever bought was last year a $2000 Cyrus power amp . Took him a few years saving the money .

The only thing I changed for better sound was removing my coffee table in front of the speakers because of the unwanted reflections that gave the sound a sharp edge . Another major advantage is that where I sit in the middle of the room there is no wall right behind my head ( its 12 feet away ) , so no unwanted reflections there either . Oh , and I call my big speaker bookcase . Sounds better . : -D <p> A very good point about the coffee table .

It took considerable skill on my part to put the kabosh on that item and I sure am glad I did . In the end the sound in this room worked out for me and the giant stuffed couches and rug on the floor with lots of curtains worked out well . If someone ever asks me about stereo I think where are you going to put it is the first question to ask . <p> All my money went into speakers in the main living area and then I opted for a high end AV receiver to make living on shelves and in cabinets much easier !

To make it digital compatible I have had to add DACs and end points and all sorts of associated tweaks .

So much for my first audio pondering of the year . <p> We had an interior designer come to our home . Everything was fine , until she assessed the basement where my stereo is located .

I got a strong impression that the folks with the larger quotes simply werent comfortable with the job and wanted to be sure they had covered themselves ( or at least a certain part of their anatomies ) . <p> I finally got it done for a moderate cost and the effect was more than I 'd expected . Not only was the echo gone , but the sound in general really worked better . The installer , by the way , at the end of the job said " Now if you ever want to take this down , do n't  call me !

@@23909580 @3909580/ <h> Short or long ? <p> Theres talk again on the forums about long vs. short connecting cables. - Its an age old question , like the chicken and egg . <p> Long interconnects and short speaker cables ? Perhaps the opposite . Arguments in both directions abound . <p> For years I remained in the long speaker cable , short interconnect camp . It was logical and made great engineering sense to me . After all , at the end of the day I am an engineer first , an audio nutjob second ( though many would argue the point ) . <p> Power amplifiers have far better ability to drive complex loads than a preamp or DAC . End of story . Only , for some reason I have to admit I might have been wrong . No , let me correct that . I was wrong , but I do n't  understand why . <p> It would n't be the first time , its certainly not going to be the last . <p> Starting with tomorrows post I thought wed open up one of those long winded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of you love and others hate ? <p> Onward into the blackness of the cable morass. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 <p> 1 ) The speaker cable is connected to the power amp input through the NFB circuit . This makes it an antenna for inducing RFI . I put a 100pF Silver Mica cap across the speaker output as well as the power amp positive input . RFI pickup in the amp circuit is controlled by reducing the total circuit length of all conductors between input and output terminals to 1.5 ? . <p> 2 ) The characteristic impedance of speaker wire is typically 100 Ohms , it is never matched to speaker or amp output impedance unless you have an OTL and a speaker over 35 Ohms ( the minimum practical wire impedance ) . This means the signal will reflect on both ends , causing time smearing echoes . Herve Deletraz documented this in a rare engineering article in Stereophile . You can see it on a scope , which means it is quite audible . <p> A simple answer is current draw power amplifiers Achilles Heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like crossovers happy , which stress the voltage rails abilities to not be modulated it all compounds , so adding long lengths of speaker cable will only add to the mix : keep them short , to remove as much as possible the complications from them being part of the circuit . <p> Good argument for active speakers , very short speaker cables and only a voice coil to drive . But yes I admit every solution has its own compromises , hopefully smaller than the problem that is trying to be solved . <p> If the interface between amp , pre , and/or DAC is balanced then make those interconnects long if needed . If they are single ended keep them as short as possible . <p> Balanced cabling is regularly run 100 200 ft at every concert that has an analog mixing console . The microphone signals are usually split on stage and sent to the Front of House for mixing of the house sound . Mic signals are much weaker than the line level between stereo components but yet the signal travels the distance just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable runs due to the reduced susceptibility to external noise . <p> I run a set of Linkwitz Orions , which is a multi-amplified design . There are four channels of 60 wpc on each side . Because of furniture that the system has to co-exist with , locating the power amp between the speakers just is n't possible . So I have to run eight 25 foot lengths of speaker cable . I am not a wealthy man unlike most of yall here ( heh ) , so went with 14 gauge zip cord from Parts-Express . Zip cord is what Linkwitz uses in his own system . Can you imagine what it would cost for eight 25 foot cables from any of the specialty lines beyond zip cord ? <p> Still proof is in the pudding . Most everyone who 's ever heard my system has left with envy . <p> Try using one channel at time with 2 identical stereo amplifiers , regardless its power or volume setting ; you will hear an increased separation and more relaxed stereophonic effect including improvement of the stereo image focus , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one stereo amp in the usual mode , and you will hear the big difference . Mono amplifiers have no crosstalk problems . <p> I prefer to have a longer balanced interconnect between my preamp and monoblocks . This is followed by a shorter run of speaker cable to each speaker . I do not have any technical reason for doing this but it sounds better to me and fits in my system layout better . <p> A word on being wrong . A wise man once told me that when you stop learning you die . So logically we could say if you are never wrong you miss the opportunity to learn something new . Enjoy being wrong because that gives you the chance to learn and live ! <p> For example , if using monoblocks , one amp would be 1m from my pre , one more like 2.5m ; is it important to use a pair of 2.5m interconnects ? If using a stereo amp instead , should both runs of speakers wire be 3m long ? <p> First of all I missed yesterdays post why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how addicts must feel when they miss their daily dose . Regarding todays post I have always been in the short interconnects and long speaker cables camp . Not that I knew of such camps . The reason was simple . Minuscule signals would do best if the signal path was as short as possible before they reached the first amplification stage i.e the preamp . Less distortion . Longer interconnects may in some cases sound better because of the added distortion but that is certainly not being true to the source . This is my reasoning . Looking forward to tomorrows post . Very interesting topic . Regards . 
@@23909584 @3909584/ <h> The rest of the story <p> In yesterdays post- I showed you a picture of the home theater rack and described the two P10 Power Plants and the two Emotiva multi-channel power amps driving the system . Today let 's continue filling in the blanks . The main processor for the system is the surprisingly affordable and spectacularly good Marantz AV8802 Prepro. - The new 8802 has fully balanced outputs , discrete electronics for each of its 11 channels of audio and really good processing . Its a great match for the Emotiva amps and was recommended to me by their designer , Dan Laufman . Dans got an ear for such things and his recommendation is spot on . <p> Of course I went with the Oppo 103D BluRay player , there really are n't  any better choices I would consider . This is a great player and it too is affordable . I do n't  have that many BluRays , and only a handful of DVDs to play , so the Oppo does n't  get too much use . One of the first BluRays I purchased was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence , before they land on Pandora , the shot of the spaceship with the planet reflected in its solar panels is nothing short of breathtaking . I do not run the BluRay through the Marantz video processor . At the insistence of my designer , Robert Dreher , the HDMI output of the Oppo is fed directly into the projector , a JVC- DLA X700R 4K . The JVC has two HDMI inputs and the URC wireless remote control system we installed automatically selects the appropriate inputs . We went with the JVC for its stunning black levels and picture quality . And it was a great decision . <p> Most of my sources , however , are not so spectacular . Over the years I 've amassed a nice collection of ripped DVD movies that populate my hard drives . Playing them back has always been a challenge , not so much the playing of them but the equipment to select them and make it easy . One of the promises I made to Terri when the theater was installed was how easy it would be to operate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple remote controls . How then to view and stream movies easily ? <p> Thats tomorrows subject . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 30 COMMENTS <p> " How then to view and stream movies easily ? " that 's easy ! Run a PLEX media server off a NAS where you keep all your videos and have a Mac mini render the content feeding the video and audio to the Marantz SSP . Plex will give you true 24p support and a user interface on par with Kaleidescape for the fraction of the price . <p> Its basically a media player application which during the years they divided into two parts to ease / accommodate different installation needs . There 's a server part to it , which browses through your libraries , be it movies , tv shows , etc. pulls relevant data like artwork , IMDB rating , cast , plot and pushes this information to the PLEX player software which is available for Mac , Windows , Linux , Android and iOS . On one of these platforms , or as the server actually supports multiple clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch all your stored content . <p> PLEX has really neat features : it remembers the time where you left off , so if you 're too loud in your new HT , you just switch to the iPad and continue from the exact same moment , it support DTS-HD and TrueHD , as mentioned before is multi platform and most importantly it supports 24p playback ( a must for all HTs ) , which none of the Apple TV , ROKU , Fire Tv bunch of players do ! <p> Thanks ! I would need to get a different newer Mac Mini then for this task which is something I might actually consider at some point . In tomorrows post you 'll see what I am doing and why . But this sounds like perhaps a better idea . Will it play standard non-Apple format DVD and ripped BluRay files ? The Mac wont , natively . <p> Actually an older one with a dedicated graphics card might even be better as long as its Intel Core i5 or better , you should be good . As PLEX has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently out there . <p> My process for adding a BluRay or for that matter a DVD is to get it converted to MKV ( you can use MakeMKV for that ) while getting rid of all the unnecessary audio / subtitle tracks &amp; extras , copy the file to the NAS running the PLEX server application , do a refresh on the library and that 's it , you 're good to watch the movie on all your devices ! <p> Newegg sells a great Rosewill RSV-L4000 server chassis to fit your rack . Just build a cheap an inexpensive media server and run Windows or Linux with XBMC ( now called Kodi ) . It is a great program with very easy to use interface and since you have 8 bays of internal storage at up to 6TB each you can have 48TB of movie storage ! . Then you will be ready for ripping 4k movies . I cut out the Blu-ray player about a year ago and it was very painless ( as long as you backup your hard drives ) . Since you are not using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just assign that path in the software and you 're done . Then the software will pull all the metadata online and now you have a library complete with all the movie synopsis and art . I would n't recommend RAID since the consumer drives even the WD Red have high failure rate . Just use external backup drives <p> Paul , Is there a reason you bought the Oppo 103D instead of the Oppo 105D ? Cost ? Features on the 105D you did n't  want or need ? Just curious because the 105D has a superior DAC chip and analog out stage . <p> Right , but I use , instead , the DAC inside the Marantz and everything from the Oppo is through HDMI . So spending money on a better DAC inside the Oppo would n't matter or make any sense . If I only played BluRays and DVD physical media , then I would get the better Oppo and use its DAC . <p> Perhaps , and many never . Problem is , no streaming service I am aware of has the library choice I do available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are nearly gone . In our town there is but one left and its a pain in the butt to travel downtown , stand in line , etc . The convenience of the library can not be overstated . <p> Yes , I 've considered that route but honestly , I just love getting the itch to watch a film and then scrolling through a library to find it . The Netflix physical media requires thought , planning and while cool , not something on my radar right now . But thanks for the tip . <p> Understood , media servers such as the Kaleidescape are great fun , accessible , and extremely easy to use based on their GUI . <p> If you 're interested in expanding your media library with perhaps some classics and new releases , its a lot more convenient to have discs delivered to your home without the hassle of having to return them the next day at your local King Soopers or Safeway Redbox which are extremely limited in terms of resources . <p> one more question . Which projector or are you using ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1080 P projector . Very nice projector.however , it is seven years old and considered obsolete at this point in time I imagine . What is your and everybodys opinion about the Picture Quality difference using a good ( 4k-8k range ) 4k projector playing 1080 P Blu-rays versus playing them on my Epson . <p> PLEX has been my solution for five years now and its evolved to the point of near perfection . I prefer its ease of use , well designed apps and ecosystem over XBMC and others . Currently using a Synology NAS . <p> PLEX has released server apps that install directly on NAS devices ( Synology , QNAP , etc ) or one can use an actual computer which offers all the transcoding bells and whistles in addition to best performance . Managing PLEX , library configuration , remote access , metadata , poster art , is all managed via the extremely well designed PLEX web app . <p> All content on a PLEX server can be accessed via DLNA clients so the Oppo can stream it quite well . <p> I typically stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WDTV Live or Mac Mini . The best user experience is probably using an OS X machine with " PLEX Home Theater " installed but the Roku app is very snappy . The recently released apps for PS and Xbox look really good . <p> I stream using the " direct play " setting in order to get the true audio stream from the source . <p> I am intrigued . It would be cheaper for me to use a Roku box , thatd be cheaper than purchasing another Mac Mini . Not sure how that would work . Is there a Plex app Roku uses ? My files are already on the network through a Mac Mini with sharing enabled . How would the Roku box connect to those shares on the Mini ? <p> Without installing some type of server , the video files could be streamed from iTunes via an Apple TV but they would have to be within the file and codec parameters of iTunes . A rather limiting approach and not recommended . <p> PLEX ( server ) is lightweight and perfect for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you through adding folders of media ( movies , tv , music , pictures are all options ) . <p> I will investigate in another week . I am leaving on a weeks vacation starting tomorrow morning early , but will be online much to Terris disappointment while there , but on a limited basis and certainly not near the theater . Thanks for this info ! <p> Once you start listening to music on this new surround system , I 'd be interested to hear how you think it compares to what you remember of what you heard from my EEAS prototype at my house in 2013 . I know its a long time since you heard it but I 'd still like to know your impressions of the comparison . <p> Couple more options for video playback which you may be covering soon but mentioning regardless . <p> WDTV Live Supports just about every format and codec imaginable with very high quality video and audio . Network share playback is inconsistent so the best approach with this device is to connect any mass storage device directly via USB . WDTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //goo.gl/xK1xCl <p> Roku USB Channel ( app ) Supports the most common formats for media on drives connected to the Rokus USB port ( not all Roku players have USB ) .

@@23909594 @3909594/ <h> NAS , the system <p> Ive been asked multiple times to include a- diagram of- a network music playing system including a NAS . I have hesitated doing that because my artistic skillswell , they are n't  too hot . But , then , I realized I can use Google Drawing and as a diehard Google Docs user that was n't too far a leap to learn the simple program . Voila ! here 's my creation . <p> Not too shabby , eh ? <p> I think one of the helpful benefits of such an illustration is to point out the importance of the WIFI router in the setup . Note how everything branches off the router . It is the router that actually forms the LAN ( Local Area Network ) or , for the purposes of these discussions , we can simply say the router forms the network . <p> The modem , in this drawing , is really the only piece not entirely necessary . If you 're not streaming music , you do n't  need a connection to the internet . That 's how I run my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because chances are good your router is connected to a modem ( in some cases the router and modem are one piece ) . <p> Of course the elements in this illustration are just that , illustrations , and you can substitute different DACs , different network players ( no , I have n't any clue what the image of the network player is or where its from ) . <p> I would make one suggestion . Get a good , high speed router . I spent the money to get this Linksys router and I have never regretted it . Do you need to spend that much ? No , but make sure its the latest , high speed type and anything else in the network , like switches , they need to be good ones too . <p> The greatest number of help calls we get from our customers concerning network audio is almost always network related . Like power matters , the network matters too . And a lot . Do n't  assume the router you 're using is adequate . Really . Spend a few bucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , do it again . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 14 COMMENTS <p> Hi Paul , I went back to find a comment you made in a previous post regarding the bridge and that 24/192 is as far as it will go , if this is the case how does one play DSD in the above set up . Thankyou for a year of great reading . All the best for 2016 . Leigh <p> When I got into digital audio , conventional wisdom was that wired connections were preferred because they were more reliable , particularly with hi-res material . Have things improved enough that wifi works reliably with everything , even 24/192 and DSD ( assuming a good , up to date router ) ? Your post seems to imply this , but you might want to address it specifically . I have everything wired except the iPad and have never suffered from dropouts etc . I do realize that in some situations wired connections are n't  possible or are very inconvenient/expensive to install . <p> Definitely better wired and I guess my drawing failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired but the iPad which is the right way to do it . That 's one of the reasons I do n't  illustrate with pictures , using words instead . Pictures have the advantage of clarity over words , but you have to be ultra careful the clarity represents exactly what you want to convey . <p> Thanks . It has been an interesting and informative stream . I use a Mac Mini at the moment but hope to get a Network Streamer when they become more affordable . <p> Almost related as it was mentioned in your post about your traveling system was a USB Disruptor . I had not seen you mention that before . What is it , what does it do and how do you connect it in relation to your Jitterbug ? <p> The USB Disruptor http : //usbdisruptor.com/ is simply a device that removes the Vbus 5V connection to the computer and replaces it with its own power supply . They have a nice illustration if you go to their website . <p> It works because the 5V connection between the computer and the DAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased jitter . Removing the 5V and replacing it with a clean power supply external to the computer helps . <p> Thank you for the link and information . I guess because the Jitterbug has a different connector it is connected at the computer and the Disruptor is attached nearer the DAC using the Type B output from a USB cable . <p> Magister , I use an AURALiC Vega DAC and Aries Bridge ( Network Player ) . The NAS , Router , and WiFi Modem are in one room all connected with ethernet , the DAC and Network Player sit in a different room . The Aries and iPad use wireless connections to the router . The Aries connects to the DAC via USB . The performance is flawless in my opinion especially streaming from the NAS including double rate DSD . Occasionally streaming from Tidal can be slow selecting a track . This could be my cable TV modem ( my Internet service providor ) or Tidals server traffic . Cheers . Keep up the good work Paul . <p> Just like in high-end audio a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is akin to a receiver , having a switch , router , and wifi access point all in one . The power supply ( the weak link just like in audio ) must supply all these with ( usually awful ) power . Paul is correct regarding the network : get great stuff , do n't  cheap out , and I would add " use separates . " Thank you : - ) <p> I am just beginning to learn this and your post have been most helpful . Qustion is if I have a transport , DAC , and a music server with the drives in it , does that not combine the NAS and player ? Have not bought the server yet but that is how I understand it . Thanks <p> From what I can see the Melco is a fancy NAS . Their descriptions a little obtuse but from what I gather that 's its function . It appears to not be a player , so it needs the other unit they refer to as a streamer to complete the group .

@@23909600 @3909600/ <h> Class DSD <p> Who knew so many of you were happy reading about common mode rejection ? Thanks for the kind notes about yesterdays post . Today let 's focus on what a Class D amp does , how PWM works and why this process is so closely related to DSD . <p> Remembering that the simplest understanding of a traditional class A/B amplifier can be broken into two parts : input voltage amplifier and output current amplifier its somewhat easy to visualize how an analog amp works . The preamp feeds the amp a small signal , perhaps a volt or two and the power amp increases that voltage by 25 to 30 times . For sake of understanding and easy math , let 's just call it 30 times . Put one volt into our imaginary amp and the voltage amplifier part gives you 30 back . Simple . If its a well designed amplifier , the 30 volts looks identical to the input 1 volt no difference means no distortion . The output current stage of our imaginary amplifier takes the 30 volts and adds wattage ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . <p> To summarize , in a traditional amplifier the voltage gain stage makes the input signal bigger , the output power stage adds current to that bigger voltage so you can have enough power to drive your loudspeaker and you get music . <p> The simplest understanding of a Class D stage can also be broken down into two parts : the input modulator and the output power stage . Today well focus on this first input stage , the modulator . <p> here 's the idea . To create an efficient low heat producing power amp we need to only allow our output power stage to be either all on or all off anything in between will create heat and lose power delivery to the speaker . To accomplish this " all in " or " all out " idea the Class D input modulator has , instead of a voltage amplifier as in our traditional amp , an on or off comparator . <p> A comparator is a really simple electronic switch that compares two things to each other . If one of its two inputs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be high . Should the input of the first one be lower than the input to the second one , the output of the comparator goes low . Simple . <p> So what are these two inputs we are comparing ? The first one is our music the second one is a triangle wave which is nothing more than a steady up and down voltage at a very precise and fixed time . This triangle wave , which we mentioned the day before yesterday , is really dependent on time for its perfection and the sound of our amplifier can only be acceptable if this up and down ramp is exact and equal in its timing . The up part has to be identical in time as the down part , over and over again . Perfection here is the key . <p> So , now put the two ideas together the one input is our music moving up and down in voltage the other input is a precise up and down voltage ramp . As long as the music input is higher than our voltage ramp side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the music voltage is less than the ramp the comparator is off . This activity makes a kind code that is directly related to the music in a very linear fashion . <p> here 's a picture of what this looks like : <p> Note on the top half of this picture the black sine wave , then the red constant triangle wave and in the lower picture , the on and off length of the modulator output . <p> Its kind of easy to see that there 's a direct relationship between the time the triangle wave is on and where the sine wave is resulting in our longer and shorter output . But also note that as soon as the sine wave drops below the red triangle wave the output goes away . <p> The sine wave is our music and , if you put this sine wave into your loudspeaker , you will hear sound . Funny thing is , if you put the modulator output into the loudspeaker you will also hear sound . <p> For those of you following along in my posts you may recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as DSD . Remember that DSD can be placed directly into a speaker ( ignoring the watts it takes for the speaker to move ) as can a sine wave as can a PWM or Class D signal . In fact , Sonys SACD process is very close to PWD or class D. Digital audio , on the other hand ( known as PCM ) can not be placed directly into a loudspeaker for if you do youll only get noise . <p> So , well cover more tomorrow , but to sum up Class D is an analog process and not one that requires conversion to a discrete numeric representation like digital audio and Class D is as close to DSD and analog as you will ever get . <p> There are a number of shortcoming for Class D and well start to understand these soon , but at least now you get an idea how Class D should maybe be called Class DSD. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409

If timing ( jitter ) were to blame for variations in sound quality , I had imagined we could prove that by removing the suspected clock/data relationship . We know jitter does not occur in stored data without reference- to a clock . It is only when that data and clock are paired we risk jitter . Therefore , - multiple copies of identical data , even those delivered over disparate mechanisms , should sound identical when output from a storage device controlled by a common clock. - Thus , the audio RAM buffer was invented to solve sonic differences . <p> RAM buffers were not new , though their use in an accessory to improve DAC performance was . We soon learned there was much more going on that also needed fixing and well cover that list tomorrow . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 10 COMMENTS <p> Are there plans for a regen type product from you ? I have three of them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 300 with a linear psu Its use almost as good as a server built for purpose . Lastly do you plan to make a server perhaps a combo pwt / network and usb server . That would be a great product of needed combination My msb UMT plus is such a device and does a great job . Sorry if this was not the intention of this post if I am wrong . Al <p> Hello Paul ! I 'm really not happy on your saying bits is bits ' foolishness . In bits 1001 equals 1001 ! Only if one has real difficulties with eyesight one could read f00l . I hope mixing up things that should n't be mixed up will belong to the past . BTW I might be wrong , but if I remember well it was Wadia with their 2000 DAC , who were first talking about jitter in digital audio . Greetings <p> Sorry , do n't  mean to make anyone unhappy , but bits ai n't  bits when it comes to getting them into an audio reproduction device sounding the same . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the timing of when those two bits arrive and the shape they 're in , how they affect the power supply and a hundred other variables affect everything around those bits and change the sound . <p> So , I do n't  mean to be so quick to say things like that , most readers of this blog know what I am referring to and I apologize for any misunderstandings . <p> OK Paul ! That is another cup of tea , because it relies to the electrical signal . To draw a comparison approach , One can read black letters very well if they were printed on white paper , it is more difficult to read them on dark grey paper and nearly impossible if they were printed on black paper . Nevertheless one has printed the same information ; - ) Greetings <p> agreed , and thus my statement bits are n't  bits until they get into the device in proper order and form . There were many myths perpetrated on us that neither cables nor recording medium mattered where bits are concerned bits are bits and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not read , or white paper it can , does n't  matter . <p> Looking at the data , IMO the results are inconclusive and irrelevant . To begin with testing at -90db is absurd . That does not emulate real world conditions . Secondly , some of the data seems to show what I 'd consider marginal improvement , other data shows degradation . Again the test conditions are IMO absurd . If this is what it takes to demonstrate any differences between this product and other products or no product , then I find it unconvincing . <p> I havent had time to read the entire article yet . I 'm not sure how this is any different from merely using a Schmidt Trigger to resquare the waveform from hf ( rise time ) degradation due to shunt capacitance and series inductance and reclocking using an SSR with a highly stable clock . As I understand it a RAM is just an SSR connected head to tail with variable input and output points . Jitter induced by interconnect wires can be sharply reduced by simply locating the D/A converter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics on the same circuit board . Much of the problem if it really is a problem seems to be created by the interconnect wires themselves . High end products that create problems more high end problems have to be used to solve ? ? ? <p> From Wikipedia ; A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop ( PLL ) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal . While there are several differing types , it is easy to initially visualize as an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector . The oscillator generates a periodic signal . The phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal and adjusts the oscillator to keep the phases matched . " Bringing the output signal back toward the input signal for comparison is called a feedback loop since the output is fed back toward the input forming a loop . " <p> " Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to synchronizing signals , a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency , or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency . These properties are used for computer clock synchronization , demodulation , and frequency synthesis . " <p> I saw my first phase locked loop around 1970 built from discrete components . It was quite a project built as part of a complex electronic measuring instrument by GE I was evaluating for Bethlehem Steel . Not long afterwards PLLs became available at low cost in IC versions . Its actually old technology but still very useful for many applications . The PLLs I 've seen use input tracking filters to keep spurious noise from knocking the circuit out of synch lock . It therefore can be considered an integrator . The VCO output can be converted to whatever you want it to be for external use such as a square wave , sine wave , triangle wave , pulse etc . From there it has to go to the D/A converter , one more opportunity to create jitter in the connecting wires . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock in what 's known as S/PDIF . What normally happens is the multiplexed data is separated into its components parts : data and multiple clocks . The clocks are then used to drive the D/A converter . <p> The first two issues you run into is the method used to recover the clock creates jitter . The second problem you run into is the clock was generated by a CD transport in the first place , and that clock is usually jittered depending on the CD player but rarely any good . <p> What the Lens did is unraveled the multiplexed data , threw away all clock information and placed the data itself into a RAM buffer . The size of the buffer varied with the speed of incoming data ( for obvious reasons ) . Once full we then used an excellent low jitter clock that was fixed clocks inside CD players are variable and change according to the speed of data recovered from the laser to reassemble ( multiplex ) the data back into S/PDIF and on its way again . <p> Yes , the RAM is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I explained below . It is clear that reclocking must happen in the transport because the disc itself can never spin at nearly the stability and accuracy of speed required for digital audio . <p> A lot of people here like analogies so I 've thought one up to explain jittering and dejittering as I understand it . Consider two amusement park rides one in front of another . In each ride there is a long train of cars one seat wide . If a seat is occupied it 's a one . If it 's empty it 's a zero . The train advances one seat at a time . When the seat arrives at an exit gate in ride one , the gate opens and if there is someone in the seat they get out . If it 's empty , nothing happens and after an interval the gate closes . The train of cars advances to the next seat and the cycle repeats . When the passengers get out of ride one , they walk to the entry gate of ride two where they get on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they get in . If no one gets in during the fixed interval the gate closes anyway and advances to the next car . The object is to have filled and empty seats in the same order , that is the same configuration in ride two as it was in ride one . Problem , they do n't all walk from ride one to ride two at the same speed . That 's the jitter . If they arrive at ride two within the interval allowed while the gate is open for the correct seat in the sequence , it does n't matter . The rate at which gate two opens and closes controls whether or not they 'll get into the correct seat . Ride two reclocks them . <p> What happens if the passenger arrives too early or two late for the seat he 's supposed to be in on ride two ? Then the sequence of ones and zeros is wrong and the D/A converter will program the wrong voltage for the analog signal . In the analog domain this will show up as distortion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jitter inherent in the digital domain and whether or not it is beyond the tolerance of what the reclocking circuit can handle before it is converted back to analog form . Measured distortion even for inexpensive CD players is invariably very low . Is digital jitter really a problem ? I 'm not sure but so far I 'm not convinced . Will fancy dejittering equipment make an audible difference ? Probably yes but that does n't  prove the change is the result of dejittering . There are other variables in play too . To prove dejittering matters , all of the other variables must be eliminated or taken into account . Is different the same as better ? I du n no ? ? ? ? Maybe , and then again maybe not . : - ) 
@@23909602 @3909602/ <h> Bipolar Mirage <p> The easiest way to picture how a bipole loudspeaker is configured is to imagine two full range Monopole speaker boxes back-to-back . Sound comes out of both the front and the back of the combined boxes in this configuration and , if you connect them in-phase ( red to red and black to black ) you get a bipole . <p> The first bipole I remember was the Mirage series of loudspeakers back in the day when API of Canada owned Mirage and they were considered high end loudspeakers . Mirage is today owned by Klipsch and I have n't paid too much attention to where their product focuses are . <p> The advantages of a bipole are somewhat the same as a dipole ( which well discuss next ) and their problems are as well . Radiating sound out of the rear of the loudspeaker in equal proportions to the front might sound goofy after all why do you need to fill the back of the room with sound ? Surely the sound pointing at your ears is most important ? <p> The answer lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your loudspeaker pair out into the backyard and play them you 'll be pretty much underwhelmed with the sound and certainlydisappointedin the imaging there pretty much wont be any . This is because we need the room reflections to help us build a believable soundstage in our rooms . <p> Exciting the rear of the room at the same time we launch audio directly at us helps create an illusion of soundstage and depth we need to support the recordings we listen to . Monopoles can create a lifelike soundstage in a room without launching this rear facing wave because at lower frequencies loudspeakers project all around them , the rear wall included . But monopoles cant project their tweeters energy at the rear wall and so their imaging can sometimes be trapped between the speakers . To solve this , some monopole designers add a rear facing tweeter . But back to Bipoles . <p> The problem with a bipole is something called comb filtering . This is a fancy term that basically means some frequencies are cancelled , while others are reinforced or ignored . Picture a comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the comb are frequencies at a proper level in volume what you want and the space between the teeth are cancellations or lower volume at the next higher or lower frequencies . <p> Comb effects can be lowered or worked with by clever design from the loudspeaker manufacturer and so the results are truly dependent on the skill of the designer . <p> From a user standpoint the Bipole presents some challenges not encountered with a standard Monopole loudspeaker . Distance from the rear wall ( it needs space to work ) and treatment of that rear wall are critical elements in successfully integrating a Bipole into your room to take advantage of its added spatial properties . The same can be said of a Dipole . <p> A Dipole is basically a Bipole but instead of the rear wave being in phase , as it is with the Bipole , the Dipole is 180 degrees different and that makes a huge difference in the way the speaker needs to be designed as well as how you place it in the room and what you do to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 2 COMMENTS <p> I must disagree with you most vigorously ( that 's going some for me ) . It is precisely the reflected sounds that muck up the imaging . I agree that reflected sounds can perform some faking of the image ( Bose 901 ) , but just throwing in some well perceived echo can add a sense of room fill and imaging as well . Precise localization of images requires that nothing but the direct sound reaches the ears , such as might be experienced in your own example , outdoors . There are many things that can be done to heighten the " sense " of imaging , such as what Polk did with his speakers that had extra drivers to provide more out of phase ( opposite phase actually ) energy which heightened the sense of separation ; or what Bob Carver did electronically to give a sense of surround sound . I would challenge you to take your speakers back outdoors again I do n't  know that the type of speakers matters a lot the idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been underwhelmed before , is the lack of room support , particularly for lower frequencies , that we have become accustomed to indoors . That frequency spectrum error can be partially offset through the use of an equalizer . I believe that you will be quite surprised at the replacement of your loudspeakers with a continuum of image breadth and depth rarely experience elsewhere . here 's another experiment : if you would like to hear the voice of God , i.e. , everywhere at once , while outdoors reverse one of the speaker leads so the speakers are 180 degrees out of phase with each other , then play a male ( or female ) voice , such as a radio announcer ; you will be stunned ( as was I ) . That said , I am enjoying this whole series of types of loudspeakers . I have experimented with building and playing with almost every type you have mentioned . I disagree with some of the responses I+GGve seen ( actually I think some have been wrong ) but we are all entitled to our opinions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both correct and errant statements . <p> Alan , thank for commenting and certainly thanks for vehemently commenting ! ! Love it . If only we can get enough conversations going sharing of opinions , its all for the better . Certainly there is much I can learn . <p> Perhaps I should restate the premise I am writing about more clearly . Non-reflective loudspeakers such as monopoles have excellent imaging without bouncing sound off the rear wall . I agree with you on that . Witness Wilson loudspeakers , some of the best imaging speakers around and they are monopoles . <p> But my point was those very loudspeakers and HOW they image . They create a small ( or large depending on how far apart they are ) trapped soundstage between the speaker pair relative to a dipole which goes wall to wall . <p> Take another example , Avalon . These speakers are great imaging loudspeakers but ONLY if you use gobs of diffusors in the room making almost a sort of diffusor forrest and then you can get better more open imaging . <p> Dipoles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most realistic soundstage of them all especially dipoles . They create this image , with the aid of proper diffusion along their rear wall precisely BECAUSE of their reflective nature , their lack of side wall interaction etc . They do not do it in spite of their reflective nature . <p> I have certainly heard those that believe this form of imaging is fake , but properly setup I have found consistently the opposite is true monopole imaging is good , sometimes great , but proper dipole imaging is the best . 
@@23909604 @3909604/ <h> Alternative reality <p> There 's plenty of alternatives : - facts , behavior , butter , education , apparel , and reality to name a few . <p> Reality occurs when the original recording was made . A live concert or a studio session sets the reality- stage and engineers capture it on recordings . <p> When our stereo systems recreate that moment of reality we agree to suspend disbelief and accept an alternate reality . <p> Walking the halls of an audio show we go from room to room , system to system , in search of the alternate reality that gets us closest to the original event . Its why we often bring our own recordings to serve as a reference . <p> Occasionally we hear presentations so convincing were tempted to imagine reality has been captured , bottled , and played back at our command . <p> Those are the magical moments we all seek . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 16 COMMENTS <p> Reality , Paul , is a most complex phenomenon . Microphones do not have a psyche or soul and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catched by our tympanic membranes especially when we sit in the middle of a concert hall while the microphones are used for a recording a near-field even catching the smacking of the tongue and the breathing noise of the singer . What we get when buying a record is a most artificial product and in rare cases a most artistic one . Only when using the headphones and amps and master tape machine of the sound engineer we might get an impression of the reality of the making not knowing the emotional involvement of the sound engineer . Only in a thought experiment you can separate the consciousness or perception from the emotion . From a mandatory holistic point of view you never are allowed to omit any parameter actually being involved . Finally the " reality " is ( much ) more than the sum of several abstracted elements invented and defined by clever human brains . <p> In my experience besides more self-evident aspects like full range capability , realistic tonal shape of instruments , resolving characteristic etc. , the key to such an experience is exceptional dynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments and singers and authentic reproduction of the room ambiance inbetween those sound events . <p> Not rarely the latter aspects can be exaggerated in a positive way by a great setup , which is the typical positive difference ( there are certainly also negative ) between an original event and a reproduced recording . The reproduced recording on a great setup , by the fact of microphone setup and post production in the recording , can sound much more holographic and determined in instrument placement and layering than the real event . <p> I think some would wonder how unspectacular a live performance can sound compared to a really fascinating playback of a recording . <p> You make an interesting point , Paul , and one I have been pondering over lately . If I close my eyes can I imagine I am listening to a live performance ? For something like lute music the answer is " Yes " and this illusion persists up as far as a string quartet , but for a full orchestra things get worse . I suspect that with a larger sound stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing effect . Even when listening live your experience close to the stage , and up in the Gods of a large concert hall , can be very different , but both are real . The illusion of reality is not helped by my living in a very charming , but tiny , house so that the listening room has savagely compromised the equipment I have space for , and the placement of speakers . I have to content myself with music sounding enjoyable , rather than completely realistic . <p> All we have is a grand illusion in our systems some grander than others . Anyone who performs has too issues that separate them From my type of grand illusion One is they know in great detail how it should sound The second is they know how it sounds as they play it and how it sounds live from a distance In my world having these virtues seems like a curse to me while playing alone must be a wonderful virtue . No sysem made to date comes close to a real reality as these gifted People know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not how it is played back by what format be it digital or analog . The recording holds the keys to the first door on our way to reality . But for some even this door is always open as they seek the quality of the performance not the quality of the sound . PAUL this is a great post that is truly showing us all its a grand illusion we each seek in great audio . I find the same as I wonder through shows . Some rooms sound right to me most bad . Be it any format . Now one last thought on real and reality . Some feel they know what reality and real is . While I make no claim in knowing better than anyone reading this my real reality is achieved in my own self being happy . This is for each of us and some times a small group may feel the same as a whole . I have had some people over to My place who do play . They love my setup but when they play a real instrument my setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does play and is in this hobby must have two realities to deal with . An example of a grest live recording that seems real to is Antonio forcione quatet . For me I am at that event <p> I have been spending considerably more time going to live performances of all types . At some point , I always close my eyes and listen with the same criticality I do at home . What 's interesting about live , is that there is very little seperaration . The closest thing I have heard to the experience of live was at RMAF , a couple years ago . They had a turntable playing a mono record with a mono cartridge , through a phono preamp with a " mono mode " . I was amazed at how the layering of instruments was there , yet not separated so much between channels . Its more layered on top of each other in a way that 's hard to explain . That is precisely what I hear live . You hear general left and right tendencies , but it more blends into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far right , singers moving positions as they walk around . I have even been in recording studios , and its the same thing . I do n't  think recreating " true live " is as hard as what we make it . The issue is the recreation of alternate reality in recordings , which are inherently non-live . It then becomes interpretive and inherently personally biased . <p> I recently attended a performance of the Emerson String Quartet . When i got home , I put on a recording of them playing the same piece . It was , I thought , very close to the live experience . Either that or my 65 year old ears playing tricks on me . <p> They 're not , but it depends on where you sit . For small unamplified groups like chamber music , a good system can easily duplicate the live event or surpass it , most likely , in sound stage and imaging , but never in tonal quality . For large symphonic music-never . <p> But as you say most likely always in terms of sound staging/imaging etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are limited in aspects like imaging/soundstaging , because that 's closer to the live experience , just as Reed explained for good mono setups . <p> If I were after close to live experience instead of listening into the recordings , I probably would go for something like the old Shahinian Diapason speakers . Do n't  know if they still exist and if my memory does n't  fool me . <p> Anyone who has listened to Patricia Barbers recordings would likely agree they are recordings of the highest quality . I have seen her live twice in two different venues . The first was a smaller intimate lounge setting and the other was a larger mid sized hall . The smaller venue had superb acoustics and the larger venue had mediocre sound quality . The odd thing is the smaller venue sounded more like one of her great studio recordings and the other venue did not . Although both venues trumped the stereo system , the smaller venue sounded eerily close to the stereo playback . Sometimes there seems to be a paradox when comparing a live performance and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what remains is the fact that good reproduced music can be extremely satisfying . The fact that this happens in the privacy of your home without any distraction like being surrounded by people , extraneous sounds etc. is an added bonus and a big one at that . Of course attending live performances keeps the the reference fresh in ones mind but listening to a good system at home has a charm all its own . Better than a live performance sound wise ? No . But experience wise ? Yes if the sound system is good and can produce big , bold and beautiful sound . My experience of course . Regards . <p> Absolutely true . If those perks of home reproduced music did n't  exist , we would n't have this great hobby . I never feel music deprived with a good sound system and a big music collection . I save live concerts for special occasions . <p> A big part of capturing reality was thrown down the drain in the 70s -80s . Today we talk about " surround sound . " Channels being fed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of having rear channel " time delay . " It was never pursued and out of frustration ( and lack of funds of many ) dropped and replaced by what I see as a cheap substitute . For it was about capturing that special sense of being there. Another interesting reality . Rooms and concert halls to not reflect around you 20 20,000 hz . The higher frequencies are lost in the reflections . That is why a cymbal and triangle will sound like its coming from the stage , and you are not sitting inside their sound . Rear speakers should consist of what constitutes lousy front speakers . Not high end speakers ! One pioneering company in digital time delay recommended using cheap speakers with big enough woofers for the rear speakers , and to disengage the tweeters . For that reason .. I located a used Yamaha time delay which is now sitting in my closet that I picked up on Ebay awaiting a possible time to have refurbished and modified . If that happens , I will be looking for rear speakers that put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was selling audio and witnessed to what could be done I walked away convinced that time delay should have been the future of audio . Its been a neglected and lost art . It fills the room with music , yet at lower volumes we are forced to resort to when we do not recreate the environment ( or a convincing environment ) of a real musical event . <p> Genez , you remind me of the fad in the early 70s ( in the UK at least ) for connecting up a third speaker at the rear of the room between the two main speakers to give an A-B output . It was undoubtedly a crime against high fidelity but it did give a very impressive , immersive sound for pop music . I never really took to it myself , since orchestral music sounded a bit strange . <p> I long ago stopped chasing the absolute sound . As others have said small acoustic groups or a singer with a guitar can sound quite close . I think one reason for that is that they are usually amplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcement at most venues is n't as good as the sound reinforcement gear we have assembled . I have been to hundreds of concerts , from very small clubs to outdoor stadiums and to outdoor facilities designed for music . To me , the most obvious difference is just plain volume . Even when I am cranking up my system to volumes that I seldom choose , it is never as loud as a punk rock band in a small club . I have a set of Ear Peaces that are always with me these days . It seems the more experienced acts with the money , can hire a person on the sound board who can create very good sound with high volumes . It is two different experiences , I know this and my goals for my system is not to duplicate that live experience , but to create a listening experience that brings me joy . I think once we come to terms with that , our goals with a home system change . I always find it interesting when people have fond memories of an older system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard , that sparked our quest . If we could hear those systems today , I think we would be quite disappointed , with a few rare exceptions . I have the Ramones on , I have seen the Ramones , a very different experience . I do find concert videos have a way of distracting us , using two senses , makes it seem more like a documentation of an event . When our eyes and mind are focused on the performers , the sound is just part of it , and unless it is bad , I do n't  find myself analyzing it . Some of us live in our own alternate reality , some by choice , and some out of necessity .

At least I think I do ; past the 40-year mark , its hard to separate self-delusion from reality . <p> Anyway , it was 1968 or 69 . I was in 8th grade at Lincoln Junior High , Carbondale , Illinois . During a Student Council meeting , I rolled my eyes and made a disparaging comment about a particularly egregious proposal before the Council . Given the general meaninglessness of all we did , it mustve been a real stinker . <p> Mrs. Dillardthe always-upbeat advisor who also coached cheerleaders got a look on her face like a storm cloud , and spat out , " BILL LEEBENSyoure SUCH a CYNIC ! ! " <p> Ever-defensive , I shot back , " I AM NOT ! ! " <p> Really , is there any better place for a cynic than in the audiophile world ? Introspective , antisocial misanthropes angst endlessly online over picayune distinctions between various versions of mediocre music . I 'm NOT one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOCK them . <p> And yet : God help me , the dysfunctional family of music-lovers and audio geeks are my people . Like my own family , they may make me want to commit violent acts , they may drive me to drink , but by GOD , nobody from the outside better give them crap . Then I get angry . And you would n't like me when Im angry . <p> Which brings me to CES . <p> I first attended CES in Chicago , the summer of 1989 . I was a UPS driver with a side-business in audio , so imagine what it was like for one whose contacts in that world had mostly been by long-distance or as a pen-pal , to enter a hotel full of the cranky and irreverent geniuses of the high-end audio world . To use a creepy contemporary parallel , imagine a lonely sci-fi geek from the middle of nowhere , stumbling into Comic-Con . <p> Not to sound too fanboy , but that 's what my first CES was like . David Manley , Bud Fried , Matthew Polk ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the glitterati , all wisecracking , all smoking ; it was the 80s , after all . After years of isolation , I felt I 'd come home . In the decades since , I 've eagerly anticipated CESbut not any more . <p> Why ? That requires some explanation . Back at that summer CES in Chicago , the " Specialty Audio " exhibitors , as they were then called , were all in one hotel . Exhibitors came from other areas to take notes and steal ideasnot to mock , or to gape in horror at stratospheric price tags . CES was the place where audio brands broke out , where new products were launched . It was not just significant , it was vital . <p> In the years since then , all that has changed , and not for the better . Let 's look at the number of High Performance Audio ( in CES-speak ) exhibitors . Going back a few years to when such exhibits moved from the casino-free Alexis Park to the top floors of the Venetian hotel ( and casino ) in 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both shows could easily be covered by press . <p> At that point , floors 29-31 of the Venetian were nearly filled with purely audio exhibits , and additional exhibits were in ground-floor ballrooms and in large suites on 34 and 35 . <p> The Venetian tower is configured like a Mercedes star , with three wings to each floor . Floors 29-31 each had about 90 exhibit rooms , with 15-20 on each of 34 and 35 , and perhaps another dozen down below . Add in the 40-80 rooms at THE , and you get around 350-400 exhibit rooms . <p> Its been downhill from there . CEAwhich , in my hearing referred to THE Show and other off-site exhibitors as " parasitic bloodsuckers " may have moved the HPA exhibits in order to discourage exhibits at THE , which ended up even farther away at the Flamingo . <p> Where are we now ? Back in 2013 , I worked in an exhibit room on the Venetians 29th floor . Allied with a number of other exhibitors , we tried to track the volume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the show , we concluded that about 2,500 people had walked through the audio exhibits . That 's less than one can expect at any reasonable regional show in the US , these days . And Munich is a whole nother story . <p> That was admittedly , a SWAG a scientific , wild-ass guess . But even more significant than the number of visitors was the type of visitor . In past years , most visitors wore badges labeled BUYER , DISTRIBUTOR or RETAILER . What we saw in 2013 , and which has only worsened since , was that an overwhelming percentage of our visitors wore EXHIBITOR badges . They appeared to mostly be guys ( and yes , 99% were male ) working at booths over at the main convention center for Intel , HP , or other megacompanies , and had come through our domain for amusement . While its nice to have pros in other fields aware of our workunlike the Good Old Days , they did n't  seem to be there to steal ideas . They were simply there as a hoot . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitors at the 2016 CES . Remember , less than a decade ago there were 300 exhibitors , filling up floors 29-31 , with more on 34 and 35 , and a dozen downstairs in ballrooms . This year , floor 31 was completely given over to tech-y , non-audio exhibitors , mostly software providers . Floors 29 and 30 had significant holes and non-audio OEMs ; there were 136 audio rooms on those two floors . 34 and 35 had a total of 18 audio rooms . Downstairs ? Aside from B&amp;O , maybe a handful . Let 's say 5 . <p> All told , that makes 159 audio exhibit roomsabout half the number of just 8 or 9 years ago . THE Show no longer exists in Las Vegas ; organizer Richard Beers focuses on the highly-successful THE Show in Newport Beach , California . So in total , were down well over 200 rooms , compared to 2007-ish . There are still additional offsite exhibits , as there were back then , mostly at the Mirage " but that number has stayed stable , around 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that used to exhibit there are nearly all absent from CES . They cant afford it . For those who do exhibit at CES , the ROI is under close scrutiny . Add up the cost of a basic room at the Venetian , sleeping rooms for crew , meals for same , wining and dining dealers and distributors$20,000 goes pretty quickly , with many companies spending far more . <p> That does n't  sound like much in todays business-world , but remember : most of these companies are under $5M/year , and that expenditure may define the knife-edge between red and black . Or , itd pay for a lot of visits to dealers . <p> I 've heard from several veteran audio companies that 2016 will be their last CES . <p> Ill likely be there for at least part of the 2017 show , happy to see friends , colleagues and media . Ill likely end up exhausted and sick as a dog ; after all , that is part of the CES experience . <p> For me , CES is now like a girlfriend who once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wistful , nostalgic overtonesbut no longer a big part of my life . <p> Bill Leebens is Editor of Copper and Director of Marketing at PS Audio .

@@23909609 @3909609/ <h> Computer Music 12 : optimizing sound quality <p> iTunes and Apple work hard at keeping life simple for its users . So simple , in fact , they are prepared to sacrifice quality of sound for it something- that makes us scratch our collective heads . But then , this would n't be the first slap in the face to high end audio . <p> iTunes easily plays most all sample rates and bit depth media without a problem . 192kHz , 24 bit audio ? Fine , bring it on . But , there 's a problem . What comes out the other end of your computer is n't necessarily the same sample rate and bit depth you 're playing . This is the great homogenizing trick Apple uses to keep things simple and working , regardless of what 's connected . In both Windows and Mac , the computer fixes- the sample rate and bit depth to whatever the user chooses . They recommend setting it at standard CD rates : 16/44 . Which is fine for CDs , not so good for higher resolution audio . iTunes will downsample high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution track . Or , it can be the opposite . <p> If the user chooses to fix the computer output at 192/24 , then no upsampling is used when you play that high resolution file . But if you play a CD , that music is upsampled to 192/24 before your DAC gets it . All this may or may not be a bad thing . There are many who love the sound of everything upsampled and ignore the issue entirely . Set the computer output to 192/24 and play away . Now , iTunes handles all music you play in it , and your DAC- receives everything , over USB , at the higher sample rate . This is n't what many of us want , wishing instead for bit perfect performance . <p> For Mac users the problem is solved . There are programs that take care of the issue . My favorite , and most recommended , is Bit Perfect . Its $10 , handles everything well and to my ears , sounds the best . Others , like Pure Music , Audirvana , and Ammara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in all things high end , the opinions are as strong as black- coffee . Each solves the problem described and allows bit perfect music at any sample rate and bit depth to play directly into your computer if you use a Mac . <p> Windows , not so much . iTunes and- Windows get along if you 're focusing on a CD based library . If you want to play higher rez music , there 's no add on program I am aware of that does what the many Mac based programs do . Windows users who wish to focus on high resolution audio , have two choices : set the computer to output 192/24 and upsample or just play CDs . If bit perfect is on your list of must haves , you would be better served with JRiver if you- can figure out how to use it . <p> Lastly , one option for Windows users is to gulp spend $500 on an Apple product . A Mac Mini- is an 8 inch square aluminum sculpture not more than a couple of inches tall . Once setup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keyboard , mouse or video screen attached . Connect it to your DAC with a USB cable and control it with an iPad as I have described in these posts . Its what I do and it works nearly perfectly . And , $500 ? Many of us have paid more than that for a single USB cable . And no , the Apple cooties wont infect your bed at night . : ) If there 's any interest in seeing what 's involved in building a headless music server for $500 , you can read my- article . <p> Todays takeaway : to get the most out of iTunes on a Mac , install Bit Perfect . For Windows users , you 'll need to stick with CDs or consider other alternatives for playing higher resolution music . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 20 COMMENTS <p> Paul , great blog on getting the best from mac mini and iTunes . I use mac mini headless but I can only run iTunes from the remote app . Are you saying that bit perfect is an add on to iTunes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exactly . Not only does it solve the fixed sample rate problem , but it helps the sound dramatically . Further , and to your next question , it also permits DSD to play and be recognized in the iTunes library . The only downside to the DSD feature is you must first run your DSD files through their add on program called DSD master , which encases the DSD file in an ALAC container to fool iTunes . <p> Bit Perfect is great , but the pricier apps do offer some features worth considering . For instance , Pure Music gives one the option of sending native DSD from iTunes to DACs that can handle it , or to convert to PCM on the fly , or to convert to PCM files . <p> For stand-alone converters , the free ( or " donation ware " ) XLD app ( X Lossless Decoder ) will convert a variety of formats , including DSD , to almost anything . Its really a Swiss Army knife for audio files , and all Mac users should have it in their toolbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth trying . I have been using Audirvana but the iTunes integration is clunky and on its own its fine if I am sitting at the mac but I ca n't control with the remote app . Thanks for your help . <p> I 'm not sure why the suggestion that JRiver is hard to use . Its much easier IMHO than say pure music and itunes . JRiver with JRemote on my IPAD works just perfect and is as easy as it gets to use . Rip the files with DBPoweramp into your server ( windows based ) which in my opinion smokes any MAC based product the files automatically sync into JRiver with not even the push of a single key stroke required in JRiver . Go to your IPAD on J Remote find the album or artist or search any number of ways to find the music and push play . How could it be any simpler than that . And btw sounds awesome . <p> I am not a Windows guy but from memory you go to the Windows Control Panel . I also think you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side of the home screen . Maybe a more experienced Windows user can chime in . <p> I am a Windows PC and iTunes user that wanted to switch to a Mac Mini as the music server and here is what I learned make that switch before building a music library or as early as possible . here 's one example why I built a large library with a PC so its stored on a USB external drive and that drive is in standard NTFS ( Windows ) drive format . Apple uses the HFS+ drive format and wont read/write NTFS . So a Mac Mini cant access my music library because of this drive incompatibility . <p> Note to readers : NTFS and HFS+ are drive formats involving drive blocks , tracks , sectors , and partitions and have nothing to do with music formats like AIFF , WAV , and FLAC . <p> I have read of a software program or two , such as Paragon , that supposedly enables a Mac to read/write with an NTFS drive , but I fear this would also add complications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could copy my music files from my NTFS drive to a new HFS+ formatted drive for a fee if I bought a Mac Mini and new external drive . But , a problem here is half my music files are in WAV format and half in AIFF and ALAC . ( I was an early adopter and read from several respected sources that WAV files sounded better . It was only later that I learned that copying WAV files causes a loss of important metadata ) . <p> So , I fear that trying to copy files from NTFS to HFS+ will leave a lot of WAV metadata behind . ( I totally agree with Paul McGowans earlier advice to avoid the WAV format because of this metadata trap. ) 
@@23909612 @3909612/ <h> Inside power amps <p> In my series on AC power I had used power amplifiers as the subject for good reason . Power amplifiers have the crudest power supplies and , as such , are more prone to AC power quality issues . A reader asked me a good question . Why ? Why do power amplifiers have crude power supplies relative to preamps and DACs ? And why do n't  designers spend more time and money getting supplies in amps right ? Great questions . <p> Let 's take our own power amplifier , the BHK Signature , as an example. - The BHK has two power- transformers : a medium sized one for the input stage , a giant one for the output . Part of the amplifier is regulated , part of it is not . And here 's the thing . The amplifier weighs close to 90lbs. 90lbs is already heavy " heavy enough that we often hire a moving company to deliver it to peoples homes " which is better than FedEx dumping on your doorstep . But I tell you- its weight to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cram into the box and still have it manageable by normal human beings . <p> I mentioned part of the BHK is regulated , other parts are not . Most power amplifiers have no regulation . Some , like ours , regulate the input stage and not the output stage . A few , like the Sanders , regulate the whole amplifier , but that is indeed rare ( and it is big ) . And it is rare for a reason . Size , weight , cost and benefit . The biggest benefit of regulating a power supply is in the input where the gain is formed . The output stage , where no voltage amplification occurs , is far less sensitive to the benefits of regulation . <p> A voltage regulator is , in effect , an amplifier . It has an input , output , and typically employs negative feedback . Adding a regulator to a low power circuit , like an input gain stage , does not take a lot of circuit real estate nor does it produce much heat . But try to add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the BHK , and you 're likely to increase real estate and heat by a factor of 50% and the benefits to doing so are minimal at best . Not always the most sensible choice . <p> So , to answer the question first posed , a great deal of time and money on power supplies is already spent on properly designed amplifiers . The BHK , for example , has 8 discrete voltage regulation stages and two power transformers " a healthy power arrangement by anyones standards . But to fully regulate the cruder , unregulated , output stage would add far more weight and heat sink area and all for little benefit . <p> Most modern well designed amplifiers have solved the age old problem faced by power amp designers . By a careful blend of regulated and unregulated power , great products that produce gobs of audio power are crafted. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 10 COMMENTS <p> Paul , I was involved with Audio by VanAlstine a few years back , and I built regulated supplies for the output stages . It clearly improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now standard in many of their products . Because the bhk uses a differential output stage , the advantages of regulated outputs might be less . Perhaps part of the reason my mono bhks are better than the stereo bhk is because that output supply is more regulated , having to feed only one channel . I think you should ask Bascom . <p> I am sure regulating the supply would have benefits , I would just be surprised if they are big ones . But it sounds like you 've found otherwise . How big are these power amplifiers ? I can only imagine a regulator that does not restrict the power delivery of the output stage would be quite large if the amp power was big enough . <p> Paul , I think you would be surprised and it sounds like you have not tried it . The AVA amps with regulated supplies go up to 300 watts/channel . I have some ideas I would be happy to discuss with you offline . <p> Wade a minit ! Wade a New Yawk minit ! I can still add 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got speakers out there that weigh 400 , 500 , 800 pounds and more . It takes four gorillas to shove them around and they have to do it for weeks . In the end they use a micrometer to set them . Then they have to lift them up to put them on spikes . <p> The power supply for the output stage can be on a separate chassis or just the regulated section . You set it down once next to the rest of the amp once and done . How much could it weigh . Cost is n't a factor . The amp JA used for the YG Sonja 1.3 cost $44,000 and there are far more expensive amplifiers out there . That it " might " only give slightly better results is no excuse . Audiophiles listen to different fuses , different wall outlets . More than one guy ( I wo n't mention any names but one of them has the initials acuvox and he s not alone ) claims he can hear sound above 20 khz through his eyes . If he wears glasses I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to build the best amplifier in the world . Now I hear equivocating , compromise , and sorry old friend , excuses . Audiophiles will pay anything for the best . So why not at least offer it as an option ? There , Ive given you a way to make more money and I do n't  even charge you a fee for the suggestion . " Bascom , I 've got another small job for you . When will you have some free time ? " Or you could just outsource it to a company that makes power supplies and buy it OEM . Lambda still in the business ? I 'm sure there are plenty of them out there . All you have to do is write the specs and bid it out . <p> Yeah , well , there is no such thing as a perfect anything and everything has limits . I still believe the BHK is the best amplifier in the world or , certainly , among the top two or three regardless of price . Could it be better ? Everything can be bettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a product . <p> Or you could buy a power regenerator . That you can use for two amps , along with other things like DACs and turntables . Why build one into every amp , when you can make it a separate piece that can power more than just the amp ? <p> We design them , we do not make them . They are made in Sri Lanka , of all places . Best transformer manufacturer in the world never had transformers of this quality with no mechanical noise . They are amazing . Took us years to find this company . <p> Hand wound or machine wound ? Maybe hand wound is good on a phono cartridge . But on a power transformer I 'd opt for the precision of machine winding .

@@23909619 @3909619/ <h> NAS , choosing the right one <p> In yesterdays post I detailed the four elements of a basic network music system . <p> NAS with a DLNA server installed ( most have them already ) <p> iPad or Android mobile device <p> WIFI router <p> DAC that can accept an ethernet cable <p> The heart of this system is the NAS . It has all the music storage , provides the computer to manage everything , and the server . The- tablet , with appropriate software , is the interface between you and the system , known as the controller . - The WIFI router is the highway system that connects everything together . And the DAC with an ethernet input is the device used to convert digital audio into analog audio we can hear from our speakers . This is called the renderer ( or player ) . <p> Together , the three main elements , server , controller , renderer , form the basis of a DLNA/UPnP network music system . <p> Today . let 's discuss the NAS . <p> When we started this series I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard drive tethered to an internal computer , accessed over- a home network . Hard drives are hard drives ; you choose them by size and speed . So , let 's just assume the internal hard drive is a non-issue to keep this all easy . Deal ? <p> Choosing the NAS you need boils down to- its internal computer and what software is installed on it. - I am also going to further assume you intend to use this NAS to build a music system . If you need it for other things , the following pointers may not be helpful . <p> Focusing solely on the computer inside the NAS , because we now understand this is the heart of the device , is much like choosing any computer . You look at its specs and find the one with the fastest speed , greatest amount of RAM , etc . And then you look to make sure there 's a DLNA compatible program- installed . And that 's basically it . ( there are other things for the more advanced , like backup ) . <p> The computers built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a very good operating system . Plus , NAS have n't any user interface and just do one job . So running a NAS on Windows or OSX would n't offer designers any advantage and would wind up costing you a lot more money with little benefit . The Linux operating system runs much of the world from airport control towers to much of the internet , its use is growing . <p> I did a quick survey of the most popular NAS you 're likely to find : Qnap , Synology , Western Digital , Intel , NetGear , and Buffalo . I found that they are all pretty much the same in terms of their computers . Most run what 's called an Intel Atom computer , typically dual core , and running at 1.7gHz . Not a bad little computer . The Qnap had models that ran- Intel Celeron at nearly twice the speed , but those models are far more expensive and its questionable whether that extra speed would matter to you . <p> So , here 's the long and short of it . Look at the brands I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than adequate to stream music to your DAC . Without exception , they all have a DLNA program installed . Without exception , they are all fast enough to work in a high end music streaming system without hiccups or compromises . Choose the various models based on price , and hard drive size . <p> There 's only one last thing we need to worry about . The software running the DLNA server . That can make a HUGE difference , and that 's what well start on tomorrow . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 7 COMMENTS <p> If you have a little knowledge or can get someone to help you , I beleive the better NAS is a PC with a bunch of discs in RAID configuration . It allows you to use whaterver soft you want , to add further discs when needed , and if something brokes down its easy to repair or just put the discs in a new PC . The last time I used a NAS ( LaCie ) the motherboard failed and it cost me a lot to recover the info and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC working as home server in the closet under the stairs and access it by remote desktop , so no need for monitor/keyboard or mouse . <p> My preferred brand of NAS is Synology . They provide frequent free updates for their Disk Station Manager ( OS ) and a good variety of apps and they can run the often mentioned minimserver . They also have their own version of RAID that allows you to mix and match drives of different capacity without wasting disk space . For speed , stay away from their economy J Series and go with a least their Value series and preferably their Plus series . BTW : Synology is coming out with a router in 2016 ( RT1900ac ) that will have a nice front end for setup and management . <p> If you go the computer server route For raid you have two options . One a mother board that handles it directly or a raid controller card But raid in any form is not best for Music sound What Pauls is posting a kind of stand alone system that can go directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option <p> Paul , Would you comment at some point about how to use a NAS without a DAC having an Ethernet capability . Perhaps using a MacMini/laptop/IPad such as you have and putting the NAS on the internet and not be limited to a LAN so that maybe one could use the same music source NAS for homes in multiple locations ? <p> Many people use a NAS just as storage that is connected over the network . In fact , this is perhaps the most used means of employing NAS in the system . The NAS sits anywhere in the home and is accessed by as many computers as you wish . The computer nearest the DAC , like a Mac Mini , accesses the NAS library over the network and then connects to the DAC via USB . <p> I considered Drobo , Qnap and Synology . From my research , it seemed like Drobo was the ultra elegant solution and Qnap offered stellar hardware . However , due to budgeting constraints , I purchased the Synology DS415play which has been solid and , like others remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more improvement , seem to improve greatly with each major update . <p> One VERY negative point against NAS or at least a point to really take care of is that most of them have an automatic cooling fan providing some disturbing noise if the NAS gets used in the listening room ( vaild for most simple installations or if the user will not rely on WLAN ( which is slower + not as solid in terms of data transfer interrupts + does add . " electro-smog " in the room ) as a connection via ethernet cabling between NAS and router and renderer ) . <p> Your readers should ( must ) know about this issue as long as a fan may be part of a NAS ( I know that there are some NAS on the market which do n't  have a fan but these are usually the smaller NAS units with only " one disk capability " ) . <p> I wish you + your family + your employees a continued merry christmas Paul ! 
@@23909623 @3909623/ <h> RAM and music servers <p> I let you know in yesterdays postthat my RAM would show up today via FedEx . Indeed it did but yesterday was a crazy busy day as we work through the new website issues , helping folks get their products registered and launching a new forum . Plus I got ta get ready to fly to Chicago this afternoon so I can play DirectStream at the Axpona show . oh , and not to forgetlisten testing DirectStreams as they roll off the production " line " ( they are actually all hand built ) . <p> But , its been on my mind and I made enough time to perform the experiment yesterday . As you may recall , my Mac Mini music server has 4GB of RAM from the factory . The program I am using to play my music through is Bit Perfect . This program allows iTunes to be used as the interface but never let 's iTunes have anything to do with playing back the music . That 's a good thing , I assure you . Bit Perfect grabs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into RAM memory ; and the program allows you to select how much RAM is being used as a ( sort of ) Digital Lens . Bit Perfects designer recommend no more than 1/4 the RAM be used for music ; thus I have it set to 512MB . <p> So this is always a bit difficult because unlike a normal A/B test , I have to listen to a multitude of tracks to get a feel for the sound . Really familiarize myself . Once I am pretty comfortable with how specific tracks are sounding in Music Room One , I can turn off the server , take it into the lab and replace the RAM . That process takes about 10 minutes . Then its back to the Music Room for the comparison . <p> To be honest , my emotional side wanted to hear a big improvement , while my technical side said BS . I got a little of both . <p> Best I could tell , there was little to no difference with the new RAM installed . Now remember , I went from 4GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest there was any change at all , I would say it had better height across the board . Yeah , I know , I do n't  believe it either . But there it is . So far , Ive manage to waste $150 on the RAM increase . But , as I said yesterday , the proper way to do this is step by step . <p> Next I wanted to see what increasing the RAM allocated by Bit Perfect would do . I changed it in steps , each time doubling the RAM starting at 512MB , then 1024 , etc . Now I am hearing a difference as I take each step up in RAM allocation . As the " Digital Lens " memory buffer is getting larger , I am hearing improvements . Much greater depth , width of the soundstage . Better individual placement of musicians on the stage , upper harmonics more intact .

Moving to 2GB of RAM brought amazing body to the instrument and both the double bass and the singer are more in the room than ever before . Amazing . Definitely worth $150 . <p> But here 's the trick : moving to 4GB takes a step backwards for some reason . Go figure . I did it several times and just some of the magic is gone .

Their treble response was clean without sounding edgy , allowing me to enjoy longer listening sessions than I have with any other amp .

@@23909626 @3909626/ <h> Crossovers <p> Perhaps the single best reason to use separate speakers drivers is not to lower distortion , but to optimize performance . A woofer can move a lot of air because of its size , mass and length of piston movement ; all necessary requirements for lower frequency musical notes . A tweeter , on the other hand , has the opposite characteristics : small size , low mass and small piston movement . Each is optimized for the task at hand . <p> A woofer will always be better and making low notes than a tweeter will be at the same task . <p> But how do you separate the low notes from the high notes ? Through the use of a crossover network . <p> There are two types of elements used in a typical crossover : a capacitor and an inductor . <p> A capacitor- can not pass DC ( battery voltage ) , but it easily passes AC and that makes it very useful for a number of purposes . <p> The difference between AC and DC is movement . AC is voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ) . Its what music is . Move between on and off quickly enough and we mimic air pressure movement that pushes our eardrums in and out to hear . Connect the fast moving AC to a loudspeaker driver and it too moves in and out , on and off , and we hear sound . <p> DC does not move . Instead there is a constant + and - . Just picture a battery with its two terminals sitting there and you will understand DC . <p> Now let 's put this knowledge together to understand how a capacitor helps us with our crossover . Capacitors do not pass DC , they only pass AC . So far , so good . But as I mentioned earlier , the difference between AC and DC is movement : the first moves , the second does n't  . But movement is somewhat of a relative term and it depends on how close you 're looking . DC actually does move , it only does it slowly ; sometimes very slowly like glass . Glass is actually a very slow moving liquid but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid . <p> If we speed- DC- up , perhaps moving from on to off once per second , we now start to call it AC because we can see movement . To a capacitor , any movement makes a difference in what passes through it or does n't  and the determining factor in what moves through or stays put is size . The bigger the capacitor , the more low moving AC it will pass . Bigger equals lower in a capacitor . <p> So to use a capacitor in a crossover network , the simplest thing to do is put it between the power amplifier and the tweeter . Depending on the size of the capacitor , lower frequencies like bass notes will not push through to the tweeter , while everything above those frequencies will pass right on through unimpeded by the capacitor . The speaker designer need only choose the proper sized capacitor to suit his needs and we have our first crossover element . <p> Tomorrow the inductor. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 4 COMMENTS <p> Crossover networks are nothing more than frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that handle them best . Capacitors allow current at high frequencies to pass through them easily ( that 's not exactly technically correct but it 's a good enough explanation for this discussion . ) They restrict the flow of current to an increasing degree as frequency gets lower . DC is zero frequency so capacitors block DC almost completely . Inductors do the opposite . They allow current at low frequencies to pass through easily but restrict current flow at high frequencies.So individually or in combination they can be used to build frequency selective circuits called filters . The single most important element in a crossover network is the capacitor in series with the tweeter . The reason is simple . If you bypass this capacitor , that is connect a short circuit around it , your tweeter whether it 's the 5 cent mylar tweeters I bought or a $400 Revelator tweeter will see low frequencies that will cause them to move beyond their maximum design excursion and they will be destroyed almost instantly . Capacitors are not only used in series to restrict low frequencies from reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parallel to shunt high frequencies around woofers to reduce their distortion too.Crossover networks can be simple such as a single capacitor in series with a tweeter or very complex with many parts which can also include resistors as well as inductors and capacitors . Crossover networks can also serve as equalization circuits within a driver 's range too . In this way they alter the overall frequency response of the speaker system . It is important to know if you 're an experimenter that the precise action of a crossover network depends not only on what parts are used and how they are connected together but the impedance of both the source ( amplifier ) and load ( speaker driver ) they are connected to . So if you buy or build a crossover network say for an 8 ohm tweeter which is intended to produce a 12 db per octave falloff below 5 khz and you connect it to a 4 ohm tweeter instead it will perform very differently . For this reason , if you want to adjust the loudness of a driver you ca n't simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossover network operates into as you turn it . Instead a special type of volume control called an L-pad combines two potentiometers on the same shaft , one in series , the other in shunt . The load impedance the crossover network sees remains constant but you can adjust the voltage to the driver to make it louder or softer . Designing crossover networks like the rest of a speaker system is part science and part black art .

@@23909630 @3909630/ <h> NAS , player <p> Were nearing the end of this series and before its over I promise to figure out how to make a diagram of the whole network music system- for you . <p> Yesterday we covered the controller , the one piece of the three parts to a DLNA music system : server , controller , player , that many of us are familiar with . The controller connects the user to the system and presents information of what 's in the library , and provides a means of selecting and playing tracks . <p> From a designers standpoint , the last piece of this DLNA puzzle is by far the hardest to design , most important when it comes to sound quality . The player . Servers and controllers in this system have little impact on how the system sounds " if any . But the player , the one that connects to your DAC , is critical . <p> In the PS Audio system we rely on a device called the Network Bridge . A PC board with a computer and Digital Lens built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as another input . In other DLNA systems , like Linns and Naims offerings , a similar- arrangement of internal computer is- built in to their DACs . Still other players ( renderers ) are external and there are a fine crop of them , including the Sonore Rendu , Aurender N100H , Auralic Aries , among others . <p> These devices are all similar in what they do , which is a lot . The player is by far the most complex device in the entire chain . Not only does it have to take files and configure them for a DAC , it- also has to decode many of them . For example , when you see that a device can play the following file types : <p> AAC <p> AIFF <p> ALAC <p> APE <p> DIFF <p> DSF <p> FLAC <p> MP3 <p> OGG <p> WAV <p> WV <p> WMA <p> With few exceptions , each of these file types has to have a separate program to decode it , prep it for delivery , do what designers think best to get rid of jitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DAC . Its a big deal , and the skill of the designer and programmer for the player has everything to do with how it will end up sounding . <p> DACs can take audio in only one way . I2S . I2S is the internal format of all DACs and has separate clocks and data on multiple lines . When your transport outputs digital audio through TOSLINK , Coax , or XLR , it is sent with only a few wires . All the many separate clocks and data are mushed together into a single stream in a format invented by Sony and Philips years ago , called S/PDIF ( Sony Philips Digital Interface ) . A DAC does not know what to do with S/PDIF- and there 's an input circuit that tears this stream into its component parts , I2S , before presenting it to the DAC . <p> External network players are no different . Once they 're finished with processing and decoding the music streamed to them , they too wind up with- I2S . They then also mush- I2S together into a single stream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then undoes all their work and we get- I2S again . ( and yes , there 's always some quality- lost in the process " just like with USB ) . Some devices , like the PS Audio Bridge , Linn and Naims internal streamers , output only- I2S which is the advantage of built in streaming . A few external devices , like Sonores Rendu , use a protocol invented by PS Audio Engineering and distributed freely to the Audiophile manufacturing community , that takes advantage of HDMIs superior connectors and cables to deliver- I2S- directly to DACs that can accept it . <p> Tomorrow well start to wrap up our series on NAS. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 19 COMMENTS <p> Question : 1 . The raw DAC only accepts I2S . The NAS , or other external disc , sends its data to the DAC via an interface of some sort . That interface may be a MAC computer running a program such as AMARRA . In this case the MAC computer with the program may be regarded as the Network Player . The computer decodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I2S signal over the USB ( in most cases ) to the DAC . The DAC is receiving an I2S signal . Is my understanding correct ? 2 . A product such as the PS Audio Network Bridge receives the bit stream from the disc and decodes that to an I2S signal which is sent directly to the DAC. 3 . The implication of the above is that a product such as the PS Audio Network Bridge removes one step . Is that step an additional level of coding to transform the I2S into something that will go over the USB , and then the DAC has to transform that back to I2S again ? <p> In other words , I am trying to figure out the benefit of a dedicated network player such as the PS Audio Bridge , or the Bryston Player product , versus a computer with a player program ( such as a MAC with Amarra ) . ( I realize that Amarra also acts as a controller it is a controller and a player , would be my understanding ) . <p> The Network Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAC ( and properly designed ) , does eliminate one step and is therefore , theoretically , better sounding . That 's certainly true in the case of the Network Bridge . <p> But much depends on the DAC itself . Imagine a DAC that does n't  sound as good as another yet it has built in network capabilities . The end result would likely not be as good sounding as possible , even with an external network player . <p> Its difficult to make sweeping generalizations as you 'd like to do . <p> The Bryston player is a good device . It may , or may not , sound as good/better than a computer connected via USB . It all depends on what you 're comparing it to . The reason is simple at least in this one example . Inside the Bryston ( I assume the BDP2 ) is a computer too no different than a Mac Mini except the Brystons computer has ( hopefully ) been optimized for the one task , where the Mac Mini ( for example ) has n't  . <p> If you already have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good choice . If you already have our DAC , the Bridge would be a better choice . <p> It was not my intent to make a sweeping generalization . But to your point , at the end of the day , Audio is somewhat like wine . I happen to enjoy wine and have an extensive wine cellar . Some would say that I am knowledgeable about wine . The best advice , however , is " if you like a wine , then buy it by the case " . <p> In the specific case of the PS Audio Network bridge connected to the PS Audio DAC the step of converting to a USB bitstream and then back to I2S is eliminated . Is that correct ? ( In the general case I would offer that elimination of coding steps may reduce , but not necessarily eliminate , artifacts that might be introduced by additional electronic processing ) . <p> Paul , I understand from what you wrote that HDMI is superior compared to USB . Clock and data are transmitted separatly . Which DACs could I connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HF noise and computer debris on a HDMI cable than on USB ? Or are there differences in galvanical separation ? <p> If you 're using the HDMI cable for I2S data , then the quality matters a great deal . You do n't  have to spend a lot you just need to make sure its rated for the highest HDMI speeds and is well shielded . <p> HDMI per se is n't necessarily better or worse than USB . We use HDMI connectors and cables to transfer I2S so its not technically HDMI . USB is ok , its a two-way communication between a computer and a peripheral , like a DAC . There 's a lot of computer noise polluting the DAC via USB , which you do n't  suffer with our scheme of using HDMI cables for I2S data , as well , you do n't  get that noise with S/PDIF but with both S/PDIF and USB you have to decode the data USB more so than S/PDIF . <p> I use a toslink cable from my computer to my ol DLIII , and the sound is noticably better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a optical out as most laptops do not provide them anymore . That is why I am tempted to try HDMI . But what I guess from your answer , HDMI out of a computer is again another format . It just seems to be like I2S , in that the clock and data are transmitted separatly ? There seems to be no way to get I2S out of a computer . And there seem to be no serious DACs which can handle IEEE 1394 or HDMI plugandpraywise . Btw , a NAS is no solution for me . My laptop is running all day long anyway , and I do n't  see the point in running a second computer in a NAS . A second 1TB HDD in my laptop gives room enough for my music . Plus I can easily switch to music editing with Samplitude , Sound Forge etc , stream radio , and so on . Everything on one machine keeps things small and beautiful for me . Chris <p> If I read the discussion correctly , this is not sending audio over HDMI protocol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit i2s directly between two dedicated boxes that have buffered i2s transmitter and receiver respectively connected to HDMI type connectors , but using a completely different signal . It will not work with a computer HDMI port . <p> This is a good idea because it leverages all the engineering and manufacturing knowledge invested in HDMI plus the quality control to the published standard , which certifies digital data accuracy . As a general rule , any wire that will transmit 100MB data streams will do very well for audio , whether analog or digital . The characteristic impedance has to be very well controlled and the dielectric absorbtion has to be low and linear . <p> I found you 're site a few days ago and its been most helpful as I 'm in the process of building a new network based system . I have a Melco NAS currently connected to a Chord Dave directly controlled using Kinsky . Before I had the Melco and the Dave , I used to use Jriver between my Zoneripper NAS and my DAC , I liked the JRiver interface and its flexibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or detrimental to use Jriver between the Melco and my DAC ? Thanks ! Chris . <p> This has been a good read , Paul . All of your posts are interesting and informative to me and for that I thank you . I 'm more of a lurker and enjoy the comments of others . <p> Some of us do n't  own PSAudio gear , but I hope to perhaps next year . <p> Everything I listen through is vintage 70s gear , with the exception of my HRT Musicstreamer II+ DAC and home built tower PC running JRiver 21 . It works as a DLNA server and any device at home can play anything from the 2TB drive I use for storage in the tower . <p> Your post about jitter and mention of the Jitterbug interested me.so I bought one and a DragonTail to get it out of harms way . Citation 17 and Citation 16a driving a pair of Gale GS401 chromes is my chosen system . Even through this modest system , the addition of the Jitterbug made a positive listening experience , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSD as an upgrade . I pretty sure it will make an impact on my system and me . <p> Did you want to go network ? I might simply suggest a computer tied to Sprout through USB would be the simplest . There are n't  any low cost renderers I am aware of , though maybe someone else could chime in with more knowledge of what 's available ? <p> Thanks for this series , Paul . It is interesting . I have to differ with you on one comment : That the server makes little difference in sound quality . I once had the opportunity to hear an A/B comparison of the same digital music file played from a hard disc drive , then from a solid state drive . The difference , on a small but highly resolving system , was startling . If I misread your post , I apologize , but I am convinced that SSD playback is significantly superior to HDD playback , all else being equal . YMMV , as they say . <p> Aha ! Yes , that is true , but let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done on a computer and not a NAS . Am I right ? <p> I will assume so . The difference is that when you connect through a computer , you connect directly to the DAC and small changes in the server ( the computer ) affect power supply and things directly connected to the DAC . <p> In the case of a NAS , there is galvanic isolation and this does not happen .

USB attached hard drives are popular , cheap and easy to use ; just plug them into a computer and they just work . NAS are not as easy to use , but they do have other advantages and they too are coming down in price .

Pretty neat except that DsAudio has n't  a very nice user interface ( as much basic music player does ) The problem I had was that the imaging of the music was much better when streaming it from Tidal ( using Devialet Air ) however the recording was supposed to be less defined ( a lot ) . Was this famous Devialet Air such a revolution in audio ? <p> Then I discovered Roon and I had to place a computer in the middle ( yeah , a Mac Mini , an old one ) . The seamless integration of both libraries , NAS and Tidal , is a true no way back . The computer is connected to the DAC via the same AQ Carbon I used before .

Nor do I know anything about Devialet , which is another factor . I use MinimServer and recommend it highly . Also , remember that you can use any control point you like . The iPad app that Synology supplies is , as you say , kind of primitive . The best control points are probably BubbleUPnP for Android or mconnect for iOS . <p> Ive tried minimserver as I wanted to use the app from Linn , Kazoo , but this nice server app does n't  see my Devialet as a sound card ( which is weird as it should be at OS level ) and the Devialet is n't UPNP yet . <p> I 'm very glad to see this topic addressed I love my NAS and agree that this technology is under-appreciated in the US .

An inexpensive used laptop running Windows 7 and JRiver ( here is the JRiver vs. other software argument again ) acts as the server and from there all my iDevices , my receiver , even my TV or BD player , can recognize the JRiver server and pull music from it . <p> Note , at no time do I play music directly from that computer , I simply use it to host the server software . All my playback devices throughout the home have their own DACs , they just take the digital stream offered up by the JRiver server software . I do have another workstation elsewhere in the house and can also use it to control the media streams , but it has its own USB DAC as well . <p> To top it all off , I have configured my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or my JRiver software on my work computer , to the home WAN IP which port forwards to the JRiver server and so I can stream my own files over the web to my phone or computer .

This sounds nice ( applause please ) but not only my NAS is quite silent but you can always put them away , far from the listening room . A fan less NAS could be cool ( applause again ! ) since it vibrates less is n't ? Less vibration is bringing less disturbance usually . Is that true for a NAS as well ? Would it make sense to use SSD even ? <p> Are there NAS better than others for playing/serving audio ? On most audio shows they use QNap . Linn supports QNap only .

@@23909635 @3909635/ <p> After what 's turned out to be a rather lengthy discussion in these pages about balanced circuitry I was prepared to move on today . Recent postings by others , as well as multiple emails from some of my readers suggest perhaps we spend a few days more finishing the subject . Then well move on . <p> Part of the issue turns out to be vernacular . What 's the definition of a balanced audio circuit ? To some it means symmetrical amplification chains . To others , like me , it means differential amplification taking advantage of common mode rejection . Definitions , by their very nature , can have multiple meanings . I think this is one of those cases . In the interest of thoroughness I will touch on symmetry for a few days and then well move on . But first , one last word about balanced audio . I promised at the beginning of this series to explain how one can tell if a circuit is balanced or not balanced , in so far as the input is concerned . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that is in common , such as noise and distortion , while amplifying the differences between its two inputs ( balanced audio always has two signal wires ; unbalanced RCA- has only one ) . <p> Those inputs are made different by flipping the phase ( polarity ) of one vs. the other ; thus as one signal wire goes positive the other goes negative . <p> What this means is rather simple , yet important to grasp . Balanced audio signals are twice as loud as those of single ended audio . Technically referred to as +6dB , - balanced signals that are rendered properly in an audio circuit with a differential input , are louder by double that of single ended signals . Why is this ? Look at the example of the balanced audio signal showing Pin 2 ( hot ) going positive while Pin 3 ( cold ) is going negative . Note the distance between the two is double , relative to a single signal wire and ground . Like two cars traveling away from each other at the same speed , covering twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between them thus produce twice the voltage in an amplifier that only amplifies differences . <p> Tomorrow well start on complementary circuits . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 5 COMMENTS <p> Hmmm , there not only seems to be some confusion due to unfortunate terminology that evolved many decades ago but other misconceptions as well . The term " balanced " conductors is IMO a misnomer . Instead it should be " floating . " It is distinguished from so called unbalanced conductors by the fact that neither of the two conductors are connected to any kind of reference ground . In an unbalanced signal circuit , the outer conductor is used as both the shield and signal return . The inner conductor carries voltage above and below this reference ground potential . The ground is not necessarily an earth ground , just a common reference point in the circuit . In the balanced conductor connection , the grounded outer shield conductor is electrically separate . In complex network topologies such as in a recording studio this reduces the possibility of hum inducing ground loops where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . Home audio systems are much simpler and generally do n't  suffer this particular problem . <p> The voltage between the signal conductors whether balanced or unbalanced is the same shape , the unbalanced conductors just do n't  have a reference point . The balanced conductors are twisted so that any noise induced in one conductor from outside sources is induced in the other but in the opposite phase . Were they not twisted , one conductor might shield the other and this cancellation effect would be less pronounced . <p> There are many types of symmetrical circuit topologies , a differential amplifier being only one of them . Class B and class AB amplifiers are other examples . So are Wheatstone bridges , a full wave rectifiers , and FM discriminators , each with its own purpose . Are these circuits truly " balanced ? " Only if their components are carefully matched and voltages carefully adjusted , that is they are constructed to be precise electrical mirror images of each other . <p> So , this brings up the question again as to whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment to improve your system performance and my answer remains a resounding YES ! And please do n't  forget the ASPCAE especially around the holidays when so many music deprived children go begging for better sound than they get from their i-pods . Your donations will be greatly appreciated . Just imagine the look of joy on those little smiling faces on Christmas morning when they unwrap their presents and find your now obsolete gear under their tree . <p> Thanks for continuing this topic and especially for todays post . I think it may explain why one of my favorite and controversial components , the BSG Technologies QOL Signal Completion Stage , has a 3 to 6 dB boost when its " signal completion " stage is engaged vs bypassed . BSG claims the signal boost is due to the increased musical information that is unlocked when hidden phase relationships in the musical signal are restored . I now suspect that their balanced circuitry ( Larry Kay told me the qol is " truly balanced " ) is largely responsible for the boost . <p> I have a Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess if it is " truly balanced " ? I 'd guess that if all the circuitry from the input to the modulator were truly differential , it would be , eh ? <p> Depends on how it is designed but its pretty rare that a class D amp would be true balanced given the way they work . The analog input stage before it might be , but most of the designs I am familiar with use a single comparator for the conversion to PWM . Having written that . most of the output stages of PWM amplifiers are balanced outputs . <p> I do n't  think a differential digital path makes sense . But you should get the benefits of common mode cancelation if the analog front end up to the comparator is fully differential , right ? And you brought up a second point , that the output stages need to be fully differential too for a Class D amp to legitimately claim to be " fully balanced . " Right ? ( Great topic , btw ) 
@@23909637 @3909637/ <h> Feeding transistors <p> The care and feeding of our friend the transistor is an art ; many spend their lives learning it and all that is entailed . In yesterdays post- I showed a cascode circuit consisting of two such devices needing to be fed . This subject came up when those watching our new video series on the BHK amplifier heard mention from Bascom . <p> Q1 is easily fed by a connection to the music source , which could be a preamplifier- if we were discussing the input of a power amp . Q2 is much different , connected only by Q1 in a technique known as Common Base . <p> Amplification devices have three terminals to them : Emitter , Collector and Base if it is a transistor . Here is a picture of how one is represented . <p> Typical connection for this amplifying device would be to place the music into the Base ( B ) . If you wanted to make an amplifier with power to drive a speaker , your output would come from the Emitter ( E ) and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base . If , instead , you wished to make the output larger than the input , as you might in a preamplifier , you use the Collector as your output ( C ) . This classic circuit description is how we configure tubes and transistors of all types and if you look at the original drawing , Q1 is setup to make the signal larger , as in a preamplifier. - Using this configuration we have many fine qualities : high input impedance , reasonable distortion and linearity among them . <p> If we change the- configuration , however , so the music goes into the Emitter first , rather than the base , ( as we see in Q2 ) our amplifying device takes on a new set of characteristics better than the classic just described : improved linearity , distortion , and faster transient speed . So why not always use that which is represented by Q2 ? Input impedance is low , nearly zero and connecting a preamplifier to this point would squash its output signal rendering it useless . It needs something in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transistors give performance levels identical to a single device , which is why we use it . Lastly , you might wonder if the grounded base style of connection is useful on its own , given its very low input impedance and the answer is yes . A- moving coil phono cartridge loves to see a very low input impedance and this is a perfect place for just such a circuit without benefit of Q1. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 2 COMMENTS <p> Thanks for great post .

Hornseither actual animal horns or manmade constructions that mimicked animal hornsare found being used to amplify sound as far back as there is recorded history . <p> A good view of several types of external gramophone horns . <p> It 's hardly surprising , then , that horns quickly became part of the picture in sound reproduction , just as they had been in sound production . Horns became an integral part of early phonographs to increase the volume of sound produced by mechanical sound-boxes , both the familiar external - straight-sided trumpet and flared morning glory varieties , and more complex geometries contained with the cabinetry of console phonographs . <p> When Peter Jensen and Edwin Pridham developed the moving coil loudspeaker in 1911 ( as described inVintage Whine #9 ) , the first thing they did was couple it to a horn , to make it louder . In this initial case , it was too loud , and we had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled to the throat of the speaker , labeled #2 in the bottom diagram . <p> Jensen and Pridham permanently coupled their prototype to a horn , and mounted it atop the chimney of their building . The two played records through the set-up , which locals were said to enjoy , miles away . With the onset of electrical amplification , large public address systems became possible ; in 1915 , such a Jensen-Pridham " Magnavox " system provided Christmas music to a crowd of 100,000 in San Francisco . In 1919 , Woodrow Wilson became the first American President to be electrically amplified through a Magnavox system , delivering a speech to a sizable crowd . <p> Starting in the teens and going into the 1920s , the Bell Systems Western Electric division , known primarily as a manufacturer of telephone receivers , became one of the first manufacturers of " Loud Speakers " for home radio sets . Prior to this , individual listeners had to utilize earphones ; the new " receivers " ( telephone parlance was still used to describe the speaker units ) allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note that the $161 set-up shown below was fully half the price of a contemporary Ford Model T , and would be equivalent to about $2200 today . <p> This period ad shows what looks like a 10D speaker with a 7C amplifier , using WE 216 " tennis ball " vacuum tubes , circa 1921 . <p> As the years went on , Western Electric became a leading provider of broadcast and sound-reinforcement systems , and became involved with movie theater sound in its earliest days . A wide variety of horn systems was designed and produced to suit theaters of all shapes and sizes ; the fascinating Movie Micewebsite shows a number of such systems . The amazing dual-horn 16A system is shown below , with four 555 compression drivers . <p> The 16A horn is still much revered among vintage audio fans , as are the 555 compression drivers . <p> The leading WE theater system was known as the " widerange " system , for its broad frequency response ( keep in mind that meant it still dropped like a rock above 10 kHz ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lansing Heritage website , that system had serious problems , mostly due to the phase delays between the WE 555 compression drivers mounted on long " snail-horns " and the bass drivers , as well as high distortion and low efficiency from the open-baffle 18 ? woofers . <p> The Western Electric " Widerange " system . <p> The next level of development in theater sound systems initiated due to dissatisfaction with the Western Electric " Widerange " systemand this is where the genealogy becomes confusedand confusing . Again , thanks to Lansing Heritage for keeping the story straight . <p> John Hilliard of movie studio MGMs sound department sought to create a system that overcame the problems of the WE " Widerange " system , and approached WE about doing so . After a year , nothing had happened , and Hilliard was approached by Jim Lansing and Dr. John Blackburn of Lansing Manufacturer ( antecedent of both Altec-Lansing and JBL ) , who had similar concenrs about theater sound systems . Given the go-ahead from Douglas Shearer , head of MGMs sound department ( and brother of actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ultimately known as the Shearer Horn ( shown at the top of the page ) . <p> The system was two-way , with a bass re-entrant horn ( as opposed to the " Widerange " systems open baffle ) using four 15 ? Lansing field-coil woofers , crossed over at 500 Hz to a multicellular horn designed and built in MGMs shops by Robert Stephens ( who later founded speaker manufacturer Stephens Tru-Sonic ) . A wide variety of cell configurations were developed to suit theaters of varied sizes and shapes ; all used Lansing-built compression drivers . <p> The system was found to be far superior to the WE system that provoked the project ; superior enough , in fact , that Western Electric developed its own version using their own drivers , and marketed it as the " Diaphonic " system . RCA marketed several similar systems , and Lansing Manufacturing had exclusive rights to the name " Shearer Horn " . Douglas Shearer himself won a Best Technical Achievement - Academy Award ( " Oscar " ) in 1936 for his role in development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of many Oscars . <p> The Shearer Horn not only set a standard for horn speakers that continues to influence design to this day , but the alliances it created changed the structure of speaker manufacturers in America .

We had kind of a quasi-competition as to which one would end up sounding better . The France theater was much smaller , and frankly had a better soundtrack which was essentially a best hits version of French orchestral music . <p> Steve eventually went with the Community Leviathan ( with extensions , naturally ) system which was absolutely enormous . I went with a combination of components from the kit above . Frankly I thought they were both stunning when done , leaving me with a tremendous appreciation what could be done with horns .

I 'd heard stories about systems capable of moving " lots of air " but that was one time I actually experienced it . <p> If designed right , no other speaker tech can match a horn system .

Unless your equipment was in a pressurised clean room you had the dreaded dust to contend with , Pots sooner or later started to crackle , Natures way of making the transition from pure analogue , and you wasted time treating them with switch cleaner which reduced , but never completely cleared the problem . This was the same dust which made vinyl such a pain . Electrostatic wipes , tracking dust bugs , and directing little puffs of air at the stylus were part of the listening experience .

Exaggerate ? : ) Sure , to make a point I often do . But truth is , remotes for years caused sonic degradation to preamps because of the gyrations we designers had to go through to get the remote controlled . Its not the remote itself that causes degradation , its the components needed . For example , pots sound better than any electronic scheme ( up until a few years ago ) and even pots are n't  that great . <p> I have never lived in a house where the size and shape of the living room , combined with my furniture , would make it possible to put the TT and preamp next to the couch .

Listening to a lot of vinyl , as well as still buying lots of CDs , but not doing any streaming of any kind . <p> What it bad about a remote control for me at least , is that I put on music and then find myself switching song after just 30 s . I think this is because I do not have to think through long enough what I 'm in the mood for listening to . This does not happen when I put on an LP , because the procedure gives me time to think about what I want to hear .

Albums as they were intended to be enjoyed . The temptation to swipe on your iPad as soon as you see something else potentially more intriguing than what is currently playing , and the visual distraction of it like some sort of short-attention-span dating app is too great . <p> Paul , sorry but once again I must disagree with your perspective . " Our equipment is now far from us for one reason . The remote control feature permits it " ! <p> In the first place , in my experience it was rare to see anyone with their preamp/tuner/turntable next to their listening chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so . Far more typical is having components set up in some fashion between the speakers , well beyond arms reach from the listening chair . Many hobbyists chose to have both interconnects and speaker wires as short as possible , and that usually means placement between the speakers . Why ? For the sonic reasons you mention . <p> Also in defense of the remote , many recordings do not have the same volume or necessarily balance from one track to the next . Jumping up and down to reach the controls is eliminated when one can fine-tune level and balance from the listening seat . From my experience this was not as simple an evolution as you suggest . <p> I do not ever remember seeing anyone in the 50s and 60s with the turntable and preamp or receiver within arms reach . As mentioned above , components were either between the speakers or along a side wall . I never thought about getting up to change the record or adjust volume . It was a natural part of the listening experience at the time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I listen almost exclusively to vinyl . Not a big deal . I do use the remote to tweak volume , a nice convenience and my system sounds awesome . <p> Then you 're likely not my age . In the 60s and 70s audiophiles had their controls at the ready . Else , they either did n't  care much for getting proper volume levels or they jumped up and down a lot fine tuning them . <p> Yes , there are clearly advantages to shorter cable lengths , but that 's little reason to sacrifice all that we gave up in the interim between now when we finally have a handle on how to make remote-controlled equipment sound better than mechanically controlled kit a process that took decades . <p> Well , with all due respect I 'm quite certain I 'm older than you . My interest in better quality audio than average consoles began in college in the early 60s and I built my first stereo system around Dynakits in 1966 . Ive been active in audio clubs since the early 70s and have visited many friends to hear their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my observation that placing components by the listening chair was a rare set up . <p> It was n't just the advent of remote control , it was also the steep increase in the cost of cable . I used to have a setup where my preamp and front-end components were away from my speakers and amps , but the setup required 20+ feet of cable between my preamp amd power amps . That system suffered audibly because even the cheapest audiophile interconnect or speaker cable at that length would cost more than the sum of all the components in the system at that time ! <p> So , now all my components are together away from my listening spot , and the longest cable I use is 2 meters . <p> I 'm with the dissent . No doubt , you all have large houses with dedicated audio rooms . If so , remotes are n't  so important ; I get it . But I live in Silicon Valley .

Because the house is open and small , I also have to support headphone options for all three usage models , btw . In fact , I needed a remote that supported both IR and RF because some of the components do n't  fit and are in a different room , accessed via an RF repeater . I use the Logitech Harmony 900 , no longer sold . ( Not sure if they have any IF + RF remotes any more . ) Though setup was itself an engineering exercise , it works great . Family is happy and continues in blissful ignorance of all the goes on when they select an " Activity . " As a plus , I find watching TV or disc is far more pleasant with superb sound . <p> I would not buy an audio component other than a headphone amp or a turntable without a remote . 
@@23909647 @3909647/ <h> Overload <p> Two things you should never do : tease an angry dog , or feed an amplifier too high a frequency . Both will result in bad stuff. - Your rear end may be riddled with teeth marks from the dog , and bright and aggressive sound is likely from your- amplifier . <p> The dogs obvious but perhaps the amplifier is less so . Any amplifier with high open loop gain reduced to reasonable levels by feedback can react poorly when fed a signal beyond its capabilities . Walt Jung discussed some of this problem in a paper I mentioned earlier- Slewing Induced Distortion or SID. - Jung , you 'll recall , was the author of the first book I read on audio design , and the lessons learned from my journey- whose course was set by his words helped me understand the subject- we are discussing today . <p> One of the problems faced by DAC designers- is the very issue at the heart of this post , high frequency overload. - Designers without a great deal of experience will tend to take the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output of a DAC . The DACs output is fed directly into an amplification device and the noise reducing low pass filter is wrapped around the amplifier in a feedback loop . The results of this classic technique are twofold : great measurements , and bad sound . When viewed on test equipment , noise is lowered as expected and the DAC passes even the closest scrutiny . But if the designer takes the unusual step of- listening to the end result ( yes , believe it or not this part of the design process is rare ) , he may be mystified at the aggressive nature of what comes through his speakers . <p> There are several ways he can address this problem . The first would be to change the speed of the amplifier circuit so it no longer goes into overload , but this path has other problems that- can lead to quicksand . <p> Tomorrow I 'll tell you a better way . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 3 COMMENTS <p> Just a comment on using NFB that came up talking to some designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems is to use NFB on a narrow bandwidth device to get wider bandwidth rather than to use it to reduce distortion . If the open loop bandwidth was good then applying NFB properly can produce good sound . A good case I heard of was in a tube power amp . The company did n't  use NFB in their preamps but did in their amp because of the need to compensate for the out put transformers . A good way to tell if the open loop is wide enough is if the damping factor at 20 and 20 kHZ is about the same as the 1 kHZ rating or if the damping factor meets similar standards . <p> This is actually a subject I know something about . The original work was done by Matti Otala at Harman Kardon in the mid 1970s . Like a lot of things it has been unnecessarily embellished to mystify it . Its actually a very simple concept electrical engineers and even tyros should easily understand . Its simply this , when the output level of an amplifier increases , its high frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers tested amplifiers for frequency response at all output levels instead of at just some low nominal value like at one watt or a voltage amplifier at -20 db . The engineering requirement for ideal performance is to have flat response at the highest output level at the highest frequency which is 20 khz or in the case of Redbook CDs 22 khz . In the real world no signal will ever require this level of performance if the output level is sufficient to drive the system to the desired level at mid frequencies . <p> Electrical engineers are familiar with the concept of gain bandwidth product . This is similar . It could be thought of as output level bandwidth product . Negative feedback when properly applied trades off gain for bandwidth . Once the worst case signal criteria is met , no further improvement in electrical performance will be of any value to the user . In fact , extending FR far beyond what is required is not only often expensive , it opens the door to different kinds of noise , distortion , and instability amplifiers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  suffer . Extreme overdesign may provide some sort of psychological comfort but it is IMO in fact bad engineering . <p> Overload as it is normally thought of is not the same as slew rate distortion or transient intermodulation distortion ( TIM . ) In the usual sense , overload means that the total signal level amplitude is greater than the system can handle . The result is harmonic distortion due to peak clipping . The waveform rise time is too fast creating a harsh bright sound due to excessive harmonics or harmonics that shouldnt exist . TIM will result in a loss of high frequencies as the system is unable to deliver high frequency energy fast enough . There the waveform rise time is too slow . The system is overloaded in the sense of too much amplitude at high frequencies . A system can exhibit both forms of distortion even simultaneously . Do they cancel each other out ? Unfortunately no . <p> RBCD was designed to have among other things sufficient bandwidth and dynamic range to accommodate any musical signal conceivable and IMO it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars pop music is engaged in , the input to the analog to digital signal is deliberately raised to the point of overload and consequential distortion . This compresses the signal and makes the average level higher and more ear catching when you 're tuning through radio stations . Personally I do n't  care because this product and this segment of the market is of no interest to me . Distorted or not , I do n't  buy it or listen to it even for free . BTW , this is what a fuzz box does in the analog domain usually to electric guitars , deliberately strongly overloading an amplifier stage to create lots of harmonic distortion . Personally I find it to be a very unpleasant non musical sound . To make it even worse , its often produced at ear shattering loudness levels .

As an example , take my own traveling music system , - which I purposefully built to be small and simple enough to put into my suitcase- along with two nights of clothing . It consists of a Mac Mini , an iPad , a WIFI router , ethernet- cable , USB cable , USB Disrupter , USB Regn , Jitterbug. - What used to be simple has begun growing and gotten me thinking about its redesign . <p> The basic system I built had few- components : Mini , iPad , router , ethernet cable , USB cable .

Because it requires one more item I did not mention . A DAC that can accept the- ethernet cable . Most do n't  have them .

Music is streamed via my normal datamodem directly to my Tidal compliant system ( Naim ) . But , due to that I have a few albums in HD that I bought from HDtrack.com , I have a USB stick attached to the Naim , where the USB function as my " mobile NAS " if you like , complementing Tidal whenever I need to play songs in higher resolution than CD . Hence I have no NAS and no ethernet cabled anywhere , as I just use wi-fi from my datamodem to my Naim for Tidal . It is a childish simple system . And it works well .

I run the free , open source Banshee music server software . Instead of running off of a NAS , all of my music files are local to the laptop . I run an rsync job out of cron nightly to copy everything over to a 3TB backup drive on my main Linux desktop box ( $600 total ) . That machine does a nightly rsync copy of my home directory drive to the 3TB drive , and then copies everything on that backup drive to a Raspberry PI with a 3TB drive hanging off of it ( $160 total ) . Lastly I use the Crashplan backup service which copies everything on the backup drive off-site . <p> So my music files are copied in 4 different places , one of which is off-site . <p> I do n't  have to concern myself with NAS performance or network bandwidth .

First he is looking to show the best of his fine DAC . Next he knows how good it sounds with his bag of stuff and likes its sound . One of my setups is a music server with internal SS drives out to USB though a REGEn or to pull bridge both soiund very good different but not much change .

I cant play DSD easily so the server helps with that but I have plenty of high res discs too . <p> Let 's face it . We go to extraordinary lengths to buy/build/connect music servers . Its a hell of a lot easier just to plug in the CD transport . Putting SQ aside for a moment , for me , its all about the interface .

And it leaves me empty and unfulfilled like hopping into a sporty looking car only to find out its really a wimp when I use them . My expectations are high to use the server as it was intended which is all interface driven . There really is n't much more . <p> Late to the party as usual , I am . Your mention of the Disruptor caught my attention , so on a whim I ordered one . Can not believe the difference with and without . Thank you Paul . Better articulation . The background space is n't " filled up " with a noise I really was n't aware of until it was n't there . <p> Btw , I did add a Jitterbug a couple of months back after you wrote about it . It also had a positive effect , though not as dramatic as the Disruptor did .

They form my musical tastes to this day , although I have extended the range to include hill ' country , bluegrass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a gramophone and collect the earlier stuff that plays with the steel needle . <p> So , with all that in mind I have a few systems , but the main one looks like this <p> The Equipment . Sony PS-X9 broadcast turntable with a Soundsmith modified Denon 103R mc cartridge , with Nordost silver/copper interconnects to a tube-based Manley Steelhead preamp . This preamp is a remarkable piece of engineering , with stunning resolution and great adaptability while being dead quiet . Thence via Bluejeans cables ( approx 40 feet ) to a pair of Manley Neo-Classic 250 watt mono blocks currently in triode mode ( 100 w per channel ) . - These are connected to a pair of JBL 4344 3-way studio monitors and an REL subwoofer , both with KAB rumble filters in-line to quell the inevitable rumble from a direct drive turntable . ( CDs are played through a late 80s Sony ES CD player as transport and a Moon DAC . A nice combination overall , although the player is a little long in the tooth . ) <p> The Sound . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 8 foot ceiling , more or less . Voicing the JBLs took some time . They are adjustable over three frequencies mid , treble and high treble . the treble and high treble are horn loaded compression units . I found it difficult to contain the sibilance of the treble horn while melding it with the mid driver . Interconnects played a big part in this , particularly the turntable to pre-amp . However , using Linda Rondstadt 's Blue Bayou ' as a reference point , over a period of almost a month , I think I finally achieved that sound ' in the last couple of days . Resolution is remarkable . Sound pressure levels are in the 85 95 db range , which sounds high , but JBL speakers are not that efficient so they need more power than most . The interesting part is that , at these levels in a room of this size , you would think that the volume control would be getting a lot of use . Not so .

The speakers are , remarkably , very forgiving of the room . Biggest near-field monitors ever ! But they do have their challenges , especially the horn-loaded treble . I tend to whine , occasionally , about how all their da*n adjustments make it hard to arrive at a sound you like for more than 5 minutes , but vs speakers with no external adjustment , I 'll take the JBLs every time .

But no longer . Concrete walls and sub-floor , and a room twice the length to width solved the problem entirely . For the gear itself , I use Herbys resonance control disks and isolation feet to good effect . The platform for the table is basically 1 1/2 inches of MDF , covered in lead ( ! ) , hanging off a concrete wall on 3 odd-spaced brackets , with a sandbox for added isolation , although I have since removed it as unnecessary .

It is even more interesting than the image itself . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 21 COMMENTS <p> Vinyl reproduction is such a crazy process , its a wonder that it offers quite similar sonic results as other less mechanical concepts . I can understand people thinking , what sense it makes to optimize an imperfect reproduction process with such effort needed and spend so much money for it . I thought so by getting rid of a digital drive by using Bridge/DS at the expense of the lost touch&amp;feel of physical media . <p> I slightly suspect these posings could lead to some news about a previously mentioned possible PSA turntable project I 'd look forward to such a development : - ) Guess it must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation ! ! ? ? But no , you plan to make a big phonostage , toojust speculating : -D <p> As Paul mentioned , linear tracking tonearms have been done . I remember them from when I was in college back in the 70s . My question is , why has n't  this concept been developed in the world of high end playback ? It seems like with the developments in technology that someone could design one that would perform really well for a price that people could afford . <p> Laser pickups have also been done . My question is , could they be made to ignore dust , debris and damage to the record grooves ? Even freshly cleaned vinyl can quickly attract dust . <p> It just seems to me that with so many turntables on the market that cost thousands of dollars that someone could come up with a better mouse trap for that kind of money . Or at least features like full or semi-automatic tonearms , interchangeable headshells so that you could easily swap cartridges without having to remove one and realign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three tonearms for different cartridges and/or tonearms , without sacrificing performance . I realize that these things do exist , but changeable headshells and semi-automatic tonearm lifts seem to be relegated to the lower end . Oh , and let 's include a dust cover to keep dust from settling on the record , and the platter when not in use . <p> About all I can say about a lot of the really expensive turntables is that many of them are massive or look really exotic . When it comes to wow , flutter and rumble , how much better are they than turntables that cost under $1,000 ? <p> Yesterdays post as well as this one got me wondering how those of you who still do vinyl prepare a record to play . The funny turntable of yesterday certainly does n't  lend itself to cleaning the record easily . <p> I 'm not talking a major cleaning with a record cleaning machine , I 'm talking the quick one before the needle hits the groove . I still use my Zerostat gun to discharge static , and use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick glance at the stylus from time-to-time or swipe over it with a stylus cleaning brush and I am good to go . <p> I used to use a Watts cleaning brush as well but no longer do , although still have an anti-static pad on my platter on top of the rubber one that came with the table . I recall reading that some feel that extra brush from the Watts dragging across the record modifies the speed of the platter , if it does I never noticed . I had my local audio guy also chide me for the antistatic pad . His belief is that changes the angle of attack of the stylus in the groove ever so slightly and modifies the sound , again , if so it is not noticeable to me . <p> I think most non-audiophiles do no preparation at all , they pull the record out of the sleeve , put it on , and play it . Even back in the day I recall looking at friends turntables and there was a big fuzz ball built up around the stylus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I had a Rabco ST-4 in in grad school and for a few years beyond ( until I became a real audiophile rather than a simple music lover ) . ; ) <p> The ST-4 was the cheap one in the Rabco line . No servos . The arm travelled on a slowly rotating roller , with a small rubber wheel at the back of the arm . The contraption worked pretty reliably , but noise from the roller and rubber wheel was clearly audible during quiet musical passages . The good thing is that it did n't  damage my records . All the old LPs that I played frequently during that time still sound LONG ... <p> I still use my Eminent Tech ET-2 tonearm which cost me $600 back in the 90s. -Tangential tracking , air bearing , interchangeable arm wands of different masses , easily adjustable VTA which also adjusts the overhang in unison , and no antiskating to worry about . -Just a pia to set up correctly . It fills the bill on all important counts , and I would n't trade it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do inexpensively . Some of us enjoy the rituals required to listen to an LP . If it were too easy , I 'd probably be bored to death . The rewards are well worth the trouble IMHO . <p> My Sota Nova has a vacuum platter as well . It was criticised back in the day for somehow poisoning the sound , but I really appreciate what it does . Its funny when my digitally oriented friends come over for a listen and see me turning on pumps to play a record . They just do n't  get it . That 's ok . I just tell them to have a seat and enjoy a listen , but do n't  touch the table ! <p> Tangential tracking arms sure do sound like the answer to the problem of keeping the cartridge properly aligned throughout playing of the record , but as Paul says , they are tough to engineer . I think they have fallen out of favor since pivoted tonearms have improved to a point that they are close enough to a tangential that designers just accept the limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold , but you have to acknowledge your market and what they will buy . <p> What really interested me in this post was the video link , it was quite fascinating . I 've previously seen images of a needle in the groove , maybe even some kind of video , but what he did was quite the feat ! That took determination . Even more fascinating was the RCA Selectavision part , the shot of the LP needle on the Selectavision disc was just too much ! Imagine the issues with keeping the disc clean , even with the jacket . It also was pretty amusing to see , at least what looked like to me , a guy who fiddles in his garage for amusement . He fiddles with a scanning electron microscope . Really ? Now that 's what I call a tinkerer ! <p> That is NOT what a stylus behaves like in real use . This is a sequence of still images made to look like a moving image . To get an idea of what a real stylus does when a record is spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record is stationary , look at the electrical output of an oscilloscope from a cartridge playing a test record . The stylus can barely stay in the groove . This is because when it moves its dynamic mass gives it inertia . It is made all the worse by the fact that the tracking force is almost always created by a mass imbalance around the pivot point . And straight line tracking arms do have pivot points , they are just vertical not horizontal . <p> The best trackers are super compliant low dynamic mass moving magnet cartridges that are in dynamically balanced tonearms . All of the others are inferior to those . Unfortunately I do n't  think either are made anymore . <p> The narrator of the video never says specifically what cartridge or turntable he is using , but I would presume something good by audiophile standards given Harbeth is an audiophile approved company . I 'll add that I 'm sure there 's lots of variation in the resulatant distortion for various cartridge/arm/table combinations , no way to put this one is perspective relative to other arm/cartridge/table combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regardless , I do n't  find the results particularly surprising , but fact is , lots of people like vinyl . I guess they are flawed . <p> I have pointed out many reasons why vinyl phonograph records can be more pleasing to listen to than CDs of even the same recording . However , those reasons have nothing to do with the technologies themselves . The RBCD technology is clearly far superior to the best vinyl can produce that has any bearing on what we can hear . There may be aspects of vinyl that can not be heard such as FR beyond 20 khz where vinyl may be superior . However , audiophiles notwithstanding that is not a valid argument . <p> Very thought provoking YouTube , Soundmind . Of course these were continuous test tones , not a continually varying musical signal which might even be MORE chaotic coming from the LP sourced signal . Is there a String Theorist in the house ? ( : unknw : ) <p> It is a bit reductionistic , however , to equate music with the timbre of multiple insturments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables with a single line on a waveform monitor . <p> Rabco was bought out by Harman Kardon as I recall . There were a bunch of me too designs for awhile but the idea died out . I have no idea why . Perhaps it was too early . Later technology probably could have optimized the concept to a far greater degree . So we are stuck with offset pivoted arms a distance from the center of rotation and one design that stands still while the universe rotates around it . IMO many cost far more than is justified and are not optimal designs for their type at all . <p> Interesting , thx paul.as a matter of fact , Recently , I was at a buddies house and he was playing analog using a Rabco arm and Decca cartridge . It was very smooth with precision imageing.that is one thing you get with those tangent tracking arms is image solidity.hes very good with those tonearms so I was thinking of picking one up , letting him rebuild it and putting it on my second turntable . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a small lamp and a light sensor . It could automatically find and play the track you selected on a record . Unfortunately , many of them if not most have had the lamp or sensor fail and there are no replacement parts available . In a sense it was a programmable random access turntable just like a CD player . It was popular during the 1970s and was featured in an episode of Columbo with guest star Herschel Bernardi who played the murderer . He used this record player ingeniously to commit the murder . It was in a Mensa like organization of " geniuses. " 
@@23909654 @3909654/ <h> Let me confuse you more <p> Apparently Ive been doing a swell job of confusing people on a subject that 's already confusing enough . Network audio . <p> Maybe let 's take a few steps back . What 's the simplest , best sounding streaming audio solution ? A NAS connected over the home network to a Bridge inside the DAC . At least that 's the best I have heard . The reason this sounds so good is due in part to the isolation between the server and the renderer ( the Bridge is a renderer ) . That isolation happens through the packetized network connection provided by your homes router and CAT5 cabling . The server is in the NAS . Heres what that looks like . <p> What I described in yesterdays post- was equally good sounding , but much less simple . In that post we used a computer to house the server . The key to that setups success was that the server was also isolated from the renderer over the network . Same sound , just simple vs. less simple . <p> And why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a NAS is- not very good when it comes to speed , flexibility and user interfaces ( and DSD and DoP are n't  always accepted ) . When you step up to a desktop computer instead of a NAS for the server duties , you can also step up to a much more robust user experience like that of JRiver and JRemote , or Roon . <p> Several people wrote me and asked why simply using a NAS as a remote music storage , compared to internal storage on your desktop , - was n't better . The answer tends to cause some confusion and I apologize for that . A NAS used only as network storage , feeding a server connected directly to a DAC through USB or S/PDIF , does n't  add much sonic benefit . The isolation afforded by the network helps , but not like the above drawing . So take a look at the next illustration . <p> The music storage in the above illustration is network isolated , but the server is still a computer connected directly up to the DAC , either through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first illustration , or illustration number 2 in yesterdays post . <p> Are there other means of isolation the computer from the DAC ? Yes , and we can go over some of those too , but for now , let 's try and wrap our minds around this concept . 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 16 COMMENTS <p> Having lived with Tidal 30 days have a fuller experience with which to share . <p> First , recording quality and transfers are all over the map . As previously mentioned there is no provision for any individual recordings provenance . Some are excellent , many are unknown cd copies . <p> That being said , their Classical inventory sucks . Obviously Tidal has yet felt a need to negotiate with the major classical labels back inventories . <p> However , in a short amount of time i 've found Tidal to be one of the best radio ' stations experienced . Celebrate the artist , give up one bottle of wine or two lunches eaten out per week if necessary . <p> It is interesting when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a compression kicks-in to compensate reducing the listening experience . Paul 's Bridge concept makes perfect sense . <p> What I enjoy most about analog is the volume controls dynamic range and bloom . Many digital sources have a sweet spot that only sounds good at one volume level . <p> For the first time I am totally unable to understand your arguments here , Paul , that seem to be most contradicting to your former philosophy of keeping things simple in order to add the smallest degradation as possible . A NAS is a computer as far as I see it however a tiny computer with a reduced OS and a limited set of functions . The network is a most complex technology . If there is no dedicated LAN cord but a power-LAN solution via the mains cables things become even more complicated . Shouldnt it be easier to isolate the internal hard disk of the music server/computer connected via USB ? And what about feeding the DS DAC from the computer via HDMI ? ? ? ? ? ? You see I do n't  understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - ) <p> No problem Paul and you 're absolutely right . This whole thing runs counter to my basic philosophy of the simplest path is the best sounding . To me , this whole streaming business is like trying to understand quantum physics the more you learn the more you understand you have n't a clue . <p> Yes , isolating the hard drive helps , and yes , a NAS is nothing but a small purpose built computer . And , for that matter , even the Bridge is a small purpose built computer too . <p> What I have discovered is that separating the renderer from the computer serving the music seems to be sonically superior in all respects to direct connections unless those connections are properly isolated . And the LAN does a great job of properly isolating . <p> Perhaps this whole discussion is getting too out there and I should return to more normal stuff ( whatever THAT is ) . <p> I looked up this link given by 2Cents and discovered Baaske also have a USB isolator 1.1 and 2 compatible , male and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sonic problems associated with USB cabling ? <p> If so , I presume I could use it to good effect between my NuWave AD Converter and iMac . <p> Paul you mentioned that DSD and DoP are not always accommodated on all brands of NAS ( one exception is **25;1587;TOOLONG , which I use to great effect on my NAS ) . However , the biggest thing I 'm looking forward to using with Roon is DSD sample rates above the DoP limitation . If I understand correctly , Roon does not use the DLNA/UPnP stack because of certain limitations one being the streaming protocol . Instead Roon Labs have developed their own proprietary stack utilizing their own Roon Advanced Audio Transport ( RAAT ) which appears to overcome the DoP sample rate limitation . If this is the case then a Roon-enabled Bridge II would be something to behold indeed ! <p> In response to the comment that " the typical server on a NAS is not very good when it comes to speed , flexibility and user interfaces " : <p> I think this might unnecessarily discourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part about speed ; my three-year-old Synology , a medium-level model at the time I bought it , does just fine in this area . Are other brands really that slow ? <p> The flexibility part is true , if Synologys Audio Station is a typical offering ( I have n't tried other brands ) . Also , the lack of flexibility is more apparent when dealing with classical music , which is not a priority for many listeners . But when you decide on any system , if you if want best sound quality and best experience , you have quite a bit of learning to do . You can get a good NAS and install MinimServer , which is outstanding in the flexibility department ; yes , its not the most intuitive thing , but the documentation is very thorough . This is no harder than learning JRiverlook at all the posts on the PSA forum about the latter ! And you do n't  have to learn about ( and pay for ) all the gizmos that folks find improve the sound of a USB connection . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only used for audio ) got close in SQ to the Bridge . <p> It is true that the iPad control points are all average . But BubbleUPNP on an Android is much better , and I like using any tablet at my listening chair much better than a laptop . Based on what Ive read , Roon does offer a richer experience but also has some serious issues for those ( mainly classical music fans ) who have invested a lot of time tagging their files . A NAS is not for everyone , but let 's not be too negative either . <p> At the end of the day a NAS as I see it is simply a fairly low powered linux machine that has to be accessed over the network instead of a having dedicated Monitor , but I 'm not sure that power is an issue here seeing as its only doing one job <p> So you can install most linux based software , and checking https : **29;1614;TOOLONG it seems that although there is not currently a linux version there soon will be , in which case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Paul , perhaps there is a better term/word than renderer that could be more descriptive/understood of its intended function simplifying your paragraphs illumination ?

@@23909656 @3909656/ <h> The loudness button <p> How many of you remember back when every receiver , preamp and integrated had a loudness button ? I remember with great fondness my first Kenwood integrated amplifier in the early 1970s and right on the front panel was a magical button labeled loudness . <p> Funny thing was whenever I pushed it on nothing got louder . There seemed to be more bass but no more loudness . The button was a complete mystery to me for years but whatever it did meant better sound and I liked that . <p> Many of you understand that this button was actually a bass and treble boost that varied with the volume control hence the name " loudness " as the amount of bass and treble boost varied with the loudness control . <p> Whoa . Remember in yesterdays post I was rambling about how any electronics designer would be run out of town on a rail should he decide to make an amplifier that was not flat ? Well , here you are : the loudness button permitted amp designers to add bass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because this was user selectable it was ok and , it actually has a basis in acoustics and one well discuss in this post . <p> Back in 1933 two audio engineers , Harvey Fletcherand Wilden A. Munson , published a paper that later became known as the Fletcher-Munson curve that this loudness control was fashioned after . What they discovered is that our perception of flat really depends on volume and the lower the volume our ears seem to think that bass and treble are rolled off despite the fact they are actually not . The lower the volume the greater this effect . <p> Fletcher and Munson published a set of curves describing the amount of bass and treble increase necessary to satisfy the ears deficiency as a measurement tool . Receiver and preamp designers in the 1970s added this feature to just about everything they made and , if left on , music would have the proper amount of perceived bass and treble for any volume level you played it . <p> Youve probably noticed this effect in your system : if the music is playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to turn up the music to get the proper bass response yet the sound is actually flat . <p> One of the problems in these older designs is the curve was implemented relative to the volume controls position not actually the loudness . So , for example , if you had an efficient pair of loudspeaker connected to your receiver you might hear an overlyexaggerated set of frequency extremes for any given volume setting with the loudness button engaged the opposite being true for an inefficient pair of speakers . <p> Today it should be a simple matter for designers to add back this wonderful control and make it relative not only to the volume control position but the actual loudness of the speaker in the room . Sadly , no one has done this that I am aware of . <p> See what I mean ? <p> Flatness is n't always a great standard to live by because " flat " is in the ear of the beholder. 30398 @qwx230398 30409 @qwx230409 30402 @qwx230402 <h> 11 COMMENTS <p> In the above mentioned sense I can accept your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that TacT Audio had integrated in its " Room Correction " - preamps a so called DRC function allowing to activate a volume dependent loudness correction of the target curve . As far as I learned the company has retired from the market a typical phenomenon for innovative technology and one man driven companies without know how in product and customer service/ sales and distribution . A pity . <p> However there might be the chance for your new amp design to revitalize this most appreciated function . <p> Thanks for challenging our assumptions , Paul . Good post . Perhaps the " loudness " button fell out of favor because ( speaking for myself ) I typically use my system for " critical listening " and adjust the overall volume for the type of music I 'm listening to . In those rare instances when I am using my system for " background music " ( dinner party at home , etc ) the last thing I want is a perception of loudness it would be counterproductive for the situation . But as your post demonstrated , perhaps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond the obvious loss of sensitivity to frequency extremes especially at the low end when sounds are soft , Fletcher-Munson and similar curves tell us a lot more about the non linear nature of hearing and the requirements for sound reproduction than just the need to boost bass frequencies when music is heard softly to perceive it as flatter . here 's a link to the actual curves in both their original form and the results of more recent research revising the curves ; <p> What the curves give us is a comparison of how loud sound actually is as a function of frequency ( that 's the background vertical and horizontal grid lines that are uniformly spaced vertically , logarithmically spaced horizontally ) compared to how loud sound is perceived to be as a function of frequency ( those are the colored lines . ) <p> One thing to notice is how closely spaced the curves get in the deep bass compared to how spread out they are elsewhere in the spectrum . What is the implication of this ? Besides all of the problems of trying to achieve flat frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of design deficiencies , room acoustics including high cutoff frequencies in typically small rooms in homes , the location you happen to be sitting in , loss of low frequency energy through walls and through flexing 1/2 ? sheetrock most of our homes are built with , microphone response , and manufacturing variables we now have more to worry about . If the recording is not played at the correct loudness you wo n't hear enough bass even if it is there . But because the curves are squeezed together , increasing bass output seems to have little effect until you reach the bottom curve and then even small increases have a disproportionate effect . Actual bass output does n't  have to be much different to go from having too little bass to having too much . Just a small extra twist of the bass control or a couple of db more of the equalization slider and you 've gone from weak inadequate bass to loud boomy bass before you know it . If you happen to have a sound system that can produce very deep loud undistorted bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing about food on my first cruise . The difference between eating enough food to satisfy your appetite and enough to cause real pain from overeating is only a few extra bites : - ) <p> here 's an example looking at the curves . To get from 20 phons of loudness to 40 phons at 1 khz , you have to go from 20 to 40 db To produce the same effect at 30 hz , you only need to increase output only from about 78 to 89 db . <p> Notice that the ear is most sensitive at around 4 khz . My experience is that small changes in this range relative to 2 khz can have a profound effect on perceived treble quality . Even a 1 db exaggeration in this region can make violins sound steely , make a piano sound something like a harpsichord . The overall impression is bright , hard , and brittle , very irritating and not the way acoustic instruments sound . It can be very ear catching to tyros in rapid fire A/B comparisons at dealer showrooms where many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which frequency ranges in the audible spectrum are critical ? IMO ALL of them . <p> As difficult as getting the bass right is , the treble is even harder . If you do n't  get the treble right , nothing else seems to matter . As relatively insensitive to treble in the highest octave as we are , what we do hear seems to have a profound effect in both its quality and quantity . Perhaps that+GGs why there are probably more different kinds of tweeters than all other types of loudspeaker mechanisms combined . An example is a speaker like AR3 . It had excellent bass , the reference standard in its day but its treble was muted , muffled , rolled off . As a result the speaker had a bass heavy quality that was overwhelming and very unmusical to my ears . So then how did Roy Allison pull off his live versus recorded demonstrations so successfully ( I was fortunate enough to attend two and the results were surprisingly convincing both times . ) I only learned how a few years ago on another website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there explained it . First the speaker did not have its flattest response with the level controls at their indicated dot settings , those were recommended for commercial recordings of the day that were judged to mostly be overly bright . Flattest response was achieved with both midrange and treble controls at maximum . And second Allison provided a substantial treble boost to the Dynaco PAS3X preamplifier to compensate for the speakers inherent high frequency response falloff . <p> Among the most powerful arrows in the audio engineers quiver are equalizers , tools that are designed specifically to adjust frequency response . So why do modern hi fi audio designers and their customers regard them with such disdain ? Probably for at least two reasons . One is that they are both cheap and work very effectively offering little profit and second is that most people who had them in the past did n't  have the skill to use them to advantage . A powerful tool misused is worse than not having it at all . And so not only do contemporary audiophiles forgo their advantages but have given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters ( low cut filters are particularly useful with very wide range systems ) and instead " tune " their systems with far less effective and predictable means including positioning their speakers with a micrometer , shopping for and using expensive room treatments , exotic wires ( some of which are dangerous to equipment ) and other techniques engineers find bizarre and amusing . <p> When you arrive at the point where a sound system recreates the sound of musical instruments as having the same tonality they+GGd have played live in your listening room ( it takes more than just equalization ) you have reached the first rung of the ladder of creating a high fidelity sound reproducing system . There are a lot more rungs and they get progressively more difficult to achieve as you go up . <p> At some loudness level with a given piece of software the loudness setting and the setting without the control will both be flat . I suspect that this often has something to do with the level at the ear the software was monitored at and it has something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to a piece of softwaer at . <p> I recently acquired a Marantz AV7005 AV Pre Tuner Which I was more then skeptical mostly because of the price point . But after reading the reviews thought why not give it a listen . It is way over the top feature wise , Sirius and HD radio just to name a few . But as the heart of an HT system I have to say it blows the doors off its predecessor a Lexicon unit that retailed at three times the cost . One feature that really shines is the Audyssey MultEQ XT unfortunately they did n't  skip the Sirius an pop for XT32 but you cant have it all . The Audyssey has a number of features all perform better then expected . Room Acoustics Correction +G MultEQ and EQ Audyssey MultEQ : A technology that allows consumers and professionals to fix the acoustical problems in rooms that arise from the interaction of sound from the loudspeakers with the surfaces in the room . MultEQ uses acoustical measurements in the time domain taken by a microphone around the listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cause audible distortions in the frequency response . MultEQ then creates a room equalization filter for each speaker and subwoofer in the system to correct these problems . Audyssey EQ is a direct extension of MultEQ for products that come with attached loudspeakers such as televisions and home theater in a box systems . <p> editLoudness Compensation +G Dynamic EQ Audyssey Dynamic EQ : A technology that solves the problem of deteriorating sound quality as the playback volume is decreased . Dynamic EQ combines information from incoming source levels and actual output sound levels in the room or car to make moment-by-moment adjustments that compensate for the changes in human hearing at different listening levels . <p> editVolume Leveling +G Dynamic Volume Audyssey Dynamic Volume : A technology that solves the problem of constantly varying volume across program material . It monitors the volume in real time and maintains the desired listening level for all content while optimizing the dynamic range . <p> Audyssey has an 11.2 surround sound system using DSX which adds two height and two wide left and right channels to a traditional 7.1 mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles is this is not the Marantz I owned in the seventies its now owned by DM holdings and is of course made in China which is really not apparent from sound , look or feel of the unit but I always felt you get what paid for so I may be paying the real price down the road . <p> Some early components ( 1950s ) had separate volume and loudness knobs . You used the first to set the volume and the second to set the degree of loudness compensation to suit your system and your room . After that , as I recall , you left the loudness knob alone . A friend in college had a Pilot amp with this feature . <p> Ah , the Loudness button brought back fond memories of my 20 watt per channel Marantz receiver that kept a midwestern kid from being too home sick at USC back in 73 . Love the Marantz photo . I wonder how many sales were closed by the Gyro Touch Tuning ? Never used the Loudness button though . You see , I was a " purist ! "

I cant say which is of better quality but the difference is very obvious . <p> Under the SACD specification , multi-channel DFF tracks are required to be compressed using DST , a lossless compression format. - The compression factor is roughly 2.5:1. - When you converted to DSF , you uncompressed the files and thus they are bigger by that amount . <p> Unless there was a problem decompressing/converting the files or with your player they should sound identical . <p> As Elk mentioned isos are compressed. - But there 's a remote chance that you are accidentally playing the front left and front right out of the multichannel section of the ISO instead of the stereo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a channels column to all of my views . ) <p> Anyway in isos the multichannel sections are compressed ( using DST ) and empirically about 1/2 of my isos also have the stereo section compressed. - Doing the decompression uses significant CPU power. - Some systems are more sensitive to the CPU load than others when playing. - Unfortunately there are a " billion " things that can contribute to this so ( if you care ) you might need to visit some places like the Computer Audiophile- ( http : **28;1645;TOOLONG ) or the Computer Audio Asylum ( http : **25;1675;TOOLONG .. um=pcaudio ) for some insight or advice. - There are also some threads here with some things that people have done . <p> SACDs ( and hence ISOs from SACDs ) can have up to three " sections " , CD audio , SACD stereo , SACD multichannel. - To be an SACD it has to have , well , SACD music. - I know of no multichannel only SACDs , there are plenty of stereo only SACDs and also plenty of SACDs with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and multichannel often ( but not always ) they have the same program. - Some may have bonus tracks in stereo , multichannel or both . <p> Multichannel is always compressed with DST , typically at about 2:1. - The stereo may also be compressed with DST . <p> If you are going to delete/erase the MC material then at one extreme you may go from individual tracks taking two times the space that the ISO uses ( from a compressed stereo only iso , I do n't  know why but they do exist ) to the other extreme of individual tracks taking about 1/4 the ISO space for a disk which had uncompressed stereo and multichannel tracks . <p> Personally I like to keep my music in the original format , but I understand that people may have other concerns/issues
