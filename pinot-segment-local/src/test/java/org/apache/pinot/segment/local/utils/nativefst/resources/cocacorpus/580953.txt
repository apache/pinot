This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed . JWTs can be signed using a secret ( with HMAC algorithm ) or a public/private key pair using RSA . <p> Introduction to JSON Web Tokens is great by itself , so here I 'll show how to implement trivial JWT authentication in Python . <p> This article assumes Python 3.5 to use nice asyncio coroutine syntax . <p> We will use aiohttp as http library , gunicorn as development server with --reload. pyjwt is python implementation of JWT standard .

There are reserved keys , like exp , which JWT standard defines and its implementations use internally to provide additional features .

There is a lot of tools for load testing , like Gatling , Apache JMeter , The Grinder , Tsung and others . There is also one ( and my favorite ) written in Python and built on the Requests library : Locust . <p> As it is noticed on Locust website : <p> A fundamental feature of Locust is that you describe all your test in Python code . No need for clunky UIs or bloated XML , just plain code . <h> Locust installation <p> Locust load testing library requires Python 2.6+ . It is not currently compatible with Python 3. x . Performance testing python module Locust is available on PyPI and can be installed through pip or easyinstall . <p> pip install locustio or : easyinstall locust <h> Example locustfile.py <p> Then create locustfile.py following the example from docs . To test Django project I had to add some headers for csrftoken support and ajax requests . Final locustfile.py could be something like the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above python locust file , if it was named locustfile.py , we could run ( in the same directory as locustfile.py ) : <p> locust --host=http : //example.com <p> When python load testing app Locust is started you should visit http : //127.0.0.1:8089/ and there you 'll find web-interface of our Locust instance . Then input Number of users to simulate ( e.g. 300 ) and Hatch rate ( users spawned/second ) ( e.g. 10 ) and press Start swarming . After that Locust will start " hatching " users and you will be able to see results in the table . <h> Python Data Visualization <p> So , the table is nice but we 'd prefer to see results on a graph . There is an issue in which people ask to add graphical interface to Locust and there are several propositions how to display graphs for Locust data .

Else start a new test at http : //localhost:8089/ and return to the Bokeh tab and watch the results of testing in real time . 
@@108228823 @3628823/ <h> Python Select Example <p> A network socket is an endpoint of an interprocess communication across a computer network . The Python Standard Library has a module called socket which provides a low-level internet networking interface . This interface is common across different programming languages since it uses OS-level system calls . <p> To create a socket , there is a function called socket . It accepts family , type , and proto arguments ( see documentation for details ) . To create a TCP-socket , you should use socket.AFINET or socket.AFINET6 for family and socket.SOCKSTREAM for type : <p> import socket s = **27;0;TOOLONG , socket.SOCKSTREAM ) <p> It returns a socket object which has the following main methods : <p> bind() <p> listen() <p> accept() <p> connect() <p> send() <p> recv() <p> bind() , listen() and accept() are specific for server sockets . connect() is specific for client sockets . send() and recv() are common for both types . Here is an example of Echo server from documentation : <p> Here we create a server socket , bind it to a localhost and 50000 port , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection we call accept() method which will block until a new client connects . When this happens , it creates a new socket and returns it together with the client 's address . Then , in an infinite cycle , it reads data from the socket in batches of 1024 bytes using method recv() until it returns an empty string . After that , it sends all incoming data back using a convenient method sendall() which inside repeatedly calls recv() . And after that it simply closes the client 's connection . This example can serve only one incoming connection because it does not call accept() in a cycle . <p> Here instead of bind() and listen() it calls only connect() and immediately sends data to the server . Then it receives 1024 bytes back , closes the socket , and prints the received data . <p> All socket methods are blocking . For example , when it reads from a socket or writes to it the program ca n't do anything else . One possible solution is to delegate working with clients to separate threads . However , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap operation . To address this problem , there is a so-called asynchronous way of working with sockets . The main idea is to delegate maintaining the socket 's state to an operating system and letting it notify the program when there is something to read from the socket or when it is ready for writing . <p> As you can see , there is much more code than in the blocking Echo server . That is primarily because we have to maintain a set of queues for different lists of sockets , i.e. writing , reading , and a separate list for erroneous sockets . <p> Creating server socket looks the same except for one line : server.setblocking(0) . This is done to make the socket nonblocking . This server is more advanced since it can serve more than one client . The main point is in selecting sockets : <p> Here we call select.select to ask the OS to check given sockets whether they are ready to write , read , or if there is some exception respectively . That is why it passes three lists of sockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readable , and which should be checked for errors . This call will block the program ( unless a timeout argument is passed ) until some of the passed sockets are ready . In this moment , the call will return three lists with sockets for specified operations . <p> Then it sequentially iterates over those lists and , if there are sockets in them , it performs corresponding operations . When there is the server socket in inputs , it means that a new client has arrived . Therefore , it calls accept() , adds a returned socket to inputs and adds a Queue for incoming messages which will be sent back . If there is another socket in inputs , then some messages have arrived and ready to be read so it reads them and places them into the corresponding queue . <p> For writable sockets , it gets pending messages ( if any ) and writes them to the socket . If there is any error in the socket , it removes the socket from the lists . <p> This is how sockets work at a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to implement the logic at such a low level . It is recommended to use some higher level abstractions such as Twisted , Tornado , or ZeroMQ , depending on the situation . 
@@108228826 @3628826/ <h> Asynchronous JavaScript Programming with Promises <h> Introduction <p> Promises are not something new to Javascript . This programming paradigm is more than 30 years old and it has been used for about 10 years in JavaScript ( which means ages in front-end world ) . Many JavaScript frameworks and libraries support promises today . Nevertheless , a lot of developers do not use promises or ignore advantages of this technology . In this article we will try to remind what the promises at glance are , how they work and what are the best ways to use them . <h> The problem <p> JavaScript is WEB browser language ( yep , we know about Node.js , but let 's leave it outside the scope of this article ) . It means that JavaScript interacts with user interface . One of the most important things for frontend app is to be responsive . Modern end-users are choosy and nervous guys who hate freezed UI , today nobody can afford stopping execution of main thread during synchronous processing of long-running tasks . The most obvious and natural example of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not acceptable to block UI and make user wait till client-server communication is finished . That 's why we have such a nice technique as AJAX ( asynchronous JavaScript + XML ) . With AJAX the client app can send data to server asynchronously and continue entertaining user untill server response is retrieved . But since AJAX request works in the background it somehow needs to notify main script that data is ready and then convey this data . Originally this is done with event handling callback functions . Here is a simple example which illustrates this approach ( it retrieves Star Wars most vulgar character from a REST endpoint ) : <p> Ahhh , what a neat , handsome , built with bleeding edge technologies example ! But let 's get a little closer to the real world . Imagine that your customer has some additional requirements ( say , based on business analysts ' suggestions ) : <p> retrieve Star Wars most vulgar character <p> then retrieve homeworld of Star Wars most vulgar character <p> then retrieve Star Wars most awesome and impressive character <p> show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a joke about Chuck Norris at the end <p> OKAY , excellent scenario . But it requires some refactoring . Below you can find one of the possible implementations : <p> Not so neat anymore , yeah ? We are sure the example can be improved , but it is likely to be a crap anyway . Business logic is spread , fragmented and mixed up with boilerplate infrastructural code . All intentions are buried under messy language constructions . Now imagine real production app which can contain much more complicated asynchronous logic . Sooner or later maintenance of such code will become a real pain . Well , congratulations ! You are on the way to Callback Hell ! <h> The solution <p> That 's time for promises to come on the stage ( drum roll begins ) . Let 's omit technical details and move on to rewritten example . Do n't worry if you are not familiar with promises or ES6 features , you will find some explanations below . Just notice how laconic , simple , readable and meaningful the code is : <h> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some future , deferred tasks . Promise itself does n't make sense without a task . Usually you pass this task to promise constructor or call a factory which runs task , creates promise and returns it . <p> Once you create promise ( along with the task ) , your main flow continues execution . The task will be processed asynchronously . <p> Internally promise can be in one of three states : pending ( when associated task is not finished yet ) , fulfilled ( after and if task finishes successfully ) , rejected ( after and if task fails ) . Once promise changes its state , it can never change it again . <p> Promises have then() method which accepts two function parameters - onFulfilled() and onRejected(). onFulfilled() is called after and if the task finishes successfully , onRejected() is called if task fails . With this functions promise can notify main flow and pass task execution results **27;29;TOOLONG , or task error onRejected(taskError) . <p> Most important thing in promises is chaining . Each then() method yields and returns new promise . This allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was no native promises support in JavaScript until recently . That is why today we have a bunch of alternative implementations . <p> AngularJS . AngularJS supports promises and has built-in $q service to handle asynchronous tasks . Furthermore , $http communication service is based on promises . <p> ReactJS . React does n't have baked in promise library , so you are free to choose 3-rd party implementation ( or JS native , see below ) . <p> Other . There are lots of other implementations . E.g. Dojo is considered to be a pioneer in JavaScript promises , Q library by Kris Kowal is often used in Node.js along with Promised-IO by Kris Zyp , Bluebird is loved by many for its speed and productivity . <p> EcmaScript 6 . Finally in ES 6 we have got standard build-in promise implementation . So if you are among the lucky ones who use ES 6 in your project - then consider using native promises even if you have alternative implementations in project-involved libraries . Some benchmarks show that ES 6 promises are memory-intensive and not the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon and from maintenance perspective usage of standard solutions is always better . Today support level of native promises is quite high : <h> Use tips <p> 1 . Always return promises from methods with asynchronous tasks . Just make it a rule . If you use promise in a function/method - then this method must always return promise . Imagine a typical example : you need to send something to back-end and you do n't have any dependent tasks except notifying user using toaster ' notifier . Seems like there is no sense to return promise from such method : <p> But requirements change , that is why later the logic of the method may become much more complicated . And if one day you get a dependent tasks - then it can take a lot of efforts to refactor the code to fit promise pattern . Another good reason to follow this practice is testing . If you return promise from such methods - then you always have a hook to process it by automated tests . Below there is a better version of the example ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in sense ) : <p> Many developers ( especially those ones who just start using promises ) build nested constructions like example below : <p> Do n't do this . Remember that each then() method returns new promise and you can resolve data to this new promise by returning this data from onFulfilled() method . Here is a more readable and elegant implementation of above example : <p> 3 . Use promise combinators . Most of JavaScript promise implementations have some helpers to deal with most common asynchronous tasks . For instance , you have several replicated sources with the same data and you want to send requests to all of them and proceed just after the very first response is received . Promise.race() combinator can be used in this case . You can pass several promises to this combinator and it will return a promise that resolves as soon as one of the passed promises resolves : <p> 4 . Use catch() statement . Avoid using of onRejected() error handlers in then() method and replace them with catch() . Actually catch() is a shorthand of then ( undefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and readable . So instead of this : <h> What 's next <p> Promises are elegant and powerful functional programming tool . But you could have noticed how each new EcmaScript edition adds more object-oriented features to JavaScript . Predicting future evolution trends of JavaScript is difficult ( who knows if OOPzilla will beat functionalKong , things change every day ) . But we were not surprised to see in upcoming EcmaScript 2017 specification a new asynchronous tool that suits OOP paradigm better . This tool is async/await functions . Despite the feature is still a proposal , it was already accepted into Stage 3 ( Candidate ' ) and is going to be accepted into Stage 4 ( Finished ' ) by the end of November 2016 . If you are familiar with Python 3.5 or C# 5 ( Task Parallel Library ) - then probably you have already faced async/await feature . The construction helps to improve asynchronous statements drastically . It makes all asynchronous code ( including exception handling ! ) clear , intuitive and self-descriptive by hiding all boilerplate stuff under the hood . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can find all the information on official Ecma github page . Just take a look on this two examples from official page and notice the difference in code amount and clarity . First one is written using regular promises , second one is written with async/await statements . Is n't it great ? <h> Summary <p> Of course , this article touches only the tip of the iceberg of promises and skips a lot of technical details , patterns and nuances . Promises are much deeper . It 's up to you and your team to use promises or not . In our opinion , it 's a brilliant technology and we highly recommend using it in your projects . Even if you do n't like promises , but they are enforced by chosen stack ( framework or library ) , then do n't ignore their advantages . Always follow best promises ' practices and avoid anti patterns . Sooner or later you will get used and notice that with promises clarity and maintainability of your code is higher . Even if you will not fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handy since promises are widespread in JavaScript world . <p> Everything you should know about validation and errors in AngularJS apps : good and bad practices , build-in and third-party tools , some pieces of advice on how to build convenient and maintainable error handling core .

We will consider main functionality and MongoDB DBSM characteristics , touch upon some subtle questions of integration and use of Mongo together with Meteor platform . The article is useful both for beginners and for experienced MeteorJS developers . <p> All the examples below are available on our Github page . At the time of writing an article version 1.4 of MeteorJS is a current one with Mongo 3.2 support . <h> About MongoDB <p> MongoDB is an open cross-platform document-oriented DBMS . The MeteorJS platform itself is tightly integrated with MongoDB . <p> MeteorJS developers made several innovative changes in integration process of MeteorJS with MongoDB . One of such solutions is MiniMongo . MiniMongo partially supports Mongo API and serves as a temporary data store at the client-side . Thus , developers do not take part in providing a client-server communication leaving this work to Meteor platform . <p> NoSQL Mongo DBSM has been the only and the main data storage for Meteor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Mongo offers a really wide range of opportunities : <p> Scalability . MongoDB is highly scalable . Standalone server is used by default , but it can be easily expanded to a cluster . <p> Document-orientation . Document is the main storage unit in MongoDB . A document may include other documents or their massives . It is a very flexible feature and it allows to accelerate development process dramatically . <p> Fast-acting . MongoDB has good efficiency indicators . According to Cloud Serving Benchmark by Yahoo ! MongoDB is able to perform about 193 000 operations per second , whereas Cassandra performs about 110 000 operations and Couchbase even less - 31 000 . <p> Integration with popular web-services . MongoDB is rather popular and widely used . Google Cloud Platform , Amazon Web Services , Microsoft Azure and many other web-services have a built-in support of MongoDB . <p> Efficient work with big files . MongoDB Stores files in BJSON format and limits document 's size to 16MB . It is recommended to use GridFS to work with documents of a larger size . <p> Availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licenses GNU AGPL and Apache License 2.0 . It allows using Mongo DBMS in the majority of projects . MongoDB source code is available at Github , which makes it much easier to understand the work of Mongo 's internal mechanisms . <p> Logging and profiling . MongoDB has built-in tools for logging and profiling . It helps to optimize the operation with DB . <p> Even having all of its advantages MongoDB is not a perfect solution and can not entirely substitute other DBMSs . That is why Meteor Development Group decided to add SQL-DBMS support . Meteor developers community has already come up with several solutions , but official support is only being planned . <h> MongoDB &amp; MeteorJS <p> Data is grouped by collections in MongoDB . Collection , as a rule , consists of documents of the same type , but this is an optional condition . Documents of the collection are not limited by scheme and can differ from each other . <p> It is very simple to create Mongo collection in MeteorJS . Let 's consider the example . <p> First of all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections-test . <p> As a result of this command client and server directories will also be added as an example of Meteor application code . We do not need these files . Delete them . <p> cd collections-test rm -rf client server <p> We need to announce a new Mongo collecton . Let 's make it in collections.js file . <p> Now we can conduct CRUD ( create , read , update , delete ) operations with this collection using the inbuilt MeteorJS methods : insert , find and findOne , update and upsert , remove . Let 's consider the given functionality in the examples . Methods find and findOne allow to get documents from the collection . Method find is used to sample from a variety of documents and returns the cursor , but findOne returns the first found document to the collection or undefined if the document was not found . You can transmit search parameters , also called " query filters " to methods . <p> // find all programming languages in collection **27;58;TOOLONG ; // find a programming language JavaScript **33;87;TOOLONG : ' JavaScript ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fetch()0 ; // find the programming languages the name of which includesJava **30;154;TOOLONG : /. *Java. */ ) ; // amount of programming languages the name of which includes Java **30;186;TOOLONG : /. *Java. */ ) . count() ; <p> You can add new elements to a collection with the help of insert method . <p> **32;218;TOOLONG : ' JavaScript ' ) ; <p> In the next step we will try to fill the collection with data . After the completion of Meteor initialization we will have to find out the amount of elements in programmingLanguages collection and add necessary documents , if the collection is empty . <p> We implement the described above functionality in fill-db.js file . Let 's place this file in server directory , for script to be run only on the server side . <p> Start the application by meteor command from collections-test directory . <p> When you first launch the app ProgrammingLanguages collection is empty . Accordingly , the call **35;252;TOOLONG wiil return the value of 0 . That is why we will add three documents with name and stars fields to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with Mongo . Let 's check the resuts of fiil-db.js script work with the help of MongoDB shell . <p> Start MongoDB shell from the directory of MeteorJS application ( without stopping the work of MeteorJS server ) and request for all the documents from programmingLanguages collection : <p> meteor mongo **28;289;TOOLONG ( ) <p> As you can see in the screenshot , when you add documents to the collection , i 'd field is created for each of them . This field contains ObjectID - a unique identifier of a document . <p> Now consider the concrete example of front-end part with MongoDB . Now we implement a separate page on the basis of Blaze template , where users can vote for the programming language by changing the value of stars field . The code must work only on the client-side and so all the files will have to be placed in client directory . <p> In app.html file we will display the list of programmingLanguages via programmingLanguages helper . <p> ProgrammingLanguages helper must receive the list of programmingLanguages from MongoDB and return them to Blaze template . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template . The template allows to display the following set of data : the name of the programing language , the amount of stars and . pl-star link , by pressing which a user can increase the language rating . <p> In app.js file we will describe programmigLanguages helper and process the click event on the . pl-star link . <p> User can change the value of stars field of each document from ProgrammingLanguages collection . On account of fullstack reactivity each client of the application will see current condition of collection even without page reloading . <h> Meteor MongoDB packages <p> Meteor developers ' community has created a lot of useful packages , which make the work with Mongo DBMS easier and more efficient . AstronomyCollection2 should be specially pointed out .

@@108228835 @3628835/ <h> Web Design for RTL Languages : The Basics <p> Localization , the process of adapting a website to a particular locale , is essential for any interface , even if only a small amount of content is there . As different locales and different language groups have various features , developers must take into account these differences when creating a website . Some of these features may be difficult to understand , especially without the help of a native speaker . These features are particularly evident when it comes to designing and developing websites for the Middle Eastern market . <p> Demand for the creation of right-to-left ( RTL ) websites has grown over the years due to the fact that Arabic is the 4th most popular language globally . According to Arab Media Outlook , 60% of Arabic speakers prefer browsing internet content in Arabic . The lack of currently available content in Arabic and the existing need for this content among users is sure to continue this growth . <p> We 've already taken a closer look at the peculiarities of developing RTL websites for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , we 'll be focusing our attention on some distinguishing features of RTL design . <h> RTL project design : The basics <p> The creation of web services and localization of already existing products for the Middle Eastern market is stipulated by certain features that can differ vastly from English ( left-to-right ) websites . The set of rules and design solutions used for LTR websites are of little value when developing websites for an Arabic RTL audience . This is because RTL websites require a different structure , typography , and imagery . At first glance , it might seem like an Arabic website is just a mirrored copy of an English one . However , it can involve a lot of effort to make a page with mirrored content appear properly on a screen . <p> SteelKiwi has already developed a number of RTL projects and we will be sharing our experience , including potential problems and solutions , below . <h> Writing and visuals <p> The main and most obvious difference between LTR and RTL languages is seen in the direction of writing . In RTL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . This directional change affects the structure of the website , as well as typography , icons , and images . <p> To design an RTL project , we use a principle that seems simple at first . We flip or mirror every piece of content , with a few key exceptions . To understand what to mirror and what to change entirely , it 's important to imagine the motion of time which flows from right to left in Arabic . For example , a list of icons that displays a specific sequence should start from the right side on an RTL website . <p> With the help of some basic rules , designing an Arabic website can be fairly straightforward . However , when multilingual platforms are involved , it 's crucial to plan out the architecture of the projects properly in order to avoid language conflicts when switching from LTR to RTL languages . <p> When beginning work on this type of project , developers should spend time designing both LTR and RTL versions since each of these is equally important for a successful end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic typography . For the projects we 've worked on , we 've preferred to use Noto font which is recommended by Google Guidelines . To maintain easy readability , bold typeface should be avoided . Italicized font is also not used in Arabic . <p> factoring in the length of words as most Arabic words are shorter than those in English ; <p> abbreviating days of the week , months , etc. is commonplace in English , but is not appropriate in Arabic ; <p> words in LTR languages do n't change their direction and neither do digits ( like phone numbers with international dialing codes ) . These are still displayed on RTL websites as they would be on LTR websites . <h> Numerals <p> There are further distinctions with Arabic when it comes to numbers . Most Arab countries use the more traditional Western Arabic numerals . However , some countries like Iran and Afghanistan , use Eastern Arabic numerals more prevalently . Both numerical systems are used in Egypt and Sudan . Western Arabic numerals are slowly becoming increasingly popular , even in more conservative Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used in North Africa . <p> As the use of numerals can differ based on the region , this feature is important to consider when localizing dates and icons and should match what is most commonly used by the locale . <h> Icons <p> Mirroring icons in an Arabic interface should be done with proper caution . Sometimes mirroring or flipping is n't necessary and sometimes it is . Basic guidelines are as follows : <p> Symmetrical icons , as well as icons without an explicitly specified direction ( such as camera , download , user profile , etc. ) , do n't need to be flipped . <p> Icons with an explicit direction should be mirrored . For example , the back button should point to the right in the RTL version . <p> Icons featuring English characters do n't need to be mirrored , but should be localized . <p> The semantics of icons should be considered , with special focus placed on cultural peculiarities or alternate meanings of symbols being used . Potentially problematic icons , such as a piggy bank icon to symbolize thriftiness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate in LTR sites , but might be inappropriate in RTL ones . It 's important to double-check if the icons used are easily understood in each culture they are being displayed in and , sometimes , this can only be done with the help of a native speaker . <h> Images <p> Not only do images make a website visually attractive , but they also convey a certain idea . Choosing an image requires appropriate selection , taking into account cultural peculiarities when it comes to perception . <p> Banners for the Arabic version of a website can be mirrored , but best practices recommend selecting individual images for each version of a website instead . Simply reflecting a horizontal image may result in distorted display when switching between LTR and RTL versions of the website . <h> Mirroring elements <p> Not all interface elements need to be mirrored . Below is a comprehensive overview of elements that may be found in a website 's layout and whether or not these should be mirrored in RTL projects . <p> Navigation buttons &amp; logo - a logo is usually placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTL websites , the logo is placed in the right upper corner . This principle also applies to the menu and navigation buttons which should be displayed in reverse order . <p> Form fields - headings and icons that refer to a given field on a form should be placed in the opposite position on RTL websites . <p> Breadcrumbs - breadcrumbs that are part of a website with a complex structure should be aligned to the right side and mirrored . <p> Video and audio players - video and audio players should not be mirrored because they represent playback progress instead of the flow of time . <p> Dates - Arabic-speaking users have their own calendar , but they are also used to the standard international date format . This element can be hyper-localized to match the locale , if the project requires it . <p> Calendars - calendars need to be mirrored . Monday will be displayed on the right side and Sunday on the left one . <p> Tables - columns of tables must be mirrored . <p> Browser interface - Internet Explorer and Opera display scrollbars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTL websites <p> When designing and developing an RTL website , the decisions that need to be made can oftentimes be confusing for those used to designing LTR projects . Applying a mirrored structure should help those starting out ease into the transition and , by following some of the tips we 've outlined above , we hope designers and developers will be able to succeed when creating an RTL project . <p> Thanks to our clients , SteelKiwi 's team of designers and developers has been able to learn many of the peculiarities of RTL languages and cultures .

@@108228841 @3628841/ <h> Five reasons to prototype website before development <p> Website creation can be compared with house building . Before working on the website as well as before building the house there is a set of rules that must be fixed and followed to achieve the expected result . <p> The results of website enegineering are prototypes with different level of approximation . Symbolically we can distinguish 3 groups : sketch , wireframe and prototype . <h> Sketch <p> Website projection starts with sketch , that generally represents wordy description . Sketch visualization is done without real content and very approximately . <p> The task of the sketch is to represent main blocks : where the image , text and main menu should be . To create sketch pencil and paper or simple graphic editor will be enough . <h> Wireframe <p> The next level is wireframe . Wireframe is much closer to the end version of the website and is a visualization of logical and content parts of the website . In other words , we create web pages , place images , texts , links , popups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visually future result . <p> There is no artistic appearance on purpose on this stage . The main task of wireframe is to demonstrate website architecture , to fix logics and content blocks . Based on the wireframe a developer gives estimation for the project . As a rule to create wireframes we use WireframeSketcher , that let 's us to create dynamic wireframes and simulate page navigation . <h> Prototype <p> Prototype is a dynamic front-end , that demonstrates complete appearance and work of the webapp . As a rule prototypes are done for big projects where time for closed testing and usability analysis is taken into account . <p> To create prototypes we use webflow.com or make webapp with simplified logics using Django , if there is a necessity to show work with admin panel . <p> Why is it better to make wireframes before development ? <p> 1 . Requirements and priorities specification <p> Website engineering is a perfect way of visualization of thousands words about the project in several images . At the stage of visualization it becomes clear where we can optimize logics or vise versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presupposes several iterations , wireframe is a must . <p> 2 . Guarantee of expected result achievement <p> Wireframe is an amazing and transparent way of task fixing and tangible result template . Due to a wireframe it is easier to understand consequences of any element change in web application structure . <p> Wireframe minimizes differences in text perception and chances that result will differ from clients expectation . <p> 3 . Time economy <p> Wireframes are produced taking into account future content . For example , 12 points in main menu and 16 ways of sorting would look really scary . Right at the stage of visualization the sections architecture and inner hierarch- can be changed . <p> Since wireframing is a fast process , changes can be done quickly . While creating wireframes we work not only with basic elements , but we create assets - design components , that can be edited for all pages simultaneously . <p> 4 . Budget optimization <p> This point follow from the previous one . Just imagine how many hours can be saved at this stage : each change will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may take several minutes . <p> Quite often for fixed price projects engineering projection is not taken into account . But as a result economy at this stage may lead to the significant budget enlargement and missed deadlines . <p> 5 . Effective development control <p> Wireframe is a good RoadMap for planning works and executors . At first you may think that a client pays for developers convenience and this has no influence on the project . But competent planning and task assignment may decrease twice time for development , that is definitely a positive factor for a client . <p> Testing and reporting become much easier , and what is really important time for these actions decreases as well . <h> What we suggest <p> We suggest projection for all website types , web apps and mobile app ( iOS and Android ) . At the stage of making wireframes our employee becomes a member of your team and does his best to visualize all your demands . <p> You may see samples of our works in our portfolio or leave request here .

The rest could be found in plugins repository . <p> Another one is Emacs , which is somewhat similar to vim - highly customizable open source solution with great community support . Spacemacs with python layer enabled is recommended for quick start . <h> Plugin management systems <p> The power of Vim is in its plugin system . There are several ways to manage your plugins zoo . <p> Easy way is Vundle . You just list plugins in your vim config file and run : PluginInstall . Advantage of this approach is that , you manage your Vim plugins from inside Vim . You store your plugins in config and change their state using Vim commands . <p> Other option is Pathogen . To install with it , you should cd to your plugins directory and clone plugin repo with git . <p> All they do is copy certain files in certain places . You could as well copy and paste files by yourself . Vundle , Pathogen and others just make your life easier . For more discussion , see this reddit thread <p> Yapf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - is a tool for formatting python code . It " takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style guide , even if the original code did n't violate the style guide " ( from project README ) . <p> Several styles provided out of the box , including pep8 , google and chromium styles . Also , you have a bunch of " knobs " to customize formatting . <p> In order to enable vim plugin , take a look at their yapf.vim plugin . You 'll need to place this file in /. vim/autoload/ and add mappings to /. vimrc , so that you can call it with a few keystrokes . <p> As projects README states , yapf formats not only the code , that violates pep8 , but tries to reformat code that does not look right according to some inner rules . In most cases , it does a good job , but there are some tasks , that are too difficult for yapf , for example formatting deeply nested structures . So do not format the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains valid , your teammates may yell at you for bad formatting . <p> Also , there is alternative to yapf - tell-k/vim-autopep8 . It binds to &lt;F8&gt; by default and fixes pep8 violations in current file . It 's less aggressive than yapf . <p> Nerdtree is useful when you need to familiarize yourself with the project . It adds directories tree as vim window , which enables handly files exploration , along with tree modifications facilities . <p> It is the matter of choice , which navigation style to use , but for me , ctrlp is great when project is familiar , because you can find what you need with several keystrokes . But when you do n't know the structure of the project , nerdtree is indispensable . <p> This tiny plugin adds contextual enabling vim relativenumber option , so you can use 13k to move 13 lines up or 28j to move 28 lines down , when you need navigation and see absolute line number when you need to see absolute numbers = )

@@108228863 @3628863/ <h> Validation and Error Handling in AngularJS Applications <h> Introduction <p> Validating user input and showing errors - is one of the most common WEB app features . But very often development teams do not pay enought attention to this functionality . Sometimes the project starts from simple prototype that does n't require good error processing core , and then this approach is automaticaly transferred to MVP and production app . Sometimes designers and UX professionals create detailed wireframes and mockups , but ignore possible errors and ways to notify user about them . Most customers are focused on main functionality and do not really care about errors . Despite this , good WEB developer has to implement convenient and maintainable validation/error handling core regardless of what kind of project is being developed . <p> We already have excellent post about WEB app errors . In this article we are going to be more concrete and provide more extensive information on the validation and error handling in AngularJS applications . <h> What do we need <p> AngularJS is SPA framework . Such SPAs ( single page applications ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solid front-end validation . But most of AngularJS apps communicate with back-end apps and must be ready to process server-side validation errors too . Moreover , there are some common things that are required for good validation and error handling processing core . Here is the list of basical error functionality requirements for typical AngularJS app : <p> input fields and forms must be validated on-the-fly before sending data to back-end app ; <p> error handling and common validation rules ( e.g. required ) must work in transparrent way not dirtying controllers with validation code ; <p> back-end errors ( if any ) must fit common pattern too and must be transparent for end-users ( look exactly like front-end validation errors ) ; <p> field and form errors must be shown in user-friendly and smart manner ( e.g. do not show errors on untouched controls and fields , etc . ) . <h> Bad practice <p> In this section we are going to share an example of bad validation and error handling implementation . There are very few reasons to use such pattern , except you are beginner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most straightforward and brute-force validation approach is manual controller-based validation : <p> Implementation details may differ , nevertheless this validation approach has a bunch of shortcomings : <p> all native HTML and AngularJS validation tools are ignored ; <p> all validation and error handling stuff is processed manually ; <p> controllers and templates are cluttered up with boring validation code and markup . <p> Never follow such patterns unless you are sure that any other approach can not be used . <h> Good practices <h> Out of the box <p> The cool thing about AngularJS is that it has built-in implementation of most needed validation and error handling features . All this functionality is embedded in form handling logic . So if you want to use built-in validation tools - then you have to : <p> wrap all your input controls into form ; <p> name those controls ( with name attribute ) ; <p> name the form . <p> After that form controller will expose number of validation methods and properties which are being automatically monitored and updated by AngularJS core . Each input has several properties that represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover form itself exposes similar properties : $pristine/$dirty , $valid/$invalid and $submitted . You can easily combine those properties in conditional expressions and use them with ng-class , ng-disabled and other directives to get required validation logic and UI effects : <p> Notice that controller is much thinner and does n't contain any validation code any more ! All logic is under the hood , validation rules are exposed in template with validators . AngularJS supports next validators out of the box : <p> type - native HTML input type ( e.g. number , email , etc . ) ; <p> required/ng-required - the only difference is that ng-required value can be changed dynamically ; <p> This validators , including powerful ng-pattern which accepts regular expressions , are enought to satisfy most of front-end validation tasks . <h> Reusable custom validators <p> But sometimes you can face custom ( project-specific ) validation requirements . If such validator is to be used in multiple **25;319;TOOLONG - then the best way to implement it is dedicated validator directive coupled with ngModel . The logic of such directives is pretty typical : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-occasion verification . If you need to validate something really special in one particular widget/page/controller - then there is no sense to implement reusable directive and share it among all app components . The best solution here is to encapsulate validation function in particular controller . But this is not a reason to use brute-force ugly manual validation from our first example . We must adjust this custom function to fit standard validation pattern/interface . <p> Of course this validation-function directive is primitive : it does n't support interpolation ( so you ca n't change verification function dynamically ) , it does n't accept asynchronous requests , etc . You can use it as basis and improve according to project requirements . <h> ui-validate <p> But you do n't have to necessarily implement one occasion validation function directive yourself because guys from AngularUI team have already done this in their ui-validate package . It is compact , flexible , well tested and maintained module . We highly recomment to use it in your projects . The directive is applied in very common way : <p> You can see that ui-validate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it has a lot of additional features , e.g. support of promise-returning functions , etc . <h> Processing server-side validation results <p> While front-end validation improves user experience drastically ( thanks to instant app feedback on user input ) , it is not completely trusty ( because the code runs on user side ) and reliable ( because data is usually stored on back-end and AngularJS app simply ca n't process all validation cases like occupied login name , etc . ) . Thus most SPA apps have to support back-end validation . According to our experience the best solution of this problem is helper service that takes form controller context along with error response and sets corresponding error flags ( which of cource must fit standard AngularJS validation pattern ) . Implementation of the service is closely linked to error response structure , therefore it varies from project to project . But core logic is always the same , see example below : <p> method checks if there are non-field ( form-level ) server errors and makes form invalid if any <p> method searches controls with specified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we set serverError - then it will always stay enabled and never get reset back itself , however server errors must be reset after user makes any updates to the control . To accomplish this goal we use special directive , see below : <h> Error styles and messages <h> CSS validation classes <p> AngularJS automatically adds and removes CSS classes to form controls and form itself depending on current validation state . Class names correspond to control validation properties names : ng-dirty , ng-valid , ng-touched , etc . Furthermore , there are a number LONG ... class pairs which correspond to every validator defined for the control ( these can be used for custom styling of some specific errors ) . <p> The second option is more preferable , because it keeps templates much cleaner . <p> In our above examples we disabled save button to prevent user from submission when form is invalid . It 's not the best approach for sure . You are free to implement any validation scenario you need . But in most cases we prefer next approach : <p> allow user to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user has n't tried to submit form - then do not show errors on control unless user touched and left it ; <p> if user has tried to submit form - then show errors on all invalid controls and form itself . <h> ng-messages <p> Highlighting invalid controls is not enought for good validation core . You need to show somehow error notifications so the user will know what is wrong . The best way to do this in AngularJS app is ng-messages directive . Here is self-explaining example : <p> this $error object contains properties ( keys ) for every failing validator ; <p> control 's $error object is used as data source for ng-messages directive with error messages ; <p> each validator must have error message ( BTW , one error message can be coupled with several validators , e.g. ng-message= " pattern , required " ) ; <p> error messages are shown only if field is touched or containing form is submitted ; <p> error message appear if the value of ng-message attribute is existing key in $error object ; <p> by default only one message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> top messages have higher priority , server error must have highest priority . <h> Common tips as conclusion <p> Always use forms . AngularJS app can be built without forms : you simply define models in controller , declare inputs in template , couple them together and fire server-side request on some action . But forms provide you with additional validation tools and make your app work in more natural way . BTW , if you need to implement complex components with nested and dynamical forms - then consider replacing regular forms with ng-form directives . <p> Add novalidate attribute to the form . This will disable standard browser validation ( as well as browser native validation popover messages ) . You will not need it since AngularJS takes care of validation . <p> Always give names to inputs in your template ( we mean HTML name attribute ) . Later you can address those inputs with given name inside your controller and template . <p> Input name and controller model name must be equal to name of corresponding field in back-end response . Sometimes your app works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. Django REST framework which follows underscore like other Python apps ) . In this case you may want to rename fields in controller response/request handlers ( or in more elegant way with service 's **34;346;TOOLONG functions ) . But sooner or later this will cause confusion and mess . Better create an exception in configuration of project linter ( if any ) and use original names everywhere . <p> Make with your back-end team a convention about server-side error response structure and always follow this convention . All your response error handlers through the whole app must be the same . Reject and claim for refactoring of each non-standard back-end error response unless it has significant reasons ( e.g. usage of 3-rd party validation services which can not be changed ) . Such cases must be exception but not rule ! <p> Do not forget about markup for non-field ( form-level ) errors in your templates , or replace this markup with toaster notification service like AngularJS-Toaster . <p> Try to avoid complex all-in-one 3-rd party validation packages . E.g. if you google AngularJS validation - then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides multipurpose validation toolset ( service , directives , message system , etc . ) . It is very tempting to attach such package to your app and just use it not taking care about things under the hood . But according to our experience , for small app with simple validation logic such packages are overkill . AngularJS has awesome build-in validation core which is more than enought for those cases . And if you need complex validation - then you are likely to fall into troubles with such packages trying to adopt them to your app peculiarity . <p> Do not hesitate to use specialized single purpose packages that support native AngularJS validation interfaces and provide validation logic which is difficult to implement and maintain ( e.g. angular-credit-cards ) .

@@108228865 @3628865/ <h> Is a QA expert that necessary during development ? <h> What is QA ? <p> Software needs to satisfy a certain level of quality before it is released . Assuring quality involves running a variety of test cases that emulate a broad set of usage scenarios , load factors , environmental combinations , edge cases , and more influencing variables . <p> Quality assurance ( QA ) supports projects by adding value to every set of circumstances . Even the best developers in the world make mistakes because they are human , making QA testing the fail-safe to catch any errors . Each software failure costs money in the time spent fixing it , in halting production , in lost revenue , or in another way . The faster bugs are found , the quicker and cheaper it is to fix them . Saving money is always a good thing and QA engineers work to save your future self-money . Nowadays a QA engineer is an integral part of every development team . <p> At SteelKiwi , we develop your software using Agile methodology . QA is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every iteration of the development life cycle . The cost of finding and fixing defects rises considerably across the lifespan of a project . This is because the requirements and design specifications need to be taken into account before changes can be made to the code , ensuring that those changes will be compatible with the project 's goals . Also , a single defect in the requirements could easily have ripple effects into other areas of design and code , making it critical to find issues as soon as possible . Working with our QA experts at this stage of planning will help us avoid misunderstandings , an awkward project design , or incompatibility of project requirements . <p> In the the figure below you can see the relative costs of fixing software defects ( Source : IBM Systems Sciences Institute ) <h> Advantages of Early Defects Detection <h> Are n't developers QA experts ? <p> While a developer may objectively know what to look for in testing , it 's difficult for them to remain objective when it comes to their own projects . Every developer goes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has been developed and how it should work and ends up focusing on testing their own functionality instead of testing the product . This limits the testing and can produce incomplete results . A development team should avoid testing its own program ( unit testing is a responsibility ) and , instead , rely on QA teams to provide objective testing results . <p> Critical problems with having developers perform QA testing include : <p> unconscious developer bias towards the quality of their own work , meaning that developers may not rigorously test all aspects of the project because they are confident that they 've produced a bug-free code . <p> defending mistakes that have occurred instead of focusing on resolving them . <p> being too close to the project and not thinking outside of the box , resulting in some scenarios or edge cases being overlooked . <p> Software should be tested in a neutral way to have unbiased testing results , which can only be done by an external party and not the developer(s) themselves . Because developers often work under high pressure and tight deadlines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of work may be compromised . The only way to have accurate QA testing results is to have a separate , objective third party perform the QA testing . <p> Remember , the earlier on that a defect is found , the less costly it is to fix . <h> Pareto Diagram <h> Why QA should be done by QA experts <p> Testing is not about just validating that the system is performing how it should be . It is also about assuring that the system is n't performing in ways it should n't be . An expert QA tester is able to delicately go about pushing a system to ( and beyond ) its limits to ensure quality and appropriate functionality . <p> Quality assurance testing includes : <p> a critical approach to the project , often missing in the developer 's tests . Testing is a creative , destructive process in which every aspect of a project is carefully looked at and picked apart to ensure it works how it 's expected and supposed to . <p> more than just a post-programming evaluation . QA should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life cycle ( SDLC ) . <p> searching for the flaws in the project . This requires a neutral and objective set of eyes and a critical analysis to find anything that might go wrong . <p> providing truthful feedback to the customer while demo presentations which helps to stay on the same page during SDLC . <p> A dedicated QA engineer brings a fresh perspective and interacts with the product features the way a new user would . A person with experience in QA will try to break the application , finding the faults in the system long before any user is exposed to them , which is exactly what you want to happen during the testing of your product . <p> SteelKiwi also has a number of QA engineers available to work together with the development team by providing user acceptance testing ( UAT ) . We only work with QA engineers that have successfully passed International Software Testing Qualifications Board ( ISTQB ) exams , ensuring that our QA team is knowledgeable and familiar with rigorous testing methodologies when performing the testing process . <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in separate offices , objectively testing the usability of your application . <p> In terms of SteelKiwi 's support policy , our QA team will investigate any issue that arises during production to help the developers fix it quickly . <h> Testing activities provided by SteelKiwi 's QA Department <p> The SteelKiwi team provides clients with testing activities at the early stages of the development process , decreasing the cost of fixing flaws and increasing the overall quality of the product . Bugs are always easier ( and cheaper ) to fix if they are found early on in the development cycle . A bug at the design stage is 10 times easier to fix than a bug at the coding stage , which is much easier to solve than a bug in the production code . That 's why it 's important to test every product thoroughly . <p> One of the most important points in testing of the modern applications is API testing . Detailed verification of the developed APIs helps rapidly locate defects . Such type of testing gives confidence that the developed app is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Also , keep in mind that you definitely need API testing on staging and prod environments if your future application will use third party API . <h> QA is invaluable <p> The importance of quality assurance may not be evident , but it is invaluable . Think of QA as a water filter , finding and fixing the impurities in your tap water . Even though you might not easily be able to see these impurities , they are there and they can make you sick . This is what QA does for software development . Even if the flaws are not evident , it is important to test for , find , and fix them before they make the software sick or broken . <p> A product that has n't been tested may look okay at first glance , but once you start to scrutinize it , you find the issues that should have been filtered out . This is the value that QA provides and this is why it is such a critical and highly recommended part of software development . <p> If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out more about starting a project with us , please do n't hesitate to get in touch 
@@108228866 @3628866/ <h> First-hand experience : Django project template by Steelkiwi <p> When you work individually you never think about what structure your project has , or how much time you 'll spend for initialization , or if everything is convenient or not . Your main concern is to finish the project and meet the deadline . When you work in the team though these question gain a good deal of importance . It 's all about little standardization . What would we like to do ? <p> Initialization speed : project 's primary configuration should take no more than an hour ; <p> Team development orientation : each team member should deploy the project easily on any stage of the development ; <p> Deployment-friendly : your DevOps should n't curse you when deploying a project , but do that in a glimpse of an eye ; <p> Scalable : there should n't be any problems if you add new apps or libraries ; <p> Well-structured : your project should be fancy and have a neat structure ; <p> Environment isolated : the project should work independently from your system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare popular templates and template engines . <h> Django template <p> As a result we get a template of the simplest possible structure . What does it contain ? Settings file contains the minimum parameters set BASEDIR , SECRETKEY , INSTALLEDAPPS ( django standard applications ) , MIDDLEWARE , TEMPLATES , DATABASES etc . <p> So we have a minimum settings set . However we ca n't control different types of settings for production , staging and local development , and there 's no requirements.txt . We can surely set it up ourselves , though it would be a mile better if we could get all at once without wasting a couple of hours for configuration . <p> We can see that now there appear packages set , more branches in settings , which by the way became more flexible due to environment variables , and both STATICROOT and MEDIAROOT have been adjusted , etc . It sounds good , does n't it ? But let 's look at the project 's structure : <p> To get to settings we have to dig deep , and this can get really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , on the whole , the template is really interesting and it makes project 's setting up quite fast . <h> -ookiecutter-django <p> This is a template engine that uses a like-named library for template configuration and adjustment . And it 's quite easy to launch . First , set up a like-named library , then , initialize the project . <p> All the settings are prefilled . Moreover , we can choose in the installation stage what exactly we 're going to use during the development of the project . It has quite straightforward structure , all the settings are stored in the config folder , and all the rest concurrent elements ( like apps , statistics , and templates ) are stored in the folder with the project 's name . However , we can trace a couple of disadvantages here as well . For example , the developers of this template state that they write it for their personal use , so there 's no guarantee that it 'll fit your project . The biggest drawback here is probably the abundance of unnecessary information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the development of the template used in our company , we needed to find a happy medium and make sure that in the process of development the project could be easily opened on any computer of a frontend or backend developer . <p> We used Cookiecutter as a basis , used its library for project configuration , and removed everything we thought to be irrelevant and redundant adding what we actually needed . <h> We changed the original project configuration <p> We decided to remove setting for Heroku unnecessary for us , jsrunner , choice of postgresql version , etc . Though we added the choice of additional redis and rabitmq backends of different types . Also , we made it possible to add allauth package as it is not always necessary , to choose between different DBs , and to integrate postgis . Also , we added a possibility to include supervisord , apach or nginx in the template . <h> Universal settings file <p> Many may claim this to be inconvenient , as it 's possible to move everything to local.py for local development , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production.py for a production server and use base.py for general settings . However , we have Django-environ , and reading . env files we can configure anything having general settings for all types of servers by only changing parameters in . env file . And to run it locally on any computer we use default value declaring it in the beginning of the file which let 's you launch the project without tweaking , so to speak . Your DevOps will easily get which settings it has to fill in production or staging . <p> If looking at the default settings we 'll see a standard settings list for project configuration . Let 's see how django-environ works with these settings . Each setting starts with DJANGO prefix . It is essential for having the possibility while reading environment variables to separate the settings needed for DJANGO application only and for other services . For example , spotipy , the library for working with Spotify , also obtains keys via environment variables , they also have an identificator in the very beginning which points to the library . <h> Virtual environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? Let 's say you have 3 projects with different python packages in each . We wo n't install them in the system , right ? Virtualenv creates isolated python environment and if activated it enables you to use packages only from this environment . You can create it using the following set of commands : <p> $ pip install virtualenv $ cd myprojectfolder $ virtualenv venv <p> You can set up a particular python interpreter version : <p> $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv <p> After activating environment you can install packages set and use them in the context of your project . <p> Now we have an isolated environment for python packages and we can avoid worrying about conflicts in different projects and our system remains clean . And what about the rest of the utilities , like postgis , redis etc ? <p> The third project uses celery , mysql , rabitMQ and it 's also bundled with mongodb . <p> Now imagine that you integrated everything mentioned into your system . Wicked , is n't it ? Of course , you can disable and enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now let 's put them in an isolated environment . To do this , we may use or Vagrant Docker . Why Vagrant ? Since docker is not virtual it is quicker . But let 's make it clear why we need it . <p> Vagrant is designed to manage virtual machines , Docker is intended to create and deploy applications by packaging them into light containers . It seems that even this small list favors docker , but Vagrant has one huge advantage , it is supported by any operating system . The reason why we use Vagrant is simple : for the opportunity to create an isolated development environment , based on a virtual machine with all the necessary services , which would have to reproduce the real working environment . <h> How do we use it in our template ? <p> Initially , we used one of the boxes in VagrantCloud Hashicorp ubuntu / trasty64 . <p> How do we fill our isolated environment ? The initial variant was quite simple : we used bash scripts and filling consisted in the sequential execution of *. sh files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , here 's the installation of postgresql : <p> Though the adjustment of all the necessary roles and packages using bash scripts required nothing less but magic ... We needed a more flexible way to do that , so the magic we used is called ansible . <h> Ansible <p> What is ansible ? Ansible is a relatively young configuration management system . The filling is carried out by executing playbook vagrant.yml , or consistent implementation of a set of roles , to be more precise . For example , we need to install postgreqsl , create a user and create a database . We connect the corresponding role , and using YAML syntax create a simple structure like this : Ansible ubuntu/trusty64 <p> Now it looks more straightforward and vivid . But we decided to take it a step further and we made a box with already installed services , so their activation is as simple as incorporating the necessary service . <p> And where is the relation to our project template ? Let 's remember our primary goal : we wanted to make an easily deployable template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would enable us to hand over a project from one developer to another and run it in any environment . And here 's what we 've got . <p> The start of the project : thanks to cookiecutter we pull the template repository and predefine some configuration values . As a result , we have a django project and preset ansible configuration for vagrant . Let 's have a look at vagrant.yml and vars-&gt; vagrant.yml <p> These examples visualize a set of options and a set of activated roles for filling our isolated environment . After this , we perform a simple command vagrant up and wait for about 5 minutes . During this period of time , all the required roles are being processed , packages are being incorporated , database and virtual environment are being created , python packages are being installed , needed migrations are being performed , etc . To shorten waiting time we created a box with the main preset packages , so packages installation simply consists in switching on a required service . When the installation is finished we get a box with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to our isolated environment using ssh interface and run django application . <p> Handing the project over to another developer : everything is made even simpler here . A developer pulls the repository , execute vagrant up command , waits for another 3 minutes and he 's ready to go . <p> At this point our next aspiration is to add the ability to support and docker and docker-compose , so it would n't restrict developers to use Vagrant . <p> The article gives an overview of measures that need to be taken to protect your business idea and entrust a development team with it .

@@108228874 @3628874/ <h> Building a game app for the modern child : Tips and Tricks <p> Today 's children are familiar with phones and tablets from birth . More and more parents are using electronic devices and apps to teach , amuse , or calm their children down . As technology continues to become an intrinsic part of our daily lives , this phenomenon poses an interesting challenge to developers . <p> Since there is a growing demand for quality children 's applications , it can be lucrative to build apps dedicated to engaging and teaching children . But it 's also important to be careful with how these apps are built as they can influence an entire generation . <p> There are particular details to take into account when developing an app for a child . Let 's take a closer look at the most important details that should be considered . <h> Target audience <p> Just as with any other application , it 's important to define your target audience before starting to work on development . <p> When searching for games in an app store , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range ( e.g. up to 5 years old , 6-8 years old , 9-11 years old ) . This is due to the fact that children develop very quickly and the interests of a 4-year-old can differ greatly from those of a 6-year-old , despite the small age difference . <p> Narrow down your target audience and focus on building an app that is most engaging for that particular segment . <h> Design <p> Children respond to particular aspects when it comes to design . Your app 's download page should be bright and colorful . Fun animations or puzzles can also attract a child . <p> Keep in mind that if the welcoming screen takes a long time to download or is not immediately attractive enough , there is a strong chance that you will lose the child 's interest in the game . As well , kids may occasionally exit or reset the game . That 's why it 's better to make the splash screen shorter so that they do n't have to wait a long time , preventing them from losing interest quickly . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a splash screen may not even be necessary . <p> Also take into account that children under the age of 5 may still have trouble reading . It 's best not to add a lot of text to games meant for this target audience . <p> The design of the app should be reasonably bright and should have the optimal number of interactive elements . Determining what that optimal number is will depend on your target audience . Children tend to try to interact with everything they see and may get upset if they do n't receive a response . It 's important to find the right balance between elements that are in motion , colours , audio effects , and smaller details so that the child understands what is interactive and what is not , avoiding confusion or frustration . We suggest using larger objects and adding a visual or audible pressing effect so that the child can understand when pressing a button has an effect . <p> It may also be useful to add hints on how to complete a level through motions , lighting effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements <p> Children , perhaps even more so than adults , need rewards and achievements throughout the course of the game . Bonuses , coins , additional levels , or whatever else makes sense to your app should be included to keep the child engaged and coming back to your game . <p> Adding sounds , such as the sound effect of falling coins , can also be very useful . Audio-visual enhancements , like the sudden discovery of a hidden feature or new level , will increase the child 's curiosity and encourage them to play your game again and again . <h> Entertaining and educational <p> Coming up with an entertaining , yet still practical game is important in attracting users . It is especially important in making sure that parents will love your app just as much as the child does . <p> Children should not only have fun playing your game . They should also be gaining a new skill or some knowledge from your app . Adding a character that helps them complete levels , encourages them when they encounter a challenge , or gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your game . <h> Click processing <p> It 's also important to be aware of how children differ from adults when holding a device . They are more likely to unintentionally touch the screen so applications made for children should take this into account . Consider how screen touches will be processed in your app in order to ensure that it functions properly when a child is using it . <h> Testing <p> Once you start developing your app , usability testing should be a key part of the development cycle . Make a list of important development questions and test these out throughout the app 's development . Questions should include : <p> how the child 's mood changes while playing ( are they having fun , are they bored , are they confused ? ) ; <p> how the child reacts to game progression ( are time restrictions an issue and how does the child deal with level changes or transitions ? ) ; <p> what colours and layouts are optimal ( test different colours , button locations , element positioning ) . <p> The ideal option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions at various intervals throughout development . <p> Our experience with developing children 's apps has shown that they tend to like large , bright buttons and are naturally drawn to the right side of a screen . <h> Access to purchases <p> Do n't forget to restrict access to purchases in a store or consider not adding this functionality at all since children might carelessly buy games or add-ons without parental permission . <h> Other details to think about <p> It 's important to keep game play and design relatively simple and intuitive . Do n't add unnecessary manual settings to the app , except for music or sound volume control . <p> Also , make sure that it is possible to save progress in the app so that children can feel like they are making progress without having to redo easy levels each time they play . <p> Keep in mind that , ultimately , parents will be in charge of what their child is playing and the app you develop should appeal to them as well , either because it is fun , educational , and positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope these tips will help you create a fun and rewarding game for kids that their parents like as well ! <p> If you 'd like to check out one of the children 's apps we 've created in cooperation with Uhsome.com play our recently released Mathwithyourfriends - a new variation of the Scrabble game , but with numbers instead of letters !

@@108228880 @3628880/ <p> Today , web application testing needs complex and full approach which includes key and general steps : functional testing , GUI testing and load/performance testing ( why testing is necessary for your project you can read here ) . <p> In this article we want to share how we create performance tests for web application loading using the most popular tool Apache JMeter . <p> many visualization reports ( charts , tables , tree , for overall view of tests ) , understandable for development team and customer <p> highly extensible <p> JMeter is an independent java desktop application that 's why it can be run on multiple platforms <p> can be integrated with Selenium , SOAP , Blazemeter , Jenkins , BadBoy , etc . <p> As you can see , Apache JMeter has many advantages over similar tools , but in our daily work we apply to it because it enables to execute load and performance tests for application at the different server types that include Web - HTTP , HTTPS , SOAP , Database via JDBC , LDAP , JMS , Mail - POP3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> At first you should install Apache JMeter ( version 2.10 or later , in this case we have 2.13 ) , recording will be more effective with Oracle Java 7 or later and browser Mozilla Firefox . In our daily work we use HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder for recording HTTP and HTTP(S) requests in Tests plans which could be ran all the time during web application is under testing . In this article you can find steps for Test plan creation for web application with https protocols and it includes csrf tokens . <h> How to create Test plan ? <p> Start Apache JMeter , at first you should add Threats Group to save recording Test plan in . <h> How to change Proxy configuration for recording tests ? <p> We create and run tests using proxy server . Change Proxy configuration in browser . For tests recording use exclusively Mozilla FireFox browser because some other browsers ( like Chrome , etc. ) do not allow you to override system-wide configuration for their proxy settings . Open FireFox browser . Change proxy configuration <p> Steps : find tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connection settings window : <p> choose Manual proxy configuration ' <p> add localhost ' to input HTTP proxy ' <p> add 8080 ' to input Port ' . <p> choose Use this proxy server for all protocols ' and press Ok ' button . <p> Check port at Test script Recorder , it should be 8080 ( 5 element pic.2 ) the same as in your FireFox browser . <p> Choose HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder , click ' Start ' button ( 6 element pic.2 ) . On the bottom of the Script Recorder window , JMeter proxy server will start and be used to intercept and record browser requests . If you are trying to record test at first time , it will display an error message that it can not start because a certificate does not exist . Click OK ' button , then click Start ' one more time . You should find a message that says that a temporary certificate named Root CA certificate : **31;382;TOOLONG created in JMeter bin directory ( pic.3 ) . Root Certificate CA was created and saved at Apache JMeter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever you connect via an https connection to make sure that you are connecting to who you think you are . In our case we should use our own created certificate authority to issue certificates for internal web servers . Just click OK and try to continue recording actions in FireFox browser . <p> Pic.3 . Created Root CA certificate <p> Open application that will be tested at FireFox browser and make test actions step by step . Use valid credentials for authorization . All steps made by user will be recorded to Test Plan set in JMeter . After making all tests actions stop recording . <p> As a result all actions that user makes in application were recorded to Thread Group ( 1 element pic.4 ) . <p> Pic.4 . Test scenario in JMeter .

You can work with it via other testing tools like Soap , Blazemeter , etc. just download saved . jmx file . <p> For running tests push ' Start ' button at the top menu ( 4 element pic.4 ) and find result at View Result Tree ( 5 element pic.4 ) <h> What should you do with requests that do not run due to csrf tokens ? <p> In this application there are some csrf tokens present and due to them we have some errors with code 403 ( 1 and 2 elements pic . 5 ) . At test result view you can find Request and Response Data . <p> For bypassing csrf tokens value should be captured by Regular Expression Extractor and input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test Plan ( using right mouse click ) .

That 's why you need to put Regular Expression Extractor to all tasks that were not passed due to variable tokens ( Duplicate GET requests and put variable value to csrf tokens at PUT requests ) . In our case we take first take ' request in which we find value of scrf tokens - duplicated it and implemented Extractor <p> For load , stress and performance testing we often used Apache Jmeter and Blazemeter together .

@@108228883 @3628883/ <h> How we create projects from scratch <h> What is the article about ? <p> For the uninitiated flexible methodologies of software development may seem a chaotic set of actions , the order of which is absolutely unimportant . Want to implement a new feature ? You are welcome ! Want to redesign the application structure in the middle of project development ? No problem . Certainly , such approach could not be called a non-working one . However , a seemingly simple and easy change of direction requires huge work on planning and preparation , which I am going to tell about . <p> In this article you will find out the stages of project creation , why these steps are important and why the positive result is impossible without the observance of this process . <h> Preparation <h> Gather the requirements <p> The work on every project begins with recognition of main requirements and goals . In our company UX-designers in cooperation with tech-leads and project managers deal with it . Even if a project is at the stage of idea , the customer surely has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business-logic , which is the skeleton of each service , and target audience . This is the most difficult communicative stage , as the degree of customer 's frankness and readiness to search answers for questions he has not given consideration yet are of paramount importance . <p> We have no recipe for this project stage , because quantity and quality of entering information is often defined by the following : what specialists are going to participate , which questions from our checklist are topical , which format the communication is going to be carried out in , etc . In the working process the competitors analysis is carried out and the main service 's functions are described . The result of the research is a structured document , which contains some general information about the project , description of goals and requirements , competitors ' advantages and disadvantages , and project vision . You can find details about the research in our previous article . <p> The time for research varies depending on quality and quantity of entering information . That is why we try to establish trusting relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of ideas ' nondisclosure , even if there is no such an agreement . <h> Frameworks and documentation <p> When the goals are clear , requirements are gathered and we have information to work with , we begin to create frameworks and write documentations . First of all , we try to describe global users ' stories , where we specify possible roles and ways of users ' interaction with the service and with each other . After this we start to create wireframes and/or prototypes , you can read about that in our article ( we are not focusing attention on the technical side here ) . <p> The main purpose of wireframes is the application structure design and checking the ideas accepted at the development stage . It is a common practice , that a function at the idea 's stage looks much simpler and more attractive , but taking all logical relationships into account it looks bulky and excessive in realization . At this stage exactly comes the clear understanding of how the user will get the necessary result , which processes will take place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the wireframes are supplemented with each space description and flow reflection with indication of relations between sections and pages . <h> Development <h> UI design <p> The high speed of wireframes creation is compensated by their relative specification , that is why this information is not enough to estimate development . Formally , design development begins at the stage of research , but we put UI design into a separate production stage to simplify perception and coordination process . <p> So , we have the results of research , design briefs and documented wireframes , which are to be turned into a completed interface . At this stage designers closely interact with developers and find out how precisely their ideas can be realised . Design creation is a deceptively separated process , and there is a great temptation to make changes into pages , which were not supposed earlier . <p> It is vitally important to overcome such a desire and to follow the drawn-up plan , in order to avoid increasing time for design development and adding new functions , which will have significant effect on the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed without adaptive design , that is why while creating UI design we take into account the way blocks will adapt to different screen types . It imposes lots of restrictions , therefore it is necessary to remember about compromise solutions , without which no design is possible . You can get more information related to this in our article about adaptive design , that also has the second part . <h> Frontend + backend development <p> After all the work from the previous points is finished , the stage of development planning begins . Before developers start generating kilobytes of code , it is necessary to plan architecture , estimate time for development , gather and choose a team , the members of which have the most relevant experience . <p> Certainly , it is extremely difficult to describe approaches to development in several applications due to the great quantity of their features . Perhaps , the cornerstone of any project is its time and budget management . Here we are absolutely open to all the approaches and try to warn about the consequences of any decision in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole project and a detailed estimate of every separate sprint before its start ( 2-3 week cycle , at the end of which the product obtains a new feature ) . In this case a backlog is formed ( the list of all tasks of the project ) and tasks are given an approximate estimate , which becomes more specified before the development at the stage of sprint planning . Such an approach is ideal for big projects , where business requirements can vary constantly under the influence of market tendencies , users ' reaction and other factors . <p> If we speak about the development with tight budget , any changes in requirements , design or project logic are impossible in this case . Even the least significant change can take the butterfly effect and increase development time dramatically . That is why we always try to gather all additional wishes of our clients on a separate list , which we can deal with after all planned work is fulfilled . <h> Testing <p> Testing is an indispensable condition for any project creation . Our specialists start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many people think , that QA specialists start their work in the course of development , however , they participate in formation of requirements to the project alongside with UX designers , help them analyse and make the description of the project at the initial stage , in advance fix users ' cases , which must be carried out in the finished product . <p> QA 's basic participation is a part of every project , and this work is not paid by the customer . Such an approach will do for simple projects , being at initial stage or those to be supported by the customers themselves . QA 's expanded participation comes as additional service , which we highly recommend not to neglect , even in case when customer has resources for independent testing . <p> We suggest the methodology of unified reports formation when developers will be able to quickly work with it , an integrated approach to testing , transparent results of check and timely reaction to changes . QA 's expanded participation allows us to bear responsibility for project 's post-release condition , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find some more detailed information about the QA necessity in the article . <h> Release and support <p> The released project only begins its life and is in need of support . We provide a guaranty period for every project with QA specialists ' full participation . The length and conditions of this period are regulated by the contract . The recommended minimum is Server and software support and maintenance , which includes supervision over server 's condition , software relevance and timely updating of safety packages for maintenance of project 's relevant condition . <p> The expanded version of the package is 24/7 monitoring , which ensures maximum uptime and immediate support . We are ready to fix server 's work any day at any time , if it is out of order . <p> It should be pointed out , that we have accurate differentiation of work work types , which may be needed . It can be planned software update , critical updates/fixes that make service use impossible , noncritical fixes or new functions addition , which can be carried out without any substantial changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project from scratch hardly ever starts with an idea only . We work effectively with any provided materials and try to preserve project 's vision , even if serious reconsideration of information is required . Every project , even the smallest one , always incurs risks with quite unpleasant consequences . <p> We know , that clear process plus transparent communication minimize these risks effectively .

@@108228884 @3628884/ <h> Main advantages of Automation testing for your software <p> Everybody heard about automation testing . Without doubt it makes manual testing easier and reduce the time spent on whole testing process . But why is it needed to you and your application ? We have simple answers : <p> first of all it increases quality of your software ; <p> it really can reduce cost of manual testing that is repeated on each development life cycle <p> test coverage of application will be heightened <p> autotests can be run frequently and fast <p> most of automation frameworks generate clear statistics which can help to point out the weak sides of application <p> when first phase of automatization is completed you can see the report with sanity test run results at any time you need to make sure that application is stable <p> higher coverage of cross browserness testing <h> When automation testing is necessary <p> On the one hand , if your project would be developed for more than 4 months , it is the first time you should think about automation testing . In first two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be developed . In three month manual QA engineer will already have a regression checklist that should be run after every sprint ending and after every serious defect fixes . During this period the additional costs are already needed for manual testing . But in the end of the fourth month regression testing for the implemented functionality would take more than a day . Automation testing can help to speed up the process and reduce costs . Manual QA engineers will have enough time for proper testing of new functionality and features . The impact of implemented features on old functionality can be verified via two mouse clicks to run automation suit . <p> On the other hand , if software under development is only MVP and would take about two months you should also think about automation testing . That is needed for the future development of extended version of a product for the quick sanity and smoke testing after . As the complexity of the application grows , errors control becomes much harder . <p> For example , if registration flow must be tested , the QA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> verify mandatory fields filling ; <p> check correctness of entered data ( phone or email ) <p> email verification <p> validation message displaying <p> Note that if there are more than one user type in the application all test cases should be run for each of them . So now you can realise how much time testing only of the registration and sign in flow takes . And now can you imagine how much time would core functionality manual testing take , which should be provided with code base growth ? Regression is always necessary , as well as time consuming . <p> Also you should consider human factor . I mean that the most conscientious and accurate regular tester can miss defects during monotonous manual testing . <p> The world 's best QA practice is to test manually developed functionality , properly verify as many test scenarios as tester can and then create automate script for future regressions . <h> How we do it in SteelKiwi <p> Our QA engineers can cover main functionality by automated use cases using page object model ( POM ) design pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-brittle test code and reducing of duplicate test code . In SteelKiwi we chose Agile methodology for development process . That is why we are always ready for your changes . Obviously , changes in code base will be reflected on automated use cases . Basically , not created using POM autotests should be rewritten , that is really time and cost consuming . Obviously , if automatisation QA engineer has used POM maintain of autotest takes much less time . <p> We use next technologies for automation : <p> the first one is using Java + Selenium + Serenity + JUnit framework . This behavior driven development which helps create maintainable and clean code for automated regression and acceptance tests . General advantage of Serenity framework is detailed reports with step by step description of application functionality with screenshots on each user step . You can see a sample of the generated report on the screenshot provided . <p> the second one is using Python + PyTest + Allure + Selenium . Allure framework serves to get reports of test runs . This reports are understandable for manual testers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , logs or other files to these reports , and even add tests to tickets in the bug tracking systems . Allure allows to separate difficult tests by steps , includes information about tests parameters and environment . <p> In conclusion please assume that cost of automation testing is higher than manual only at first stages of product development .

Most app developers realize the fact that the Chinese mobile market is massive , but are still a bit uncertain about what that means for the apps they develop . There is a number of issues which Android developers face when it comes to Chinese devices ( Meizu , Xiaomi , Blackview , etc . ) . Oftentimes , these problems arise due to the firmwares and/or shells working on top of OS Android or device settings . <p> The problems that occur are linked with the system workflow , services , components , etc .

@@108228887 @3628887/ <p> In this article we consider one of the methods to implement a chat written in WebSockets into existing django project using aiohttp and aioredis . <h> Introduction <p> A server written in aiohttp is single-threaded , which means that any blocking operation will block performance of the entire flow . From this it follows , that we can not use Django ORM directly in this flow . <p> One of the common solutions to this problem is to use the message queue . On client 's request we will publish a message in one of the worker process topics . A handler that is subscribed to this topic processes and returns the response to worker response topic . WebSocket -server receives a response , processes it and sends to necessary connections . <p> For simplicity in the example we will use Redis PUB/SUB . <h> Protocol <p> Before writing a web-server we need to develop communication protocol between client and server . In our example we will have chat with rooms on the same page , so we will need the following messages : <p> authentication ; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authentication <p> For simplicity , we will use authentication via token . Each user has unique token , and when they connect to the WebSocket server we check the presence of this token and its authenticity . <p> Since it is assumed that the list of chats is on a single page , with a successful processing we will send the answer to all users of this chat . This will allow us to note , that chat rooms have new messages and even enable us to give short previews . <h> Write a simple websocket-server <p> Now let 's create a new Django application called websockets with core module inside , as well as empty server.py , settings.py , views.py files . You should end up with the following structure of files and folders : <h> Subscribe to workerresponse topic <p> Before you subscribe to a topic , create a WSApplication class inherited from aiohttp.web.Application and specify the methods to be executed in it at setups and shutdowns . Add settings to connect to redis and topic names to **27;415;TOOLONG file and submit the creation of Application object in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connection to redis and add a task , which will process incoming messages from worker response topic . To do this , we define the method setup and subscribetochannel . <p> At shutdown we need to close all connections and complete the fulfillment of all tasks . To do this , we define a method onshutdownhandler and add it to the list of methods , which will be called at shutdown signal LONG ... In onshutdownhandler method we go through the whole list of connections and shut them down , as well as cancel all added tasks . <p> Then **31;444;TOOLONG file and write a class , which will connect to subscribetopic and process messages , then publish them back to worker response topic LONG ... in which we will specify a class with the method for processing the received message . <h> Implementation of messages processing <p> When implementing the messages processing , I am going to use django-rest-framework , as it initially has token authentication , and also because of the serializers . Of course , you can use something else . <p> Now add validation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have uuid and action fields . If they do n't , we will return the error . To do this , we change the processmessagemethod , add attributes of REQUIREDKEYS , ACTIONS and errormessages , and methods validatemessage and errorresponse . <p> In case of an error in the processing , we will send a websocket-server a message with ERRORRESPONSETYPE , in case of successful processing - SUCCESSRESPONSETYPE . Websocket-server will be guided by these types and decide how to send the responses . Let 's specify them in websockets/core/utils.py file . <h> Message processing with action=authenticate <p> When we receive the message with action=authenticate we will check whether the user with this token exists or not . When the processing is successful , we will add session data , so that we could understand which user owns the connection . We will process the received session data and save it in websocket-server code . To enable this , add successresponse and processauthenticate methods to our WorkerHandler class , as well as error message about invalid token : <h> Processing of message with action=selectroom <p> When you receive a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this chat room , but first we need to make sure that the user is authenticated and is a member of this room . <p> To do this specify getroom and processselectroom methods and add validation of session data to validatemessage if action does n't equal authenticate . <h> Processing of message with action=newmessage <p> When you receive a message withaction=newmessage , check whether the user is a member of this chat room and if there is a text of the message . These conditions fulfilled , we create a new message . In order to send information about a new message we add sendto key if the processing is successful , which will store the ids of all the users who should receive this information . Websocket-server will look for all of the connections of these users and send the response to them . To do this , add the text of the error message and processnewmessage method . <h> Send response to connections <p> Let 's consider the situations that may arise . In case of processing error , the connection which has sent us the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with messages about authentication and room selection . In other case , all connection that are included in sendto parameter should receive a response . Also , when we receive a successful response from workers , we have to update the session data . <p> Before sending a message to worker process topic we save it to uuid , i.e. when we receive a response we can find the connection to send a response to . If there is sendto in response , we have to send it to all suitable connections . <p> To do this , create methods findwsbymessageuuid , findwsbysendto , updatesession and processworkerresponse in WSApplication class .

Although some business owners consider outsourcing to be something inappropriate , it no longer can be referred to as a cheap stuff . On the contrary , outsourcing time-consuming tasks proved to be an extremely wise decision for all kinds of businesses . <h> Save Time and Money <p> If you have a staff of one or one hundred , delegating tasks to a third party provider frees up your valuable time . Hours spent on web or mobile development and solving different problems connected with it may be returned to your disposal by outsourcing . This relieves you and your team of involvement in accompanying tasks , which will be taken as primary ones by an outsourcing company . Of course , you will have to pay extra for outsourcing , but you would not save more if you needed to recruit , teach , and provide new employers with working space and salary , even for a short-term enterprise . <h> Professional Expertise and High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outsource the rest " a well-known business tagline says . Outsourcing is a good option if your company demonstrates no special ability in a particular area . And what can be better than hiring experienced professionals , who deal with the task several times quicker due to their core competency . <h> Reduced Cost of Training <p> Apparently , if you choose outsourcing , you choose to pay only for the service you need , without hiring and training your staff for this purpose . <h> Improved quality <p> The third party company is determined to provide you with high quality service in spheres which do not refer to your core competency , as they work for this result on a daily basis . <h> Access to world-class technologies <p> Your business might need a number of platforms and technologies for various services , which the outsourcing companies have access to .

@@108228897 @3628897/ <p> Push notification , also called server push notification , is the delivery of information from a software application to a computing device without a specific request from the client . <p> Unlike pull notifications , in which the client must request information from a server , push notifications originate from a server . Typically , the end user must opt-in to receive alerts ; opt-in usually takes place during the install process and end users are provided with a way to manage alerts if they change their minds later on . <p> An important advantage of push notifications in mobile computing is that the technology does n't require specific applications on a mobile device to be open in order for a message to be received . This allows a smartphone to receive and display social media or text message alerts even when the device 's screen is locked and the social media application that is pushing the notification is closed . <h> The importance of smartphones and push notifications in everyday life <p> This is not surprising , because the smartphone has become an integral part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with friends , plan our tasks and time , create videos and photos , do almost anything in fact . And the ability to make calls is no longer its primary function . <p> The number of smartphone users statistics <p> Push notifications are indispensable in the development of this process . They always keep us posted with important information and make sure that we can respond to the notification relevant at this very moment in time . This may be a new message from colleagues or friends , information about discounts , fresh news from an online resource you like , etc . <p> There 's the other side of the coin though . As a user may have a large number of applications installed , the number of push-notifications can be unacceptably high and cause a negative attitude towards them . Therefore , application developers must be aware of tacit etiquette of using push notifications : <p> Let the users manage push notifications themselves ; <p> Send only really important notifications , e.g. the relevance of which is limited in time . <p> An example of the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a user 's interest or special offers available only during short period of time . In this case the push notification is sent to ensure a user does n't miss out on this information . No-rush messages can be sent to email . This scenario will not cause irritation and the desire to turn off all notifications of your application , thus the user will develop loyalty to it . <h> Tips on how to make push notifications effective for your business <p> As it was stated before , the user must have an opportunity to turn on or turn off push notifications . Making these settings flexible will be more efficient , so it 's always a good practice to enable the users to choose those notifications they are really interested in . If the users have only two variants - to turn all the notifications on or to turn them off they 'll most likely stick to the second option . <p> Avoid sending the users an abundance of notifications . They will turn them off if you 're lucky , if not they will delete your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notifications and to send them only within a preset time span . <p> Use push notifications for getting users ' feedback about your app . <p> Now having the idea of what the push notifications are we can look at the possible variants to choose the most suitable one . <h> Some services and their tools <p> Let 's look at the most popular services . Most of them offer not only push notifications , but many other useful tools . <p> 1 . Amazon Simple Notification Service ( Amazon SNS ) . If you are already using any Amazon services , then you 'll like using its service for sending push-notifications as well , as Amazon SNS can also send messages to the Amazon Simple Queue Service ( SQS ) , AWS Lambda functions or to any HTTP server . <p> Sending push notifications to Apple , Google , Fire OS , Windows devices SNS allows you to send messages both to a single recipient and to a large number of recipients at the same time . You can use the SNS service to send SMS-messages to mobile device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of delivery containing the statistics of successful or unsuccessful deliveries and mobile push-notifications standby time via Amazon CloudWatch . <p> The first million of Amazon SNS requests per month are free . Then every additional million of Amazon SNS requests costs 0,50 USD . <p> FCM is the new version of GCM . If you are integrating messaging in a new app , start with FCM . GCM users are strongly recommended to upgrade to FCM , in order to benefit from new FCM features today and in the future . <p> So we already use FCM instead of GCM in our projects . This service is free for any number of messages and also there 's an opportunity to use two types of messages - push and data ones . <p> Tip : In our work we use Pyfcm library . Also our team works on the development of our own inside application to work with FCM API . <p> Tip : This service developers suggest using urbanairship Python library . <h> Conclusion : <p> These services are not the only ones worthy of attention . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd better decide if you will use additional tools of the chosen service as well , or you 're going to use push notifications only . This decision will influence both the implementation time and the cost of the service . <p> I hope you enjoyed this article and found it useful .

When the page is loading , AJAX request for messages history is sent to the same URL as well as the first request for page rendering . AJAX request is also sent for dialogs switching ( all required data is stored in history object ) . Problems appeared at history navigation . <p> The reason for this is that the first action that the browser performs after scripts loading is AJAX request to get JSON with a dialogs , which browser remembers afterwards . And if we go to messages page from any other page using history switching buttons - a browser will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JSON instead of designing HTML layout and loading styles and scripts . A decision was logical - URLs must be changed ! But since it was problematic for back-end , we had to find the way out in front-end .

@@108228909 @3628909/ <h> 8 tips on how to employ the best team of developers for your project <p> The time has come ! You 've decided to create a mobile application or website for your project . After defining the purpose of your project , identifying your target audience , and thinking up different ways to monetize , you 've finally begun your search for the perfect development team . <p> This search can be a tough one though , especially if your technical skills and knowledge are n't quite up to snuff . A quick search on Google will give you hundreds of companies to choose from , making the choice even more confusing . <p> Here are our top 8 tips on how to choose the best development company for your project ! <h> Tip 1 : Scan the market <p> There are a number of websites that feature development companies , helping you search through many companies at once . You can start by checking out what is available on Clutch.co , Appfutura.com , and Linkedin.com . <p> Design portfolios on Dribbble or Behance also feature development work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hire . <h> Tip 2 : Narrow down by location <p> Once you 've seen what 's available out there , narrow down your search by choosing a geographical location that suits you best . Prices , professional styles , and approaches to work will differ from region to region . It 's important to choose a team that meets your expectations and collaborative approach . Consider time zones , language barriers , and cultural differences to narrow down your search . <h> Tip 3 : Select a development language <p> If you are familiar with the various programming languages and technologies available , you might already have a preference on what you 'd like to use for your project . You can further narrow down your search by focusing on these particular skills . Look for companies that specialize in development using your favourite language or framework . Want your project to be built using Django ? Search for developers that are Django experts ( and find out more about why we believe Django is the best web framework there is ! ) . <p> If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built with , you can wait and consult with your top company choices once you 've chosen your shortlist . <h> Tip 4 : Set a budget <p> Compare costs for hiring various companies . Even similar companies from the same region can charge differently . You should find a company that has the skills to do a great job bringing your project to life , without breaking the bank . Keep your budget in mind when making your selection . <h> Tip 5 : Do your homework <p> Once you 've found a manageable number of companies to choose from ( 5-8 ) , take a look through each company 's portfolio carefully and with a critical eye . Portfolios will give you an overall impression of what the company is capable of . Do they pay attention to details ? Are they using the latest in development technology and UI/UX design ? Take into account every aspect of the work featured in the company 's portfolio and think about how it would translate to your own project . <p> Keep in mind that your application 's success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for featured portfolio projects and check out their reviews to get a sense of how users like the end result . A company that makes beautifully designed websites that are impossible to navigate through is probably not the best choice . <p> Case studies are another great way to find out what a development company has to offer . Case studies should look something like these examples from our own portfolio : TipCow , Inkbulb . By looking through a case study , you should be able to better understand the purpose of the project , how it was developed , and where the company 's skills lie in terms of current market trends . A modern development company should be able to show you various projects that look and feel professional , complete , and effective . <h> Tip 6 : Check out the reviews <p> One of the most important indicators of a development company 's success is customer feedback . Websites like Clutch.co and Goodfirms.co display project reviews from actual clients , giving you an idea of the company 's performance on former projects . Testimonials on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients and the team . <p> If you want to go a step further , you can even reach out to former clients via LinkedIn or Facebook to ask them about the company directly . As they say , knowledge is power ! <h> Tip 7 : Make your shortlist <p> After narrowing down your search to around 3 companies , you need to determine the criteria which will help you choose the perfect company for your project . <h> Some basic criteria should include : <p> Developing a minimum viable product <p> Companies that are interested in working with you on your project should suggest an MVP development model . This model will allow you to test your idea on the market while also saving you time and money . The company commits to a smaller initial project and can help you figure out the most basic , but critical aspects of your product . MVP development should allow for scalability and further development , giving you the freedom to continue with the project at a more transparent and affordable pace . <p> Establishing an efficient way of communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers . They should be managing your project and communicating with you with the aid of a tech-lead or project manager , dedicated to your idea , so that developers can focus on developing . <p> The most efficient way to collaborate is through a project manager , or PM . The PM should maintain sufficient contact with the client to control the development process , determine priorities , monitor quality , and coordinate the development team . A dedicated PM should keep you informed of the progress of your project and should work together with you to establish markers of success . <p> Ensuring the necessary resources exist <p> Some companies try to do it all with limited resources , putting a potential strain on your project . You should make sure that the company you select can provide you with the necessary staff to make your project a success . A complete development team includes at least one project manager , a backend and frontend developer , a tech-lead , a designer , and a quality assurance ( QA ) expert . <p> The advantage of hiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete teams available . While a team of freelancers may be more affordable , it is much more difficult to keep multiple people in multiple locations organised and on track , and the burden lies heavily on you , the client , to do so . A development company is most likely located in one office and can easily discuss and make decisions about the development process . Changes can be made quickly and collaboration is simplified ; multiple freelancers can not ensure fast or constant support , wasting your time and efforts . That 's why it is better to have a dedicated team available to you . <p> Agile Software Development : Iterations and divided results <p> Development companies often use a specific approach to project management , allowing them to stay on track of various projects at once . One such method ( and our favourite ) is Agile software development in which a project is broken up into multiple sprints . Clients are able to check in with the project regularly to ensure that everything is still on track . Corrections and changes can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become too difficult or complicated to make . <p> The greatest advantage of development using sprints and other Agile approaches is that inaccuracies or issues can be identified at the beginning of the development process , making it 10 times cheaper to correct than discovering them towards the end of the development cycle . <p> Post-release support <p> Make sure you are aware of each company 's post-launch product support . Companies vary in what kind of support they offer to clients once a project is realized . Some offer 24/7/365 support , which often comes at a premium , while others offer on demand support , and some might not even offer any support .

Every day a lot of new applications are added to stores and each of them claims to uniqueness . Creators invest money in promotion and make effort to ensure that the application has been popular and useful for a bigger amount of users . In November 2015 there were some 1.8 million apps in Google Play alone , 200 thousand more than in July of the same year . The Apple Store , on the other hand , had gone from 800 apps in July 2008 , the month of its launch , to 1.5 million in June 2015 .

What do the users expect from the native mobile app and how much time they spend on their smartphones ? ! <p> 90% of time people work with native applications and only 10% - with web . In this case we can make a conclusion , that the market of native mobile applications is wide and it will make sense to struggle for a bench on the market , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More than 20% of downloaded applications are opened by user just once . Over 25% of users abandon the mobile app after just 3 seconds of delay . Over 48% of users are less likely to use the app again and the goal is to hold a useractive for a long term . <p> If you want to create a really successful app , be ready to work hard , seriously promotion and pay special attention to testing . Even a minor defect in app can nullify all your effort in development and promotion . Slow loading of pages can reject potential users , when user has installed application and has opened it at first . First impression after installation is the main one , it determines users ' loyalty to this app . In this case the indicators would be the following : speed of uploading pages and content , how fast the user can click application and find out what it offers .

Good experience of application 's work is the key indicator . This means , that performance and time of responses have a key role in creation of a successful product
