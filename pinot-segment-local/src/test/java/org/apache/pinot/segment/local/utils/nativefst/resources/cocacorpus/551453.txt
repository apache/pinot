@@28238613 @1938613/ <p> Johannes has a better metaphor , but the photo is from iStock. - Ed . The Bumble Bee Effect . Different to the Butterfly Effect because they have n't made a movie of the same name with at least two sequels . The Bumble Bee effect is all about buzz and pollen . It 's about being talked about . We successfully did so by putting on an earthquake ( a really big one ) . There are other ways to create a buzz that are much more positive . Obvious buzz topics are awards , photographing the wedding of Kate and Prince William , standing tall in the face of adversity , scandal , heroism , and achievement . ( Actually ' scandal ' might not be considered as a positive buzz . ) Pollen is the haploid male gametophyte generation of the plant and is produced in both angiosperms and gymnosperms through the process of meiosis . Pollen is produced in the male cones of gymnosperms and in the anthers of angiosperms . This is important stuff ( thank you Wikipedia ) . Plants produce microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , the plant uses the pollen from its own flowers to fertilize itself . Other types must be cross-pollinated ; that is , in order for fertilization to take place and seeds to form , pollen must be transferred from the flower of one plant to that of another plant of the same species . Insects do this job for certain flowering plants , while other plants rely on wind transport ; agents that effect pollination are also known as vectors . The Pollen is really a metaphor for the fertilisation , and spreading of , ideas . Ideas are the buzz . When you think about it , The Bumble Bee Effect is straight out advertising , but in this age it includes being in places where people talk , like Facebook , Linkedin , Twitter etc ( the vectors ) . The Bumble Bee Effect is about the information and the way it gets around . A side effect of the pollination process is the gathering of honey ( rhymes with ? ? ? ? ) , a sweet reward for the passing on of the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all really . We are the often-inadvertent carriers of other people 's buzz , but , if the world were a hive , we would n't mind because a smart bumble bee knows that it is all for a greater good . So here 's the guts of it . Become talked about . Allow others to carry the message and be happy to carry the message of others . Cheers , Johannes PS On average a Bumble Bee flaps its wings 150 times a second .

@@28238631 @1938631/ <p> We came across Jacqui McSweeney 's Instagram when she shared an image of a Queensberry album . We liked her feed so much we asked her to tell us more about herself <p> Why do I love photography ? I love how organic it is in that I can have an idea for an image but from that idea to looking through the viewfinder to pressing the shutter everything can change . <p> I love how excited it makes me , and how I can share that excitement with the people I am photographing , and the people viewing my images . <p> I love thinking about the colours of an image or the beautiful tones of a black and white . I love that beauty can be both captured and created . <p> I think what 's most important to me is not how we get to an image , but what the image ends up being . <p> I have been a photographer for twenty years and a wedding photographer for fifteen of those . Before that I trained as a photographic printer , and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for photographers . I do n't  think I could have had a better start in photography . <p> Printing means you are looking at every aspect of an image : the colours , the tones , the framing , and what makes an image work . Working for so many years with film was invaluable too . <p> When I first shot weddings I had three rolls of 120 to capture the colour images and 2-3 rolls in the 35mm to capture the black and white . So that would be about 150 images from a whole wedding . I think I still shoot with the final image in my mind , thinking of telling the story with a finite number of frames rather than shooting thousands and hoping for the best . However I do love sitting down to edit my images in Lightroom now . I have so much control over how I want it all to look . I guess it brings me back to my darkroom days . <p> I think the look I go for is crisp and clear and sharp . Mostly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to stand way back and shoot wide scenes but I always seem to be drawn back to shooting close to my subjects .

And then her biggest question arrives : " How much will this cost ? " You tell her your " starting at " prices and then crickets . <p> Hmmmm maybe she did n't  love your work as much as she thought . The convo quickly wraps up and you have this pit in your stomach knowing that another one just bit the dust . : ( <p> I know . It sounds counterintuitive , right ? You were thinking it was time to drop your prices ' cause you 're sick of clients walking away when they hear prices they deem too high . And here I am suggesting you do the opposite . What 's up with that ? <p> Before answering , we need to take a little detour <p> In the consumer market there are three big spending arenasValue Shopping , Mid-market , and Luxury shopping . <p> In the good old days when we were kids , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their shopping arena . Value shoppers bought back-to-school clothes at Kmart . Middle Class America visited places like Aeropostale at the mall . And rich kids got their clothes from fancy boutiques . <p> I remember when people started calling Target " Tar-zhay . " Target ( like Kmart ) had always been considered the home for value shopping and yet something was changing there . People were discovering fancy finds at this retailer . Wealthy and middle-class consumers were unabashedly shopping for posh stuff in a Value chain ! They jokingly changed the pronunciation to go with the fancy air Target was taking on . <p> Shopping at Target ( a Value Shopper brand , remember ) no longer has a stigma . All the cool kids are doing it . But ya know which brands ARE hurting ? Those mall shops that used to be the Middle Shopper favorites . Shops like Aeropostale ( for example ) are filing for loans while Value brands ( Internet and brick and mortar ) are hitting big sales gains . <p> The middle market is dying a slow and painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their needs and aspirations . <p> Think of it this way you 'll save your pennies for an iPhone , right ? But you shop for groceries at Walmart . You 're proud to have a Coach handbag and you wear it with matching DSW shoes . Or take me for example I have a used car , shop for clothes only at the heavily discounted outlet stores , and yet my kids attend a private school that racks up tuition of $26,000 a year . <p> Private schools are n't  just for the wealthy and neither are iPhone or Coach bags . Consumers are no longer locked into one shopping arena . They have the freedom to trade down in certain areas so that they can trade up for big and little luxuries . <p> Which brings us back to photography . <p> Whenever I encounter mentor students who express the problem of clients walking when they hear the pricetag , I ALWAYS discover they are priced in the middle . <p> The middle is a no mans land . Run , do n't  walk , out of this spending arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the ones who are getting the most consistent bookings ) are those at the Value end and the Luxury end . <p> I 'm sure you all have some choice words for the photographers who shoot and burn for under $300 , and yet you 're green with envy when you see that their pages have 3000 fans MORE than yours , and they 're raving on Facebook about another satisfied client , and another , and another . <p> Shoot and burners are always busy because they are the ultimate trading down thrill . Just like Target shoppers can find adorable , designer dresses for unbelievably low prices , so too can consumers find a custom photography experience at a cant-resist price . These photographers never have clients walk away at the price tag because the price tag is so low as to be non-offensive . <p> " OMG ! You 're right , Megan ! I SHOULD just drop my prices ! Time to go with the shoot and burn biz model . Then I 'll be busy ! That 's the ticket ! " But wait , before you run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this model . <p> We all know Facebook likes to put on a pretty face . When your shoot-and-burn friends post new sessions on the daily , you see busy , successful photogs . What you do n't  see is that gal hopped up on coffee at 1am to get her sessions edited . You 're also not seeing that guy wringing his hands at night as he wonders if its all worth it . You 're also not at the accounting table with the photography couple when they realize they made more money per hour as **35;0;TOOLONG than they are now . Trust me , I 've been there , done that . And I 'll bet you have too . <p> The problem with the Value end of photography is that this world shouldnt even exist ( at least not as were currently seeing it delivered ) . <p> In order to be low price AND profitable , you must also be high volume , low customer service . And high volume in the portrait world , ai n't  one client a day . Its more like EIGHT clients a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding world , ai n't  one client a week . Its more like THREE ( or more ! ) clients a week . When you 're serving so many clients , you are n't  helping them choose clothes for their session , you are n't  hand-editing each image , you are n't  writing them birthday cards , and you are n't  meeting for coffee to coo over Pinterest boards . All the little touches that we soulful , well-meaning artists love , must be thrown out the window in the name of efficiency . The experience is rather cookie-cutter and makes us cringe a bit . <p> What shoot-and-burners do n't  see is that , while that $300 check looks nice , its not going to pay the costs of running a business . Unless they can get to a truly high volume ( eight portrait clients a day , not one a day ) , they are going to fail . And if they manage to achieve that volume , they will be a lot like Sears . Spoiler alert : Sears Portrait Studio is bankrupt . This business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the meantime , all the price-sensitive shoppers who are calling on you with your sensible pricing and good service , are sticker-shocked . Why would they pay $600 when they can pay $300 ( half-price ) and get practically the same thing ? ( Back to our example : why would anyone shop at Aeropostale , when Target is cheaper ? ) These clients see photography as a status quo need . They want custom portraits but they are n't  ready to spend big . You will lose this client more times than not because she does n't  see the value in what you are offering . <p> Before you all go curl up under your covers and cry , take heart . There 's a silver lining to this raincloud . <p> Enter Luxury Boutique Sales . The perfect business model for photographers who value offering high customer service , exquisite products , and great art ! <p> Contrary to what you might think , this market is not just for the wealthy . Remember , Walmart shoppers have the newest iPhone too . This market IS for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not just filling a need ( " I need boudoir portraits ' cause all my girlfriends are doing it .

I do n't  get that feeling at all when I walk into Target . I know what I can expect to pay based on the way the brand makes me feel . <p> When you have beautiful marketing pieces , when you answer the phone on the second ring with an air of " Im dropping everything to be with you now , " when you put an artisan-quality , handcrafted portfolio box or album into your clients hands , you are saying without words , " I 'm going to spoil you !

Take the leap and jump over $1,000 for the greatest success with luxury sales . ) If you 're a wedding photographer , you may want to be so bold as to say " My wedding collections start at $3,000 . " <p> Do clients walk away ? Yes . Some do . But the confidence in my voice and the promise of luxury keep the overwhelming majority of them committed to invest . <p> Offer luxury .

@@28238659 @1938659/ <p> Any serious professional will tell you that photography is n't an easy way to make a living , and it probably wo n't make you rich . Even Annie Leibovitz filed for bankruptcy . <p> Here is a piece of our story on the journey to where we are today . <p> By Koby &amp; Terilyn Brown . <p> Early in 2010 Koby and I had a serious talk about the direction of Archetype Studio . Key to that discussion was figuring out what lifestyle we wanted to live . <p> For us , photography is about passion . The need to craft memories into something emotionally tangible . Its about freedom to go where the wind blows , and live without boundaries . Its about risk and sacrifice . Its about relationships and love Its a lot about love . Its about seeing , really seeing . With your soul . Its about light and the absence of light . Sunrises , sunsets , the twist of a curl on a little girls head . That same twist of a curl when she walks down the aisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that is wonderful and it compels us to take pictures . . . But we figured out early onthe hard way of coursethat passion does n't  pay the bills . And passion was n't getting us where we wanted to go , literally . Before 2010 we both had other jobs to supplement ( read " fund " ) our photography , and honestly those other jobs were holding us back . Our freedom was limited , and travel nearly impossible to schedule . We had money , drove expensive cars , and bought expensive clothes and furniture . <p> A lasting reminder of a life of excess : in 2006 I actually paid $11,295 plus tax for a COUCH , and thought little of it at the time . Its kinda ugly but I still have it because I cant seem to get a decent price on Craigslist for it , and I ca n't bear to just throw it away . Its one of our last extravagant reminders of a different life . <p> That couch did n't  make us happy . In fact , I think it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us happy . . . except maybe the silver Mercedes coupe . <p> We chose to give up everything ( except the couch ) to pursue our dream lifestyle . Beautiful cars , house , accessories , furniture . We even sold our gold jewelry by the ounce to one of those We Buy Gold places . Everything that had cash value we sold . I was queen of Craigslist and eBay . I was happy to see it all go ( except for the cars I really like beautiful cars ) . But we had a goal and were willing to do whatever it took to make it happen . <p> In 2011 , we clearly defined that goal : to travel and photograph luxury events around the world , and to live on Galveston Island . <p> Even though we asked for outside help with startup costs , we were turned down each time . No one ( even family , and especially not banks ) thought photography was a good investment for the long haul . We emptied our savings and retirement funds . There was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive couch . <p> We spent most of the money learning everything we could about how to run a successful business , and setting up the business itself . Who knew there was so much time and money involved in setting up a corporation with a total employee count of two ? <p> There was also an almost complete turnover in equipment to manage . Koby and I built our original photography businesses ( starting back in 1998 ) on studio work , and our equipment was bulky and heavynot at all suited for travel . <p> We spent a year renting equipment , to field test it before we invested , and to determine exactly what we liked and what 's well suited for international travel . Bottom line . . . if it is n't light enough or small enough to carry to a hilltop in Alaska , or a pedestrian-only mountain-top city in Italy , its a waste of money in our eyes . <p> In our new life we do n't  use credit cards . When we gave up the fancy cars , and sold the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking back , its clear this was an important step towards future success . Debt is stifling . <p> We paid casha whopping $5,600for Big Red , the ancient , but faithful Durango that replaced my beautiful Icelandic Blue Land Rover . And we leased the Doodlebug , the little black Chevrolet HHR that was the most exciting thing we could find for less than ten grand . <p> Doodlebug replaced the silver Mercedes . Can you feel our pain ? It was worth it . . . kind of like childbirth . In this case , Archetype was our baby . <p> So while I speak of fancy cars and couches , and the faux woes of giving them up ( except the couch of course ) you should know about the very graphic side of those first years in this business . They were intense and there was n't enough money to make ends meet . <p> The reality of shopping at Salvation Army for yourself and your kids is intense . Knowing you cant pay all the bills each month and making sure that you alternate the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity because there is n't enough gas in the car to get there is frustrating . Doing all that while trying to grow a business in a new market is seriously challenging ... mentally , physically , and most of all for me , emotionally . If there is one thing we learned in business school , its that success breeds success . Often , success is built on the illusion of success . And success is expensive . <p> The magic really started to happen when we sat down together in 2010 and discovered we both want the same thing out of life and more importantly , that standing together we were brave enough to reach for it . <p> 2010-2011 were lean years , but hunger drives resourcefulness , sacrifice breeds appreciation . . . and teamwork is the cornerstone of success . Koby and I work as a unit . We have the same goals and this makes it easy to have the same work ethic . We sacrifice equally to do what we love ( except I still have my couch ) . <p> To sum it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on making them happen . Sounds simple ? It is . But it takes commitment and hard work . Be brave - You can do it . <p> Ill never take money for granted again . I 've learned that money matters . It matters a lot , unfortunately . But its only a means to an end . For Koby and I , its really about the adventures along the way , and the chance to save little pieces of future history . <p> Stay tuned , well tell you about how we defined our niche in a future post . <p> Terilyn <p> International wedding photographers , Koby and Terilyn , run a luxury event photography business from their happy little place on a barrier island off the coast of Texas .

Why ? Because I 'm uniquely equipped to tell my clients stories sometimes a story they may not even see within themselves . <p> People may be enamored with the look , the feel , the scent of the paper , the bursts of color those pages provide , but no matter how gorgeous , high quality or well designed , an album in itself can not create emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> The elation of imagining their story well told generates excitement and desire . <p> Clients will typically choose whichever album I show them .

In the case of children , I draw out their unique personality quirks and expressions ; those become full-page spreads ( or multiple spreads ) per child . There is nothing greater than hearing a parent say , " You captured each of my kids true essence , " then laying these out over several pages in the album . <p> Present the album layouts .

I find most clients will then typically narrow themselves down to 40-50 images . <p> If so , rather than show a client a product that might encourage her to trim even more , I immediately show her a premium album designed to hold those 40-50 images . <p> In other words , instead of trying to talk her into an upgrade , I start at the top , with that premium album , and allow her to " trim away " to a lesser , smaller album , and fewer images , if she has price concerns .

Now dears , I mention this because Photojunction has a back-end too , and I suppose what I really want to suggest is , if you can , keep your hands off it . Let me tell you what happened to one of our users recently . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would really have got my knitting in a knot , but there are lessons to learn , so let me explain what they did : 1 . Went in and made copies of the Project folders ( where Photojunction stores everything to do with a specific job ) . 2 . Manually deleted content from the Project folders ( which PJ put there for reasons I do n't really understand ) . 3 . Saved extra stuff in the Project folders ( which PJ wo n't know about " especially if it 's in one of the duplicate Project folders they made , which PJ also wo n't know about ) . 4 . Renamed files ( which means PJ wo n't be able to find them ) . 5 . Used illegal characters when renaming ( which PJ , your operating system or lab might not be able to handle ) . 6 . They also configured their Preferences to put the default saving folder inside the default project folder ( this is " I 'm my own Grandpa " territory and confusing for the software , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know everyone has their reasons , and I 'm the last person to criticise , but I hope you do n't mind me offering some suggestions : Click on my Preferences and you 'll see I do n't even know where Photojunction is storing my bits and pieces . As with my iTunes , I 'm happy to leave well alone . Some users need to change their Project Folder because they need to place the files on a different drive or central server , and it 's easy to do : I just do n't need to . I have n't even changed the default " saving folder " ( where PJ stores my exports and upload bundles ) , so the files still go to my desktop . But my main advice is not to mess around inside the folders . If Photojunction puts things in these folders I assume it has its reasons , and who am I to disagree ? If I want to duplicate Projects , Events or Albums I do it in Photojunction , because if I do it that way PJ can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same if I want to edit , duplicate or delete my image files or the exported page layouts : I can do it in PJ , and if I do it that way everything works . The developers , who are very nice young men , have spent a lot of time building all this into Photojunction so that they can help you avoid all this frustration . Bless you all , and please cover up outdoors ( it 's cold and wet here in New Zealand right now " not that I 'm complaining ) . PJ Nanny 
@@28238673 @1938673/ <p> Have you thought about running your own workshop ? So many photographers do . Its a great way to pass on your knowledge , build your reputation , and make a bit of money while you 're at it ! But where to start ? <p> Julz Glovers " The Workshop " is about the use of online imagery to get clients attention and turn them into paying customers . She focuses on food photography in particular , and on Instagram as a promotional tool . She offers both one-on-one and group coaching , but her latest course is online , and accessible to people across the globe . We spoke to Julz about the importance of online imagery , and what it takes to put together a course of your own . <p> loading ... <p> What is The Workshop and who is it for ? <p> ' The Workshop ' is a creative platform and service where business owners and other like minded people come together to learn about the importance of photography &amp; Instagram for their brand and how to implement these new skills into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group environment or during a 1:1 coaching session . <p> loading ... <p> How did you get started ? <p> I applied for a job as a photography tutor last year and after the interview , I had a bit of a lightbulb moment and I realised I had been beating around the bush , going from job to job , subconsciously avoiding going out on my own and following my heart . I had been putting off starting my own business for a long time . There was something inside telling me this was the time , so I followed my gut and I could n't be happier . <p> I love sharing my skills with those who are eager to learn so the idea of teaching workshops excited me a lot . Many people are posting photos on social media that just are n't doing their business any service so I want to help guide them to represent their brand in a new light ( pun intended ) . <p> loading ... <p> Do you have any advice for other photographers wanting to create an online course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online course would be to just go for it , and make it fun ! Do n't give up if sales are n't met the fist time round . Also , you do n't need to have your course content perfect before you launch the course . The content is something that can always be improved . Listen to any feedback the students give you to adjust accordingly . Better yet , ask potential students before launching the course - what do they want to learn about and what are they struggling with most ? <p> Depending on your budget , you can hold an online course via email , directly available on your site or host it on online teaching platforms such as Teachable , where many creatives host online courses . <p> Your sales page is hugely important . When you are selling the course you need to prove to your audience why your course is so valuable , who they will be learning from and what they will get out of the course . People want to know what they are investing their time and money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being heard , and that you are there to help them achieve their desired outcome . <p> I also suggest creating a Facebook group because that ads to the community vibe , which is hugely important with online learning . Give students the ability to ask questions , get involved , collaborate and learn from each other . <p> I have found the 1:1 and small groups workshops have been the most effective as there is more quality &amp; practical learning . I am always open to teaching new topics . I have been thinking about starting a ' mindfulness for business owners ' class and I also love the idea of weekend-long workshops . <p> loading ... <p> loading ... <p> Why is quality online imagery so important for businesses ? <p> Quality online imagery is vital in any business .

@@28238674 @1938674/ <p> Want to make the Workspace Image Gallery even more powerful for Events with lots of images ( eg weddings ) ? If that 's a Yes , check out an optional feature called image categories , which you can switch on in Basic Settings . Here 's how they work . The normal way to organise images in your events is using collections . Collections work a bit like iTunes playlists , in that images can be in more than one collection ( eg album selection and favourites as well as Nan 's ) . On the other hand images can only be in one Category ( eg Ceremony or Family Groups , but not both ) . You use Categories to divide your images into logical groups so that it 's easier to view them . What 's great is that you can use them together . Let 's suppose you divide your wedding images into Categories like Bride 's House , Ceremony etc , and then you or your clients go through and make a collection of Favourites ready to design an album . With Categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the images in one Category . This breaks up potentially hundreds of images into nice bite size chunks ! It makes album design easier , and if Uncle John wants to go straight to the family images , he can do so easily without trawling through everything else . The graphic below shows an example . It 's a slideshow for a collection called For The Album ( click the image to see it bigger in a separate window ) . The Categories are shown as a list along the top . Clicking on a Category name refreshes the slideshow to show only the images in that Category . It 's currently displaying ' All Images ' , which refers to all the images in this collection . And yes indeed , you can add a shopping cart to the slide show ! How do you create and share Categories ? In a Workspace Event you can create a Category by clicking on the ' + ' next to the Image Categories label . Drag and drop images into the Category box , exactly how you would for Collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your client or the general public ( eg by email or on Facebook etc ) click the blue SHARE button in the top right hand corner of the event window . The Categories you create will automatically apply to any Collections you share , but a Category will only show up in a slideshow if in fact there is an image from it in the- shared collection . Categories can also be used with- Editable Collections . If you do have any questions , or are still unsure on how it all works , feel free to get in touch . Have a play , try it out and let us know what you think ! Anna PS - the Unsorted and Reject Categories will never be shared , they 're just for you ! And do n't forget you need to switch on Categories in Basic Settings .

@@28238688 @1938688/ <p> We just had a webinar covering the Problem Reporter . Hopefully it helped clarify some questions you all had.I 'm going to talk about problems that can occur after this step . There are two ways to export your printable files from Photojunction . You can do it through Photojunction Direct ( if you just need JPGs ) or you can use Photoshop ( required if you need layered PSDs ) . If you choose to use Photoshop , the process is no longer completely controlled by Photojunction and this means that , unfortunately , we ca n't control everything that happens . Last year Danny posted some tips to avoid these problems on the forum . It seemed like a good time to revisit these tips and maybe add a few more . Even if you are n't receiving script errors in Photoshop , some of these tips might help you save a bit of time too ! #1 - Keep It Simple Just because the computer will allow you to name your folders anything you want , does n't mean you should . Resist the urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm looking at you , question mark , comma , apostrophe , slash , and colon ! - And any of your little friends too ! Following this rule will save you headache all over the place . #2 - Open Photoshop First This is especially helpful for a slower computer or if you have more than one version of Photoshop installed on your machine . Make sure you do n't have any files open in Photoshop though ! Just the application itself . If you receive an error when exporting and you had Photoshop open first , try closing it and letting Photojunction launch it . #3 - Close Other Programs The scripting ( communication ) that is happening between Photojunction and Photoshop is pretty hefty . On top of that your computer is opening all those High Res files , cropping , moving , resizing , etc . This can be very memory intensive . A restart before an export can never hurt your speed either . This will help clear up the memory so it is really only worrying about the export . #4 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next coffee break . Or just use it as a good excuse for a break . Photoshop likes to be a shining star . It is not a fan of running in the background . If you are trying to do other things on the computer at the same time , this could cause some communication issues between Photoshop and Photojunction and one of them may get confused . It is sort of like trying to have a conversation while someone in standing between you and your mate reciting poetry . Completely distracting , how could you deal with that ? And since you ca n't do anything at the same time as the export anyway , did you follow tip #3 ? #5 - Replace the Image Sometimes things look right in Photojunction , but the tiniest thing might be funky . If your export seems to go to a certain point and ALWAYS has a problem at the same spot of the album , try replacing those images on the layout and going to the export again . To save yourself a bit of headache , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . As odd as it sounds , this has fixed 95% of the times I have received an error in Photoshop . Still having issues ?

@@28238698 @1938698/ <p> Kate Hopewell-Smith believes that the more confident you are , the better photographer you 'll become . But she worries about the lack of confidence in our industry , and wonders how many photographers are considering whether to carry on or not <p> From my experience meeting and communicating with lots of photographers there is a serious problem out there with lack of confidence , which for some can become quite debilitating . In fact I describe it as an " epidemic " extremely prevalent , widespread . <p> I read a lot of photography magazines but I cant recall ever reading an article that openly discusses the confidence issues that plague photographers . Yet one brief post from me on Facebook recently demonstrated quite clearly that people are not only happy to talk about it , but probably need to . <p> Becoming a full time photographer is often a shift from living a dream inside your head to something that other people can see . It is often at this point that the doubts and fears begin to take hold - the kind of thoughts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm sure we all know that crises of confidence are common amongst creatives in all fields . Meryl Streep once said " You can have a perfectly horrible day where you doubt your talent Or that you 're boring and they 're going to find out that you do n't  know what you 're doing . " She is talking about a very specific problem fraud fear and I know it is something that many photographers can identify with . The reality of this insular experience is a horrible feeling of vulnerability that can lead to a negative impact on the creative process and the quality of our work . <p> Now I happen to believe that you become a better photographer the more confident you are the more you believe in your ability . Its complicated is n't it which comes first the chicken or the egg ? In truth if you are n't  able to believe and trust in your abilities then you need to address the reasons why . You need to work out what is stopping you becoming the photographer that you want to be . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other photographers and finding your skills lacking . This is truly a losing game and you would be far better to focus on you . You can only be the photographer inside you and not a replica of an idol . <p> Focus on what you can control and do n't  lose sleep over the things that you cant . A few years ago I had started putting myself in situations where my lack of knowledge could let me down , and I knew it . I was constantly on edge about the stuff that I did n't  know and if I 'm totally honest I had no idea what I did n't  know . I solved this problem by getting training and learning to control light , which increased my confidence hugely . I talk about photography being like an enormous jigsaw puzzle , and each piece of the puzzle being a nugget of knowledge . Every time I learnt something new the puzzle became more complete , and in parallel my confidence built . <p> At this point I am going to emphasise the fact that you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical aspects of photography , and find you get the results you want without really knowing how or why . This is absolutely fine as long as you are not taking on commissions that will expose your lack of knowledge . <p> A very simple example is that of winter weddings . To do a low light celebration justice you need the right kit and you need to know how to use it . The benefit of my training is that I can now walk into any scenario ( within my niche of lifestyle photography ) with the confidence that comes from knowing that I can deliver strong imagery maybe not my best , but certainly of a high enough standard for my clients . <p> Practice there is no substitute for hard work . Knowledge should help liberate you , and allow you to make pictures that you love . But only with some hard graft . After all , " Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst . " Henri Cartier-Bresson . <p> Be nice to yourself . Try to forgive your mistakes , learn from them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need some serious work and a plan . A plan will keep you focused and moving in the right direction rather than in a static state listening to the doubting inner voices . Take the time to sit and identify your weaknesses and work out what it is going to take to change the situation . This process alone , the act of recognition and positive action , will make you feel so much better about yourself and your business . Trust me . <p> Finally let 's consider that our end goal is often to be successful , but what does that mean ? Sometimes it is important to just remember the reasons why you wanted to do this in the first place . You might find that you have been taking on commissions that not only sit outside your comfort zone , but are also at odds with what you most enjoy about the craft of photography .

We ask her to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to future generations about her family values , her love story , her parents , and the love stories of past generations . <p> " Its about connecting one generation to the next , and we want to help her to do that . <p> " We send a questionnaire immediately , on the night of the wedding , and ask her to imagine some of those factors in her album display , using an intuitive online questionnaire process . " <p> The timing is ripe to determine what 's perfect for the bride on an emotional level . The Edmonsons catch her in her most vibrant , romantic state , unfettered by logic and un-poisoned by over-rationalization . <p> But curious , I ask , " Really ? On the night of my wedding ? How can you harness this ? " <p> Luke creates a little experiment for me . He tells me to close my eyes and picture myself on a vacation . " OK , can you see yourself ? Where are you ? " <p> " I 'm on the beach in Bermuda . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ? " <p> " Its pink , and grainy and very warm . " <p> " How is the breeze ? " <p> " Its warm but very strong . Its gusting through my hair . " <p> Luke says , " An hour from now , a day from now , even a week from now , I can ask you these same questions and the brain will recall the same answers , as if you truly experienced this . Its the power of imagination , and you stay committed to your recall of these dreams . It works that way for a bride . " <p> Wide-eyed , I take a deep breath and return to my home state of New Jersey ! <p> In 95% of cases , he says , the album purchase will remain consistent with the responses articulated through that questionnaire . " Because its the perfect album , the fulfilled commitment to her imagination . " <p> By merging these sensibilities , a top-of-the-line album becomes an inevitable choice for the majority of their clients . <p> Luke says , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transactional minds or leaving them with that memory of us . We want to engage with them on an emotional level , their right brain their imagination . " <p> Only after the questionnaire is completed is the album price calculated . <p> Pricing in the context of " Yes " <p> The Edmonsons employ a no-pressure policy , offering the album sale before , during or after the viewing . " While its not included in our commission , it can be added by our client to their collection at any time . " <p> Offering both a " Base Album " and an " Elite Album " ( the latter is a Queensberry ) , along with complimentary digital files for archiving purposes after the wedding , brides usually find the Elite album irresistible . <p> " We unified our pricing structure so that the process is ultimately about creating the perfect album for the client , not nit-picking about details and options . We want to price in a way that allows for whatever customization feels right for them . We created the questionnaire to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ritz-Carlton approach , where the experience is customized and the answer is always YES . From album covers to page additions , digital files , limitless revisions we want to give them what they want . " <p> What 's her perfect album ? <p> The Edmonsons ' goal is to discover ' What 's her perfect album ? ' Is it horizontal , square or vertical ? What suits her ? Does she want a refined smaller display , or something huge and prominent ? Does she want matted pages , digital flushmounts or the Duo album ? Does she envision 30 pages or 60 or 120 ? <p> " We do n't  over deliver on the initial album design , but we give the client what she wants based on her responses to the questionnaire . Thereafter , the client has the option to add images . add more sides or maintain her specs . <p> " This is where the imagination factor kicks in , " says Luke . The " upsell " is not a sales pitch , but rather a process of self-selecting options according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most cases , the higher-tier albums are chosen . <p> " While its true that 30% of brides may not buy an album from us , the strength of those 70% who buy top-tier albums is impressive . We know people have their reasons not to buy . They have notions of what they can or can not afford . Life happens , that 's all okay with us . " <p> A Higher Visual I.Q. <p> " We like to say that our clients have a higher Visual I.Q. " said Luke , " When they see a Queensberry , it fits the prism of their imagination . <p> " We searched the market and did extensive research to create the highest perceived value , " he said . " The feel of the pages , the vellum overlay , the inherent value of professionally designed layouts Queensberry really gave us the best way to tell and preserve the precious legacies of our clients . " <p> The Big Picture <p> Much like a signature Edmondson portrait , I commented that their approach seems to be " all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really have to shift the paradigm . We cant decipher everything like a Chinese menu , basing our standards on strictly defined price points and add-on options , and not expect our clients to do the same . Its much wiser to think about how you like to be sold to , and work from therefrom an emotional standpoint , " he says . <p> Luke notes how our industry has changed dramatically , as wedding and portrait commissions are shrinking . <p> " Those who are selling twenty or more amazing albums a year are going to do really , really well . They are making themselves indispensible resources , as historical storytellers for the client . The others not selling albums , in my opinion , will not survive . " <p> " We need to think of ourselves as architects . We have an expertise and create value when we deliver their vision of their story , not simply ours , " Luke elaborated , " If they ask us for a ranch home and we give them a colonial , we are n't  fitting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top quality materials , we become invaluable talent and they 're thrilled . " <p> Its the ower of imagination and Yes that makes you indispensible . <p> And at the heart of it all <p> " To us , an album is a not just a documentary of a wedding day . Its an heirloom and a family legacy <p> We like to think were not shooting for the past and the present <p> Were shooting for future audiences , the generations to come . <p> We want every grandchild , every great grandchild , to be able to look at an album and see the story of their matriarch or patriarch <p> " This is our fundamental vision , and our sales philosophy is simply a by-product of it . Our cameras give us an excuse to be invited into peoples lives and shape their legacies . That means everything . "

In 2015 , he discovered the exhilaration and satisfaction of capturing outdoor landscapes .

When I was starting out in photography , I asked Teresa Klostermann if she would allow me to learn from her . At one of her wedding gigs , I was able to attend as her assistant , which gave me hands-on experience . I studied Teresas technique of shooting , posing , and applying a creative eye to various scenes . In my early days I mimicked much of what TK taught me , even down to my editing style . <p> " I also turned to YouTube , which is a great platform for learning different skills , such as editing . I stumbled across David Ilyin a few years ago and literally soaked up as much as possible from his editing tutorials .

This will ensure that the information that 's shared has relevance and impact . Learn to ask for help and do n't  get too caught up in what if they say no ?

First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it or not . Even if you think people passing your images around is a form of piracy , that 's better than being ignored , which is what happens to most of us .

( Is n't it ironic that Shoot and Burners are delivering their pictures on thumb drives now , just as PCs are going the way of DVD players , and everything 's going wireless ?

" Its important to identify a niche , " she says . " There are a lot of galleries around . You need to be different .

" Its important to do your own research on the gallery you 're applying to , and fill out any and all paperwork they require before contacting them . This gives them a chance to research you as an artist and look at your work . Be prepared . At this stage , I am able to run an exhibition on my own , with the help of the exhibiting artists , and do n't  need to employ anyone .

" <p> loading ... <p> " I am personally drawn to conceptual art ; something that makes you think , not necessarily a pretty picture . So far the standard of images has been high . Unfortunately I still have to turn artists away if their work does n't  fit with my requirements . " When looking for new artists to represent , she says , " I find artists through personal contacts . I also advertise for applications through my social media sites and posters at art institutes .

" Some may call it old fashioned and boring , but I want people who werent there with me to experience it too . To show them how it was , rather then illustrating and creating an artificial image afterwards . Generally , I 'd love my landscape photographs to be timeless , appealing to viewers in 50-100 years time . I do n't  drop in skies , remove structures , make mountains bigger , change colours etc . That 's just not my style .

Not to mention their archival qualities , which are counted in many decades . These prints need to be seen to be fully appreciated . There is no better feeling in photography than seeing the print at its real size rolling out of the printer incomparable with looking at pixels on a screen .

@@28238808 @1938808/ <p> I wrote this post two years ago and for some reason never published it , but I think it makes some good points about simplicity and not confusing price and payoff . See what you think ... We had an interesting email from a client who also deals with a certain other album company ( shame on him " LOL ) . This company makes a big deal about simplicity and quite right too . Anyway , he asked them if they 'd consider introducing some - gulp - options , and to his frustration they said No . Now to be fair , over the years we 've got better at saying No to things that compromise either the integrity of our product or our ability to deliver it , and if there 's one thing we do like it 's simplicity , but there is still a big difference in philosophy here . It 's highlighted by two things this company said to our client . 1 . They suggested that he solve the problem of customers asking for options that they did n't offer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great idea , until people see what they want at your competitor's. 2 . They also said that offering " options " would create production difficulties for them . No argument there . The solution for Queensberry lies in the workflow and systems that connect you with us ( cue a big fanfare for Photojunction and Workspace here ) , in setting very high standards for our team and understanding that yes , with more chances to screw up every now and then we may . That 's the price , not to be confused with the pay-off " differentiation . Because making all your albums look pretty much the same as everyone else 's ignores the fact that one of the most visible signs of differentiation between studios is the album . And that 's important because in the long run there are only two ways to compete - differentiate or drop your prices . We do n't believe that your clients ' choices , or your opportunity to project yourself in the market , should be put aside because artisanship and good taste and catering to personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " our job is to see that as far as possible , any difficulties involved are our problem , not yours .

@@28238810 @1938810/ <p> We caught up with two of the design team , Simon and Rachel , to talk all things album design . Here are their top four tips for creating beautiful , clean layouts . <p> loading ... <p> Less is more <p> Rachel : Unclutter your design . Its simple . Let the key images and high quality materials of an album speak for themselves . If you notice the design , its taking precedence over the images good design is effortless . <p> Simon : If the design is loaded with images the hero shots can be lost among a forest of images . By keeping the image selection minimal , you 'll free up space and make the rest of the design sing . <p> loading ... <p> loading ... <p> Continuity is important <p> Rachel : An album is meant to tell a story , and images that look out of place throw the viewer off . When designing an album , I always think about the order of events , the scaling of the objects within the imagery , and the general feeling of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Simon : Images that match in context tend to sit well together , and images that do n't  tend to distract . With every design I aim to create flow between the images that is effortless from one setting to the next . <p> loading ... <p> Be wary when cropping <p> Rachel : Cropping an image should always leave its integrity intact . It can be good to remove distracting elements , or emphasize a point of interest , but you ca n't use cropping to try and change an image . <p> Simon : You may be tempted to crop in on an image to feature the subject matter larger , but be mindful that you are n't  losing the quality and integrity of the original composition . Also , if you crop tightly you run the risk of critical areas of the image being hidden behind a mat , or trimmed away when the book block is guillotined in production . And important details often look awkward when they 're jammed up close to the image edge . <p> Watch out for Aunty Sue <p> Always take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer Duo albums or Panorama Flushmounts , there will always be either a split or a crease in the page . Get to know the album you offer and take into account the margin width to avoid splitting Aunty Sues face in two . <p> loading ... <p> Why not outsource ? Some photographers like to do their own design . Maybe they use design as a sales tool , or their design skills and sense of style add value to their work . Or maybe they just enjoy it ! But otherwise , let us do it for you ! Our team of trained designers do a great job and will make your life simpler , and there 's no extra charge for their services . 
@@28238811 @1938811/ <p> This is a long post , so I 'm starting with the short story ! Some people are upset about the terms of trade for our new web-based lab service , Queensberry Print . <p> We want to clarify that , yes , Queensberry Print products are available to both professional photographers and end-consumers . Certainly , " consumer " means " everyone " , but in reality we believe these products will only be of real interest to professionals , serious amateur photographers , and people who received digital files from a professional and who really care how their photos are printed . <p> Our existing range of books and albums is still 100% exclusive to professional photographers . <p> As well explain in detail below , the new service is driven by changes in our industry . They allow us to respond to those changes , including the increasing frustration ( even resentment ) of some consumers at the fact that many photographers , for whatever reason , have themselves stopped selling " professional " albums . <p> As a professional yourself , when you log in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our entire range of products , but the general public certainly cant . No one can see any prices , or order any products , until they register with us . When they do , they will only be able to see pricing and place orders for Queensberry Print products UNLESS they claim to be a professional , AND we accept their bona fides and approve their account . <p> The Long Version <p> Queensberry Print will offer silver halide , inkjet and digital offset printing , plus its own range of presentation products - frames , boxes and photo books . Anyone will be able to buy who cares enough to pay for high quality printing , products and hands-on service - not just professionals . <p> That 's what 's disappointed some of our clients . They like the new products but want exclusive access to them , like our existing books and albums . <p> But why change at all ? <p> Because what 's driving change is not us but the industry we operate in . <p> When we started attending trade shows in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen album makers at an event . At the last one we attended there were about sixty . Labs have gone into book publishing , or struggled to survive . Huge photo book operations like Blurb and Crewe have grown , and even developed their own " pro " services . Almost none of them is committed to " professional photographers only " , but all are eating away at the markets of traditional album makers like us . <p> Into that mix you need to stir revolutionary technological change , at every stage from camera to final product , plus the internet , which changes everything . <p> On the other side of the equation , professional photographers are under incredible pressure too , struggling for a sustainable business model , when everyone has a camera and we 're up to our eyebrows in images . <p> So , like all album makers we 've been asking ourselves what happens when ... <p> 1 . Our competitors do n't play by the same rules as us . <p> 2 . Photo books are everywhere , and accessible to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . Many photographers have abandoned the idea of selling albums in favour of shoot-and-burn or digital downloads . <p> Does this mean Queensberry is in trouble , as we 've seen people say ? No , it means we 'd be silly to sit back and do nothing about it ! <p> Over the last few years our business has been transformed : PJ Remix , Duo , MusTe , Press Books , Workspace and the rest . The only thing that 's remained the same until now is our single-channel policy . <p> Canon , Epson , Kodak and Nikon have professional products and services . They do n't go out of their way to market them to amateurs , but they do n't ask to see your licence either Leica would go broke if their market was photographers instead of people with money And a friend recently shot a portrait session for a client with far more Hasselblad kit than he has . <p> What professionals can get , often , is a better price , and that 's what we intend to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partly it 's simple loyalty , but there 's more to it than that , as I 'll explain . <p> A few years ago we went through a " design audit " process with a team of brand and marketing specialists who were intrigued by the fact that , unlike any other " design-led " company they could name , we do n't have full creative control of our products . The photographer 's picture-making and design skills make or break them . It 's no wonder we love beautiful work , because it adds so much value to what we do ! Image quality , design skills , technology skills , and of course , access to " the people in the viewfinder " . <p> In short , we believe professional photographers help us make a better product . <p> 2 .

Additional tier discount to regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queensberry Print . <p> 4 . An expectation of quality to match the images you 've created . The saddest thing about shoot-and-burn is that so many photographers are abandoning their images , which they 're presumably proud of , to any random print , frame , or canvas shop the customer chooses . Or to oblivion in a drawer somewhere . <p> 5 . You will soon be able to sell these products online in your own shopping cart in Workspace . <p> Two ways to offer Queensberry print products <p> With these new products you will have a choice : Make the sale yourself , and place the order at " trade prices " , or offer Queensberry Print products in your own shopping cart ( coming soon ) , reasonably marked up , and with your profit on the images themselves added on . <p> If you 're committed to shoot-and-burn , you might also simply recommend Queensberry Print because you care what your customers do with your files ! Even though shoot-and-burn may be a reality we have to live with , if anyone cares enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presented , surely they 're doing everyone a favour . <p> Its you the clients paying for <p> Obviously we believe that beautiful presentation adds value to your photography . It differentiates you and your work in the market , and its an essential part of high-end brand-building . But that does n't  mean you can easily charge prices for those products that consumers believe are " unreasonable " . High-end products like our Duo may be one thing , but frames , canvases and photo books , available all over the place , are quite another . If the internet has done nothing else , its made it really easy to compare prices on consumer goods . <p> What does that mean ? <p> If you 're going to charge separately for the image and the product , the product price really needs to be " reasonable " in the eyes of the public . <p> Your art , what you get paid for , is your photographic and design skill . From a business point of view the products your imagery is displayed in add value two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , indirectly by way of the value they add to the images themselves . <p> Building a brand to support you <p> Mid- to high-end photographic studios are the foundation of our business . Helping them prosper is in our DNA . So is our belief in the importance of what you do for " the people in the viewfinder " by way of your photographic , storytelling and design skills . <p> Its our intention to continue to ramp up our marketing and support of professional photography . It starts with an update of our directory , coming in a day or two , with more initiatives coming soon . <p> As we said when we launched , Queensberry Print is the start of something new , and as always with our new projects you 'll doubtless see the site and the products evolve over the months ahead .

@@28238814 @1938814/ <p> For much of my life I 've lived with something that feels like both a blessing and a curse . I 'm passionate about helping people , deeply curious about relationships and business , and often I 'm the person that people go to for advice . That of course is a great honour , but the curse part is that caring leads me to give people the advice I think they need rather than the advice they want , and that sometimes hurts or challenges them . To use myself as an example , I 'm overweight , and yet I know there is a basic formula for changing that : " Less Calories In , More Calories Spent " . Like the people who come to me for help , I need confident , focused advice , and to be held to account - but in fact I find well-meaning people fall into 3 categories . 1 . Those who do n't want to hurt my feelings , so avoid the issue . 2 . Those who help by introducing the " new new thing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , talk from experience and have the confidence to confront me . Until recently I 've tried to avoid the realities of my situation , so I preferred people who fell into categories 1 or 2 . They allowed me to remain a little delusional , whereas the Type 3 person would challenge me and make me face up to the changes I need to make . So why do I mention this ? Well simply I believe our industry has become to an extent dysfunctional . Or to be more specific , while many photographers are confidently following a successful path , many others are struggling - and the opinions and advice they 're getting from certain other people are n't helpful . Too often the conversation has become dominated by those offering the equivalent of Type 1 and 2 advice above . They make it easier and more acceptable to accept low prices , to not make the sales effort , to not re-examine what we 're doing - and blame customers and the market instead of doing the hard focused work needed to be successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , we 're often challenging potential customers , the people we never want to upset . As a result I 've been decidedly absent from social media over the last year . This has been partly due to development projects within Queensberry , but , as well , I simply lost my confidence in how to respond to the online discussions I see . Too often the tone in many online forums ( Facebook , LinkedIn , private forums ) is negative , defeatist or over-simplistic . The most assertive voices are often the most negative , and when advice is given it 's seldom clarified or put into the context of the writer 's experience , or lack of it . Often the advice , in my humble opinion , is simply wrong . If nothing else it 's just personal opinion , " what works for me " , but it 's given as gospel , as if it applies to all , and that simply can not be true . Many say that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert . It may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert just because you believe something and it works for you . I guess my challenge is not for people to stop giving advice , but for those asking for it to be more curious and cautious about the answers they get . We 've done our 10,000 hours in running a luxury business , in sales , in IT and in working online , although we 're not traditional chest thumping self promoters . We do however speak to far more photographers than pretty much any self-appointed expert out there , and I just wanted to say we 're here to help if you want us to . You can email or phone me personally , knowing that we really want to build a strong community of successful , generous photographers who believe in the value of what they do , work hard and invest in their own professional development . Professional photography is very different to what it was ten years ago , or even five . There 's no point in being negative about that , or pining for the old days .

@@28238846 @1938846/ <p> . But first , some background ... For decades many photographers charged really high prices for their products ( albums , prints , framing etc ) . They did this to avoid asking a reasonable fee for their <p> services <p> . You can see why . Even our wealthiest acquaintances think photographers charge way too much ( they have no idea what you do for your money ) . A few photographers backed up these high prices with some pretty dodgy selling techniques . For example I knew a guy who would tell people that unless they bought now the prints would go for recycling ( true ! ) . Another would ask his customers , do you like this photo ? If they said no he ripped the print in two . They soon got the point . Well you just ca n't do that any more . So ... <p> 1 . You need to charge for your services <p> . You must also be clear what those services are ( the shoot , travel , consultations , image editing , artwork , album design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the album , you need to make that very clear too . <p> 2 . You need to charge a reasonable mark-up on the product itself . <p> So what is a reasonable return on a Queensberry album ? Our attitude is that you can charge <p> as much or as little as you like . <p> If you can charge way more than I 'm about to suggest I 'd put it down to your reputation , and to your craft and sales skills - congratulations ! But there 's no point complaining if other people sell our albums too cheaply by your standards . We know people who cover their costs only , because they make their money in other ways or because they 're getting started and want to build their business with a following wind from world class products and beautiful presentation . <p> But I 'm just putting off telling you how much ! <p> How does 100% markup on the wholesale album price sound as a starting point ? That 's a fairly normal retail markup in this part of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services I mentioned . Apart from your sample(s) you have no up-front investment in stock , and I 'm assuming your customers have already paid for the photos through your shooting fee . For years people selling all-inclusive packages would suggest taking your costs and multiplying them by 3-400% , as if that number was carved in stone . But that seems wrong today unless you 're making very clear that the price covers the photography and a lot of services . If it 's just presented as a markup on the album it probably looks alarmingly expensive . But as we 've been saying , I do n't think you should focus on the percentages , but on the <p> extra revenue <p> you could earn from the gig , and on the <p> marketing benefits <p> ( differentiation and word of mouth ) . Price it to be tempting . The real choice may be between making less than you 'd like on the album , and making nothing at all .

@@28238918 @1938918/ <p> I could n't help myself ... I just had to jump in on this one . There are many reasons why photographers are coy on their pricing . They want to keep their colleagues uninformed . They do n't want to frighten potential clients before they have had a chance to impress them with their own brand of personal charm , their list of awards , and the opportunity to brandish their Photoshop skills . They do n't feel confident in their own pricing . We have two companies dealing with different budgets . The less expensive brand has full disclosure on the website. 65-75% of people responding to the website are booking an appointment if we are available . 10% are asking for our prices ( mainly photographers who ca n't read ... I 'm kidding but you 'd be surprised ) . 15% are trying to sell- us something and about 10% are asking about other things . The more expensive site gets more comments but less bookings . The most common request is , ' How much ? ' - This usually comes up well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Heather and Anna said do n't waste your time telling them how good you are . They are both right about their responses , and the choice depends on who you are talking to . Some brides feel that you are hiding something if you are unable to answer their question . Others are looking for a ball park . Both want an honest answer . With our premium brand we have two significant issues to address . Firstly people assume we will be out of their budget . Secondly they assume that we will be busy . Stating our prices on our website could mean that we miss out on having the conversation that could lead to us picking up a booking . Stating our prices does let people overcome some of their own barriers . It is important that we have something that clients can like and afford so that the door is still open to us for a look in .

If it was a popularity contest it would end up below car salesmen , cold callers and politicians . But love it ( nobody ) or hate it ( everybody ) it 's there for a good reason . Photojunction travels along paths . It follows those paths to locate , use and update the proxy images , hi res files and exports created as you work . The rules are simple . If you do n't move , rename or delete your files and folders , Photojunction will find them . But life is n't simple , and sometimes stuff happens . So what can you do ? First stop is the relink option . In the Event window under the " More " button you get the option to relink your hi res files ( as in the graphic ) . Use the browse window that appears to navigate to your hi res folder . This will clear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few images still not found , most likely because those files have been renamed or are in a different location ( maybe a new folder , like " Edited Images " ) . Remember , anything that 's not along the original path PJ wo n't find . There are several options available to you to resolve this . 1 . Place all the hi res files in one folder and relink the whole folder , as above . 2 . If you have sub folders place them in a main folder and relink to that main folder . Photojunction will work through the sub folders happily . 3 . If you select a single missing image in the Event window and right click ( or control click ) on the image a pop up menu will appear . Select " Browse for Original " and locate the missing file . 4 . Make sure that every image has a unique file name . You might not even be aware you have duplicate file names because they 're in different folders . This sometimes happens when people make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , and put it in a new folder with the same name . Always give the new file a unique name . Otherwise as Photojunction is working its way through your subfolders , if it comes across more than one file with the same name , it will replace each in turn until it reaches the last line , which will be the only one used . 5 . Finally , if you have renamed files they need to be reimported separately . Go back to the MORE button on the Event windrow and select Import More Images .

@@28238953 @1938953/ <p> Rugby World Cup fever is gripping New Zealand at the moment , which ties in nicely with my topic ( sort of ) . Twenty teams are here to be beaten by the mighty All Blacks . ( Go you good things ! ) OK , all the teams want to win , but only one can . Whereas our goal is to deliver the best possible books and albums , so everyone wins . How 's that for cheesy ? But we mean it ! We have had an influx of press book orders over the last few months and nearly everybody has been over the moon about them . However not everyone has had the same warm fuzzy feeling . Why ? Often it 's the nature of the product itself . Press books are books . Not albums . When you design them you need to remember they 're three dimensional . Like all perfect bound books and magazines , the pages curve in to the centre , and Photojunction does n't show this very well . I raised this with our developers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe guides to 10mm from the spine . The designers say that 's helpful , but you ca n't depend on it to keep you out of trouble .

Press books are great in that they enable you to design with lots more pages and images , but maybe in your case you need to field a different team . If you love the look , touch and feel of our art papers , but want a lay-flat product , check out our press albums . Good luck to the boys in Black , and to the other teams and their fans coming down under . I 've hidden the remote from my wife and it 's time to sit back and enjoy the fireworks . Cheers Pete

@@28238965 @1938965/ <p> Come summertime you cant open a newspaper or magazine without articles about getting your body beach ready . Many women are secretly terrified at the prospect of getting into swimwear publicly , because whilst very few people actually suffer from body dysmorphia ( the belief that one 's appearance is unusually defective ) most women have body issues . The truth is that I deal with this reality on a regular basis because I shoot a lot of boudoir photography . <p> Last week I put a few pictures on Facebook from a shoot that both I , and the lady in question , loved . There was an incredible response and I had four enquiries that same evening . However , nestled amongst the positive comments was this : <p> " no wonder women have serious body image problems , your setting them up as porn starsyou know full well what your doing to women . Your doing this for money not art " sic . <p> The man in question is clearly an idiot , and I retained my professionalism and refrained from pointing out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just so wrong about my motives although of course I need to make a living . Hand on heart I believe that every woman should experience a boudoir shoot once in their lifetime . <p> When I get asked what I really , really love to take pictures of , the answer is actually women . I often chose to paint the female form so it is no surprise that I also enjoy photographing it . However the reason I enjoy boudoir as a genre goes far deeper than ticking an aesthetic box . It is without doubt the most psychologically rewarding part of my business . <p> The truth is that most women , including me , would love to have some beautiful images of themselves that explore their sensuality . What is absolutely critical in my work is that the images are about the women being in control . She is choosing to celebrate herself on her terms , and is absolutely not being sexually objectified or presented as a commodity . <p> I do n't  actually like the label boudoir but I understand that the genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is open to stylistic interpretation . As in all photography your own taste barometer will play a big role in developing and positioning your work . I am absolutely clear about what boudoir means to me , and I attract the kind of women that I want to photograph of all ages , shapes and sizes ( despite what some of you might think ) . Most of them have had children , which means they might not love the physical reality of their bodies , but they have a deep respect for what it is capable of . At the start of the shoot all of them want to point out their flaws which is why I always ask them what their partners most love about them physically . That 's the only way to get a positive out of a woman sad but true . <p> A boudoir shoot with me is an indulgent treat , a journey of self-discovery and hugely empowering . Women leave on a high with confidence levels through the roof , and yet they have not seen an image . I have learnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one element of the return on investment , and probably the least important . <p> My boudoir work does not need a hard sell , nor any marketing - each shoot leads to another through genuine , word of mouth , referrals . The emails that I get from the women Ive photographed are wonderful and I am now quite used to this kind of reaction to the experience : <p> " I surprised myself about how much I enjoyed the shoot itself and without a doubt its done more for my confidence than anything else in the past 10 years " . <p> What I did n't  expect , but has delighted me , has been the response of the husbands and partners of my clients . Because whilst they obviously get to enjoy the resulting imagery the biggest gain for them is a change of confidence in the woman they love . <p> I visited one of my dearest friends in New York last year and suggested we did a shoot whilst I was there . We had a lot of fun drinking vintage champagne and laughing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful she looked and that this ( ie what I was seeing through the lens ) was how her husband saw her . I immediately saw that she doubted what I was saying that 's women for you . As soon as her husband returned to the apartment she wanted to show him the images on the back of my camera . She was clearly on a high and as he flicked through the images he turned to her and said , " Stunning , darling , but that 's how I see you " . It was a very special moment and I just kept quiet . <p> The next day as we wandered through SOHO he stopped me , looked me straight in the eye and said a heartfelt thank you for what I had done for her . In his words : <p> " My wife has always been beautiful to me , but I have learned over the years that how women see their bodies and how men view them are two very different things . The revelation through the boudoir experience , is that for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I see her body . The impact this realisation has had on her has been very liberating and the photos , which are tasteful , natural and in my view stunning , are an added bonus " . <p> It took me a full year to persuade another of my closest friends to do a shoot with me she was reticent following breast cancer and a mastectomy . It was almost like seeing a phoenix rising from the ashes and her husband is deeply grateful for the part photography played in his wife finding herself once again . <p> With all these positives does come a negative and that is the fact that boudoir photography is really hard to do well . It takes a lot of practice to get good at it and practice you should - for the sake of the delicate egos that you hold in your hands .

Now the thing I like about Jo : she is not a sales person , she is someone who is there to help you and your business . With that in mind Jo talked me through the Duo and then the full colour service . Brilliant , I thought , I just have to send Queensberry print-ready files and they do the rest , including the design wow , how easy is that . It saves so much time , and gives a twist as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as I tell the clients .

We upgraded two clients before the sample even arrived . With Jo 's advice we did a real showcase album with 104 images ( from a wedding we were flown out to Australia to shoot " we are based in Wales ) and the feedback has been amazing . I think Queensberry have such a unique product and the bonus is that no one within 100 miles has the Duo album .

His promotion can bring in thousands of extra dollars and set your business on a completely new trajectory - but instead of jumping in and having a go , people sometimes get sidetracked by doubts and questions . Like ... I do n't have time . No problem ! We can design and colour correct for you . What if I get too busy ? Hey , great promotion ! See above . What should I offer them ? An album just like your sample ( invite them to come in and touch and feel it if possible* ) . That makes your offer very specific , and you can have a price worked out .

Apart from that it 's a matter of choosing the photos , the design , and the album itself . Your customers can choose the photos themselves in Workspace , and ... who can do the rest for you again ? What price will make the cash register ring ? It needs to be tempting . As Stephen said , even clearing an extra $500 from one past customer would be great , especially if we 're doing the design and image prep for you , but what would make twenty customers take action ?

@@28238995 @1938995/ <p> Colour management is one of the cornerstones of digital photography , it is also one of the most misunderstood . Some photographers are experts , some try to ignore the subject , some do n't seem to have heard of it , others have read about it on forums or blogs and ( kind of ) get it . Years ago when our lab went digital , we brought in the experts to help set up our systems and get the best results from our printers . This relationship was not a one-date wonder .

If you use our print-ready service you need a cm system too , at least if you want a reasonably accurate idea of how your prints will look BEFORE you send us the files !

The next step is to use your calibrated screen to soft proof your images as you edit them . This is the process your software uses to emulate the look of the final print . To do so you 'll need our ICC profile . Use it for is soft-proofing only . Do n't Convert or Assign : the files you send should be Adobe 98 or SRGB , nothing else .

@@28238999 @1938999/ <p> Following on from last week 's post , here are a few more album design tips . For all you photographers designing your own . <p> loading ... <p> Let them breathe <p> We touched on cropping last time , but it 's worth repeating ! <p> Sure photo-bombing is fun , but generally we like the core elements of an image to have a nice amount of breathing space to the edge of the page , or image " frame " . In fact think of it exactly like framing a picture : it gives the subject a sense of intent and importance . Jamming things up against the image edge often looks awkward . <p> But " breathing room " is also important for practical reasons . Our book blocks are trimmed on the guillotine in production , meaning you always lose 1-2mm from around the block . And if you 're ordering a digital copy , the print will be scaled down dramatically , meaning that that 1-2mm trims away much more of the image . <p> Then , suppose your camera shoots a 3:2 aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the design calls for a 10x8 you 'll be pleased you have some breathing room around the subject that you can cut away ! <p> Finally if you 're using our free design service , the team will tell you that tightly cropped images give them problems for all the above reasons . <p> loading ... <p> loading ... <p> Create a grid <p> By using standard aperture sizes you can create a block of images that line up in nice grid-like structures , giving clean lines , consistent spacing , and simplified style . Templates make this very easy . And once again , be sure to give the images a nice amount of breathing space from the edge of the page : like framing a picture , this gives the subject a sense of importance and also gives us some allowance when we guillotine the page edge ! <p> loading ... <p> Consistency counts <p> Photographers have access to creative editing tools that did n't  exist a generation ago but sometimes those " special effects " look out of place in an album . Bear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , but alongside each other on the same page , or in the same book .

I do remember getting to Jakarta around midnight on a backpacker 's holiday and looking for somewhere really interesting to stay ( it worked out but I do n't recommend it ) . On the other hand we know people who leave nothing to chance , plan every detail beforehand and spend their big adventure hopping between Hiltons . Some people do n't really like the idea of travel at all , because it takes them out of their comfort zone and no-one out there really knows how important they are .

@@28239079 @1939079/ <p> To continue my rave on The Junction earlier in the year about image slicing and dicing , here are a few thoughts about designing a pressbook with particular consideration to keeping your mind ( and your clients ' heads ) out of the gutter ! Photojunction makes designing a Queensberry album very easy and FAST . But while the layouts look very similar on-screen between albums and press books - in reality these two products are vastly different . When you 're working on screen it 's really easy to forget that a press book is , well , a book , and the pages do n't lie flat . Queensberry press books ( like most other photographic books ) are perfect bound , which means that a small amount of the inner side of each page is obscured in the gutter , or spine , of the book . It 's not unusual ( common to many high quality books and magazines ) but it is an important factor to consider when you 're designing . Currently Photojunction has general ' photosafe ' guides on Pressbooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much of a gutter to leave in any given book . The number of pages in the book , thickness of the paper stock and the size of the book are some of the factors that determine exactly how much of the page is obscured . Photojunction takes care of most of the technical bits , but book designers train for years in the art of layout design , so here are a few gutter-minded tips about designing press book layouts . 1 . Visually allow more white space for the inner margins of the page . Remember the tighter you make the white space , the easier it is to see any small discrepancies . 2 . If you are wanting to have an image bleed into the gutter - make sure that there is n't any critical information that could be obscured , like heads , hands or text . 3 . If you 're using a Panoramic image , make sure there 's plenty of space either side of the gutter so it does n't look like your subject is ' sinking ' into the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

You 're in charge of everything except the buying decision . Clients tell you what they want , which puts them in charge of everything except the yes or no part .

Open the Event window to review images is a very handy option in the Project Setup window .

But because it 's meant we 've had to change the way you log in , some people have found it a bit confusing - so let me explain why it 's so cool , and how it works . Until now the only way to give someone access to your account has been to share your login details . It 's very common but it 's not good practice and sharing your login means they can do everything that you can in your account . But suppose you have a staff member or second shooter you 'd like to upload images and edit events - and nothing else . Or suppose you use a contractor to design your albums - but only design them , not place orders ! It 's so easy to do , but to make it work we 've had to change how you log in , ie as a user not as an account ! Before Workspace would ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your email address and password , and that email needs to be the one you used to set up your Workspace account . Maybe you ca n't even remember which address you used ( I 'm that guy too - four email addresses , two iTunes accounts etc etc ) . If you ca n't work it out , email us with your account number and we 'll tell you which email is linked to your account so you can log in again . Once you 're logged in , you 're the account administrator , so you can invite new users . Go to Settings and click Users , then INVITE USER . Enter their name and email address , and check the things you 'd like them to be able to do . In the graphic I 'm giving someone power to create events , modify them ( create collections etc ) , and also design albums . Note they wo n't be able to share ( publish ) the events , place album orders or do anything else on the list . Click the INVITE button at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email with an activation link . If they have their own Workspace account under that email address , when they click the link they 'll be asked to enter their password . If they do n't they 'll be asked to enter a new password and confirm it . That 's it , they 're in . A few more points . An account can have more than one administrator if you like . As an administrator you can delete users or change their permissions at any time . And you can also be a user on multiple accounts . Great if you 're running a service like album design or image editing . Tell us what you think : ) Cheers , Ian

On our Queensberry Facebook Page- we run a ' hot album ' feature , where I share an album each day .

@@28239095 @1939095/ <p> 2 . How DIFFICULT is it to make 100% markup on the wholesale cost of the album only ? Thank you to everyone who responded . Why the survey ? So we can help photographers who ask us how much they should charge . We 've never tried to set a recommended retail price , and we do n't  intend to now , but its obviously helpful if we can give our customers , especially newbies , some idea what other photographers are charging . <p> Almost three quarters of our respondents think that 100% markup on the album alone is about right , or a little too cheap <p> - so its probably safe to assume that most of your competitors mark up their Queensberry albums by 100% or more . It also gives you a clear idea how much you could earn by selling them ! On the other hand about 15% say 100% is much too cheap . Drilling down into their detailed responses explains why . Our survey asked people not to include anything they might want to charge their clients to cover other costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to use the photos , travel , consultations , image editing , artwork , album design etc ) , but its clear from their comments that those who said 100% is much too cheap are charging more ( up to three , four or five times the album cost ) to cover costs like those . <p> This shows how important it is to make very clear what your prices include <p> . In many package deals the main product is the album , and the album price includes everything , including the shoot . Obviously its the overall cost that matters in the end , but its easy for people to come away with the impression that your albums are eye-wateringly expensive if you 're not careful . By the way its equally clear that some photographers , especially newbies , charge low markups to ensure that their work goes out beautifully presented rather than just as digital files . One respondent only charged his cost price . <p> Its one thing to say that 100% is a fair markup , but will people pay it ? <p> Opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to achieve 100% , but not much . Only about a third of respondents said it was fairly or very difficult . The other two thirds were more positive - including that 15% or so who again think its <p> very <p> easy . <p> So who thinks it 's easy and who difficult ? <p> We asked respondents about themselves ( age , gender , country ) , their market position ( starting out , mid-range , high-end etc ) as well as how many albums they sold and how they sold them ( packages , a la carte etc ) . Over the next little while I 'll drill down into the global stats to draw a few conclusions as to what works best and what does n't  . Are younger photographers selling as many albums ? Are people confident about selling them in future ? Do women do better than men ? Are packages effective ? Watch this space .

@@28239098 @1939098/ <p> I 'm a bit frustrated ! We have two new initiatives to launch but we ca n't get either out until next week , so I thought I 'd try and clear up a few misconceptions about SEO ... SEO comes to mind for two reasons . First , in Ian 's 14 Tips post a while back he said ( rather carelessly ! ) , " 10 . Link to the venues , florists , dressmakers and other vendors who were connected to the event - another Workspace feature . They 'll love you for it , and linking is great for SEO . " Someone commented , " Yes , linking is great for SEO , but for the site you are linking to , not for you I 'm always wary about linking tovendors ' sites unless there is some reciprocal linking back to my website . " That 's absolutely correct , but I think Dad 's point was basically about paying it forward and giving the other guy a reason to reciprocate . It 's hard to negotiate your cross-links ! Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the new Smugmug which has turned into a conversation about how Smugmug is bad for SEO , some of which I think is misinformed . My basic point is that SEO is not something a site has , it 's something you do - or your web host / software does for you . Google treats stephenbaugh.smugmug.com and stephenbaugh.com exactly the same way . Pages within those domains are also treated the same way . ( It 's not true when people say the home page of a sub-domain is found but nothing else is . ) ( BTW " www. " is very normal but it 's a subdomain too ! ) The real difference between them is that stephenbaugh.smugmug.com belongs to Smugmug , but stephenbaugh.com belongs to me , and I can take it anywhere . ( That 's why in Workspace anyone can create their own " custom domain " . ) Having said that , having your own domain is only the start . You have some work to do ! Search engines are in the business of trying to solve problems for the searcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the searcher , and they make that decision on lots of parameters . Those include the obvious , like Keywords ( search engines see text not images , which is why Flash pages rank badly ) , the age of the domain , the amount of traffic , who and how many links there are to the site etc . There is an argument that pages with video or other features get extra points over ones with just text , but that largely depends on the category . How well you rank in Google is not just about how well you set up your site , but how well you do this relative to other sites returned in the search result . If for example , your competitor starts focusing on SEO you might find you fall from your number one position , just because you are no longer relatively as useful . The problem with photo hosts and the sub domains on them is simply that , on the day you join with them , your new domain eg stephenbaugh.smugmug.com is only one day old and not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain it would be more authoritative in Google 's eyes due to it 's age and existing reputation . Second , Google does n't return domains in search results , it returns pages , and the page part of your new URL is also new . Smugmug , Zenfolio and other sites like Workspace ( http : **27;220;TOOLONG ) have different URL structures . You need to redirect pages as well if you hope to keep your previous page rank . Next you need to register your domain in Google and Bing webmaster tools , submit your site map and register yourself with Google Places as a local business . If you do n't do this stuff the search engines wo n't even know you exist , will not know about your updates and certainly wo n't find galleries that are not connected with your home page . Google will punish you if it thinks you 're gaming the system , so tread carefully with any SEO expert who suggests using black hat methods to get fast and dramatic results . It will be you who suffers in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers innocently undermine their own efforts with unhelpful website structures , such as : **27;249;TOOLONG ( website ) **26;278;TOOLONG or ... stephenbaughblog.com ( blog ) **37;306;TOOLONG ( hosting ) Google sees all these as separate and probably low traffic sites . Ideally you should be trying to get everything under one domain , like this . stephenbaugh.com ( website ) stephenbaugh.com/blog/ ( blog ) **27;345;TOOLONG ( hosting ) More traffic , more social mentions and more links back to you are like gold to Google . They say people care about and visit your site , so Google will return your pages in its searches . BTW you can customise your Workspace URL for free . If you need help please ask ! Bottom line ... You should prioritise having a beautiful site that people want to use and share . One that allows you to be proud of your images . You need text on pages or in URLs that support your keywords but not so that it looks stupid . You need links back to your site and you need to network ( Ian 's point ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've mentioned . It 's not easy but it'a worth the effort .

@@28239101 @1939101/ <p> Sometimes you get lucky ! Andy and Wendy left this remarkable story on our Facebook page . <p> We live in the UK . Last December our house was flooded by a tidal surge and EVERYTHING on the ground floor was ruined . We had so little notice that all we had time to save was one of our cars , our dog and a handful of personal papers . We were devastated when we realised our wedding album , created by Queensberry in 2002 , was among the items lost . <p> It was our pride and joy , and we despaired of ever replacing it . The original photographer had finished doing wedding photography , we did n't have his contact details , and we had copies of almost none of the photographs . It really hit home how valuable such memories are . Photographs really are one of our most valuable and tangible links to the past . <p> I mentioned our plight to a friend at work , who knew the photographer from a local pub , but had n't seen him for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't sound hopeful . <p> As he drove home from the office that evening he had to stop for a car to pass . The driver was none other than our photographer , Paul Tidswell ! He flagged him down and explained our plight . <p> That very day he 'd been sifting through old negatives and had earmarked a pile of old ones for the bin . Ours were among them . He rescued them and forwarded them to us along with the original album design sheets . I ca n't describe the elation we felt at that point - our memories recovered from the jaws of oblivion at the VERY last minute ! <p> Had we not had the design sheets I would never have remembered that Queensberry had put the album together for us originally , but I was now able to contact the company with a view to obtaining a replica album . <p> The team were superb and very soon we were put in touch with Bromley photographer Jo Newman . She moved the earth for us - I had the photographs scanned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructed better than ever . Our precious memories have now been restored . <p> I ca n't thank Paul enough for returning the negatives to us , and Queensberry for putting the album together ( on two occasions ) so beautifully .

Photographs are so important in capturing those family moments that would fade otherwise with the passage of time . <p> If we do n't nurture and treasure them with the utmost care , all can be lost in minutes .

@@28239108 @1939108/ <p> After more than fifteen years in the business , UK photographer Simon Whitten of Firehorse Photography &amp; Filming has covered more than 600 weddings on four continents . He 's has been a friend of Queensberry for much of his career . Simon is strong-minded character who believes that the key to success is to find your own way and stand out from the crowd . " Do n't follow the latest fads or fashions , " he says , " or you will only ever be a follower , and always late to the party . " We asked him a few questions about how that 's reflected in his life and work <p> Simon 's first ' proper ' camera was a gift from his grandparents when he began a higher education course in art and design . He spent a lot of time messing around in the darkroom , and this carried over at university during a combined arts degree , but then for ten years he barely touched a camera . Sixteen years ago he bought a film SLR ( digital would n't exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and enrolled for an evening course at the local college , mainly to use the darkroom . The tutor was a weekend wedding photographer who , during a pub chat , challenged him to have a go . " I did . I sort of enjoyed it and soon started to cover the jobs he could n't do . I never expected to be in it for long , but it took off for me and I 've never looked back . " <p> Simon says he loves photography but it 's not an obsession . " I do not feel compelled to carry a camera with me at all times and shoot everything . I do n't even own a smart phone so ca n't anyway ! " <p> What advice can you offer on finding your personal style and aesthetic ? How long did it take you to perfect your own ? Perfect ? I 'm still working on it and always will be ! I think I have one of sorts , but I could n't really tell you what it is , other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot and how ie my client first and foremost is me . If a couple like my work and approach , and buy into it , they trust me to do more of the same . So my advice would be to be honest to yourself , and not try to please everyone . And do n't follow the latest fads or fashions , or you will only ever be a follower , and always late to the party . I saw the results of a recent article featuring thirty photographers and largely could not tell their work apart . Whether that works for them or not I do n't know ... <p> When photographing a wedding etc. what do you look for ? What do you hope to capture while taking photos ? <p> A cohesive story , a whole : ie I 'm not specifically focussed on ' hero ' images that I can win awards with at the expense of my clients . Without scripting it too tightly in my head , but having a plan in regard to what I want to capture . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a tried and tested routine that works for me , but at the same time ready to react to the stuff that just happens at every wedding unscripted . There are so many elements that can make up any story , but my overall aim is that my capture and presentation is as comprehensive as possible . And by " comprehensive " I do n't mean sheer quantity for the sake of it , as that serves no purpose and can even take away . Wood for the trees and all that . <p> Some people believe that taking photos takes away from the moment . How do you feel about that ? Do you think photography gets in the way , or do you think that it can make the moment ? <p> I 'm a firm believer that it can capture , define and preserve ' a ' moment . Whether it 's ' the ' moment is always going to be open to debate and interpretation , but I do n't think photography by professionals ever needs get in the way . People can , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latter I 'm thinking more in regard to those who simply must take a picture on their iPhone and as a result completely miss the moment . So in summary , it can be argued , and I do believe , that photographers take pictures with a purpose that can and does define moments . <p> What are your tips for people wanting to get into photography ? If you were to start again what would you do differently ? <p> Honestly , I would not advise anyone to begin a career in photography today . The market is too saturated , work is in decline , rates are in decline and even for those already in it , we need to work increasingly hard for even a small share . If I was to start again , yes , of course I 'd do a few things differently , but only with having the benefit of the hindsight I do now . <p> What 's your point of difference ? Why do people come to you ? What makes you different from the photographer down the street ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because define ' different ' and just how ' different ' can you be in any particular genre ? Many would argue , " it 's all just wedding photography and pretty much looks the same " . I 'd say my one USP , if I have one , is I do n't slavishly follow the latest trends . In fact I deliberately try and avoid them . One thing I have done in 2015 in that regard is I have stopped looking at what other wedding photographers are doing , other than by accident or necessity , ie what is the fella down the street is doing ? Respectfully , I 'm not really aware or much interested . Another I suppose is attitude , which is positive in regards to what I am doing , and my clients ' interests , but largely indifferent to the industry as a whole . It goes back to not trying to be all things to all people , but being on the same page as that small number of people who become clients . I think the single biggest USP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crowd for whatever reason , just as long as you do stand out and can then hold their interest . <p> When people look at your photographs how do you hope people will feel ? <p> A : It stands out on a quality basis . It makes them smile , it makes them laugh , it makes them cry or it makes them nod their head and say , " that 's quite good " . That has to happen with 25-30 couples per annum who then go on to use my services , and that 's it , job done . <p> Some people find the camera intimidating how do you make them feel comfortable ? <p> If they are potential clients , chat with them to determine whether we will be able to overcome that . If actual clients , work with them to achieve it . But mostly it 's about attracting the right fit clients in the first place , then booking them . And after that , further gaining their trust by discussion , almost always in person prior to the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only gradually working my way into their space . I rarely have any issues with it , and neither do my clients , who usually comment after the fact how easy it was and how comfortable I made them feel . <p> Why should people invest in professional photography ? <p> Simply because cameras do not a photographer make . It 's who is behind the camera that makes the difference between a meaningful picture and a well-intentioned snap . Time is unrepeatable and memories are precious . The number of people who say , " I wish ... " By then it 's too late . <p> How do you divide your time between work and play ? <p> I keep fairly strict office hours and office space , generally working 7am-3pm weekdays , but longer during busy Summer months , or if there is a deadline looming . My office space is totally separate to our home/living space and is only used for work . Having said that , being self-employed means I can go out for a run or a bike ride during the day if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does where you live affect your photography ? <p> It does and it does n't . I 've always lived in small villages in the countryside and most of my clientele do not . I used to think that would be an issue , but it never has been , at least not one that I have felt has been an issue . Could I book more clients if I lived in a town or a city , and potential clients could just pop in for a chat ? Probably , but I do n't , and around 90% of my clients book without having met and , in most cases , only a brief chat by email . <p> Which other photographers do you love ? <p> No one from the world of weddings ! I used to have various photographers I aspired to , first locally , then regionally , then nationally and then internationally , but these days , as I said above , I 've stopped looking . I might look at an organisation 's awards winners or similar , and I 'm part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but otherwise , not looking ! <p> I do look at photography and photographers all the time however . But it 's more the former than the latter , photography over photographers . There 's a couple of ' oldies ' and many more newbies of the instagram brigade . I wo n't name them they have enough followers already ! Magazine/editorial photography is a great ' influence ' . <p> -Why does printing matter to you ? <p> There 's an argument it 's only a photograph when printed , and only an image otherwise . I agree with that sentiment , but also appreciate that the way we look at imagery/photography is changing simply because technology and lifestyles have changed . However , I am a strong advocate that a significant event should be printed and therefore presented and preserved for all time in a tangible format . The way you view a picture is enormously influenced by how you view it , and in print , arguably , you take more time and therefore see more . <p> -Do you have any memories of going through photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are defined by what you actually remember in your head , fused with any actual imagery from the time , whether that be photographs or video . I wish I had more photographs and of my parents and grandparents . Photographs are a legacy . <p> -Do you print your own work/ personal memories ? Why or Why not ? <p> Yes . Every year we create a family year book for ourselves that is myself , wife and daughter , based on holidays , trips and special events . <p> -Why Queensberry ? <p> Quality and customer service levels that match my own . I first hooked up with Queensberry around 2002 I think !

@@28239144 @1939144/ <p> To help promote our professional clients we 've just updated the Queensberry photographer directory . You can now include up to four images to show off your work . Listings are absolutely free - so if you have n't already , now 's the time to add some images and get the Queensberry website working for you .

Listings with images rank first - but distance from the search location and the amount of business you do with Queensberry also count . We do n't want you to languish at the bottom , so please take a minute to add or update the images in your listing by going to the Get Found link in Workspace . You can also include a brief message and your website and social media links . All the best from everyone at Queensberry . PS Yes , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active Queensberry account to publish a listing . 
@@28239145 @1939145/ <p> I originally posted this on a private Facebook forum , where it got a lot of discussion so what do you think ? <p> I 've been watching people asking for feedback on their price lists , asking if pricing should be online , asking if everything should be shown up front , and these discussions make me think about the big problem with price lists . <p> The way I see it is , most price lists make it sound like photographers sell USBs full of images , pieces of paper even boxes full of pieces of paper and the problem with that is that paper is n't worth much so people think , " That 's a lot of money for a piece of paper " . <p> Here 's what I think we need to sell ... FEELINGS , EMOTION , EXPECTATION , DESIRE <p> So if you ca n't explain that , show people . Allow them to see and feel what you do . No one wants to HARD SELL , but what makes people want to BUY photography is feelings like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Remember me " , " They 're beautiful " , " I 'm loved " , " They 're loved " , " I cared " , " I do n't ever want to forget this moment " , " Tell my story " , " This is important to me " <p> That 's what you do for them . Helping people to experience those feelings is why we all get up in the morning is n't it ? How you do it is a whole other subject , but if your client is n't emotionally connected to those feelings , if they do n't desire what you 're offering before they look at your prices they 'll never value what you do . The paper / product is the chocolate box that helps create desire . It 's not what you should be selling though . 
@@28239149 @1939149/ <p> My hands are how it all started , making a leather handbag for my mother . <p> I am a woman of the craft . Creating things by hand is something that I 've mastered over time and fallen in love with . Not just leatherwork and bookbinding but needlework , cooking and much more . <p> Over the years as Queensberry grew I got busier and busier , and , for much of each year , I 've put this aside . <p> But today I was reminded how much I 've missed working with my hands the feeling , the respect for my craft , the getting back to a space that fills me with love . <p> Why is handmade so special ? There is a Greek word , meraki , which means to do something with soul , creativity , or love to put something of yourself into your work . When you work with your hands you do just that , you pour your soul , your creativity into it and you leave feeling accomplished . Photographers will know what I mean . So will anyone making something with passion .

@@28239153 @1939153/ <p> We 've just spent a great Monday afternoon browsing through the submissions for our Bragging Rights campaign , which closed last Friday . Thank you to everyone who participated ! We had a terrific response from friends old and new . Plenty of weddings of course , but also engagement shoots , family portraits , maternity , pets , you name it . Different countries , cultures , locations and styles . So that was inspiring , but now comes the hard part " choosing ! We 're looking for twelve sets of images to showcase on our website , in our new season sample albums and books , and in our blogs and marketing pieces . As Anna said , we 're not choosing just on the basis of image quality , either - all the more reason to say that some awesome photography is going to miss out . We 've been swamped with riches , thank you ! Cheers , Ian 
@@28239154 @1939154/ <p> I was sitting at my desk eating Mini Dinosaurs ( from the Natural Confectionery Company ) . I was wondering about the scope of Photojunction as a tool in our business the list of opportunities to make money from this ( very free ) software . I could increase the album sale with More pages - fancy covers - extras like flips and wings - cases - digital copies , duplicates and parent albums - press book versions . I can show some of these ( like extra pages , flips and wings ) in the software . Others , like fancy covers , may need help from Queensberry 's swatch book . Actually press books are a huge opportunity because they are affordable and look great , but different enough to be- a unique purchase . What I am thinking about , as I chew on a purple dinosaur , is making a brag book . It 's a book of favorites with one or two images on a page . It 's not the whole story - that is what the big fat Duo is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has some great shots , and is affordable enough to merit a couple of copies . Think like a photographic book you might get from a bookshop ( remember them - bookshops ? ) . It does n't need to be big , just attractively priced . The purple dinosaur is history and I am eyeing up the yellow one . But wait , there 's more . I could do a slideshow . Nothing too flash , but flash enough to be worth a couple of bucks at least . And it 's so easy , and I could do an album slideshow too , to help sell extra pages to clients who ca n't come to the studio . If I wanted to get all flashpants on the slide show I could make proof layouts and turn the album into quite a hot little presentation using third party slideshow software to reveal the images on the pages one by one . The yellow dinosaur is toast ( I was having an intense thinking moment and needed the extra sugars ) . It 's too easy to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing . There are no green dinosaurs ! For some people this is a weird concept ( making money from something you did n't pay for ) but why not think about Photojunction as more than just an album planner ? Cheers , Johannes 
@@28239155 @1939155/ <p> I got a little reminder about walking in our customers ' shoes this week . We ran a survey asking regular users about twelve Workspace functions and features , from ordering albums to hosting to shopping cart sales how important they were to people , how often they used them in Workspace , and how easy they were to use . <p> The thing is we ( OK , I ) focused on how photographers experience Workspace , but not on how it works for your customers . That 's pretty bad , but in a sense understandable because although at Queensberry we use Workspace heavily every day ( in fact the entire Queensberry website is a Workspace site , including our product image galleries , our shopping cart and this blog ) , its been heavily customised and so we do n't  personally use Workspace themes , for example . <p> So , out of sight , out of mind . <p> Things like that are a trap . Another example : We never see what people experience when they sign up ( hey , we registered ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business comes through . Same with people ordering an album for the first time . Its a breeze for us , but what about people using our album set-up screen for the first time ? <p> Every business has problems like this . Its often not easy to look through your customers ' eyes , but as I 've just been reminded , it 's well worth doing . <p> CheersIan <p> PS , the survey is still open if you 'd like to take part . People been really helpful with their responses , and well come back and ask different questions some time soon ; - ) 
@@28239157 @1939157/ <p> As a photographer you can order wholesale , provided you have an approved account . These notes are to help you sell Q-Boxes in your own shopping cart , at your own prices . <p> Step 1 - Favourite the images : In your client 's gallery , they can click the Workspace Heart to select the images they wish to include in their Q-Box . ( For more on how to favourite images , click here . ) And not to worry , they can add / remove / edit images later , in the shopping cart , if they change their minds . <p> Step 2 - Go to Favourites : They can view their favourites by clicking the Heart icon at the top right of the screen . <p> Step 3 - Add their Q-Box to their shopping cart : To order a Q Box , your client needs to hover over ANY image in their favourites and click the shopping cart icon ( screenshot below ) . Note : Make sure you 've added Q-Boxes to your pricelists , or the option wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popup will appear , with the only difference being that the Q-Box option will now be visible ( screenshot below ) . <p> loading ... <p> Step 4 - Review Q-Box options : Once the Q-Box has been added to their shopping cart , it will open to MY SHOPPING CART . Here your client can review their Q-Box , choose colours etc , and finalise their image selection if necessary . If the Q-Box is for matted prints they can also choose aperture sizes , review the mat colour and so on ( screenshot below . ) <p> loading ... <p> The shopping cart then proceeds as normal to the final steps of gathering your client 's name , address and payment details
