@@100397981 @4597981/ <p> Energy , the environment and competition for natural resources will emerge as challenges in continuing China 's positive relationships with the United States and other powers in the coming years , says Henry Kissinger , who orchestrated modern Sino-U.S . relations three decades ago as President Nixon 's Secretary of State . Author and China expert Orville Schell offers a historical perspective , going back over a century of China 's history to delineate an " uncertainty principle " that informs the contradiction between an increasingly prosperous and powerful nation that is nevertheless faced with dire environmental , economic and political problems . Ultimately , Mr. Schell argues , one can not understand the China of today without the ability to absorb its conflicting and contradictory nature . Is China 's continued economic dominance and increasing confidence on the world stage putting it on a collision course with the U.S. ? Or do we have every reason to be optimistic about the future of Sino-U.S . relations ? <p> Mav <p> 03.23.07 , 12:45 PM <p> It almost seems like one of the side plots in the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the remaining fossil fuels .

Other nations must respond . <p> enlivened <p> 03.23.07 , 04:04 PM <p> Great programs this week . I think the answer is that threats from China will be situational . Remember the collision with the Chinese plane ? Chinese military conflict with the U.S. will more likely revolve around a provocation related to Taiwan than global competition . It would be a good idea to stop inflating our national debt and giving ownership of our financial stability to Saudi Arabian and Chinese bond holders . <p> SNS <p> 03.26.07 , 09:27 AM <p> But it all depends on what we mean by ' threat .

No doubt . <p> Do any of these things suggest , as a moral imperative , that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have to be prepared to compete . And then there is the very tangled issue of Taiwan . Does the U.S. have a moral obligation to protect Taiwan ? <p> And it will be worth observing whether or not democratic freedom really rises with China 's economy . <p> rocketdog <p> 03.28.07 , 09:59 AM <p> SNS : I do n't think I 've got anything to add to that . Well put . <p> savageb <p> 03.30.07 , 05:34 PM <p> I agree with SNS . It is a matter of perspective . China is a growing power , soon to be a super-power . If we think with " conventional uni-lateral wisdom " ofcourse China is a threat to the U.S. and its sole position , which is also debatable , as world superpower . The U.S. may be disillusioning itself . If China continues to grow as it has , and gets its humanitarian and environmental issues under control , along with sustaining a healthy and politically happy middle class , it could overwhelm the U.S. in terms of economics per capita and education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. were willing to share the world stage with a firm multi-lateral attitude , it would view China as healthy competition instead of a threat .

Which will it choose ? <p> jay <p> 04.19.07 , 04:26 PM <p> I 'm with SNS . <p> China will undoubtedly be the dominant economic player in future imo , but that in itself is no reason for conflict . Internationally they seem to mind their own business for the most part . <p> I do n't know alot about Chinese history or politics but hopefully they develop socially as well as economically as a nation . Investing in and trading with the young Chinese financial market could be one helluva shot in the arm for the international financial community as a whole . <p> kfitton <p> 04.20.07 , 08:34 AM <p> As far as I can tell , the US is playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with a completely different set .

It wants the end of Israel . That is because Hamas is part of a pan-Islamist movement with global messianic ambitions . Creating a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank is not its aim . A branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , Hamas dreams of world dominion for its version of Islam rather than a mini-state in 5,000 square kilometres of barren land in a geopolitical backyard . <p> How can any supposebly knowledgeable person say that in front of others and expect not to be laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Islamic caliphate in the middle east completely free of non-Muslim influence and the destruction of Israel . <p> AaronSDavis <p> 01.24.11 , 07:29 PM <p> These are merely " stated aims " which we ( and probably they ) know are unattainable .

" <p> Civilizations always think they 're immortal , Eagleman says , but they nearly always perish , leaving " nothing but ruins and scattered genetics . " It takes luck and new technology to survive . We may be particularly lucky to have Internet technology to help manage the six requirements of a durable civilization : <p> 1 . " Try not to cough on one another . " More humans have died from epidemics than from all famines and wars . Disease precipitated the fall of Greece , Rome , and the civilizations of the Americas . People used to bunch up around the infected , which pushed local disease into universal plague . Now we can head that off with Net telepresence , telemedicine , and medical alert networks . All businesses should develop a work-from-home capability for their workforce . <p> 2 . " Do n't lose things . " As proved by the destruction of the Alexandria Library and of the literature of Mayans and Minoans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plumbing disappeared for a thousand years when Rome fell .

" Do n't let natural disasters cascade . The Minoans perished for lack of the kind of tsunami alert system we now have . Countless Haitians in the recent earthquake were saved by Ushahidi.com , which aggregated cellphone field reports in real time . <p> 4 . " Mitigate tyranny . " The USSR 's collapse was made inevitable by state-controlled media and state-mandated mistakes such as Lysenkoism , which forced a wrong theory of wheat farming on 13 time zones , and starved millions .

As some of you know westart these talks off with a long short , a short film that exemplifies long termthinking . This long short is one of the shortest at sixty seconds and probably coversthe longest time span at several million years.STEWART BRAND : And for the next four and a half billion years . Good evening I 'm StewartBrand from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many here have readSum Tales of the Afterlife , how many have given copies to their friends . That happens alot and it 's going to happen more.DAVID EAGLEMAN : Okay so this is you and you live in a fantastic , terrific society andyou would probably think that there 's no way that anything 's ever going to happen inthis society . You ca n't even imagine how something like this would fold and collapse.It 's very difficult to imagine , but note that you would feel exactly the same way ifthis were you and you lived in the Roman Empire . You would have thought exactly thatsame thing and if you lived in ancient Greece it 's impossible to imagine that yourwhole society would fold and collapse . Similarly if you were living in ancient Egypt orin the Mali Empire in Africa it would be very difficult to imagine these things . But infact an astounding number of civilizations have come before us and they have collapsedand centuries of progress and development and invention have caved in on themselves andwhat this has left is nothing but archeological ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined slowly and others have suddenly toppled andscholars are still trying to figure out why , and there 's an entire academic disciplinethat 's devoted towards figuring out why societies collapse ? Now one of the main reasonsto figure out why societies collapse is to figure out how to avoid that happening tous . So when you sift through the evidence about the different societies and how theyfell , you find that there are things in common . Things in common that cause them tocollapse and these include things like disease , natural disaster , political corruption , economic meltdown and resource depletion . So the civilizations that survive are thosethat have either been lucky or the ones that have developed new technologies tocircumvent these challenges . What I 'm going to argue tonight is that we are a verylucky civilization because we have sort of accidentally invented a technology that Ithink obviates many of the threats that have caused previous civilizations to collapse.This is a con-activity map of the Internet . What I 'm going to do tonight is present acase of this rapid electronic network system , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse . So I think we 're at a water shed moment in our historyand this may just be the thing that saves our future . For each step I 'm going toexplain why it matters historically and what still remains for us to do to keepourselves safe . Step number one for avoiding the collapse of civilization is try not tocough on one another . This is a virus and disease epidemics caused by microbes likethis , viruses and also bacteria ; these are the things that precipitated the fall of theRoman Empire and of the golden age of Athens and of most of the empires of the NativeAmericans . It 's sort of surprising that when you look at the largest threat to thesurvival of civilization that something so small , and in fact it 's so invisibly smallthat viruses and bacteria were n't understood until very recently in history and yetdespite their small size these have caused more death and destruction than all thefamines and wars put together . Take as an example small pox which was the mostdestructive disease in history . It 's killed hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally eradicated . The Romans lost up to a third oftheir population in parts of their empire and about a millennium later what happened isthat the crusaders came back from pillaging distant land and they brought an epidemicof small pox to Europe . Europeans then went over to the new world , they brought smallpox to the new world and in doing so it devastated the Incas and the Mayans and othernatives there . Some of you may know in 1707 small pox wiped out a third of Iceland.Similarly the black plague , Yersinia Pestis , this wiped out a third of Europe startingin 1347 and then it kept coming back to haunt Europe century after century . Yellowfever so badly decimated Napoleon 's army 's in Haiti that Napoleon gave up the idea ofhaving a Western French empire just because of yellow fever . Because of his 22,000crack soldiers he had sent to Haiti , 21,000 of them died so that 's why Napoleon soldthe Louisiana Territory to the United States because he said I just do n't want to berunning this show confronting diseases that I no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per acre which in a bloodless manner doubled the size of the UnitedStates . It goes on and on , there are these viruses and bacteria that have reallynavigated the course of history in major ways . What I 'm going to suggest is that theInternet is really our key to survival here and this is for three reasons . First whatthe Internet gives us is the ability to work remotely and when you can work from hometelepresently , what this allows you to do is inhibit viral transmission by reducingface to face contact , the human to human contact . So here 's the idea , the next timethat there 's a really killer virus coming our way , if businesses are prepared inadvance , what they can do is really leverage telepresence to keep supply chains runningwith the maximum number of employees working from home . Now this is n't going to keepeverybody off the street but it 's going to vastly reduce the density and it turns outthat when it comes to epidemics that 's all you need to do . You just need to get thingsbelow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tipping point is becauseviruses have a limited lifetime and a certain probability of infecting somebody . If youhave very low host density then the virus dies before it can get to a new host . But assoon as you get enough people together then it can find new hosts and you go from somesort of equilibrium state into an epidemic , it really blows up . In fact you can seethis sort of thing happening every Christmas holiday season with people shopping in themalls , because they all bunch together and then you cross over this population tippingpoint and then everyone gets the flu and cold . Now here 's the problem , in the pastsocieties have reacted to epidemics by bunching together so for example in medievalEurope when the black plague hit and other plagues like it , war and religious factionswho spent all of their time killing each other would show solidarity in the face of allthis death by marching together in the streets together to show that the Catholics andthe Protestants could be friends in the face of the plague . Well that was the realmisstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native Americans in a show of goodwill , they would gather in the tents of people who were infected with small pox , everyone would gather together and again unfortunately that was a gesture that was sortof i 'll fated . This is exactly the fear that all major medical centers have the nexttime we have a new strain hitting us , whether it 's the Asian flu or Swine flu orsomething , the big fear that medical centers have is that everybody with a cough isgoing to come flocking into the medical center to get checked out . This is reallydangerous . I think this is the second great opportunity afforded to us by the netbesides telepresence is telemedicine whereby with increasingly **25;236;TOOLONG we do n't have to have patients coming in and bunching up together butinstead we can have diagnosis from a distance . The telepresence and the telemedicineare very useful because they keep the population density below a tipping point . I thinkthere 's a third benefit that we get from the Internet which is we can optimally directresources when there is an outbreak . You may know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens at the local hospitals . Now the thing is thatit takes two weeks for the CDC to put together their report . It lags the actual fluoutbreak by two weeks , so Google came up with a better idea . What they do is they trackwhere people are searching for terms related to the flu so if their searching forinformation on symptoms or medicines or something it turns out that over the course ofthe nation that serves as an excellent proxy for where there is a flu outbreak . Whilethe CDC 's report lags by two weeks , Google 's lags by only a day . This gives us a veryrapid way to know dynamically exactly where the flu is and where the outbreaks arehappening . Unlike previous generations that were brought down by disease , especiallybecause they did n't know how to react in terms of density and sparseness , we can now dobetter because of the Internet . If we 're well prepared when the next epidemic arriveswe can fluidly shift into a self quarantine telepresence society in which the microbesfail by dent of host sparseness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ills ofsocial isolation and everybody sitting on facebook , but whatever those ills are itInaudible a lot worse for the microbes than it does for us . Although we 're well intothe step there 's work to be done if we want to save our civilization . Businesses reallyneed to work on developing their disaster plans and their work from home epidemicplans . I wrote a paper on this in the Journal Nature about five years ago and I 've beenwatching what businesses are doing . I 've been monitoring how this has been going . Somebusinesses are doing it , most are n't still . It 's really important to try to getbusinesses to do this and it 's extremely easy to test , to work out the kinks , to haveeverybody to work from home . The second thing is in society we really need to keepdeveloping telemedicine and similar ideas like that . So that 's step one where theInternet already gets us a long way down that road of not coughing on each other . Thesecond way that I propose the Internet is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to lose things so in a battle between Julius Caesar andTony the eighth , Julius Caesar got backed into a sort of funny military move and whathe ended up doing was burning his own ships at the dock . Now military historians talkabout whether it was a good idea or not but the thing was he accidentally lit the dockson fire and that burned down the library at Alexandria . Now the reason that was such atragedy is because the library at Alexandria had for a very long time been collectingthe manuscripts of every single person who passed through the port . So if you weregoing through Alexandria you had to give up your manuscripts for careful copying by thescribes and then they would give it back to you . So what the library housed was all ofthe knowledge at that time . This was the repository . The problem was it was the singlerepository and when it got torched ; it 's now just a memory . The thing is that all theknowledge collected over that period of time was lost entirely in a single fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the same fate in thebonfires of the Spaniards . Of the thousands of books that the Mayans had written , thatcataloged all of their learning and discovery and so on , we only have four of them.Only four survived in the modern times . Now can you imagine somebody trying tounderstand our civilization by reading let 's say the Bible and Frankenstein and HarryPotter and Twilight . That 's the situation we 're in where we 're trying to understand theMayans . All of their knowledge is gone it was burned . The Minoan civilization was aflourishing civilization between 2700 BC and 1450 BC . It was on the island of Crete , they had all kinds of trade and discovery . Here 's one of their Frescos , this is knownas the Phaistos Disc from the Minoan 's . Does anyone know what those symbols mean ? Nobody does , join the club , yeah exactly , because it was completely lost . In fact theywere n't even called the Minoans , that 's not what they called themselves . That 's a namethat a British archeologist gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So everything they had and knew was lost to us . So knowledge is hard won bysocieties and civilizations but it 's very easily lost and it proves impossible toestimate the number of museums and archives and libraries and houses of learning thatfell under the swords of invaders or under the wrecking balls of natural disasters . Sothe problem is history is characterized by the sort of amnesia where you havecivilizations that flourish if you can imagine little fires on the surface of the globethere where there 's a fire that happens for a while and then it gets doused out forwhatever reason and everything they learned is now forgotten . The thing is that thisimpacts survival ; this is n't just some sort of historical interest thing . So take as anexample inoculation . Many people know that in Europe inoculation was introduced by LadyMontegut , and the idea is that you introduce a little bit of the virus to somebody andthat confers immunity to a bigger dose of the virus . For example with small pox , thisis where it was used . But inoculation is n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces the death rate . But what 's not so widely known outside of westerncircles is that Lady Montegut did n't invent this , in fact the Audubon Empire where shefirst saw it , they did n't even invent it . It turns out that this inoculation had beenin practice in China and India and Africa for centuries unbeknownst to the Europeans.For example in China inoculation was underway since the tenth century and by the timeof the Ming Dynasty in the 1500 's it was widely practiced , everybody was doing it . Butthe Europeans had to sort of re-stumble on this on their own much later . Does thismatter ? Well you bet it matters because millions of people died in the meantime whilethis was going on while some people had the knowledge of inoculation and others didn't.Now Edward Jenner in 1796 improved on inoculation instead of injecting somebody withsmall pox you used cow pox instead which makes them less sick but it also confers theimmunity . Well that was a great idea that Jenner had except we now know that six peoplein Germany and England had the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody knew . What happened is the little fires got lit but they did n't spread soeverybody had to independently rediscover this . Now as I mentioned it really matters ifthese things have to get rediscovered or if they can catch on and spread because at thesame time that all this was going on with Lady Montegut and then later with Dr. Jenner , Native Americans were dying of small pox . The knowledge existed in other places on theplanet but they did n't exist as these whole empires were falling here . Okay whathappens is if you can imagine these little fires going on , I should mention two moreexamples actually . This is stunning but did you guys know that basic plumbing ceased toexist for a millennium after the collapse of the Roman Empire . People forgot how to doplumbing , they had to rediscover that a thousand years later . One more example in theyear 1900 three different botanists independently discovered the rules of geneticinheritance which Gregor Mendel had quietly published forty years earlier . It wasindependently rediscovered three times in the same year . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes away and you 've got basic plumbing andyou 've got the rules of genetic inheritance and what you really want is for an idea toget discovered once and then to really catch fire . That 's what you want to happen andthat 's what the Internet is good for because it 's distributed and when you distributeideas it can latch on everywhere and get spread around and in fact this was one of theoriginal motivations for the Internet was to have distributed storage . The big idea iswhen you distribute things bits of knowledge and transformed ideas can latch onimmediately . The news spreads everywhere quickly and redundantly and it makes it verydifficult to erase . So fires like the library of Alexandria and floods and so on have avery difficult time erasing such a knowledge set . So for example in my field as aneuroscientist I everyday use Pop Med which is the central collection of all of the biomedical research . So anything that 's discovered anywhere on the earth is going to endup in here very quickly and I can find it with a few clicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may use , they scan these old archives of all these old journalsfrom the 1600 and 1700 's . Journals that nobody goes down to the library and actuallydusts off anymore , now it 's fully text searchable , you can find things that were oncelost to history , they 've been exhumed now and they 're all right there at yourfingertips . And of course with something like Google books you have the worlds writingis all there and it 's clickable and discoverable and readable . So the idea is if theMayans had had Pop Med they could have just looked up inoculation , right , and unlikethe library of Alexandria you ca n't torch Google books , that 's really here to stay.That 's the idea . Now as an example of the modern appreciation of storing knowledge in aredundant indestructible manner , everyone recognizes Michelangelo 's David . Well this isnot actually Michelangelo 's David , this is Michelangelo 's David and it 's being scannedwith a 3D laser scanner , it 's from a group Stanford and University of Washington . Whatthey did was they scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right is areproduction of it made of a billion polygons at a quarter of a millimeter resolution.This is the largest scanned object in the world right now and the idea is that if themuseum were to be suddenly destroyed in an earthquake , this statue would not be lost.It 's totally reproducible now ; this is what 's known as the digital Michelangeloproject . You can download this onto a CD under jump drive it 's stored all over theworld and what this means is , by the way , this just got completed a few months ago , soprevious to that if this had n't been done and there was an earthquake it would just beutterly lost . There would be no more statue there . Now this is just a piece of art ofcourse but I 'm using this as an example of the way that we can create things now andmake them immune against destruction . Where this becomes really important is with theintellectual discoveries that might be happening anywhere on the earth and that mightbecome really important for our future . We wo n't be losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them and we 're not wasting time with parallel rediscoveryas has happened so many times in history . This allows us to optimally solve problemsincluding problems that we do n't even know are problems yet . Okay , so step two isdistribute , do n't reinvent . Now the fast spread of these ideas obviously injects noiseinto the data base but it also very importantly prevents the loss of discovery . In thisway societies can optimally ratchet up and we can use the latest bricks of knowledge inour fortification against existential threats . I think we 're doing a good job here , there 's a lot more that we 're going to develop here , for example , aside from doingdigital statues I do n't see why we could n't do full digital cities and combine forexample Flicker and Microsoft Photosynth passively and reconstruct very fine threedimensional detail of everything that 's out there and have that for the future . Rightnow that 's a lot of data but in four years it wo n't be . I 've been thinking about waysto improve information science so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not lost but you could develop algorithms some day that could actuallygo and read all the papers in Pop Med and analyze them and start constructing newhypothesis and experiments and that ratchets things up even faster . So there is a lotof room to grow here but I think we 're well on our way on this step for savingcivilization . Okay , step number three . Tell each other about things faster . What you'reseeing in the top left here is an image from Pompeii which was destroyed when MountVesuvius blew and covered the city in ash . What you 're seeing in the lower right is aFresco from the Minoan 's civilization that I mentioned before which was destroyed by atsunami . Here we see the Harappa civilization which is in between India and Pakistan onthe coast which disappeared entirely and Meghito which is in modern day Israel , both ofthese seem to have fallen to earthquakes . So in all these cases natural disastersuddenly made a civilization disappear . When I really started thinking about therelationship between natural disaster and the Internet is when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . So what happenedwas Californians were glued to their television sets trying to figure out if theirneighborhoods were in danger . Here 's a picture from San Diego and you can see the fireway in the distance . What people wanted to know was am I in trouble ? So they turn onthe news station let 's say CNN and they got disappointed because what happened was CNNwas spending all their time covering celebrity mansions and they were looking atwhether these mansions in Hollywood and Malibu were going to be in danger and somehowthese houses were taking up air time in proportion to their square footage . So if youwant to know if your neighborhood is in danger that 's not useful to you . So whathappened is you could see this several years ago happening something tipped , somethingchanged and what happens is everybody turns off the TV and they went to their computer , they start taking Geotag cell phone pics , they started twittering , they startedupdating their facebook pages and what happened is the news started spreading veryfast . The news started spreading in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than CNN could cover it because essentially what you had were all thesehome journalists . You had journalists embedded on every block in every home and peoplewere taking information and putting this out there . What happened was thisdecentralization and this massive networking really sped up the information in a waythat old news networking just could n't compete with anymore . So that got me thinkingabout what happens when you do and you do n't have this kind of networking in the faceof a natural disaster ? Take what happened in December of 2004 when there was anearthquake underneath the ocean and that caused a massive tsunami that hit all of thelip of the Indian Ocean and caused a devastating tsunami in Southeast Asia . It allhappened without warning , nobody saw this coming . People saw the water receding andthey thought it was interesting , they went out there and everybody knows about thethousands of people that died . Contrast this with what happened in the Pacific Oceanjust four weeks ago , February 27th . What happened was the Pacific Ocean has a tsunamiwarning system because in 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that happened scientists went and built this specific tsunami warningsystem , essentially it 's a bunch of buoy 's that are sprinkled out over the entire oceanand they track what 's happening in real time and they 're connected to an informationalway of getting the word out . So what happened on February 27th , just four weeks ago , was that there was an underwater earthquake and the system picked up these shock wavesand sent out the word . What happened is within hours the beaches in Hawaii werecompletely evacuated , there was nobody there everyone went up to the high groundspeople were sort of festive about it and got a picnic or whatever , but they were up inthe high grounds , nobody was on the beaches . The U.S. Navy took their ships from PearlHarbor and steamed them out so they would n't be caught in near shore damage . It turnsout what happened is the big wave never came , it was sort of a false alarm but it was atremendously successful test of the system . Because had the wave come nobody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the Indian Oceanlacks a system like that and so I think what we have is this fantastic contrast just inthe last few years of what happens when you do and you do n't have the sort of networkcommunication where you can get the word out very quickly . And if you can imagine thatif the Minoan civilization had had a tsunami warning system then they 'd still be herewith us and they would be sitting in the audience next to you . Okay , I want to giveanother example of how having fast information like this impact existential threats soimagine that the Pompeian 's had had electronic communication when Mount Vesuvius blewand this was in the year 79 and the volcanic eruption actually happened in two phases.What happened the first day is over the course of about twenty hours there was thishuge plume of pumice that rained over the course of the day about nine feet on Pompeii , but that 's not what killed people . Actually what kills people often with these volcaniceruptions is what happened the next day , it 's called pyroclastic flow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and gas and dust that 's screaming down the side ofthe volcano at a hundred miles per hour and this is a thousand degrees in temperature , right so this is what kills you . It turns out that this is what eventually hit Pompeiiand it hit all the people that were still there and this is what killed them and whatdestroyed the city . By my calculation here 's Vesuvius right here and here 's Pompeii , bymy calculation it would have been very easy with a networking system for the Pompeian'sto march ten kilometers to the southeast in about two hours and it would have all beensaved had they just known that this was coming , right ? The idea is they were stymied bythe lack of information and they were completely killed and then they were forgottenfor centuries . Something that strikes me as very interesting is that Pompeii wasrediscovered in the 1700 's . Can you imagine now with our network system forgetting acity but it was forgotten where it was , who they were , it was forgotten until the1700 's . Okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems with tsunamiswith volcanoes , but you might be thinking what about something fast like an earthquake , is that going to help anybody ? Well maybe not , but certainly where the net has beenproving very useful lately is with aggregating information for the public for crisisresponse . Just like the information was spread about the California wildfires , quicklythis has all been sort of formalized . This is a site called Ushahidi.com and this wasoriginally built in 2008 to monitor violence that was happening in the elections inKenya . What you 're seeing here is a real time map of areas of trouble in Haiti and whatthis is , is people can contribute with text messaging or e-mail or web submissionexactly where trouble is . Different sorts of trouble too , emergencies , menaces , publichealth problems , all this stuff and in the immediate aftermath of the Haitianearthquake , this was a real go to site . Because everybody on the ground with a mobilephone can text and say hey here at this location something is happening and everybodygets to see this . It aggregates it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting twist on this . The fact that people we know will inevitablynow a days twitter and text and update statuses from wherever there is a disaster , actually gives us another way to read information if things go really badly . We shouldbe able to assess spots of really big damage because of the absence of information . Sowhat I mean is imagine there is a really big hail storm somewhere where there is goingto be a lot of twittering about that but now imagine that a giant meteor slams into theUnited States somewhere , it 's the absence of any twittering from that spot that 's goingto carry the bad news at the speed of electricity . That 's how we 're going to knowsomething really bad happened there . So the idea with step number three here withadvanced communication networks , humans grow closer to omniscience and omnipresence andthey can spread news of a disaster faster than the disasters wave front . And with theright circumstances that head start can provide the extra hours that saves us . We stillhave a long way to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on putting the same sort of monitoring system that 's in the Pacific Oceanin the Indian Ocean so that we wo n't have a recapitulation of what happened in 2004 andit 's a very good step and we 'll continue to have better and more accurate disasterrecovery sites . One of the things that has to be absolutely certain is that these sitesdo n't go down right when we need them most . Okay , step number four , how to avert thecollapse of civilization is you have to minimize tyranny . Political censorship has beena familiar specter in the last century with state approved news outlets in Rumania , China , Cuba , Iraq and lots of other countries . The official newspapers of the SovietUnion , what you 're seeing here , you 're seeing Pravda , had a complete lock on the newsand foreign newspapers were only allowed in if they were published by communist partiesin other countries and approved by the Soviets . It was n't just the newspapers , theSoviets had a firm lock on all the copying machines so that you could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . And of course theSoviets were very fond of editing photographs to remove people who had fallen out offavor with the party , so you see these sorts of things where people are just gone . Thisis Photoshop before Photoshop was cool . They were fond of doing this sort of thing , this is an unusual fact but even the weather reports were doctored so in Cheska Romaniafor example it turns out that certain weather extremes translate to time off from workand so those temperatures were never reached , ever . It turns out that Stalin did thesame thing because if the weather report suggested that the sun was not going to shineon the day of celebration of the labor movement then it was doctored . In all of thesecases what the censorship did was it hobbled cultural progress and it directly fomentedrevolutionary reactions and the reason is that censorship never seems to work that wellwith the population because people never really fall for doctored messages that easily.The parties always think that they 're going to get away with it but in fact thepopulation is usually smarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the point Iwant to make is that censorship can be much more dangerous than just books and photosand weather . Tyranny can actually bring down a nation so on the far left here is TrofimLysenko , he was a Soviet Agronomist who became extremely powerful in the USSR becausehe was favored by Stalin . So Lysenko had these theories about how to grow wheat and itturns out that we now know those theories were scientifically fraudulent but it didn'tmatter because he was favored by Stalin he got more and more power and by the late1940 's he was completely in control of Soviet agriculture about the way that everybodyhad to grow their wheat . The problem is with the centralized command is that the SovietUnion covered thirteen time zones and had an incredible variety of soils and climatesand a lot of local common sense by local farmers and as a result this central rulesetting that happened , it was called Lysenkoism , the central rule setting for how togrow agriculture was absolutely disastrous for the wheat crops in the Soviet Union . Thelocal farmers knew better how to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened is that scientists who disagreed with Lysenko and it turns outthat they were correct , they were disbarred from their position and several of them , atleast four of them , were executed based on the fact that they were disagreeing with hisgenetic theories . Well historians traced part of the downfall of the USSR to thiscatastrophe that happened with their agriculture . It hobbled the economy and itcrippled the proletariat belief in the new system and so the lesson for history is thathaving a centralized tyranny rarely works as well as having local information andnested feed back loops . Well the Internet allows us in a very natural way ; itdemocratizes the flow of information by giving the open access to everybody . To thenewspapers to the world , to the photographs to the world , to the blogs . Now obviouslysome postings that you find on the Internet they 're full of doctoring and dishonestyand others strive for independence and impartiality , but in the end everything isavailable on the net for the end user to sift through and to give reason andconsideration to . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can allow formassive speedy democratic responses to things . So I 'm just going to use this as anexample because this happened just four months ago . On December 30th the Canadian PrimeMinister Stephen Harper announced that he was going to shut down Parliament until March30th presumably so he could continue to work on a stimulus package . But a lot of peopleknew that the reason he was doing it was because he was about to get a vote of noconfidence that would force an election and maybe force him out of office . So what hedoes is he just shuts down Parliament and he did it on December 30th so that everybodywould be busy with the holiday season and in fact a lot of people were busy and sort ofdid n't notice . Well one student noticed and he started a facebook group which veryquickly got 214,000 members and through this they were able to organize rallies allacross Canada . Many of these rallies had 3,000 people at them and he was able to dothis with such rapidity and effectiveness in a way that would not have been possiblebefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all the time now , we 're seeingthis all over the world . And so the idea is that governments can be kept in check thisway with a sort of speed that was n't possible before . Here 's another way thatgovernments can be kept in check by publicly aggregating and displaying informationabout vote tampering . This is a growing trend in many countries , this has been used inthe voting , the national elections in the last few years by Nigeria , Kenya , Afghanistanand among several others . So the idea is that citizens using their cell phones canreport disturbances or defamations or vote tampering or they can even just reportincidents where things went well . What this has the effect of doing is keeping theelection fair and free as possible , in fact I mentioned earlier the crisis mapping toolUshahidi , it was developed in Kenya for the 2008 elections when a lot of violence wasgoing on . What this does is it publicly shines a light on the election and this is justone way to keep governments a little bit more transparent than they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the Internet in shininglights on governments and minimizing tyranny is in danger in many places around theglobe as most of you know , I 'm sure . In 2006 Google agreed that they would sensortraffic in China because it was obviously very appealing to tap into a market of fourhundred million people . As many of you know if you search for Tiananmen Square protestmost places in the world on Google this is what you get . If you 're inside China and yousearch for Tiananmen Square protest this is what you get . So what happened veryrecently of course is that Google changed their mind on this topic and recently startedputting into practice ways of circumventing the great fire wall of China . In doing sothey are taking a real risk about giving up this giant chunk of market , but I thinkit 's a very admirable thing to do if you care about mitigating tyranny . It puts theChinese authorities in a very difficult position which is interesting because thegovernment there is weary of agitating local Google users who tend to be very highlyeducated and vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that minimizing tyrannywith the Internet is not automatic , it 's not straight forward , it 's going to requireconstant vigilance . In fact , here 's another example of that : This is a map of theInternet and information flow around the world and how free it is and you can see thatthe red areas are sort of the usual suspects where there is really serious danger interms of the openness of the information flow , but what some of you might not know isthat the government of Australia in 2008 decided to try to pass mandatory ISP filteringon all the web sites and in 2009 it was leaked that they had a list , the black list ofall the sites they were going to filter out . Now this has n't actually been put intopractice in Australia but it is a subject of real political discussion and thegovernment that 's in power wants to do it and this is something for us to really beaware of . Because again while the Internet can reduce the control of a government thereis constant vigilance that is required . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it remains likely that future attempts at censorship areeventually going to be defeated by the new technology of the Internet or at least theInternet will help with this . Among other things as citizens our next steps are firstof all to demand transparency in government at every point that we can , this is alreadyunder way with sites like recovery.gov and we should financially encourage companieswho stand up against censorship . There are several companies now that are consideringpulling out of China . Now it 's complicated , some of them have various reasons , some oftheir servers have been hacked and they 're mad about that . They have various reasonsfor wanting to do that , but I think the Inaudible is on us as a population to givepositive feedback to those companies . Google 's stock has fallen 6% since they startedhaving this trouble with China and that 's a shame . Thinking a little further into thefuture , eventually people are going to get very good at having home brewed satelliteuplink systems which means that you can circumvent government firewalls all together . Ithink all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimizing tyranny andthe Internet is one of the technologies that can really help us get there . Step five:If you want to save civilization is to get more brains involved in solving problems . Weall know about crowd sourcing and the idea here is that you solve problems by massiveparticipation and what you do is you get lots of people together and their essentiallythe nodes of the super computer . There 's been a lot of scholarly writing and popularwriting about the wisdom of crowds and the fantastic properties you get out of crowdsourcing . For example on the site Foldit , protein folding is an extremely intensivecomputational problem and the idea here is that you turn it into a game and you haveend users work on the game and see how they can fold it and see who can get the minimumenergy configuration and then you can win prizes and so on . So what you 're doing isyou 're distributing this very hard problem to lots and lots of people . It 's a greatidea for crowd sourcing . CSTART is a new organization that 's just begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the moon . So we do n't have to dependon governments anymore we 're going to get to the moon by ourselves by everybody sort ofpitching in the same way you can do open source movements to develop really goodsoftware . So that 's the idea with crowd sourcing , but what I want to point out is thatcrowd sourcing really , the way it 's going now , involves less than 1% of the worldpopulation who are actually involved in this sort of thing . I want to suggest animportant way to go beyond crowd sourcing . Eighty years ago Virginia Wolf and her essayA Room of One 's Own , she pointed out that half of the planet 's writing talent had beensquandered by the simple fact that women at that time did n't have the same opportunityas men to become writers . She imagined in this book what would happen if WilliamShakespeare had had a sister named Judith Shakespeare who was equally as talented . Whatwould have happened ? And her answer is we would never have heard of Judith Shakespearebecause she simply would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humancapital . Human capital is a term that originally was defined by Adam Smith and itrefers to the skills of the labor force . It turns out that it 's now becoming clear thatthe development of human capital depends on open access to education and opportunities.Many economists have been really emphasizing lately the importance of cultivating humancapital because the investment translates directly into economic output . In a worldwhere we know that historical collapse is so tightly tied to economic meltdowncivilizations would be well advised to leverage all the brain power that they have . Theproblem is most of the world does n't have the opportunity to get the education that'safforded to a small minority . For every Einstein , or Yo-Yo Ma , or Barak Obama who havethe opportunity for education there are uncountable others who just never get thechance . This vast under tapping of our civilizations potential steals security from ourfuture . The Internet addresses this problem with a kind of natural ease by opening thegates of education in a way that 's never been possible before . So a motivated teenanywhere on the planet can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with Wikipedia and then going to MIT 's open course ware and getting an IvyLeague education . Many universities launch this sort of thing , Rice University has asite called connections which is essentially Wikified text books from children toprofessionals and it 's been very successful . So for the intrepid learner anywhere onthe globe , if they can get a hold of the Internet , there are tens of thousands ofcourses on line , there are lectures , there are lecture notes , there are homeworkproblems , there are quizzes , interactive web demo 's and so on . And beyond the coursesthe world 's scientific knowledge is now at the fingertips of everyone . So hunting downa scientific paper when I had first started graduate school you had to walk over to thelibrary . Now everything is at your fingertips and the National Institute of Health hasdemanded that all the papers that are published on their dime , in other words , anyscientist who has an NH Grant , now has to upload the published manuscript to Pop Medcentral . So the idea is that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their fingertips . If they 're the ones contributing to the research theyshould be able to access that . The same with Archive.org , you 've got all the physicspapers available so all the world 's knowledge is available right there to anyone whocan get a hold of the Internet . If you 're ever going to be a medical patient of coursenow 's the right time to do it , until recently physicians had a lot of asymmetricknowledge over the patients , but with the proliferation of medical web portals andsites where patients get together and share information , the patients are bettereducated and that ends up being better for everyone . Okay , I know what you 're thinking , you 're thinking you know it 's not actually trivial for kids in impoverished countriesto get a hold of the Internet and much of the world does not have access still.Nonetheless , even the mere feasibility that completely redefines the playing field andpeople are working on getting computers into the hands of children all over . Many ofyou are familiar with the One lap top per child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these so that they can have this self empoweredlearning . There was a lot of development that went into One Lap top Per Child to makethese computers very inexpensive and Negroponte , the guy who 's been leading thischarge , just announced that they 're working on a new model of the computer which willbe based on the tablet model and the advantage here is that it 's a lot cheaper and morerobust to build because the former model has nine hundred moving parts including thekeyboard and the hinge and so on whereas the tablet model has none of that . So you cando it for cheaper and it 's more robust and you can get this into the hands of even morechildren . So this is a program that 's underway and it 's been tremendously successful . Italked a few steps ago about the retention of knowledge and the speed of spreadingknowledge , but what I 'm really talking about here is the creation of knowledge and I'dlike to be able to come up with a better word than crowd sourcing which as I mentionedjust uses less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since there will beproblems in the future that we have n't even thought of , in the face of that what wewant to do is maximize our problem solving machinery and so what I think we want to doas we democratize education is move from crowd sourcing really to something likesociety sourcing where we 're getting 10% , 50% of the population involved in reallysolving problems . It goes without saying that vast numbers of people on the planet willnot take the opportunity to give themselves an Ivy League education , but for the firsttime in history it 's widely available . So the Internet has sort of naturallyaccomplished a human resource capitalization that would make Judith Shakespeare proud.We 're finally in a position to actualize the brains available in a worldwidepopulation . There are a lot of steps that we need to do next . We need to keepincreasing sites and application for crowd sourcing , contribute to open course wheresupport open access publishing in all areas financially incentivize that and improveinformation science . I can go into that a little bit more . Finally the last step if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run out of energy . It turnsout that carrying capacity is one of the main concerns on the mind of scientists andpoliticians and thinkers . It 's the fugacity of the natural energy resources that wehave is really the concern because when societies exceed their , in other words howmuch energy is available to support them , that 's when all is lost . That 's when theystart fighting for the resources that are there and everything goes down the tubes . Sothis characterizes many different types of collapses that have come before us , so inJared Diamond 's book Collapse , he points out that a common reason for societal failureis environmental damage for example : deforestation , or soil erosion . In his bookAncient Maya , Arthur Demarest points out that the same thing that draught and a loss ofsoil fertility precipitated the fall of the Mayan even before the small pox arrived . Itturns out that just recently people have come up with evidence for the excedance ofcarrying capacity among the Minoan 's , a civilization that I mentioned before that gotwiped out by a tsunami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that part of Crete , meaning that if a tsunami did n't get them , carrying capacity issues might have . Well happily the Internet again addresses thissort of problem with very natural ease . I was recently just giving a talk at the NIH inInaudible and I was absolutely amazed by these atavistic filing cabinets that linedthe hallways and the rooms and they filled everything with this unnecessary gravity andno one accesses these anymore because all of the important papers of course haveshifted into electrons at this point . So what remains in the hallways are these fossillike evidence of a recent age in which you measured information content , not bygigabytes but by cubic meters ? The inefficiency of these giant filing systems hascharacterized everything , businesses and scientists until very recently . I 'm going tosuggest that the technological shift from bigger to smaller is more than convenient , it 's absolutely critical to the future . Take for example our mail service , since theintroduction of e-mail our postal system which has now been demoted to the moniker ofsnail mail , has been hemorrhaging financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up . Why , because everybody is sending their documentselectronically , whether it 's real estate contracts or book manuscripts or whatever itis everybody is sending this electronically . It 's very difficult to estimate thebillions of pounds of carbon dioxide saved by not having to ferry batches of papereverywhere for simple transactions . We can be sure that this makes a contribution toair quality . Similarly we 've diminished the need to drive long distances to browse andpurchase products and this has allowed many brick and mortar stores to shift a lot oftheir operation online . If you 're shopping for a perfect set of cutlery or dishes or ashirt or something you might have previously driven around to several stores to lookfor this , to look over the stock , and now it 's replaced with some minutes of websurfing , you find exactly what you want at the best price and you click to get a singledelivery . Now I know what you 're thinking , you 're thinking well what makes you thinkthat the delivery trucks are any better for the environment than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that one thing you might worry about is allthe packaging that involves in delivery but of course all the companies that are movingtowards more eco friendly packaging , they call it eco friendly packaging , but of coursethey 're saving themselves money . The only reason that they ever had big packaging wasto prevent shop lifting . You have to put things in big display packages so people can'tstick it in their pocket and walk out . Well now you do n't have to do that and companiesincreasingly they 're all advertising how they 're saving more and more and more on theirpackaging . So now things are very tight . Okay , but obviously we still have to worryabout the trucks driving around , but the good news is everybody 's trying to save moneyand energy and so it turns out that companies like UPS who deliver these things havedeveloped these super optimization algorithms where they can figure out how to makedeliveries in the most optimal way possible and some of you may know that UPS trucksdo n't even make left turns anymore . Why because left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you waste a lot of time and gas , so UPS they never make left turns anymore , their super optimized and as a result they 've saved millions of miles off theirdelivery route , they 've saved millions of gallons of gas and they 've reduced CO2 by alot . In many cases it turns out it actually is much more efficient to have these thingsdelivered to you and to your neighbors rather than you driving all over town in yourinefficient , sitting alone in your car , left turning method . And then finally it 's thecase--so I 'm a scientist and I see this all the time , people in businesses and otherpeople see this in your own ways all the time , but we 're having more and more meetingson line . A few months ago I was invited by the Journal of Nature to give a talk insecond life and I was able to use power point slides and people dropped in from allaround the world to hear the talk and it was a fantastic experience for me becausethere was not a drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the talk.It was seamless and it was absolutely environmentally friendly . Now there are of coursereal costs for the forest of computers that under pin the Internet , but these costs arefar less than the trees and the coal beds and the oil deposits that would be spent downfor the same amount of information flow . A lot of people are working on ways to produceelectricity more cheaply and quickly , but there are n't any such plans for trees andcoal and oil . So to summarize this many authors have pointed out that societal collapsecan typically be cast in terms of energy . When energy expenditure begins to our weighenergy return , that 's when collapse ensues . So next time you 're annoyed by theaccumulation of e-mails in your e-mail box just think about how grateful you are thatit 's not all packages and papers like it was in the old days . Okay , so what to do next , well I think it would really be useful for companies to commit to server forms aroundsustainable energy . Governments can incentivize us with tax breaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have phone apps where you 're minimizing your own routesdoing no left turns and figuring out how to go places and this is just in the nearfuture . I think in the far future we 're going to have even better ways involving crowdsourcing and other methods of really getting better energy efficiency . In JaredDiamond 's book Collapse , he points out that societies often fall because ofmalfunctions in long distance trading for needed resources . And I think through themodern lens we can suggest that maybe the most important trade works nowadays , thetrade networks nowadays are carrying zeros and ones . They 're informational , they 're inother words instead of sort of the silk route it 's the fiber optic trading route . Andwhat I 've argued is that the Internet can in a very natural easy way defy six problemsthat play traditional roles in societal collapse , and these are the problems . Now ofcourse I 'm sure some people are scribbling down questions , now saying you know it'smore complex than that and that 's exactly right . There are a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many scholars who address whycivilizations collapse , some point out that , very general things they do n't changetheir fixed design for solving problems or they find problems they can not solve . Theseare two famous ideas about why societies collapse . They are very general . I actuallythink that even though it 's sort of tangential here the Internet with the crowdsourcing , the marketization of education and so on , the speed of information , I thinkit might actually be able to touch on these . There are others that it probably wo n't beable to touch on directly . Two men invented in 1948 listed many prerequisites for acivilizations survival , I 've picked out some here that I think the net does n't directlyaddress . Basic nutritional needs , construction of a good legal system , maintenance oforder with good executive and judicial branches , and having meaningful diplomacyabroad . These are all things that maybe the net does n't directly address . And then I'msure somebody scribbled this down on a piece of paper already , there is a really bigproblem with everything I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? We are completely married to this , I mean it 's already the case that we 're in thissituation , but I 'm arguing that it will save civilization and here 's the real Achillesheel to the argument here . I think there are at least two ways that the net will godown , one of course is major electricity outages and I think what 's going to need tohappen is people are going to need to think very hard about back-up plans not only forthe server farms but the routers , the end users people having waves at their own homesto run this and it might not , you might not want to just have it solar because theremight be something like a nuclear winter where there is no sun , you maybe want wind , Imean there are a lot of really bad scenarios you can imagine where the net would godown and you 're completely depending on it and you want some way that the whole societyhas a back-up plan here . I have a suspicion that the nets going to go down a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everybody along theway has a good method for this . Then of course there 's going to be network attacks andwe 're already seeing some of this . The Internet in Iran went down recently and Ihave n't been able to find out exactly the follow up of what happened , but at the timethey were saying it looked like cables were cut , these undersea cables and I think thejuries still out about exactly what happened , if it was purposeful or not .

Given how married we are to the Internet and given that this is thething that might save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something likean equivalent of the seed vault . This is the seed vault in Svalbard which holds fivehundred different types of plant seeds and the idea is that if there 's some globalcatastrophe you 've got a back-up of everything here and you can actually reconstitutethe crops of the world by pulling them out of this seed bank is Svalbard . So we need tohave some sort of Internet seed bank , and I 'm not talking about the Internet archive orjust having a copy of what 's happening on the Internet , I 'm talking about things burnedin the physical media that teach you how to generate electricity , how to build acomputer and how to reconstitute the net . Because we might have back-up of all the dataon the net , but someday if things get really disastrous we want to be able to actuallyrebuild the net . So that 's all I 'm going to say and I 'm happy to take questions now.Thank you so much .

Thank you . Well I see a lot of old friends out here and its just greatto be here at the Commonwealth Club . I am on a book tour and I did write this book " ATime to Lead . " I wrote it at the behest of a West Point classmate and I was on the dailyshow with Jon Stewart about two weeks ago and he said , so let me get this straight , youran for president four years ago , you did n't write a book . Now you are not running forpresident and you have written a book and its entitled " A Time to Lead . " He said , whatgives ? And I explained to him , I really want to write a book about America and that'swhat I tried to write about through my own experiences in my life . I ca n't get through anairport without people asking me what are we going to do about Iraq and what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , you ca n't just pop out analgebraic equation and answer that question . You have to go back and ask how did we getto where we are and who are we as Americans . So let me try to tackle both those in a wayand then set the stage for your dialogue because I really want to hear what 's on in your mind.The beginning of all this problem that we are in with Iraq and Afghanistan in the war onterror and all of that is its not with the birth of Mohammed and its not with the foundingof the state of Israel . Its actually 1989 , it was the year of miracles in Europe . It was theyear in which the Berlin Wall came down ; it was the year in which the Soviet Empire inEastern Europe collapsed . It was the year in which we are generally credited with havingwon the Cold War . We won the Cold War with an integrated civil , political , diplomatic , economic and military strategy that was calling upon all of America 's resources andstrengths to contain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power.Now it was true that Republicans and Democrats never totally agreed on this . Thestrategy was actually formulated in the late 40 's by Harry Truman and it was carried byEisenhower and Republicans always believe we should have more weapons and talktougher and threaten more people and do more covert operations , and Democrats alwayssaid , ca n't we be nicer and have more negotiations and ca n't we sign more treaties anddo n't be nasty . And but those abroad common agreement , that this was America'spurpose in the world and within that agreement then Democratic and Republicans foughtit out . And so Truman , Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson , Carter and Reagan all carried thisstrategy forward until the Soviet Union collapsed.People of my age in the armed forces I I was commissioned in 1966 and my firstexperience in Germany was 1964 as a cadet , I had a tank platoon with 19 soldiers and fivetanks in Germany to command for the summer of 1964 . We went to the we went to thedivided city of Berlin we went to Checkpoint Charlie , we went down Karl Marx's0:06:56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cheap communistarchitecture . We saw the angry militant thin faces of these East German borderpolicemen . We saw the mines in the Berlin Wall . We were told and received theintelligence briefings about the four East German divisions who were locked and caughtin their barracks , locked up with their officers , with their equipment uploaded , ready toattack on two hours notice and behind them two Russian armies of a dozen divisionloaded with tanks ready to get to the Rhine River in less than 72 hours . Behind that morearmies , more troops and ultimately 6000 warheads pointed at America , nuclear warheads.That was the world we grew up in . It was unthinkable to us that we would win . I mean wealways wanted to win and there was an American diplomat named George Kennan whowrote this paper called The Sources of Soviet Conduct , in which he said if you just holdon and squeeze them long enough , eventually they will collapse at their own mistakenideas . But nobody was willing to take a bet on it and say it 's going to happen in X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1989 , he was coming in to be the Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my friend Bill Odum was going to go in and brief him andI said I said , General Odum , take this message into General Powel for me and becauseI had worked for him and he knew and respected me , I said , tell him he should set a goallike this would be the that the end of the Berlin Wall during the four years he isChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . And a couple of days later I got a note back fromGeneral Odum , it says , no General Powell says that 's too ambitious a goal.And four months later the Berlin Wall was down . We could n't believe it . And within twoyears the Soviet Union had collapsed . We won the greatest victory of the 20th Century.We won it without ever having fought the Russians directly . We won it because we tookwe built our economy and Eisenhower said America 's greatest strength was oureconomic strength , we took our military and trained them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , not to fight war . We took our educational system and we triedto sharpen it for training and teaching and science and education and technology tocompete with the Soviets on Sputnik and the race to the moon . We took our young peopleand we appointed the football coach from Oklahoma to be the Presidential PhysicalFitness Advisor for America . And in the Kennedy administration young people wereencouraged to be physically fit and get a presidential physical fitness badge , and we did alot of things to try to harness America . We brought tens of thousands of young peoplehere to study and see our ideas . We sent American companies abroad ; we evenencouraged them to hire local people and then bring them back here for training . Thosemultinational corporations were America 's eyes and ears and ambassadors on the world.All of that was designed to contain the spread of communism and deter the Soviet Union and it worked.But but when we won the Cold War , we lost our strategy . We had no adversary ; we lostour purpose in the world . We lost the organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer world , we lost the organizing principles thatkept the NATO alliance together . We were in a new world . It was so new that Harvardhistorian Francis Fujiyama it the end of history . George Bush proclaimed a new worldorder . Gabriel Garc++ ' + +GG++G+++-a M++ ' + +GG++G+++-rquez came to see me in Panama on 1996 and says , it 's the mostboring time in history . And I said why , he said because there is no clash of ideas . There isonly one idea . I said I do n't think that 's boring . But I was wrong , because there were a lotof other ideas . During the that period I was the division commander of the Fort Hood asJeff said in 1992-94 ' . I had 350 armored fighting vehicles , 350 tanks , battalion of apachehelicopters , battalion of multiple launch rocket systems , three battalions and tubeartillery , 17,000 soldiers and 53 horses . I got to ride the horseback twice a week , I hadboots that came up to my knees , I used boot picks to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't like you pay more than $1,400 for a horse andhad a big black stetson and with two stars on it . And I actually could gallop and jump and I loved it.And suddenly I was told I was going to go to Washington , get a third star and be theDirector of Strategic Plans and Policy on the Joint Staff , the highest military staff in thecountry . My job was to integrate military thinking with diplomatic and political strategy.So I was the guy who took the military strategic plans and went across the Potomac Rivereveryday to the White House meetings and had a staff of 300 officers to help me and wedid everything from all geographic areas to space , arms export policy , international treatyand negotiations and the UN . I had the whole you might say , what is this what else isanybody doing on the Joint Staff . But believe me , it 's a very busy place and there are a lotof people doing a lot of things . But I had a huge port folio and when I went up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Soviet threat , there was noorganizing principle and so , I arrived at it was I think the fifth of April 1994 was myfirst day . When I walked in , they handed me three , three ring binder , stacked up on mydesk , they said , sir , you have to learn all these . I looked at it and they were full ofacronyms and abbreviations and I could n't understand what they were saying , I thought Iwas going to learn about NATO . But instead they showed me a map and it had like sixlines and they were all intersecting . They said , well , there is NATO , there is the EuropeanUnion , there is a Western European Union , there is the organization for security andcorporation in Europe , there is a Western Union Treaty organization , I mean they wentthrough all these different organizations and they were all overlapping . So Denmark is themember of the they member of the EU , but they are not a member of the EU , monitory , but they are member of NATO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union.But they get to vote in the EU on West European Union Defense Policy you know , theyare not member of the you know , there is you are trying to sort this out and it wasincredibly complicated and confusing and I had been there and trying to learn my job , General Shalikashvili told me I was supposed to be the person who drove the staff . I wassupposed to come up with these ideas.So the second day , I was there , I was leaving the office . And somebody said , bad news inAfrica , we just had a shoot down of an aircraft by a missile that shot-down the presents ofRwanda and Burundi ; it may be our missile . So this was the crisis on Thursday morning , my third day . So it turned out it was a French missile and not an American missile noproblem . I was leaving the office , so I am and I said well , who are these people onRwanda and Burundi . They said , sir they are the we do n't have time to brief you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar and come back and give you the run downnext week , fine . So on Friday , I was leaving the office , I thought I had a full week , mywife was saying , when are you ever going to be home , when are you going to hang thepictures , when are you going to unpack . And I had already learned , when every time Iwent to Shalikashvili 's office , he had CNN on continuously . And I realized - my learningexperience was if you ever want to find out what 's happening , you do n't ask the NationalMilitary Command Center , you watch CNN . So I was leaving office at six o'clock atnight on a Friday night , half the people are gone because they think they can takeadvantage of me as a newbie on the block , that I wo n't call them on Friday night if theyget out of their seat . And I was looking on the CNN screen , there is fighting , there aresoldiers , they are in Africa . It 's dark , there are black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said what is this , a war movie or what ? And my assistant said , oh no it'ssome action in Kigali or some place and it looks like I think it 's a French and may bemay be it 's the Belgians and so I quickly called the National Military CommandCenter and said I am you know , I am the new J5 , I am supposed to know everything , what 's going on in the world and looks like we got a battle going on in Africa , what 's thatabout ? They said , sir we do n't know anything . I said did you look at CNN , they said , no sir.So I called the European Command Center in Stuttgart , Germany and they are supposedto keep up with Africa , I said , what 's going on , they said , we do n't know anything aboutit . So I had to call the embassies , anyway , we were up all night with the State Departmenttrying to figure out what the French and Belgians were doing . The Saturday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry and they said , if youimpress Perry you may get to go with him on a trip to Korea . So go to this meeting andsee what he has to say , so I went in there and I thought , ah Korea , I have been there adozen times , I have been over there , I have trained the troops , I know the war plans , Idiscovered we were about to go to war with North Korea . It seemed like PresidentClinton had been there in October of 93 ' , he told the North Koreans , they could have toldhe said , no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula , he got home , the CIA said , wellMr . President there has been a slight problem , it seemed like we may have misled youmay be we should have told you earlier , but there is this Korean reactor and they can takethe fuel rods out of it and if they reprocess them , they could extract plutonium from thespent fuel and that could make a nuclear weapon and there could be enough plutonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they have done this because they won'tlet the IAEA inspectors look at the reprocessed or non-reprocessed fuel pit to find out ifthere were residue in there , has been reprocessed or not . And so we were going tothreaten them and we were going to take them to the UN and they said , if you take us tothe UN and put sanctions on us , we will consider it as act of war . And so the generals inKorea called us to say they say it 's a act of war , it 's going to be an act of war , give usmore troops and this thing was ramping up to be a full fledged battle and you know , Ileft about three hours later from the secretary 's office kind of stunned , because none ofthis was in the press.And on Sunday I got called into a meeting in the White House , I sat in the back row , Situation Room it 's a little tiny room about the size of this stage with a little table andthere was the Secretary of State Warren Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a TV screen from New York , she was the UN Ambassadorand Sandy Berger , the Deputy National Security Advisor , Tony Lake , the NationalSecurity Advisor and Bill Perry was there again and Shalikashvili , my boss was there andseveral other people , Vice President 's National Security Advisor , and they are arguingabout the Air Rules of Engagement for flying combat air patrols over Bosnia . And theyare talking about what are the criteria which enable them to shoot Serb aircraft . And theyare arguing , well there is a plane here and there is a plane here and if they sees the plane , if it turns back to them and if the radar is on and what if there is a radar on the ground andif the radar on the ground , what kind of radar is it and how does the pilot know the radaris on the ground and tracking him , not tracking and this discussion goes on and they aremoving like this . I am sitting there trying to follow this conversation ; I got a littlestenographer 's notebook . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't followit , they could n't follow it , they want an aviator in the room , no body understood thetechnology , we spent three hours there on a Sunday afternoon and we ended with nothing.That was my first weekend . And on Monday morning , a guy came in , knocked on thedoor , he was a one star general , he said sir , I was gone last week . I worked for youdid n't me my name is Tommy Hill . And he said , I have to report something to you , I amnot allowed to tell you this because it 's classified information and it 's compartmented . ButI and I am representing you in this compartmented program , but I feel like how to tellyou any way we are planning an invasion of Haiti . And you know , here I come up , hereit 's the end of the Cold War , I do n't know why we have armed forces left and we areabout to go to war with North Korea , we are fighting the war over the Balkans and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this went on every single weekend with callsand frantic meetings and nothing decide and after about six or eight weeks of thisShalikashvili called me back and he said Wes , he said , look he said in his polishaccent at English . He says , we hired you to be the strategist because you are supposed tobe so smart , so tell us what is this strategy that has us working every weekend ? And itwas a joke , because there was no strategy . And so we tried to create a strategy . Weworked really hard to do it . And we labored for year and a half to create . I mean - Whatdo you do after deterrence and containment ? There was no obvious threat , we knew thatthere was a threat of regional war , there was a threat of terrorism , there was a threat ofnuclear proliferation , there was a threat of Russia should be become hostile , but therewas no obvious immediate threat that you could sort of run up the flag and say , look outhere come here they come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to mobilizeresources , build alliances , so we really puzzle over this . And we wrote this strategy calledthe Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement . It was published in 1995 , and if you sawthe title today of Engagement and Enlargement , you think it was an advertisement formen 's pharmaceutical product . All most nobody read it it never became the realnational strategy . We were very active you know we went to Bosnia , we put 25,000troops on the ground , we stopped the war , we fought a 78 day air camp , and we bombedSaddam , we bombed Osama Bin Laden , we won that war that saved a million and a halfAlbanians , that I led as NATO commander and at the end of it all when I retired in 2000there was still non national strategy.And in the 2000 presidential election I remember it was just before I left the military , Icame to New York and I heard Ken Black and Bob Shrum who were managingrespectively , the George Bush and Al Gore campaigns , debate in front of these prominentFrench and American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Whatwould be the top five issues ? It was like the economy , education , social security reform , and may be trade and that was it . There was nothing about national security , nothing , nosignificant foreign policy issues . Now , everything was going great . And then 9/11happened . And what happened in 9/11 is we did n't have a strategy , we did n't havebipartisan agreement , we did n't have American understanding of it and we had instead apolicy coup in this country , a coup , a policy coup.Some hardnosed people took over the direction of American policy and they neverbothered to inform the rest of us . I went through the Pentagon ten days after 9/11 . Icould n't stay away from mother army . I went back there to see Donald Rumsfeld , I hadworked for him as a White House fellow in the 1970s , its all listed in the book and and Isaid to him , are you doing okay on CNN and he said yeah yeah yeah fine , he said , Iam thinking about he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book that talksabout the Kosovo campaign and he said , I just want to tell you he said , no body is goingto tell where or when we can bomb , no body . He said I am thinking to call this a floatingcoalition , and what you think about that . I said , well sir , thanks for reading my book . Andwell he said , thanks that are all the time I have got , really . And I went downstairs , I wasleaving the Pentagon and an officer from the Joint Staff called me into his office and said , I would want you to know , he said , sir , we are going to attack Iraq . And I said , why ? Hesaid , we do n't know . He said I said , will they tie Saddam to 9/11 ? He said , no he saidbut I guess , its they do n't know to do about terrorism and so the they think butthey can attack states and they want to look strong its all , I guess they think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know what its like that old saying , it said , if the only tool you have is a hammer , then every problem has to be a nail.Well I walked out of there pretty upset and then we attacked Afghanistan . I was prettyhappy about that , we should have . And then I came back to the Pentagon about six weekslater , I saw the same officer , I said why why have n't we attacked Iraq ? We are sill goingto attack Iraq , he said , oh sir he says , its worse than that . He said he pulled up a pieceof paper of his desk , he said , I just got this memo from the Secretary of Defense 's office , it says we are going to attack and destroy the governments in in seven countries in fiveyears . We are going to start with Iraq and then we are going to move to Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Somalia , Sudan and Iran seven seven countries in five years . I said , is that aclassified memo ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show it to me . He was about to showit to me , because I do n't want to talk about it . And I I sat on this information for a longtime , for about six or eight months , I was so stunned by this , I could n't begin to talk aboutit . And I could n't believe it would really be true , but that 's actually what happened . Thesepeople took control of the policy in the United States and I realized then it came back tome , a 1991 meeting I had with Paul Wolfowitz you know , in 2001 he was DeputySecretary of Defense , but in 1991 he was the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , it'sthe number three position of the Pentagon . And I had gone to see him when I was a onestar general , I was commanding the National Training Centre , I had met him one time , hesaid , if you ever get to Washington , come with me up there , I always say that . Well , I wasthere in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell , he gave mefive minutes of his precious time and set me on my way and I was bored in the Pentagonand and I thought I will just go who could I see . I think I will see Wolfowitz.So I called and up there he was available , Scooter Libby came to the door , I met Scooterfor the first time and he brought me in and I said to Paul and this is 1991 , I said Mr.Secretary you must be pretty happy with the performance of the troops in Desert Storm.And he said , well yeah , he said but but not really , he said because the truth is weshould have gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and we did n't . And this was just after the Shiauprising in March of 91 ' which we had provoked and then we kept our troops on the sidelines and did n't intervene . And he said , but one thing we did learn , he said , we learnedthat we can use our military in the region in the Middle East and the Soviets wo n't stop us.He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to clean up those all Soviet clientregimes ; Syria , Iran , Iraq , - before the next great super power comes on to challenge us.And it was like you know I am coming out the Mohave desert , I have been trainingtroops , I have n't been thinking geo strategy for some time and suddenly a guy just sort ofshoves this nugget it well you will remember it it was a pretty stunning thing , I meanthe purpose of the military is to start wars and change governments , its not to sort of deter aa conflict , we are going to have invade countries and you know , my mind was spinning.And I put that aside . It was like a nugget that you hold on to . This country was taken overby a group of people with a policy coup , Wolfowitz and Cheney and Rumsfeld and youcould name a half dozen other collaborators from the project for a new American century.They wanted at us to destabilize the Middle East , turn it upside down , make it under ourcontrol . It went back to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wasthere a national dialogue on this ? Did senators and congressman stand up and denouncethis plan ? Was there a full fledged American debate on it ? Absolutely not ; and there arestill is n't , and that 's why we are failing in Iraq , because Iran and Syria know about theplan . All you have to do is read the the Weekly Standard and Bill Kristol and he blabbermouthed it out all over the world , Richard , the same way . They could hardly wait tofinish Iraq , so they could move in to Syria . It was like a lay down , oh our legions are going to go in there.This was n't what the American people voted George Bush in to office , well they didn'tactually vote him to office , but it was n't what many of the people who it was n't whathe campaigned on . He campaigned on a humble foreign policy , the most arrogant foreignpolicy in American history . He campaigned on no peace keeping , no nation building andhere he is with Afghanistan and Iraqis ; astonishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in Iraq , please believe me , do n't be mad if you are a Democrat at yourDemocratic congressmen because they ca n't reduce the troops and frustrate the president.That 's not the issue . And if you are Republican do n't be mad at the Democrats becausethey are fussing with the troops . Whether you are Democrat or Republican , if you are anAmerican you ought to be concerned about the strategy of the United States in this region , what is our aim , what is our purpose , why are we there , why are Americans dying in this region ? That is the issue , for lack of an effective strategy we are going to lose in this regionalbattle . David Patreaus , he worked for me , he was a fine young officer , he has n't workedfor me as a senior officer , I assume he is very competent , no body makes four stars in theUnited States Armed Forces , no matter what 0:29:09 unless they are pretty good.But and David Patreaus is good , darn good , but listen , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region are held by the White House . They have to dowith strategy , whether you talk to or isolate Iran , whether you punish or reform Syria , whether you aid or condemn Lebanon , how you motivate Egypt , how you deal with SaudiArabia , those are key elements in a strategy and there has to be a purpose for it and noneof that has been laid out in any coherent way . No , its all about politics , it 's what KarlRove said in January 2002 , in Las Vegas , Nevada , he said , " We going to run thisPresident as a War President . " And you know what ? They are succeeding . TheDemocratic challenge to Iraq was in my view misplaced . We should not havechallenged on troop strength or tactics . Its not about troops and tactics , it 's about strategyand policy . And we failed on challenging the strategy and policy . And Bush won ontroops because he knows he has got the Democrats up against the wall . It 's all aboutpolitics . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not you are not supportingthe American troops . If you if you try to challenge what he is doing , he says you don'twant to win . And now the rhetoric is heating up against Iran.So where is this going to go ? Likely to a strike against Iran it could be strike againstnuclear , could be build as a strike against Iran because there are aiding and abetting theinsurgents who were fighting and killing Americans . And how many Democraticcongressmen do you think will be able to take a strong and principle stand against this ? Well the answer is ; any Democrats who want to stand up and say , " No , I believe Iran hasa perfect right to kill and attack American soldiers .

I 'm sorry . I had my notebook on the laptop and I was advancing.We got - I was about to get part of this lecture at high speed . I just want to thankeverybody for being here because the mere fact that you 're here illustrates that you'rewilling exert effort to inform yourselves about what 's perhaps the most pressing issuefacing the world right now . Certainly , that 's my opinion . The Santa Fe Institute has along history of involvement in this area although I would say we 've kind of wanted to getinvolve for a long but never until recently found the right way to do it . Almost 20 yearsago , there was something called the 2050 project that Murray Gell-Mann pushed andthere was an effort to get SFI involved in thinking about sustainability issues and thefuture . For various reasons that did n't quite go but that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years ago , the National Renewable Energy Laboratorycalled up and particularly the director Dan Arvizu called Geoff West , our president.They had some conversations and they asked SFI to help them think out of the box , thinkabout the issues and renewable energy and sustainability that they might be missing andthat lead to a couple of different workshops that have happened in the meantime . Butthen we got the idea of holding a summer school and so , this summer school that we'rehaving involves 30 utterly remarkable students from the natural sciences , social sciences , biology , and physical sciences and it 's a 2-week event with 30 students , 10 experts fromaround the world and so far I can say it 's prove to be an incredibly exciting event.The organizers of that event have been Jessika Trancik , Postdoc at SFI , Doug Are n't  ofNational Renewable Energy Laboratory , myself and John Shellnhuber who is going toserve as the moderator for tonight 's discussion . So tonight , we are going to have adiscussion between two people . I mean let John introduce them but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who he is . He is first of all was originally trained as aphysicist . He is the founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate ImpactResearch . He has got many honors , a long list that I 'm not going to bore you with thenincluding being a member of both the German and the U.S. Physical Society - I 'm sorry , theAcademy of Science - the National Academy of Science . He is also a founding memberof the IPCC , a long term member of the IPCC , that 's the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change that if you 're reading the paper and you see the estimates aboutthe impact of global warming , they are the ones who produced that . They got the NobelPeace Prize in 2007 , so it 's my pleasure to introduce John Shellnhuber who then will ++-+-+G++-+-+-+ ohyou 're going to - oh that will go . You can go that way . I forgot there was stairs there , anyway.And so it was already a really complex problem to be solved but do you see I did , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real pleasure to be here . In general , themoderators are very useless person actually but today we are doing an experiment ofsome sort . I mean first of all , it 's a real pleasure to have two world leading intellectualshere who are coming from very different angles actually and the overall issue is clearlythe world is in crisis not the automobile industry , it 's the planetary as a whole , our planetas a whole , the planetary system as a whole . So it 's climate change but very often issuesas well its soil erosion , water resources and species depletion and so on . And the questionreally is I mean when I entered this field , I was trained as a physicist thenmathematician as well and I enter the field I thought , well this is very interestingintellectual challenge . I have to think about climate change and the planetary system butthe more you learn about it , the more you get worried . I already give a lecture on that onSaturday and the latest numbers and the latest analysis simply show that if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are able to deliver a world which is worthwhileto live in to our grandchildren and something very dramatic needs to happen , verydramatic needs to happen . I give you just one number , the United States would have tocompletely decarbonizes their industry by 2050 , no emissions at all , probably going intonegative emissions , that means extracting carbon from the atmosphere through growingforest and probably even by 2030 , there would have to be an emission reduction ofaround 80% . So these are just numbers but it would mean an industrial revolution andthe question is of course can we afford to save the planet . That 's what economist askedyou . We may lose shops in saving the planet so how should we do it ? Should we do it atall ? So that is the title of this talk or of this event tonight , Will It Cost the Earth to Savethe Planet and then of course , this is being discussed in different ways.The economists really talk about timing . Timing is very important so we assume we aregetting smarter and developing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might be better to end climate change . So this is in the end , the discussion aboutthis country , it++-+-+G++-+-+G+++-s an intergenerational acuity and so on and Partha Dasgupta will certainlytackle the event a while for people who are more coming bottom up engineering type , very creative , very pragmatic like Amory Lovins to say , oh we have a wealth ofsolutions . We just have to employ and apply them and while waiting for anything , wecan do it right now . So I 'm over simplifying clearly and the two gentlemen will maketheir points but they 're coming from very different philosophies I guess and now theexperiment today is do these philosophies match can wait , make it for a conversation foryour questions , can we make these philosophies match in order to have a crurde look atthe whole as Murray Gell-Mann would say , the claw approach for which the Santa FeInstitute is so famous and we 'll do this experiment today . Let me first or let me say a fewwords , just a few words about the two gentlemen I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - oh actually all of the three people on the panel including myselfstarted as physicist so we are somehow the jobless samurai of the intellectual worldand with all looking for new battlefields . So Partha started out that he is major in Physicsin Delhi I think and from Mathematics lapsed into Economics and - but I mean he is basedin Cambridge now , St. John 's College and many people say very appropriate forCambridge . He is termed the Newton of environmental economics and I think there issome truth in it . So Amory Lovins started out as an experimental physicist then he isnow I think the lead engineer of energy efficiency . You may call him the Einstein ofenergy efficiency . So we have two very famous people here tonight and let 's see how theevening goes whether it falls flat or we will really have good look at the whole . SoPartha , may I invite you to come to the floor now.Thank you very much . It 's almost like being like Buridan 's ass sitting in the middlewondering which of the routes to take but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left rather than right . Well it 's a great pleasure to be here Will It Cost theEarth to Save the World and I 'm an economist . I will be taking the separation betweenthe natural scientist and social scientist on this particular problem is one where we trustone another to do well by our own disciplines and I 'm going to be using very , very crudeestimates that are thrown at us from the natural sciences and feel them somewhat tofashion the questions that we as citizens by ask when we deliberate over breakfast , lunch , dinner and at parties , not political events , is to what we should do about saving the world.So I wo n't - it 's not my place to talk about the urgency of the matter . It 's the urgency Itake from the natural scientist and then I 'm going to try and convert into something likethe perspective of how to think about cause and benefits . We realize what the trade offsare , I do n't want to insult by stating obvious . We are thinking about intergenerational orway into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us some . What isthat some is something we want to talk about and if we do n't do it , there 'll be somedamages in the future . The Economics of Climate Change inevitably leads us to thinkabout the long term in a way that most economists are n't use to . The natural horizon hereis 50 , 60 , 100 , 200 , 300 years . In a way and typically if you read newspaper e.g. the - Iwo n't even mention the Wall Street Journal but something like the New York Times , you 're really looking at typically the next year , 3 years down the road , 5 years but themoment you say 5 years , you start thinking about 5 year plan so the Soviet period andyou stop and shrink back to it the next year so to speak . So we 're talking about the longterm in some sense and the other thing , the second point I want to made before I proceedis that , there is a sense when you read the literature of people , economist or philosopherswriting on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future generations are aliens.What are we to do about them when they arrive ? As a father of 3 children , I feel that 's amisleading way . I think we do ourselves injustice or insult ourselves by notacknowledging but in fact we do think about the future people all the time because everyfuture person will be somebody 's child and that somebody will have been somebodyelse 's child and we can track it back to ourselves . So we spend enormous amounts ofmoney rightly and with great pleasure in educating our children which is an investmentinto the future and we did want - we take them into account and when we take them intoaccount , we take our grandchildren to account because we recognize that they in turn willbe interested in their children . So by recursion , future people are very much in ourminds . The question is that as on a day-to-day basis when we go about our daily lives arethe signals that we receive from the external world but of course , being an economist , thesignals I have in mind are prices . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our future people into account in an appropriate way and there 's anenormous literature which I will not go into now . We suggest that we would be deadwrong and thinking that market ++-+-+G++-+-+-+ the prices ++-+-+G++-+-+-+ face in the market reflect the scarcities ofgood and services . Of course , that 's why we are here today . We 're talking about globalclimate change and enormous amount of unanticipated effect of our actions are being feltgradually now but into the distant future cumulatively in a way which makes things veryworrying.Okay , now let 's get down to business . What am I to do now ? Here we go , crudeestimates of annual expenditures require to limit a mean global temperatures increase thatis to 2 degrees centigrade - this is a background . Roughly speaking when you 're veryuncertain about the future , standard technique , a very reasonable technique is to say let uscreate some kind of quota beyond which the threshold beyond which we do n't wish toenter . Currently amongst the economist those who work on global climate change didthat quota is something like let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is today . And crude estimates , yes , if you want to limit that , then theestimates are that something like 2 and an outline of the figures that I 've seen , they aremaybe other figures but from our purposes , I want to give you ballpark figures , 2% toan outside 10% of the aggregate GDP of rich countries over the next 20 years , 25 yearsand so forth . Now , when you 're a reading newspapers , the figures like say 10% of GDPespecially if you 're reading it in America , you 'd be talking trillions and I askedsomebody a very famous U.S. senator once said a billion here and a billion there andpretty soon you 're talking about big numbers or real money . But here we 're talkingabout trillions because this is a trillion dollar economy . Once you 're given this figure ina trillion , in terms of trillion dollars , you start worrying . I want to argue that that worry isa misplaced and here is why . Is it ++-+-+G++-+-+-+ is 10% an outlier figure , is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , note that over the past 30 years or so , the GDP of OECDcountries which - these are - if you like the club of rich countries in the world , has beengrowing at an annual rate of approximately 3% a year . Now - so only 3 to 4 years ago , GDP was 10% lower than what it is today . It has been going 3% per year . So even ifyou 're just leave aside 10% of your GDP for the " future " and regard the usable GDP yourpersonal if you like to 90% then that 90% GDP is what we are experiencing . It would besay 4 , maybe 5 years ago . Now you have to ask yourself where we , we should askedourselves were we that badly of 5 years ago . Is it the case that we were starving and soforth and so on ? Life was probably pretty the same then as it is now . So we 're really nottalking about big numbers when you turn the problem into one of what it felt like inliving memory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just the other day , okay ? Now , so that 's one point.The next point is however , if it 's , you 've got a pool of cash , we need to worry about howto spread over the future to save the earth and here , those people who have worked on theEconomics of Climate Change and I 'm going to be talking about two main protagonist.Both of them are very influential have come to very different conclusions and I want tospend the rest of its talk giving you a flavor of the source of that difference . Both theparties and question and I 'll mention their names and the figures they use , take climatechange very seriously but one , William Nordhaus , a colleague and friend of mine at theYale University who has been studying the Economics of Climate Change for the past 30years , has come to the conclusion and that conclusion has n't change over the last 30 yearsby the way . The models have been changing . The models he has been using have beenchanging but his conclusion has n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gradualist policy . Do n't spend too much now but allow economist to growand become richer and then 20 , 25 , 30 years down the road , shift investment towardsclimate change . Mitigation and various forms of activity that could reduce to limit thetemperature let 's say within 2 degrees . That 's the broad picture and that 's the picturewhich has been followed by - which has been accepted by a number of people . Incontrast , Nicholas Stern , Lord Stern currently at the London School of Economics whohad a very famous review at the end of 2006 which was commissioned by the U.K.government . The Prime Minister back at - the then Prime Minister and the financeminister and now Prime Minister Gordon Brown backed it - took a view that the matter ismuch more urgent . The specific policy that was suggested were something like 2% of theGDP of rich countries should be invested even as we speak and as a recurrentexpenditure . So when I began the previous slide by saying that the estimates are varybetween 2% to 10% the lower end is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist but I 've included up to 10% for the simple reason I takenatural scientist a lot more seriously than more social scientist do and I 've heard muchhigher figures and I want to work with them to see what that might involve.Okay , so the question is why is there a difference of opinion between the two ? And theanswer is as it 's been suggested already , it depends on the way you discount future costsand benefits relative to today . Tomorrow , the dollar is not the same . Tomorrow 's realdollar is not the same as today++-+-+G++-+-+G+++-s real dollar because with today 's real dollar you could dothings which might make the asset grow , okay ? Now , the question is as citizens , whatdiscount rate should we use ? Nordhaus and large group of economists have taken themarket rates of return on investment as the benchmark for doing that calculation . I willwish to argue that it 's deeply flawed for a very simple reason , that if you are studying aproblem which involves huge market failure , an institutional failure , generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals are wrong.Then to use those same market signals to solve their problem that involves market failureseems the methodological weakness to me . Question is , is it likely to be very large ? Imean , you can always make an error , make it logical flaw in your analysis butnevertheless , it could be that you still arrive at approximately reasonable answer . Theanswer in this case happens to be , no . The figures that were used by William Nordhausand Nicholas Stern are as follows . Nordhaus in a particular scenario which the Sternreview follows takes a value of 4.3% per year discount in future costs and benefits toconvert them into present values . Stern takes 1.4% per year of the discount rate , which insome sense explains in great deal . It provides a great deal of explanation for theirdifferent recommendations . Now , you might think that approximately 3% discount ratedifference is not really very much , but in fact it is , 4.3% a year may not seem verydifferent from 1.4% a year , but it 's in fact a lot higher when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So to give you an example , consider we 're givenloss in consumption 100 years from now , say , 100 dollar in real terms 100 years fromnow . If the figure is discounted at 4.3% a year , the present value of that loss is nearly 20times lower than the present value of that same loss , if it were discounted at 1.4% a year , which gives you the intuitive sense of what discount rates are doing for you . The damage100 years from now will look much smaller when discounted at 4.3% than if it will bediscounted at 1.4% , and that 's what 's giving the difference.Now , what I want to do in the next five minutes that I have with my disposal is to lend anexplanation for their difference . So why they arrived at these two very different discountrates , which are doing so much of the work in explaining the difference between theirrecommendations . In fact , of course , many people would regard the Sternrecommendation as being very overly conservative and that 's why it was taking outerfigures like 10% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting reason , intellectually isvery interesting , as concerned citizens like yourself will find very worthy ofconsideration . To put it slightly crude but not too crude , I 'm an academic , I do n't want tobe that crude but it 's approximately correct but it requires certain amount of delicatemaneuvering . Nordhaus is , the approach that he takes , is on the whole rather democratic.It says let me try and figure out from the day-to-day behavior of people , how they viewthe future . So the kind of data he studied in order to infer what discount rate ought to beused for the global climate change problem , are behavior . The presumption is the peopleare concerned people , intelligent people , concerned about themselves and others and let'stry tease out elicit from their behavior what their values are , okay ? So that 's if you like -a particular philosophy of doing well for economics are more of philosophy by saying , their actions speak very loud . Let 's infer the values . Those values which will beconsistent with the actions , okay ? Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very reasonable because he was a Mandarin at the time he wrote the -- which is a government official . There the idea is that really we can , through speculationby reading the classics like Aristotle , John Stuart Mill and so forth try and see what theright thing to do this and we will use that way of thinking to arrive at the kind ofparameters on the basis of which we choose a discount rate . So there you have it . Youhave on the one hand , if you like , a contemplative method of arriving at a discount rateversus a cold-faced kind of way of doing it which is to study a lot of consumer data aboutexpenditure savings and so forth , risk taking and then trying to infer the differences.Question , what should we -- which route should we follow ? Being an incurable ditherer , I find a bit of good in both , and a bit of bad in both . I do n't like to be told by Mandarinswhat I should think , because that smacks so of authoritarianism , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of harm good people have done in thepast . So I worry about that.On the other hand , trying to elicit values that we as citizens hope from our daily behaviorin the market place , in a world in which the market signals are all wrong , hugely wrong , particularly the contexts of global climate change are diversity loss and so forth . It seemsto me to be wrong also because we , on our daily basis , are not behaving as concernedcitizens . What we do is we behave as concerned citizens when we gather on occasionsby people , various people and then of course agitates their congressman in this country , provided by people , various people and then of course agitates their congressman in thiscountry , parliamentarians in the UK , and so forth . It seems to me that that 's where theaction is going to lie , and I++-+-+G++-+-+G+++-m much more -- my gut feeling is that as I rely on that thatmiddle ground where we -- the political dialogue which is which to really effect at theend of the day the deliberations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thiscalendar year . That will happen not by people choosing discount rates but in some sensepushing towards policies which are going to commit funds for this monumental --gigantic undertaking that humanity has to undertake , there 's no ifs and buts about that butthe underlying economic arguments that I 've been suggesting , of course , are there tosharpen that intuitive notion , but at the end of the day it seems to me that that 's where theright wait lies and so I think these debates , these discussions are the right way forward.Thank you very much.So , I guess I 've seen Amory Lovins entering this room , you must be somewhere . Okay , Amory , the floor is yours.Well , as you might expect , I have a different perspectives about what questions to askwhich is even more interesting than the answers . We are often offered in the media amultiple choice test which if clearly expressed would read something like , Do you preferto die of climate change or oil wars or perhaps nuclear holocaust because those are thebroad consequences of the energy choices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom offered which is none of the above and that 's what happens I think if we useuse energy in a way that saves money because then problems like climate change and oildependence and nuclear proliferation go away , not at a cost but at a profit . So this is thefundamental divergence I think from the lovely tutorial we 've just had on how to valuemoney over time when we compare cost now with benefits later . I do n't that 's thecomparison we 're actually making in the climate case . Do any of you happen to knowhow climate protection is like the Hubble space telescope ? No ? Well , they were bothspoiled by a sign error , a confusion between a plus and a minus sign which cause themirror of the telescope to be grounded in the wrong curve . Similarly , the whole climateconversation is about cost burden and sacrifice , what will it cost to protect the climate , who should pay , who should decide ? Actually , the theorists who came up with thatnotion got the sign wrong because climate protection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable is that it 's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel . Efficiency ischeaper than fuel . Once more politicians appreciate this remaining resistance to climateprotection , well I think melts faster than the glaciers , and the main obstacle to climateprotection is the assumption that it 's going to be costly but that 's contrary to every shredof empirical evidence we have . I 'm going to come back to that point at the end because Ithink there is a very interesting difference between , for example , physicist and economistas to what is evidence , what is empirical . There are sort of paralleled universe that'soperating here . And we can get some notion of empiricism by looking at what companiesdo , I worked mainly with the private sectors , so I may give you a few numbers . Two ofour biggest chip makers , IBM and STMicroelectronics have been cutting the energy theyuse per dollar of revenue.By over 6% a year , with two or three year paybacks on their investments such as a lotbetter than one can do in other kinds of investments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate or not . BP met its climate goals for initialoperation carbon reduction 8 years early , they made $2 billion on the deal . Dupontraised some eyebrows by saying that by 2010 , they would have cut their Greenhouse gasemissions by 65% below 1990 level . How are they doing ? That sounds pretty ambitious.Well , by 2006 they were 80% below the 1990 level than they made $3 billion on the dealand so a lot more than that . Now , Dow has invested $1 billion in saving energy andthey 've made $9 billion so far return on that investment . United Technologies has cut itsenergy intensity 45% in five years . General Electric is in the midst of improving itsenergy productivity 30% to build shareholder value . I think the record-holder so far isthe carpet company interface , which while growing the business and making money hascut its absolute Greenhouse gas emissions by about 72% . So what 's wrong with thispicture ? Nothing . Their shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank , so whilst thepoliticians continued to debate theoretical costs and who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits before their competitors do . The size ofthose profits is rather large . McKenzie put out a supply curve showing how much moneyyou would save or pay as you increase the savings or abatements of Greenhouse gas andthey figured that you could actually by 2030 abate , eliminate about 70% of the normallyprojected emissions of Greenhouse gas in the world and an average cost of just ++-+-+-+-++-4 per tonof CO2 , that 's down in the noise and distinguishable from zero . And the reason is thatthe left side of their curve , there are a lot of negative cost opportunities for mainly energyefficiency that 's cheaper than the fuel it saves , that is its profitable and the area under thatpart of the curve is almost equal to the area under the -- or costly bet at the right whereyou actually have to make an extra expenditure to abate the emissions . Now , the lefthand part of the curve , the energy efficiency part as McKenzie would agree , it does notinclude a lot of newer technologies nor any of the integrative design that we 've beenadvancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get expanding not diminishingreturns to investments in energy efficiency . That is its way to make very large eventenfold of our energy savings cost less than small or no savings . And economist don'tlike to think about that because it makes their economic models explode versusinconvenient and inelegant , but it is what we observed empirically that if you optimize awhole building or factory or vehicle for many benefits rather than just a piece of it forone benefit , you get very large energy savings that are cheaper than small or no savings.And I 'll give a couple of lectures to the course tomorrow , showing some of the examplesof this , but you 'll find many of them at rmi.org/stanford , Standard engineering schoollectures which show how to tunnel through the cost barrier to get expanding returns toefficiency investments in buildings , industry and transport . You know , with our designover thousand buildings this way and $30 billion worth of factories and 29 sectors , various land and sea vehicles , it 's quite consistent . In the factories , for example , we'resaving 30% to 60% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In new factories , we 're getting 40% to 90% savings and the capital cost goesdown for the efficient plant , not up . This leads of course to curious conversations withpeople who have been conditioned by presumably the brain disease they caught inbusiness school to think that efficiency must cost more , so I tell them , yeah , we 'll save , you know 80% or 90% of the energy in your new office building and it will cost about3% to 5% less to build . They say , yeah , what 's the payback ? I 'd say , no , it will cost lessto construct . They say , yeah , but what 's the payback ? I 'd say , what part of cost less tobuild do n't you get ? And this is , of course , well we 're up against in the climatediscussion , the assumption that protecting the climate must cost more than we pay . Sofor -- or we would have done it already in the implicit assumption as that markets areessentially perfect . So if we have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must because the price was n't high enough because if you 're an economist , youtend to interpret the world through the lens of price . Price is merely a form ofinformation . It 's one way to get people 's attention to signal how much something isworth . There are other ways to do that too , but I do n't happen to see the world justthrough the lens of price , interpret behavior just through price or think that behavior canbe influenced only through price . I think higher primates are a lot more complicated thanthat and , you know , good economist do too and we have a superb economist here who Ido n't think would not subscribe to the caricature of you . I just gave you of the wayeconomics is often done but it is quite widespread . And I do n't even think there 's avaccine against it yet , but the corollary of course , is if you believe the reason we haven'tbought energy efficiency as the prices to be at high enough , then you will ask how highwould we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy that much efficiency , youinfer from other people that responded to price changes in the past , these are calledhistoric price elasticity of demand and then you turn the crank on the model and say , howmuch would it harm the economies they reduced GDP if we had that increase in energyprice and then kept the money and did n't give it back to people . And you can getanswers like to 2% to 10% of GDP . On the other hand many of the mainstream modelswill also show negative numbers . It just depends on what assumptions you make and theoutputs are hardwired to the input . You do n't actually need the model to reach thisconclusion.To give you a few numbers on how much efficiency is available and worth buying , in thiscountry , we can save over half the oil and gas at the fifth price of buying more or three-quarters of the electricity at an eighth price of buying more , and we are actually buyingquite a lot of efficiency , for example , in 2006 , a rather healthy year for the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil all went down because energy intensity , energy use per dollar of GDP actually went down more than the economy grew . Thatwas with 26 years of stagnant life vehicle efficiency . It was with rewards in 48 states forselling you more energy , rewards to the utilities for selling more energy and penalizingutilities for cutting your bill , which is just as stupid as it sounds , rewarding the oppositeof what we want . Imagine what would happen if we paid attention ? Maybe we'restarting to pay attention whether for reasons of climate or security or prosperity . Andhow fast would we have to pay attention ? Well , if energy intensity in the worldcontinues to drift down as it has done historically by just 1% a year , then normalprojections , carbon emissions would triple by 2100 and we 'd all be toast . Of course theobjective here is to make toast and not be toast , so if we were to cut energy intensityworldwide 2% a year instead of 1% , then carbon emissions would stabilize , and if wecould cut energy intensity 3% or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theextent that irreversible changes are not already underway . Can we imagine reducingenergy intensity 3% or 4% a year ? Well , actually the U.S. has done that for many , many years , at time of both high and lowprice , and without paying attention . California has been about 1 percentage point fasterthan that , China 1 percentage point faster than that , they cut energy intensity over 5% ayear for a quarter century through 2001 and now they are back on track and acceleratingeven beyond that . I 've named some of the large companies that are cutting their energyintensity 6% to 16% a year , so why should 3% or 4% a year be so hard especiallybecause most of the projected growth is in countries like China and India that arebuilding their infrastructure the first time and it 's a lot easier to build it right than to fix itlater as we have to do . And since everybody I can think of the last 40 years or so whohas done energy efficiency has made money at it , why should this be a costly activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumptions and actually , atRocky Mountain Institute , our focus is re-inventing fire that is road mapping and drivingthe profitable transition from oil and coal to efficiency renewables . We already did theoil part 5 years ago . You 'll find it at oilendgame.com ; it 's a study for the Pentagonwinning the oil endgame which shows in considerable detail how to get the U.S.completely off oil by the 2040s led by business for profit because the average cost ofdoing this is just $15 a barrel in year 2000 dollars . And we 're now about half waythrough doing the similar electricity story looking at an all distributed , all renewable veryefficient electric system that looks like it 's probably going to work better and cost lessthan present arrangements and be a lot more resilient . So more about that in my topicallectures to the class tomorrow . But I want to just end with a little comment about what'sbehind the -- I think important differences of perspectives that we 've just heard sketchedand we 'll get into next in a conversation.At my organization , we are practitioners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do transformation and not incrementalism . And I 'm not all that interestedin tools for allocating scarce resources because our work is around creating abundance bydesign . And of course if you turn scarcity into abundance through radical resourceproductivity , a lot of tensions and problems in the world go away including climate , oilproliferation and a lot of the development problem . But I think there 's also an underlyingdifference between disciplines as nearly as I can tell and I try to study economies and I dospeak it with kind of a physics accent but as far I can tell , for an economist , what isnormally considered empirical evidence is aggregated price elasticities of demand that isnumbers summarizing how large number of people behave in the past under conditionsthat no longer exist in which it 's probably your goal to change as much as possible.Now , I do n't want to be too cynical about it because this is a very useful thing tounderstand and it reflects all the hassles of you know , people who have other things ontheir minds , who have lack of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to devote their lives saving energy , there are a lot moreimportant things to do.On the other hand , while it 's important to understand the 60 or 80 market failures inbuying energy efficiency , for me as a former bench scientist , empirical evidence has to dowith numbers I can measure based on physical observation , becomes in physical units.So , if I can look how much energy it takes to provide a certain level of measurablecomfort in a certain floor space , under certain climate conditions or to turn alumina intoaluminum or pulp into paper or dough into bread or whatever my need is for service likemobility , information or illumination or whatever . That seems to me -- you know what Iwould call empirical and of course , the rap that one will often hear from economist withsome justification is that those who just concentrate on the engineering details of makingthe equipment more efficient technically , will miss the important points about humanbehavior like , how do we actually bust barriers and turn those 60 or 80 market failuresinto business opportunities so people can respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . getting price right is important , but I think there 's more to itthan that and as a practitioner of course , I bump my head against those market failureseveryday , they are very real for me , because I see buildings and factories mis-designed allthe time and try to fix them . Why were they mis-designed ? You have to wonder thisafter awhile . Well , if you pay architects for what they spend and not what they save , youcan expect to spend a lot and not save very much , so economics does work . And if youstart paying them for what they save and not what they spend , it has a very salutary effecton design . If you reward utilities for cutting your bill and not selling you more energy , it 's amazing how much energy they 'll help you save . About half of the states are nowconsidering doing that . So , I think there is indeed a valuable fusion of these twoperspectives , I 'm not saying either one is right or wrong , and perhaps that is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you .

Its so amazing to have a standing room onlycrowd here in San Diego this morning . Its quite an honor to be here with somany friends , so many familiar faces and so many new faces . So were going tohave a great program over the next 2 days . I 'm going to tell you a little bitabout it . First , I would like to extend a special welcome to our guests who arewatching this on Fora.tv , were glad you 're going to join us for the next day anda half . As I mentioned , we have a great program planned for you . I wanted tojust start by sharing a little bit . We 've got a speaker today with us . Shesgoing to talk more about this , from NASA , but I thought it was a really amazingopportunity to see yesterday as we were preparing for this meeting , theconfluence of STEM events that took place . We had the endeavor inching its wayever so slowly towards its final resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of people lining the streets to watch that historicevent and at the same time , we had a man hovering at 40 miles above the earthin a small capsule with a team helping him make a historic journey breaking thespeed of sound as he descended to the earth . Those two events going onsimultaneously really for me brought home the purpose of why were here today toreally talk about STEM . Either of those two events could not have happenwithout STEM , without science , technology , engineering and math . So I thoughtthat was just reallya really interesting and exciting way to launch our event.So I 'm going to tell you a little bit about our program today . We have quite anamazing agenda planned for you . This is the third annual summit for our group , but I wanted to first welcomeactually to thank our host committee , the SanDiego Science Alliance , and if they 're in the room , if they could stand up , Idlike to give them a hand for hosting us . Theyve done an amazing job . Thank you.And I also wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondyear in a row . Chevron is our presenting sponsor . They 're an amazing partner andwe really thank them for their generous sponsorship . We also have sponsors fromJP Morgan Chase , Intel , Raytheon , and the Bechtel Corporation . So we thank themfor their support as well . ApplauseChris Roe : So over the next day and a half , were going to hear from and engagewith cutting edge researchers , leading public officials and organizations , passionate students and leading women that had helped to transform STEMteaching and learning in our State . Two of those legends who have personallyinspired me and countless millions are Dr. Sugata Mitra , who 's going to be ourkeynote speaker this morning and you 're going to be amazed by what he s going totalk about . He s really one of the world leaders in transforming how we thinkabout both formal and informal education , and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who is goingto be with us this afternoon . As you probably know , Kareem is the NBAs all-timeleading scorer and has founded the Skyhook Foundation , which is doing someamazing things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my world ? andin that book , he talks about it taking a bucket brigade to really create aninvention and its really the last person in that line who benefits the mostfrom that group of people who have been filling those buckets passing themforward . And I take that analogy to this room here today . Each of you aremembers of that bucket brigade who have been advancing STEM education . We wantto thank in particular our teachers and school leaders who have really beencarrying heavy loads particularly during this past year and were so pleasedthat many of them are here today . Could we have our school leaders and teachersstand up and be acknowledged ? ApplauseChris Roe : Great . For those of you that are new to STEM education and I knowthere are a lot of new faces here in this room . We welcome you with open arms.Youre going to learn a lot over the next few days . You 're going to meet lots ofnew friends and were here to help you , and please reach out if you see newfaces , say welcome , introduce yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half years ago in our inaugural summit and we consider you to be pioneers inthis statewide movement . If we could go to the next slide , at that inauguralsummit , CSLNet was born . Next slide please . Around a vision that all studentsin our State would have the knowledge and skills necessary for success not onlyin education , but also in their careers and their daily lives . So that 's animportant thing to remember as we spend the next day and a half together , thatthat is a vision that this group collectively established two and a half yearsago . The mission of our organization simply is to help California prepare thenations most capable graduates . That 's a very lofty goal . As you know here inCalifornia , we have some great examples , some wonderful things that arehappening . But we also have long ways to go if were going to fulfill thatmission . So we 've got a lot of work to do . But were here , were excited and wereengaged to get at it . So many of you were also here with us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katehi hosted us for a great conference.We had about 200 people who were at that conference . Together we generated over300 ideas for sparking innovation STEM . We had an amazing group . A lot of thoseideas have actually been put into action over the past year , so were reallyexcited about that . We also know that since that time we met a year ago inDavis , there 's been a lot that 's happened here in the State both positively and alot of challenges that we 've faced . Our schools in colleges continue to facemassive budget cuts . I 'm looking at some of the faces around the room , I knowthat they 've been working extremely hard under extreme conditions and wecontinue to face the threats of even more budget cuts over the next year.CSLNet and the people in this room , our network has responded to cuts , proposedcuts in the area of Science funding . We raise awareness about the need topreserve that funding and rallied support and with the leadership of folks likeassemblywoman , Susan Bonilla who 's with us this morning and the leadership ofour State Superintendent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second year of high school Science . If that had been lost , I seesomebodysyou can go ahead and applaud if you want to for thatApplauseChris Roe : --I think that was really an important moment . We were getting callsfrom all around the country of folks that were concerned , that California wouldhave been potentially the only State in the nation the required effectively 1year of high school Science to graduate , and we could not allow that to happenas a State . So thank you for your help and support as we did that together as anetwork . Today were going to talk about some really exciting things that havebeen happening . Theres been significant progress in advancing theimplementation of the Common Core State Standards and the adoption anddevelopment of Next Generation Science Standards . When we think about thesetogether , we think about these as the framework for the Next Generation ofStandards for STEM . Its really exciting because by doing this , its reallycaused us to hit the reset button and really examine some sacrosanct policies , ranging from the area of standards to assessments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to career technicaleducation and even accountability systems . So we have a lot of work to do andwere going to have some exciting panels that are going to talk about this.Actually we 've got a great panel shaping up this afternoon . Its going to reallydig in to what this means to gather when we look at Common Core and NextGeneration Science Standards and talk about it from the perspective of K-12 , higher education and business and industry , which is going to be reallyexciting . I 'm pleased to report that after these game changing standards havecome in to fuller view that there 's been a number of new pieces of legislationthat have passed and I think Tom and Susan will both probably talk about thatin their comments this morning . But were already beginning to see progress andwere seeing some exciting new things that are happening coming out ofSacramento that will have the ability to really change our education systemhere in our State . Were going to talk a little bit about the focus on jobs aswell . I do n't  know if those of you who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the group change equation in Washington DC.Even though we have 11% ... almost 11% unemployment here in the State ofCalifornia . There are 1.4 open jobs in STEM fields for every job seeker . Sothats amazing when you think about that . Overall there are 5 people chasingevery open job in our State , but in the STEM field specifically , there are 1.4open jobs for every job seeker . So we really need to dig in to why do we havethat mismatch and what can we do differently . And were going to have a panel onTuesday that 's led by Jamai Blivin from Innovate+Educate , that 's really going todig in to that issue more as well . So there are a number of bright spotshowever on the horizon , one of the things that our group has done over the lastyear is work with regional partners around the State . Last year we had , Ibelieve 5 regional networks that were working with and this year were up to 8and ready to announce our 9 . So I would like our regional partners if theycould , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting . Ifthey could all stand up and be recognize because we could not do this withoutyou . So please stand up . ApplauseChris Roe : There are other bright spots as well and I 'm sure Tom will talk aboutthis but student test scores are up . We continue to make incremental progressdespite these massive budget cuts and all the challenges that are facing ourteachers and school leaders . As an organization , were pleased to announce twonew efforts today as well that we believe will set the course back on someState leadership . One is called the Power of Discovery , STEM squared , and thisis focused on providing high quality STEM programming to students during afterschool . So you 're going to hear more about that this afternoon , but were reallyexcited about this effort , and again this is in partnership with a number ofdifferent groups across the State , the notion of collective social impact atwork . The second is focused on transforming STEM teaching and learning throughtechnology in partnership with Google and the Cal State University System andfunded by the 100K intent campaign . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is designed to recruit a hundredthousand new STEM teachers across the United States . So were really excitedabout that new partnership as well . You 'll hear a lot more about these duringworkshops and we 've got an amazing program schedule with lots and lots ofworkshop . So look through your agenda , pick out the ones that you really wantto go and attend because I think were going to have a great time . If we couldgo to the next slide , I want togo back to the last slideI want to talk a littlebit about our beliefs and why were here today . The first of those reallyinvolves equity . We believe very strongly and when this organization wasfounded , that STEM education is really for every student in our State . Its notsomething that 's reserved for a few students or done only at a few selectedschools and we are excited when there are STEM schools and we have some greatones here in the State , but we really do believe that every student should havethe opportunity to have a high quality STEM education . We also believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one group alone . I 'm justcurious in the room ; we 've introduced the K-12 groups . How many people do wehave here from our education ? If you could just raise your hands . Wow , we 've gota lot of people here from our education . Thank you so much for being here . ApplauseChris Roe : And how many representatives do we have from Business and Industryin the room ? ApplauseChris Roe : Good . Thank you . And what about STEM rich institutions like museums , after school programs ? Awesome , thank you . ApplauseChris Roe : And what about non-profit who are working in the space ? ApplauseChris Roe : Wow . So this in that quick review , you can see that there 's almostequal balance between every one of those groups , which I think is reallyexciting . It makes the work fun , and enjoyable . But I will challenge you ifcame with a group to reach out to somebody else from a different stakeholdergroup , a different perspective than you to really share what you 're doing and toget some new ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somemassive changes in front of us and you 're going to hear this from the speakersthat we 've lined up today . We can not afford to just take small incrementalsteps . We really need to change what were doing in significant ways . In termsof success , we believe that STEM is really a key to lifelong learning . We knowthat students are being born today will likely live to see the year 2100 . Youcan think about in our own lives the amount of progress and change that weveseen since I started when I had a typewriter in my high school and whatchildren today are being born with and picking up iPhones and knowing how toswipe and not knowing anything else but how to swipe their iPhone . Thinkingabout those students in the year 2100 , this is a massive change , and again thisis why we believe that STEM education is for every single student . And thenfinally we believe that STEM is an engine for lifelong learning that studentshave these basic skills whether or not they 're going to be a Rocket Scientist oran Engineer , it really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next slide please ? Were going to talk a little bit about how weorganize our work . CSLNet has really 3 overarching strategies . We believe thatits really important to build public understanding and support of STEMeducation . We could see by these events where we had to close registrationearly because we had so much interest and excitement . There is a lot ofexcitement around STEM education in this State , but we still need to helppeople understand what it is , why is it important , and what were doing to tryto make this better . And were doing that by building the field and that 's whyall of you are here today to help us build capacity in your local regions , inyour local schools , and your local districts , and well talk a little bit moreabout that as well . And then finally , strengthening capacity for leadership . Wehave some amazing leaders in this State but unless we work together on thiscommonly , were not going to achieve the results that we want to . If we could goto the next slide please ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its really important that folks understand what STEM is and as agroup , we have talked about this a lot . The STEM task force that Tom and Susanhave been co-convening has talked about this quite a bit . But what do we meanwhen somebody says , Oh you 're doing STEM education . What does that actuallymean ? We like to think about this really in 3 parts . One is really around thepractices and skills that go with Science , Technology , Engineering and Math , and with the Common Core and the Next Generation Science Standards , for thoseof you that are familiar with that , you 'll understand this is a huge shift inreally focusing on these practices around critical thinking , problem solvingand even creativity that associated with the interdisciplinary skills that gowith Science , Technology , Engineering and Math . So those are the base skills , the base concepts , but they need to be applied if were going to connect withstudents in real world contexts . It ca n't be formulas that are just dry , why areyou doing this , were just memorizing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with real world whether that 's a career opportunity , understanding how this is going to be used in their future career , in theircommunity or global issues . Students are very different than we were as kids.When we were 12 , you just memorize its formula and that 's all you needed toknow . So when you take the 3 of those together , and if you could advance theslide to that , you can see an advance again and then one more time , that 's whatwe have as a STEM cable when visual . A student who 's really ready to go out andbe a contributing member of society and be a productive member of ourworkforce . So if we could go to the next slide please ? We know that were onlygoing to do this if we build public support around a certain number of policypriorities as an organization , we 've picked 5 key areas that we really believeare central if were going to make the kind of bold , systemic change that weneed to make in this State and youll hear a lot of about these over the nextcouple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already and you 'll heartons more , we need to continue implementing the Common Core States Standardsand make sure that we actually adopt and implement the Next Generation ScienceStandards . A lot of people are working really , really hard to make sure thatthese standards are the best that they can possibly be , but that together theywill provide a great platform and a great service to our students and teachers.Along with that , huge implications for teacher preparation , teacherprofessional development , and we really need to reform the way that we preparein particular STEM teachers for the future . Accountability systems have been alimiting factor in our State and nationally for STEM education . The extremefocus on Math and English language arts has been somewhat of a determent toSTEM education because its so narrowly defined . I think Tom may talk about somenew legislation that just passed very exciting that will really help open thatup and provide more opportunities and support STEM education . And then wevetalked a little bit about strengthening public , private partnerships . We needto enable those to grow and flourish and be stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our new initiative , we really need to ensure that allstudents have access to high quality STEM programming during after school time.Its an amazing opportunity to work with students to do that . So with that , ifyou could advance to the next slide , I 'm going to introduce my Chief EducationOfficer , Marcella Klein Williams , who 's going to talk a little bit more aboutour theory of change and get the program going . MarcellaMarcella Klein Williams : Thank you . ApplauseMarcella Klein Williams : Thank you so much . I was thinking last night as werepreparing for this is , in this room altogether , we have the deep thinkers andthe committed individuals from throughout the State of California that areaiming to transform education to focus on STEM education to prepare ourchildren for a future that we do n't  know what it will be like . So when we lookat our theory of change , the most important thing that were doing is wereengaging and motivating , that 's what children but that 's certainly with adults.And when I think about who are the educators , who are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're babies andthey first come on to the scene in preschool , all the way throughmatriculation . Its certainly not just the ones like me who hold credentials.Its educators who are at large . Its the educators who are from highereducation . Its our educators from Business and Industry that can share not onlytheir wealth with us but also their wit , their wisdom and their time . And itsall of the folks that you 're representing here in the room , and each of us comeswith our own good ideas . But what I know about good ideas is they get betterwhen they meet another good idea and you 're able to rub those ideas together . SoI hope that you spent some time listening to the wonderful people who are uphere on stage , but more importantly than that , I hope that you talked to thepeople who are at your table and you get to know them as well because althoughwe want the next two days here in San Diego to be wonderful , engaging , andinspiring . These two days do n't  matter . What really matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are you going to connect up with thepeople that you 've met today to really start building that system that ourchildren deserve because here in California it can be argued that we have oneof the strongest STEM economies of the world and we need to have a matchingSTEM Education System to go along with it . And moving to disseminate and equipis as we come together and we have those good ideas . When we disseminate andequip what were saying is we give it a try . We try to bat for the fences . Wesee if itll actually work . And in giving it a try , that assumes something . Itassumes that we have a stomach for failure as well because its going to takecourage and its going to take innovation . And that 's why when I look around theroom , I see not only smart people , but people who have the stomach for it togive it a try and to try those things that were not sure if they 're going towork because the definition of a breakthrough idea , is just basically a crazyidea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August andthoseDavid Seidel will talk about those 7 minutes of terror , we need to havesome minutes of terror here . Is it going to work ? And the swing and swing likewe mean it , and the last thing that were going to be doing in moving thisforward is teaching and learning . In teaching and learning is coming clean , being able to tell each other , Will this work ? And this , do n't  ever do thatagain , I already tried it . And its being able to take a bright spot that 's inone corner of the State of California and not rest and not sleep until itspreads throughout the State of California . So its a caring concern for yourown and for the children that you touched , but its a caring concern for thosechildren who you will impact and you will never have the honor of knowing theirname or meeting them , and that 's who you 're changing today . All of usbut all ofus more importantly , all of us together . So what were going to be creating areSTEM-capable students . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our life that were going to be creating a legacy that we can beproud of , our own children can be proud of us , and the children of Californiathat will lead us into the future . Theyll never know our names , but we were apart of that bucket brigade that lead them to where they get to stand in totheir future . Thank you . ApplauseChris Roe : Thank you Marcella . Well were in for a real treat . What I would calla personal friend , a friend to CSLNet and a friend to every person who caresabout STEM education is our next speaker . He s the elected Chief of Schools forall of California and in that role , Tom Torlakson oversees the education of 6.3million children attending 10,000 schools in 1,100 districts across the State.I think that 's about 1 in 8 students in the United States if I rememberedcorrectly . Every day , Tom applies his experiences as a Science teacher , a highschool coach and State Law Maker to fighting for students and improving ourStates public education system . Nearly 40 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach on eligible schools . He went on to teachtrack and field , coaching with young people and winning a dozen championshipsthroughout the years . So he knows how to get results which is really cool.Spurred by the desire to increase the opportunities for kids to learn andthrive . He went on to politics , rising from the Antioch City Council to theContra Costa Academy Board of Supervisors to the California Legislature now tostatewide office . During his time in the legislature , Tom worked to protect andincrease education funding , improve student health , ensure school safety , cutthe dropout rate , and develop the largest system of after school programs inthe nation , which is pretty impressive and we owe him a huge debt of gratitudefor that . He also authored the Quality Education Improvement Act , or the QEIA , which dedicates millions to our lowest performing schools , and played a keyrole in 1998 proposition 1A , a major source of funding for building andimproving our school . So its my pleasure to welcome State Superintendent TomTorlakson to the summit . ApplauseTom Torlakson : Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good morning.Tom Torlakson : STEM learning network . The team . So pleased to be here and thankyou for your leadership Chris , Marcella and all the learning network team . So Ijust commend these efforts . I was told you would have high energy , positiveenergy , kinetic energy , not just sitting there potential . Were going toactualize , right ? Were going to move it . So it is to keep up with that , youknow , Chris advised that I go for a run , so I did a little biochemistry , getkicked in the endorphins and then had a couple of cups of coffee , which isanother form of chemistry , but Im revved up , are you revved up ? Audience : Yes.Tom Torlakson : Youre going to have a great couple of days here . I know this.And so the work you 're doing and the STEM Learning Network is fantastic , cuttingedge , and where we need to go , and you just saw an outline so well , but a lotof work ahead to be done and that 's why we pull together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way and implementing the Common Core is fantasticand helping in the Science New National Standards , helping with that . Theres anumber of you in this room about 80 altogether convened and Phil LaFontainefrom my staff in CDE and his team helped staff that effort . How many of you arepart of that ? Stand up if you 're part of the 80 that are working on the NationalScience Standards . I know Chris , you 've been part of that effort . Just say thankyou to this group . Thank you . ApplauseTom Torlakson : And what you 're doing to connect the classroom Science , the dayScience to opportunities after school is fabulous and tied in to what our greatmuseums and Exploratoriums have out there for us , it is also fantastic . I callit TEAM . You mentioned my coaching track running days . I call it T-E-A-M , youknow what that stands for ? T-E-A-M , teamTogether Everyone Accomplishes More . Soare you the TEAM to implement a new renaissance in Science education inCalifornia ? The 21st century model , not the old style but the new style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowing who some of you are andhavent had the pleasure working with you . I thought I start off since youreScience , Engineering , Math with some numbers , 7 million , 45 , 2 dozen , 123million , 4700 and I 'll turn this into what I think was about 40 to 50,000smiles . How many of you saw the Endeavor flyover ? How many ? Was that athrilling moment ? And so the numbers there , they say that over this weekend asthe Endeavor went to the California Science Center from LA that about to 40-50thousand line the streets cheering , snapping photos , relishing a moment ahistory that reminds us when we are united and pride and purpose , we can hitthe mighty goals and when we really put our minds to something , we canaccomplish the kind of greatness that was represented by the Space Program andthe Endeavor . So that was a number of ten to thousands of people dazzled bythat final journey and by the way some foundations are helping and we thank allthe foundations who help all the time in these arenas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there , the Endeavor not just going tosit in the museum . People look at her , climb around on her , its going to have acurriculum before the students come and its going to have a curriculum to justtalk about all the interconnections of Physics and Astronomy and Geology andeverything that you could think of that would tie into this . This is part ofAmerican greatness and the numbers are 2 dozen the 2 dozen is atmosphere escapeand reentries , 47 hundred orbits and 123 million miles of travel before itsfinal resting place , and did you know the important role California played ? The Endeavor has big roots right here in California , in our innovative state.The main engines were fabricated in the San Fernando Valley . The heat tileswere invented in Silicon Valley . The fly by wire technology was invented inDowney , and the Endeavor rolled off the assembly line in the Mojave Desertready to fly into history in 1991 . So why bring up these numbers ? Again , because I think the Endeavor story remind us of the heights we can go whenAmericans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it reveals akind of unity again of pride and purpose and when you combine determination andearnest endeavor with scientific innovation , it reveals some of our commonfascination with exploration discovery reaching together for the next greatbreakthroughs in Space Science , in Bioscience , in Medicine , in ComputerScience , in Green Energy and Pollution Control and Clean Up and by the way alot of our young people , those 6.3 million students are in school and theadditional students that are in our universities , they have an altruism andidealism that this taps in to , to look at ways that they can help solve some ofthe problems facing our planet . And so I also had a number 2 and 2 relates tomy grandson and so I 'm a granddad now , Papa T. I havent been call grandpa yetbut Papa T will work right ? So , you know , I say this because when I seeconstant movement , I see constant curiosity , endless inquisitiveness , exploringthe word , this little mind and ball of energy just keep going and going andgoing you 're in for learning and is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this natural innate curiosity and wish to discover and explore theworld and then I look at the students coming back . Seven million student camebackdid the lights just go up ? Energy , positive energy , you see , look at this , you guys , let there be light and there 's a lot of light when about 6.3 millionstudents came back to our K-12 schools in the last few weeks and our universitystudents about almost 3 million in California came back and focusing as it cameback with their own aspirations , their families and teachers bringing togetherhigh hopes and high expectations and believing in the California dream , whichis I think what were standing here for and working towards that dream of abetter life , believing that we can have a better life and greater opportunitythrough what ? STEM education , through education and we know that 's the doorwayto brighter futures . Chris asked me to share just a little bit about myconnection , you know , teaching science , you know , getting back to school arebrought back memorize to me of those first couple of days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the general sophomore Biologyclasses and I had advance classes in Marine Biology and I was privileged to seethis curiosity unleashed in fun ways and so you get the inaudible water youget some mud from the delta of a pond and you check it out and give thestudents microscopes and have them look and see what 's down there and whatsmoving and what 's not moving and how it fits in with , you know , life thephytoplankton , the zooplankton , and the paramecium , and the amoebas and what islife . This whole issue of asking questions and being inquisitive and writing itdown . I even got the skeletons out of the closet . What I did is I had themicroscopes and pond water out there and then I got the skeletons out of thecloset literally . We had a human skeleton , we had the snake skeleton , and therat skeleton and you know , on and skulls from a number of different creaturesand the students got to handle and look and see what was going on and we haddude , do you remember dude ? The rubber man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , I had the students going around and you know , handle theorgan and look at the , you know , what 's the liver do and you know , why is shapedthe way it is and you know , what 's its function . So that was part of getting thekids warmed up and I ask them to observe , write down , draw , share with yourteammates what they see and what they think about what 's going on and whatquestions do they have . So this was fun of course there are no bad questions , all question are good so we encourage that and that 's what you encourage . And ofcourse we had the school garden where we went from the seed were everythingstarts . DNA and hybrids , new ways to make corn and say more productive , gettingto learn about photosynthesis , oxygen and carbon cycles energy and water cyclesand discussion leading to droughts and world hunger and then there were fieldtrips , and by the way , thanks for the foundation to help provide access to themuseums and the field trips . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offield trips , right ? So I was lucky to teach in a title 1 community but just foran example , the campfire discussions , being some of the best after climbinghalf dome or shooting white water rapids in the South Fork or the American . Welook at these kinds of questions around the campfire . Why are the rapids fasterin some areas than others ? How long did it take the river to cut the canyon ? Where did the gold come from that the rapid revealed during centuries oferosion ? How did the ongoing slow collisions of the earths crust form ourmountain ranges ? How long did it take the mountains to rise up and create thetilting slopes and the snow packs that were so full of potential energy thatwould be converted to kinetic energy , hydroelectric power or drinking water andthe environment for the bass and salmon fisheries ? So I had this first handconnection with our STEM learning opportunities and I wanted to say thanksagain to those who have helped in our action plan . So sort of transitioningfrom some of the stories , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum trips , and delta research vessel , type of the trips . Iwanted to focus on the areas where we are working in concert with the goals ofthis STEM Learning Network we also know that we have an imperative to deal withthe need in the economy , which Chris mentioned , and Marcella mentioned . We lookat the number of bachelors degrees in science and engineering as a proportionof our workforce , they fall in to 45th in the nation . California faces ashortage of 1 million collective graduates , college graduates by the year of2025 , and we know that 75% of the fastest growing jobs in the new economy , andeconomy of now and economy in the future are in the STEM fields . So we want tosee and were committed in the Department Education a study growth of collegegraduates in the STEM fields and we want more Scientists and Engineers comingfrom both our high schools and our universities . We have partnership academiesthat are working really well about 503 of them over half of them are STEMrelated students who would otherwise will dropout , get involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so those are the part our action plan tokeep those going . We want to thank Senator Steinberg for his leadership ingetting inaudible which renewed a number of those partnerships and providedadditional funding and also for his legislation , it says let 's look beyond themass scores and English language Art scores and look at a broader target ofwhat we define as success what we define as a right preparation for studentsfor career , for citizenship , smart citizenship and smart voting and for being asmart consumer . How do we make sure that this happens ? And my department willbe involved , I 'll be tasked through this legislation for defining a new targetand I think that we should look at the STEM , what is the school doing in theSTEM area before we round out the API and just based it on what we have in apast in a sort of narrow range . Were also relooking at distinguish school awardprogram and also including STEM in that . Its something we want to honor andreward schools with recognition as distinguish schools , if they have strongSTEM component a couple other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to coordinate STEM activities throughout the department and Iwant my team to stand up Lupita Alcala is here , Phil LaFontaine , the restStacy , Heather , please be recognized . We also have a book , by the which , I 'll justrefer you to , a booklet , we just report it out , Greatness by Design , whichtalks about opportunity to train teachers in STEM and so were needing a hundredthousand new teachers in the next 10 years and we have an opportunity toreorient teaching not only the 21st century approach to learning in general , but also specifically the values of STEM education . We have a blueprint forenvironmental literacy that 's just taking off . Were going to be appointinggroups to that and helping us move that forward . Well be announcing thecoachers in 2-3 weeks . I 'm going to talk about the STEM taskforce in just asecond . We have the education technology taskforce . How many of you have beeninvolved in that ? There are a number of you here . Were aiming to get the one toone computing capacity . Were looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , differentiate learning , get them right tothe area and its not just the old multiple choice test , its more cognitivethinking , critical thinking , problem solving , all the things that Chrisoutlined for us . Were calling that Initiative , no child left offline okay . I dowant to thank Susan Bonilla , wheres Susan ? Our great legislative leader , thereshe is right back there thank you Susan for your leadership . ApplauseTom Torlakson : Susan is a co-convener with me of the STEM taskforce where thepolice where the work in progress is being made . I want to thank Susan Hackwoodfor her cheering and Dr. Broadhurst for his co-chairing that effort . Theyredoing marvelous work and anybody else is on that STEM taskforce , could you juststand up and be recognized . I want to thank you for your leadership in thateffort . ApplauseTom Torlakson : So valiant works going on , we have a number of other componentsto our initiative to bring about a renaissance of STEM education in California.I do have to mention a final set of numbers , 30 , 38 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight up , we need money to do this too . Its great to have thesegreat plans . Its great to have these great corporate and foundation partnersbut we as California need to commit ourselves to invest in education , reinvesting . So I am in favor both 30 and 38 . Ill just put that right outthere . The margin of Californias ready to vote taxes to help education israther thin . So I 'm against splitting the yes vote . I 'm just saying vote for bothand you do n't  get tax-wise if they both passed but you do get the opportunity tomake sure that one of them gets across the finish line . 39 is also a goodproposition . What 's the 20 billion , the number 20 , that 's the amount of money theschools have lost in the last 5 years . 25% of their funding has disappeared , K-12 and higher education . So were facing other 10% cuts , another 5 and a halfbillion if we cant pass these measures in the next few weeks . What does thatmean ? It means a lot more crowded classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts throughout California , 4 weeks will be knocked off ourschool year . So were competing in this global economy . We want to be STEMready , have career ready , students graduating , but we need to vote and go yes , yes . here 's a late-breaking piece of news , we are going to work in collaborationwith this group , another number , its going to be 2013 , November 18 and 19 , towork with the STEM Learning Network and co-convening a major STEM symposium.Were hoping at the 2000 range of participation . Now I 'll wrap up with the SolarSuitcase Story . Any of you heard of the Solar Suitcase Story ? Okay . LagunaCreek High School , Elk Grove District , hard-shell suitcases about this widedepth and its a green partnership academy . One of the ones that DarrellSteinberg helped to get funded through legislation , and you come in and youpoint to the roof , they students installed some of the solar that powers theirclassroom , and then this young lady who was taking me on the tour said , I lovethis . Its hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing hands on .

So how do you that ? Well they put a battery in , they saw plasticsheets to sort of create a framework so it does n't  rattle around and bang aroundand then they put a cord and a light , and then they ship this with two solarpanels to places in the world where there 's no electricity . So in the middle ofthe night , if you 're giving birth , your mortality rate is really high , theinfant mortality rate is very high . And so in Liberia , in Nigeria , India , places in Haiti , these Solar Suitcases go and they 're connected . The sun powersthe battery . The battery is there when there 's a need at night .

Dr. Qayoumi previously served asthe president of CSU East Bay Campus where he was an amazing leader andactually helped found one of our regional partners , the CSU East Bay cradles tocareer network . So were really pleased to have him here to make some briefcomments on behalf of our board . ApplauseDr . Qayoumi : Thank you Chris and good morning everyone . First , on behalf ofCSLNet board of directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thiswonderful conference and to talk a little bit about , briefly about theimportance of STEM and the role that it plays in our economy and the vitalityof our State . Then when you talk about the whole concept of STEM , this is notsomething new . If you look at and go back to the 17th century in Capellas workon the role of liberal education . We go back to trivium and quadrivium , thatswhere we really see the root of STEM education . And also if you look at moderntimes , one of the studies that we all look at is pieces of studies that havelooked at the educational achievements of countries for the last 50 years . Andthe World Bank have always looked at them the number of years of schooling andcountries and correlated that into the economic vitality of those countries . Afew years ago , one of the professors at Hoover Institute in Stanford looked atthose studies and tried to put some quality elements , and what he realized isthat when he was looking at the quality element of those studies , if there wasno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ofyears of schooling in those countries and economic vibrancy , but when he usedthe quality factor that was already the key element and I had the chance totalk to them and I said , what did you use as a element of quality , and he said , basically it was STEM competency . So STEM competency is really what reallymoves every society and what has really been the foundation of moving oureconomies . I think in the US , if you look at the last 50 years that has reallybeen the key that has really moved our economy especially for our great statethat has really been the key . And also if you look at for the next 10 years , 5out of 8 key jobs and our growing jobs will be in the STEM related field and 8out of them , 10 highest paying jobs will be in the STEM related field . This iseven more important for the State of California because despite the fact thatwe have 11% of the workforce for the nation , we have somewhere between 15-18%of the STEM related jobs nationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when you look at college graduates , only 16% of our collegegraduates are in the STEM related field . And especially when you compare tothat to many other countries such as for instance in Korea that will be 38% , France 47% , China 50% , and Singapore 67% , that really shows what kind of majortask we all have in front of us . But even that 15-16% camouflages the fullstory because when you look at the STEM achievement of women , when you look atthe STEM achievement of many of our underserved communities , that data reallyis very concerning and depressing for each and every one of us . So thatssomething that we really have to look at . So because for many aspects , when youlook at STEM education , I think there 's a big quote from Carnegie Foundation , which states , Math and Science are essential components of a liberal education , the backbone of a larger inaudible thinking from earlier childhood throughthe most advance level of learning across academic disciplines . Science , Technology , Engineering and Math enables us to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society andinteractions among all that will determine the future of our planet . So you cansee the role of the STEM education is quite critical . I think as Chrismentioned that its not only the when you talk about STEM is not Science , Technology , Engineering and Math as separate of silos . Its basically theinteraction of all of these , but its not the interaction of all of these aspectbut added skills such as imaginative problem solving , social dexterity , workingout and being able to deal with ambiguity and a sport of that , the whole aspectof innovation of entrepreneurship really becomes a critical element of STEM , and all of us when we look at the magic of Silicon Valley . The magic of SiliconValley is that fusion of STEM competency with innovation entrepreneurship andthats what has really been the secret of Silicon Valley . And I think as we lookat in the future what we really need to just do is to see how we could reallybuild this pipeline for all of this for the future and I think the approachthat inaudible has started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these regional groups which really embodies ourregional stewardship in 3 key areas , how we can build a workforce of ourregions , how we can enhance the economic vibrancy of our regions , and third , how we can build healthy and thriving communities . And I think through thatkind of environment , we can really build not only create through careersbecause our current college graduates , by the time they 're 41 , theyll be goingthrough 10 job changes . So it has to be not only two but through all theircareer overall . So as part of that one the work for college for universities isvery much set and there is a big challenge and first of all , not only how weveto buildand graduate the next generation of high school STEM teachers but alsolook at STEM education as part of an open ecosystem so we can really look anddesign our whole curriculum very differently than what we have done . Really getout of this lecture mode that is so antiquated and nobody learns from and wereally do a good job of boring students , so if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us tremendously and really look at **25;355;TOOLONG basically from the K-12 , the community colleges , universities andindustry are working together . I think through that kind of way , we can reallybuild the workforce of the future for ourselves whether that is in high tech , biotech , clean energy , aerospace , genomics , proteomics , agriculture , personalized medicine , cyber security , big beta and analytics because these arethe key areas that our State needs as we look towards the future . I thinkhaving this gathering is really very important and inaudible and some of uswhen we feel while given all of the challenges of the State can we all make adifference and here 's a quote from inaudible who said , Never underestimate thepower of a small group of people because the only way the chain has actuallyhappened historically has been but a small group of people . So I think all ofus collectively are in that kind of a power . And lastly , I think as we look tothe next two days of this conference , I 'll just give you one problem and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our public officials inSacramento and Washington DC who are STEM savvy , what kind of a State and whatkind of a nation well have ? Thank you . Applause

@@100398242 @4598242/ <h> Lights , Camera(s) , Action : The Right Camera Setup for Your Event <p> When I Love Lucy came on the air in 1951 , most television series were shot using the single-camera format on a sound stage in multiple takes , with a laugh track added in later . However , Desi Arnaz knew that his wife Lucy was a big presence that shined in front of a live studio audience . So he procured one of the first studios that could- accommodate- a large audience . And since filming in front of a live audience is not conducive to the multiple takes of a single-camera set up , Desi worked with cinematographer Karl Freund to perfect the three camera shooting system . Using multiple cameras allowed for the show to be filmed much like a play , with longer takes of chronological action , and capturing- multiple- angles during those long takes . Freud also had to invent a new lighting system that went along with the three camera set up to ensure that the light was consistent across all camera angles . This three-camera format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy to play to the crowd . That three-camera system quickly caught on in the television industry and is used today for most sitcoms that are filmed in front of a live audience , including The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother . The single-camera system is still widely used , too , in sitcoms like The Office and Modern Family . <p> Besides being educational and just plain neat , this brief television history lesson also relates to the question " How many cameras should I use to film my event ? " Much like the factors that led Desi Arnaz to the three-camera format for I Love Lucy , there are several points to consider when deciding on the filming format for your event : What is the set-up of your venue ? How big or small is the stage presence of your speakers ? What is the lighting set-up and how will that look on camera ? To help answer this question , let 's dive into the differences between a single camera shoot and a shoot with two or more cameras for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how many cameras you decide on , a key idea is that video needs to be worth watching . An online video presentation must distinguish itself from a radio interview or a written transcript . By- zooming in and out , expertly panning across the stage , and incorporating multimedia like- PowerPoint- slides , a- professional videographer has the ability to transform your stationary single-camera shoot into a visually dynamic experience . That being said , single-camera shoots are an efficient and cost-effective video solution . The camera is positioned at the optimal location at the venue to capture all of the action , and remains stationary for the entirety of the event . For events with multiple speakers , a single camera may be positioned behind the audience , where it can capture all of the action on stage as well as potential Q&amp;A participants from the audience . As the conversation moves from person to person , the videographer zooms and pans accordingly . This style of shooting works well for sessions with single speakers and without a lot of movement , like a keynote presentation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to a one-camera shoot . For starters , shooting with three cameras gives you many points of focus . The possibilities are endless " in one scenario you can have one camera trained on the moderator , another on the speakers , and a third on-stage camera to capture audience questions and reactions . Shooting the stage from multiple angles gives the post-production crew more material to work with , as they can stitch together various shots and angles , and edit in cutaway and reaction shots to truly achieve a broadcast television sensibility . For a shoot with two or more cameras , a visit to the venue should be scheduled with the videographers before the event to determine the best positions for each camera . For live-streamed events , an on-site director should work directly with the camera crew for smooth , professional , seamless live switching from one camera to the other . So which of these shooting setups is right for your event and your goals ? Here are some questions to think about : <p> How many speakers do you have scheduled for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement , or will the primary speaker be stationary for the most part ? <p> Do you want to capture the speakers or presentation from several angles ? <p> Do you want the ability to capture the audience reaction ? <p> Will one camera capture all of the action in your venue , or does the layout require more than one angle ? <p> If you have a mainly stationary speaker or panel , are comfortable with limited camera angles , and have a venue conducive to a single-camera set-up , then a one camera shoot would be great for you . If you have several speakers who will be moving around , would like to capture several angles of action , or have a difficult venue that requires several vantage points , then a multi-camera shoot would be best .

And wehave had two very interesting and at times passionate debates already , one about the climate changeand the science and politics of climate change and one about newer science and in relation to socialpolicy in politics and responsibility in the legal system.This debate is much broader , and more open ended . It 's titled " What are the barriers to science in the21st century ? " And really , the reason why we decide to put this debate on was for two things . Last yearwe had a great respond to and we asked the question what should we want from science , and it threwup all sorts of interesting issues . And one of the speakers introduced had said " We should wantnothing that is immediate or instrumental . " We should generate quite a good debate but the time wasvery limited . So we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people think of thebarriers to science , but within that mix I sort of fully expected the question about instrumentality tocome up , and indeed only two weeks ago the research councils put down a report about the researchimpacts of science that they fund , which is great , you know they are celebrating the impacts of whatthey fund . But it also made the point that they would be looking at changing the review system forfunding of scientific proposals to include a direct assessment of possible economic benefit . And theyalso said that the people should not be worried that this would narrow the range of research that wouldbe funded . But it was more about making explicit something that already takes place . Through thatalso I had put out a survey , just over two weeks ago , not a particularly scientific survey , it was entirelyself selecting and I pushed out as far more as I could and got as many people 's response I could tofind out what science is to all these question and to just to sort of inform the discussion . One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the figure stayed very much the same from a fairlyearly point , they seem to settle down around fairly consistent figures.85 percent or so of the sciences told that the disinterested pursuit of knowledge without any constraintor external pressure was a desirable thing for society to engage in . But only 50 percent or just over 50percent thought it was realistic . And I thought that was quite interesting as to well , what then are thebarriers to pursuing these desirable aim and why yeah and indeed , that the minority of people whodid n't think it was desirable , what might be the reasons why it would n't be desirable . So that might bea question that we can address in the discussion as well.I have a very eloquent panel . I hope they are eloquent , I think they are eloquent that they are certainlywell qualified to speak . So I am going to introduce them to you . They will now make their openingcomments and we will have a bit of a discussion and plenty time for your questions . We are extremelyhonored to have Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , if not more particularly hisvery prominent role within the House of Commons , Science and Technology Committee , has done alot of very interesting repose and put government I think under a lot of very good pressure on particularissues . And most recently , they you might have seen last week in the papers , they have beenconsulting about abortion and whether you should require two doctors to sign off an abortion . And alsothe debate about that the time limit has come up on how long abortion should be . So they do a greatwork . And so we are delighted to have Evan here.Second to speak would Ruth McKernan on my immediate left . Ruth is Vice President of the externalresearch in Europe at Pfizer the pharmaceutical company . She graduated from the University ofLondon in biochemistry and pharmacology and has a PhD in the mechanism of action of antidepressantdrugs . She has worked at the University of California in San Diego . She has worked previously forMerck , another major pharmaceutical company . And she has recently published her first book fornormal scientists " Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIND awards . So that was Ruth.And then she will be followed by Professor Monica Grady on my far left . Hello , Monica . Monica isProfessor of Planetary in Space Sciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes . She has previouslybeen the head of Meteorites and Cosmic Mineralogy Division in the Department for Mineralogy at theNatural History Museum . She is particularly interested in meteorites , as you might not be surprised tohear after all that , and has written a number of books in relation to that . She also gave the RoyalInstitution Christmas Lectures , " Voyage in Space and Time " in 2003 . And she was formerly a memberof the Particle Physics and Astronomy Council 's Science Committee and is now in the committee ofthe Science Technology and Facilities Research Council which is the sponsor of our science debateshere it the Battle for Ideas . So she will have some insight into what research councils are up to.Finally we have Dr. Bill Durodie on my far right , who is a Senior Lecturer in Risk and CorporateSecurity at Cranfield University . He was previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior Research Fellow in the International Policy at the 5* ResearchAssessment , rated War Studies Group of King 's College and a very good research group that one.Anyway , Bill 's issues of interest to him he has written about widely and spoken about widely , relate to risk and risk consciousness , and also the erosion of expertise , the demoralization of elites , thelimitations of risk management , and the growing demand to engage the public in dialogue anddecision-making in relation to science and I am sure Bill will say things to provoke us all , in ourdebate and discussion . Okay , so without further adieu , Evan would kick us off please ? I will stand . Thank you very much Tony , I am sorry I was late . I have talked on top of the yellow linesand I have n't asked anything else of the sponsors except one glass of wine last night , and half of pulledsandwich . So may be a parking ticket coming your way , and I do n't care if that value for money or not.It 's a factious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Sunday , anyway . I am little bit the reason I amlate is that I had to email that everyone I think well , certainly has all politicians fear getting today , which was because I have been doing some work on supportive research on hybrid embryos and infavor of the right I have helped with assisted dying and in favor of a women trying to chose onabortion , I got the I am a freelance journalists that has been asked by The Daily Mail , to write aboutyour personal life . I got a phone call first , I boot it into email and please please listen now is thetime to confess . And I was desperately trying to find something interesting to say about my personallife , because I fear I am going to die of shame when they find that I have being singularly boring , but ithas been a little stressful today , so I am sorry if I appear little flustered . I hate going first and so myrevenge to the organizes to do little preparation and to have a little rant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do apologize my fellow panelists on this.So what I found firstly I just want to do with this question of where the government stands on this , because we have a government that gives a very mixed picture on its support of science . Certainly interms of funding there has been significant increases in recent years , okay , and talk of doubling . Butdoubling a small number is easier to do than doubling a large number , and without being too partpolitical about the Conservatives the funding of science back in 1997 was not a lot . So to increasethat significantly with a low base , but I think credit has to be given . But in terms of high education , wehave n't seen for that part of the funding , we have n't seen a similar rise and that has created issues.The second thing is one can say what about the support for science ? And once you get beyond thepersonality of David Sainsbury , as I try and do , and look at the issues , again it 's a mixed picture . Thegovernment boasts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrettable failure and therewas a lot of hostility to that based on two sides , the pseudoscience and my own party , which is beingwhipped in to shape much more quickly now , is guilty on that as much as the others . But having failedon that , they then claim to have got a good record . And I am not sure that 's the case . They can sayyes . They on nanotechnology , they beat off the hoards of opponents with that powerful ideas and thatvery clear manifesto , that 's Prince Charles and his grey goo , which I do n't think was high hangingfruit , shall we say , and then they say that they are very big on stem cells because we finally dragoonedthem into passing the therapies of cloning regulations in 2000-2001 ' although again I have to tellyou , it was a struggle to get them to move on that.But if actually you look at even stem cells , the nonsense position that they put out on hybridembryos , that is the idea that yes they were in favor , its okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you would n't be allowed to do that for ethical reasons , the things that weresub human somehow it was not possible this on things that were less than human , that is when youtook a human nucleus and put it into an animal embryo cell and its the the and enucleated animalover . And we took a huge amount of time , two Select Committee reports , a campaign that I wasinvolved with to get to show that the government only had the support of Josephine Quintavalle andand a Catholic Archbishop . And if the government only has them for support on a policy like that , then I thought they could see they were heading for disaster . And we finally got them to change thatpolicy . But it was a struggle.But on other issues , the government says well , it 's not worth having the fight . So when it comes todoing something about the creeping teaching of creationism in schools , not just going to be careful , not just in science lessons , but teaching in religious education , creationism as fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to some people believe this not this is the case . So they have n't evengone there . They have been extremely weak . And when it comes to recognizing that homeopathy , andindeed other unproven things that have medical claims , and I do n't just include complementary andalternative therapies in that , but they are the best examples because they boast about the fact that theyare part of the normal , research driven , proof of efficacy , agenda . They have allowed homeopathyproving which are well I do n't have time to explain it , but they are the opposite the prove to countas evidence of efficacy for the for the purpose of getting MHRA approval , and that 's becausehomeopathy is popular . But to subvert the whole of healthcare product regulation in that way is unacceptable , it 's a disgrace , and it shows I believe I would argue that the government is not as goodas it claims to be on these issues . They wo n't debate that with me . They seem to choose their owngrand and I understand that.Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to what extent should government directresearch research programs and what scientists do ? And I think it 's fair to say and I speak , and Iwill explain this a bit further , that that I think the government does have a valid interest , not just aninterest , a valid interest in directing public funding that it raises from taxes , from unfair taxes in thename , but I am not straying into that for its priorities , okay , our parliament 's priorities or scientist'spriorities . I have long argued and I continue to argue that it 's not their role to judge between what arethe best grant applications to fund . They have to do this very much at arms length following how theentire principle , and set priorities for the research councils who then must be independent . It alsofollows that 's I think is outrageous that government departments when when spending moneydirectly on commissioned research put strings attached in respect of the free publication of the of thescientist doing that research . There is still far too much of that about , they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was clear that they have n't , because whenever you talk to someone who isdoing research in the government , they are they do n't have academical research freedom that wewould understand . And understandably one can say , yes we will agree a publication date . But thegovernment has oppressed publication of research that does n't support the policy . It 's a disgrace and Irefer you to the Science and Technologies Select Committee 's Reports on Evidence Based PolicyMaking that we published last year.One example of this is the urgency that the government wants to give to translational research , even forexample bio medical research , and I have argued and select committees argue , that if they want to dothat they should not do at the expense of basic research or if they do that they have to be transparentand say , we are cutting basic research in order in a short sighted way of my view , to try and pushtranslation . So there is an issue around towards the extent they are entitled to push knowledge transfer.I think they are entitled to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dothat with extra funding and not from the basic research . What I do n't like is research councils decidingthat they are going to give funding for worse research , worse application simply because there is anobvious knowledge transfer application , and reject better research applications because there is noobvious even for basic research even if they are both basic research , because I think that is secondguessing and awards prizes to people who can fantasize about potential knowledge transfer ratherthan have a rigorous , necessary approach.Finally , if I may just have a word about public the role of public consultation , because this is againwhen I have come to those with the government and this and the interesting thing is around again , the question of biomedical research , for example in the regulated area of fertility treatment and embryoresearch , because what the government did and again this is an our Science and Technology Report , how not to do consultations where consultations are not , we identified that consultations in otherwords the sort of thing that Tony just talked about doing , at the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly there is bias in the way you put the question , there is bias in the peoplethat answer , almost it 's not quite as biased as a Focus group , but its not a very good way ofmeasuring it , just genuine opinion polls with large sample sizes , with sensible questions and indeeddeliberative opinion polling is a far better way . What the government did is asked a stupid question in apublic consultation about for example hybrid embryo research , get a write in answer from thecampaign groups and then which is fair enough , that 's what they to do , it 's what they are set up to doand its what I would do if I was doing that sort of thing and but then saying , we are not going toproceed with this because the public do n't support it , when in fact when they were finally persuaded todo proper public opinion , well the public did support it.I could go farther and I 'd say it is interesting to note that the public archive on this yucky thing , likehuman animal hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't keen on taking an organfrom a dead body and then putting into the body of a live person well , it has never been allowed , if hedoes the public their view of organ transplantation . But regardless of whether the government thepublic like it , if it 's legitimate research and parliament has n't banned it , it must go ahead , because wecannot have research priorities set simply by the yuck factor or even or even public opinion directlyeven when it is not based on the yuck factor , even when it is based on serious political or religiousobjections . That 's not an acceptable way of doing research and it 's a continuing struggle , because thelegislation is very clear that the public does not have a veto on research in this way , but it 's acontinuous struggle to get the HFEA to remember that its job is to carry out what poll entrusted to doand not try and win popularity stakes with Daily Mail . We can not allow the Daily Mail to persecute mein this way no , to have a veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back around to the DailyMail , I feel is my work is complete , thank you very much.Okay thanks very much Evan . Now for something different , we have got Ruth please.Okay , I 'll stand up as well and stay with that tradition I am almost going to talk about somethingquite different I feel . I am expecting we are going to hear a lot about education and a lot about moneyfor research and what the government spend and what the government does n't spend up on . Butactually I am I am going to try and persuade you that I think that the barriers designed in 21st centuryare more likely to be cultural , than I either financial or educational . And for me , coming from thepharmaceutical industry , I can see how much this will cost us . And cutting edge science is now veryexpensive and very inter disciplinary . And I think to be really successful , we 've go to the point wherewe have to link science from many different disciplines and really communicate well from one field toanother . And my background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural science or any scientificmagazine I do n't have to stray very far from my field to not to understand what 's written in thosearticles . And you know I certainly struggle with your work , and it 's not easy because we 've becomevery , very specialized . And I think for us to do a really good job in the future , we need to pull togetherideas from different areas and working in silos those or even thinking in silos . I think that 's going to bethe biggest barrier to research in 21st century.So you might think that the pharmaceutical industry is a very mature industry and it 's very applied.And it 's really based on the pursuit of knowledge , things we know about with very tangible eyes . Itcosts $800 million for each new drug that 's launched and we we depend on people from lots ofdifferent disciplines to bring every drug to market , takes on average 16 years to make a drug . So wehave chemists who design the molecules , we have computational scientists who try and marry up newcompounds with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We havebiologists who try and understand the human genome and see by interacting with which parts of genesand their pathways , how can we make better drugs , how can we make better medicines for patients . Itrequires people from lots of different disciplines . And it requires disciplines that overlap . And what wefind hard is actually recruiting people that have knowledge of several different disciplines , it 's very , very hard to find mathematical biologists who can model and what a drug does to the body , how longit 's going to stay around . I am sure some of you will remember that the general incident , actuallymathematical modeling could have predicted the type of toxicities that were seen in that tragic case.So I think in any one area , we ca n't truly predict what scientific advances will be necessary to besuccessful in the future . We could n't do it in the past and I do n't think we are going to be able to do itnow . Who would have thought a few years ago , that understanding the way about distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alzheimer 's disease . In the area Alzheimer'sresearch , fragments of a small peptide called A beta and linked together to make polygon senileplaques and that builds up in the brain , to try and diagnose people with Alzheimer 's disease and to tryand understand what drugs do to that process we need to measure in the blood all of that fragments thatare made and all of the fragments that are circulating in the blood . But there are 1000s and 1000s ofproteins in the blood . And when we separate them in a to a two dimensional array , there are 1000s ofmolecules there . So to see what changes a drug might make or what proteins are present in people withAlzheimer 's disease and not in others is exceptionally difficult . But the sort of technology that 's usedfor identifying distant stars is exactly the same technology that we use for identifying proteins thatchange in the plasma from people from Alzheimer 's disease.We never would have set out looking at distant stars to find a treatment for Alzheimer 's disease , unlessof course if it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quadruple or I would callcooptation , and the reason I say that is we live in a global society . I work for a global company . All thebig pharmaceutical companies and medical research companies , they are all global . We can invest at allas in any part of the world we choose , China or in India Egypt . The UK has a fantastic reputation forinnovative science , and science Sainsbury highlighted this in his report , but I think if we do n't get ouract together , we will see research bleed from the UK in the way that other industries have . The otherand so I think that 's going to be really important . And when I say cooptation , if you do n't know what Imean , you might think about putting a man on the moon . So there was competition between Russia andAmerica but there was great cooperation between different disciplines in America . The physiologiststhat understand what space does to the body , material scientists and the astronomers , the computerscientists at the time , and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation of people fromdifferent disciplines in competition with an outside force.And I recently took my kids to the Kennedy Space Center . And actually I was quite shocked when Isaw the Luna mojo , and if you have n't seen it , it looks like something that is six thong project . Andlike to put together with the excessive use of rubber solution glue and lots of an aluminum foil . Andthat 's not to decry six thong projects . But at the time we thought it was the very limit of what sciencecould do , putting a man on the moon was the most amazing thing . I remember watching it , when I wasat school at the time . I thought it had all been done and yet you know , we could never have thought ofmobile phones or nanotechnology or stem cell research , and these things are so close on horizon . Andeven in my own area of making drugs , we think of drugs as small molecules , but actually they are nowantibodies or cells expressing genes , or modified RNA that controls whole differentiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we need education to underpin the future of science . And as Lord Sainsbury said inhis recent report , Raise to the top on innovation in the UK , a major campaign to improve science , technology , engineering and mathematic teaching in school is needed and who could argue with that.And of course we need adequate funding and I think both blue sky and applied , because we don'tknow , we ca n't predict the value of blue skies until way down the line . And in the same reportSainsbury said , " In today 's global economy investment in science and education is not an intellectualluxury for a developed country , but an economic consumption necessity . But for me money ineducation are hygiene factors . It 's like sanitation and fresh water . We wo n't to develop without them.But to be really successful we need to recognize the globalization of science and industry . We need torecognize , that to make UK PLC leading in science , we need to bridge disciplines effectively and beopen minded to new ideas wherever they come from . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planetary perspective.Okay thank you Tony , and I guess I better stand up as well.Okay , so my field is very different from Ruth 's and my perspective is very different from what Evantalked about into , because he was taking again mainly things that have come up before the SelectCommittee , in terms of stem cell research , genetic modification of food etc , and Ruth has been talkingabout from the pharmaceutical perspective . I come very much from a physical sciences background . Iam a chemist and a geologist . I now work as a planetary scientist . And the research that I I do and thepeople that I work with , very hands on ; we do experiments , we have equipment and we need equipmentand people to carry on doing that research.So what are the barriers that prevent us doing that ? Well , I prefer not to think of them as barriers butmore at hoops that we have to go through or hurdles that we have go through that are put in front ofus by a benevolent government , so what type of shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now justification for research is not a bad thing . I think it 's an excellent thing . For many yearsif you are not careful with a research project , you can keep going down a blind alley and not getanywhere and get yourself you know , dug deeper and deeper and deeper . If you have to key if youhave to come back to write a brunt proposal , if you have to get your project pre-reviewed , then you canbe sure that you are being kept on the straight narrow . Fine ; as long as these things do n't have tohappen too often , or take up too much time . And I think if you talk to any active research scientist andyou say to them , what about writing a grant proposal , they will they will just sigh and throw theirarms up in the air in despair and say " You just waste so much time doing it . You wrote the grantproposal , it goes to review or you review somebody else 's grant proposal and then it has to go to andcommittee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think things will be so much better ifthey said , right here is a pot of money . It 's X , the number of researches are Y. Everybody can have Xover Y , get on with it . And we will be so much you just feel sometimes you would be so much moreproductive , because of this constant requirement for justification.But we do have to justify , because the money comes from the public purse . We have to be able to standup to anybody and justify why we do that research . I think that is I think that is a duty for any activescientists , that they have to be able to justify to a member of public and you know , for the purposes.The member of public might be grandma , it might be your son , you know your niece , whatever , whodoes n't know or understand your field . You have to be able to justify to them what you are doing andwhy it 's important you are doing it , because otherwise the responses well , why is that money beingwasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more money so much morerequirement for hospitals or schools , when there is so much poverty in the world , why are you wastingyour time working on an instrument that 's going to go to Mars , which is what I do.How can you justify wasting your time working on something that 's go in to go and look for life onMars ? Well I have got an example from in a similar way to Ruth and the Alzheimer 's , in that theresearch that I have worked on , well went into building an instrument for a project called Beagle 2 , which you may remember as being a fantastically successful well I am talking till the very lastsecond of its life , a fantastically successful space probe . I am also working with colleagues on aninstrument on a space probe called Rosetta . Beagle 2 went to Mars , Rosetta is going to a comet , hasn'tgot there yet . Now , on both those instruments , on both those space probe there was an instrumentcalled a mass spectrometer . Now in the in a lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizeof a table this high . The mass spectrometers that were made for Rosetta and for Beagle 2 are this big.And what they are doing , in both cases , is they were going to look for carbon dioxide and they weregoing to look for the characteristics of the gases on Mars 's surface , on a comet . That instrument hasbeen the subject of a Translation Award and is being used to develop a field portable instrument to takeout into the field of Africa to test for tuberculosis , all right . So this thing is on its way to a comet , thatcrashed on the surface of Mars is being built now to go out into Africa to test people for TB . At themoment it takes eight weeks to test for TB , to take a sample , get it sent to a lab somewhere else , get theresults back . That is far too long . This gives you a diagnosis within two hours ; much , much less actually.So that 's an example of something that came from a blue sky 's research . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints , because you ca n't do everything and anything you want todo , because there is a limited amount of money . But you can not constrain research too narrowly ; because that assumes you know the answer . And research is n't research if you know the answeralready . So although we say right , you 've got to be aware of possibilities for knowledge exchange , youcertainly have to take opportunities for public outrage . There has to be this opportunity for blue sky'sresearch as well . And so so these the barriers or the hoops or the hurdles are all towards making itmore difficult to do those things that you want to do . Some of them are valid , justifiable . But it justmakes it a tiny bit more difficult for us to do it in the way that we would want to do.Now responding a little bit to what Evan was saying about the government 's record on funding forscience . The government has been absolutely fantastic since 1997 in pouring money into sciencethrough a research infrastructure fund , which has been fantastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the infrastructure that decayed through the previousTory government . But what it has n't done is produce more people to actually use those instruments andpopulate those laboratories . And that is one of the biggest hurdles that we have to overcome in the nextfew years . Ruth made a reference to it , which is the declining number of students who are doing math , sciences , engineering and technology . Right from the youngest school students , right from the sort offour and five year olds , they need excellent teachers who can continue to inspire and carry on thechildren through that period when they you know , really interested in dinosaurs , to get these sullenteenagers over the hoop over the hump of 14 , 15 , 16 ; when they suddenly decide ah , I am notbothered , I ca n't be bothered , I have got one at home , all right , I know what it 's like yeah , it 's blurry -it 's very difficult . So we got to be able to make sure that we have people who can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist teachers , so bring the students , the exciting , dynamic way thatscience can do things , that you can achieve things . You have to have something to inspire children andI think one of the biggest barriers that we have got for science at the moment is the way that science isoften taught in schools . It 's so prescriptive by the time you have got here 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 year olds andreally I think that is where the problem starts to - to set in and that is something that I think we need tolook to in the future . Thank you.Okay . Thanks , Monica . Everyone has covered lots of different things which is great . Bill please.By the way we look and see the fashion has now become to stand so I will stay seated . The if hadbeen asked to give this talk to you five years ago , that 's to what the greatest barriers are to science inthe 21st century , I would probably have suggested that the biggest barriers are one , the demand byactivists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precautionary Principle . In case I don'tknow what that is , essentially it says " Act first , find the evidence later " which is incredibly a dodgyway of approaching science I would suggest . The second thing I would probably have raised is theobsession of governments that science should support the British economy which is been raised in yoursurvey and other way that science becomes instrumentalists . And Evans just reminded me that theobsession with dialogue is also a largely counter productive in science and one dialogue I usually leavethe last words of Henry Ford to when asked said " If I had have asked the public what it was thatthey wanted , they would have asked for a faster horse " . The now it may come as a surprise to you , but the categories I want to nominate as the biggestbarriers to science in the 21st century are firstly , scientists themselves and secondly , science educators.And when I say science educators , I mean that in completely the opposite way , I suspect then thatwhich Monica has just raised . Now I say this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually- originally studied physics in Peru college a long time ago and went along to start a PhD in astronomyat the university of Manchester although I ended up with a PhD in politics instead . But more recently , as a social scientist indeed I found myself defending science progress and reason from those we hadvery little appreciation of it . So what I say , is said you know with a good deal of reflection on thematter . And I think the first thing to say is that scientists and science educators are also members of thepublic and as members of the public they are not immune to some of the dominant cultural trends whatRuth referred to that we see in society today and those include , I would suggest , the degree of socialpessimism and exaggerated perception of risk allow you of human beings and human activity and apursuit of fairly limited objectives.Let me give you three examples of what I mean . In 2004 , a Royal Society study group published adocument called " Making the UK Safer : Detecting And Decontaminating Chemical And BiologicalAgents " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the so called war and terror . And thethe study essentially took a face of value what it described in its introduction as " Growing concernamongst the public as to the possibility of a chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear attack " . Ido n't doubt the qualifications of the scientists who were involved in that study and I do n't doubt that itwas technically rigorous in terms of should that be an incident we will I am afraid this is how weshould go about dealing with it , but I would suggest that it was scientifically unsound and I say thatbecause I was taught that the first job of any scientist is to interrogate the axioms to precisely not takethe world at face value and and to interrogate the appearance of of things . So you would start byasking , well is there really growing concern amongst the public as to the possibility of the chemical andbiological attacks . And even if there is , what does that represent ? Is it due to media hype above thepossibility of chemical and biological attacks or is it due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have very little to do with the possibility of chemical and biological attacks . Andyou should start by explaining that rather than diving in assuming the problem that face value andpublishing report which ironically ends up giving credence to the fact that the public are concernedabout chemical and biological weapons because obviously if the scientists of the world society areinvestigating this , then it is a major issue that the people are worried about . So ironically they ended updriving the public concern that they were suggesting was a problem in the first place.Earlier this month my attention was drawn as I was looking through the BBC website to an articleentitled " game violence study is launched " which I have here in front of anyone interested . This was aa study - essentially to look into the consequences of violent computer games on young children.There have been two paragraphs are quite instructive I will read them out to you " the government isasking for evidence for a new study of the effect of violent games on children . Psychologist TanyaByron will have to study which will also examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are not familiar is famous from little angels and house of tiny terrorists . Now my questionto Tanya and the government is this , if you are just starting to study the effects of such games how doyou know children need protection ? So clearly what you have done is you have assumed the conclusionof the outset and there is an increasing tendency in so called scientific projects nowadays to do that , tostart with a conclusion and then look for confirming evidence . That 's not science even if it 's conductedby people who call themselves scientists and even if there is a winning research team happy to take thegovernments money in order to examine an outlook which shines with their own.My last example appeared in a copy of - since I received fruits standard agency news , however oftenit 's published I presume it 's monthly and I got front page article there entitled agency cause industry toaccount on food colors and we are informed in that after a detailed study industry reps will call tomeeting at the FSI to explain what they were doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insidethe brochure that you read the reports author professor Jim Stevenson from Southampton Universitynoting " we know there are many other influences of work " . So in other words , again a predeterminedagenda has not just influenced how the science was presented but what science was conducted in thefirst place . Now of course there is nothing particularly new to any of that . But the fact that it appears tome to be an increasingly common phenomenon today suggest to me that scientists themselves are notentirely innocent . The problem in part comes from a very shallow empirical view of science that seestruth as being somehow arrived at by summing up and averaging all the possible available data hencethere is a supposed need to listen to every voice across the spectrum including whatever was defined ashidden or unheard voices in scientific debates nowadays usually those of children animals and the planet.Now leaving aside the remarkable ability of some to speak on behalf of the immature , the dumb and theinert - the real problem is that one of the real purposes of science is to exclude particularistic opinionsat every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been value free but it should striveto become so . Next educators , now it 's true that fewer and fewer young people are studying sciencealso at age of 16 , high level physics has declined by 35 percent over 15 year period , undergraduatechemistry has gone down 30 percent over a ten year period and world renowned physics and chemistrydepartments have being closing to the point where some are suggesting would be unable to standsustain any industry let alone explore much farther.The response of leading science educators has being to demand that the curriculum be made more " relevant and accessible " whatever that means . The suggestion in a number of reports beyond 2000 , science education from 14 to 19 in the Robert 's review is that science education should be pitched atthe vast majority who will " consume science rather than produce it " and accordingly the new GCSEfocuses on debates and controversies within science rather than what is caricatured and so would Ithink one fit into this as dry facts . Now , no doubt there is a good many people whowould rather engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by science and begiven free expressions to the limitations of scientific evidence , but without any building blocks , it'sunlikely that any of this will go very far other than to further confuse and concern them.Students have always complained as you I think revealed that science is too hard and irrelevant but theonly thing that 's new today is that we take those views seriously . It 's educators who have lost theirconfidence as to the importance and impact of science . Exploring science as some kind of textualmedia analysis , thus remove the one element essential to a proper understanding which is practicalexperimentation , as we have also seen a growing use of field trails which are open ended , empirical andin conclusive over the use of controlled laboratory experiments which are conceptual , theoretical andrigorous . Children are being sure changed and confused by these developments and there is littleevidence that they lead to any in harm uptakes of science studies at a higher level but again thegovernment did not wait for the evidence before introducing the changes on the GCSE . Science wasnever taught as objective fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a succession of modulesapproximating to the truth but now by representing all of science as a series of negotiable truth , students are simple absorbing the uncertainties of the elites and those who ought to be educating them.Finally because I do n't want to upset too many people , I am not trying to suggest that all scientists orall science educators are fallen into this trap but there is now sufficient to confuse matters and shape aproblematic agenda . It will be the job of scientists and science educators to get that own house in orderbefore complaining about government pressure , activist 's lobbying or publican difference . Thank you .
