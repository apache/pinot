Read more about our vision here . <h> What is Crowdfunding ? <p> Crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals who support a camp by networking and pooling their money to promote an effort . <h> What 's the benefit of Crowdfunding versus traditional methods of fundraising ? <p> In crowdfunding , the crowd always comes before the funds . So the biggest benefit you generate from any crowdfunding campaign ( even if you do n't reach your goal ) is publicity first . For example , one of our first campaigns went viral , and was featured on theHuffPost , the The Daily Mail , The Telegraph , and several other reputable news sources . <p> Additionally , crowdfunding allows you to reach and rally together a large group of people in one place who believe in your cause even before you launch . This grassroots support provides the freedom to not be solely dependent on a bank , a grant , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people , putting less financial pressure on a few individuals . <p> If you are still not sure how crowdfunding can benefit you , email us at info@launchgood.com - feel free to pick our brains ! We will help you figure out whether or not crowdfunding is the best fit for you . <h> What 's the difference between LaunchGood and other crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter , IndieGoGo , and Gofundme ? <p> Vision - We are committed to building a more creative , entrepreneurial and empowered Muslim community . Every campaign on our platform becomes part of creating that vision . <p> Personalized Support - Raising funds can be scary . We provide one-on-one support by coaching you throughout the whole process . From developing your pitch , offering the best perks , to creating a funding strategy , our team has coached over 1000 campaigns , so we know what it 's like to ride the roller coaster ride of a crowdfunding campaign . <p> Supporters Can Cover Fees - On LaunchGood , supporters can choose to cover all fees ( platform and credit card ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . On average , 80% of supporters cover fees to bring total net fees to 2.5% ! <p> Flexibility - Life happens . We can extend your campaign a few days ( especially important if you are doing all-or-nothing funding ) or lower your goal if need be . <p> Offline Donations Count - We understand that not everyone 's online . Sometimes people prefer to hand out a check or some cash . We make it incredibly easy for you to factor in offline donations to your total amount raised . <p> Momentum Building - There is a unique feature in LaunchGood called Community Pages , where you can set up a page for your organization and each time you have a new campaign it is listed within that page . Check out this example from award winning digital artist Peter Gould . <h> Are n't KickStarter and similar platforms better because they have larger networks ? <p> The average campaign on those platforms is just one of thousands that hardly gets noticed .

We are intentionally creating a safe space where your network and supporters can feel welcome , regardless of their religious beliefs . <h> Is LaunchGood Just for Muslims ? <p> Nope ! You can be a Non-Muslim doing work that affects or is of interest to the Muslim community , or you can be a Muslim leading a campaign that benefits a Non-Muslim crowd . One great example is by Andrew Kosorok , a Christian artist building bridges by sculpting the 99 names God in the Islamic tradition ! Another example is the Rebuild With Love campaign that involved a group of Muslim organizations raising funds for churches that were targets of arson . <p> We believe that Muslims have incredible values to share with the rest of the world and LaunchGood is a manifestation of the impact that Muslims can have when they rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims , our platform supports Muslims launching good across the globe , which is not and should never be limited exclusively to the Muslim community . <h> How much does it cost ? <p> Its absolutely free to create a campaign . Once funds are raised , we collect a standard 5% fee on online funds raised . In addition , our credit card processor , Stripe , collects a 3% processing fee on all successful online payments . Supporters also have the option to cover the 8% in fees upon online checkout . <p> If you do n't raise any funds , then we do n't collect any either . That 's because your success is our success . It 's that simple . <h> Can I collect money offline ? <p> Yes , for free ! In addition to displaying a more accurate amount of funds raised , we encourage adding offline donations so that campaign creators can keep offline supporters updated on the progress of their campaigns . <h> How do campaigns receive funds raised ? <p> There are a few ways campaigns can receive funds raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , UK , Canada , and Australia <h> How do I create a campaign ? <h> Can I create a campaign outside of the U.S. ? <p> Yes , but before you do , make sure that your community and network both understand crowdfunding and how it works . Additionally , it 's important that your community has an established culture of giving online or else it might be difficult to secure support . <h> How long does it take for LaunchGood to review a campaign ? <p> It takes our team between 24-48 hours to begin the review process by assigning a Campaign Coach . From there , campaign creators are asked to set up an appointment to discuss best practices for crowdfunding . Depending on the amount of campaigns being submitted , the time it takes to review a can vary . <h> What does the coaching process entail ? <p> Depending on how much work your campaign might need and whether or not it is time-sensitive , the coaching process can vary between a few days to a few weeks . <p> The first step is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch and form an outreach strategy . <p> Next , Campaign Coaches send a recap of the call via e-mail that includes a suggested timeframe of when to launch . <p> Finally , after implementing tips to polish up the pitch and form a campaign strategy , campaign creators can contact their Campaign Coach for official approval . <p> While this process might be longer than anticipated and many campaign creators are looking to launch as soon as possible , we highly advise against rushing through the planning phase . We ask that campaign creators work with us in a timely fashion and trust this time-proven method . <h> What are the guidelines for creating a campaign ? <p> Campaigns must fall under one of the following categories : Arts , Causes , Education , Fashion , Film &amp; Video , Food , Music , Publishing , Technology , and Other . <p> Campaigns ca n't be polemic , sectarian , fraudulent , or violent in nature . <p> We do not run any campaigns where the person or entity receiving funds raised is anonymous to the public . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency assistance funds , we ask that the campaign creator display his/her Facebook profile and publicly vouch on behalf of the individuals he/she is crowdfunding for . If possible , we prefer that the campaign creator partner up with a 501c3 charity or mosque where we can deposit the funds . <p> We periodically ask that any relief campaigns based abroad are done in collaboration with a United States or UK based verified charity . If you have you questions about whether or not your charity qualifies , send a message to info@launchgood.com . <p> This is the established standard for transparency and accountability required for us to protect our supporters , safeguarding against any potential cases of fraud . <h> How does LaunchGood vet campaigns ? <p> The LaunchGood team reviews every single campaign on site to makse sure they follow our general guidelines , and they are transparent and clear ( ie. no anonymous campaign organizers ) . Although the LaunchGood team reviews campaigns , we can not verify all the information that Campaign Organizers supply , nor do we guarantee that the Donations will be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Charity . We assume no responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in accordance with any applicable laws ; such responsibility rests solely with the Campaign Organizer or Charity , as applicable . <p> You , as a Donor , must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of contributing to any Campaign , Campaign Organizer , or Charity . We encourage donors to use their discretion when supporting campaigns . <p> While we have no obligation to verify that the use of any funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and our Terms of Service , we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse of funds raised very seriously . If you have reason to believe that a Campaign Organizer or Charity is not raising or using the funds for their stated purpose , please use alert our team of this potential issue and we will investigate by sending a message to info@launchgood.com . <h> Can I edit my campaign after it 's been submitted for review ? <p> Yes , you can edit your campaign at any time , including after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your campaign . <h> Do you offer all-or-nothing funding or partial funding ? <p> Both . All-or-nothing funding is for campaigns that are unable to move forward without the necessary funds , while partial funding is for campaigns that could use every dollar . <h> What are Community Fundraising Pages ? <p> A community fundraising page is a curated page that makes it easy for team members , supporters , and volunteers to quickly raise funds for your organization or cause . You learn more about themhere and see some cool examples ! <h> Can I create my own Community Page ? <p> All pages have to be approved by the LaunchGood team . Users can contact info@launchgood.com with any inquiries . You 'll hear back within 48 hours ! <h> How can I get my campaign on a homepage banner ? <p> Follow our banner design guidelines hereand send the banner to your Campaign Coach . Please note that all banners must meet a minimum quality standard in order to be approved for the homepage . <h> How does LaunchGood decide on campaigns to promote on the homepage , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our team decides on a weekly basis which campaigns to highlight and promote . We take a variety of factors into consideration , including the storyline behind campaigns , the overall quality of pitches , and how much supporter traction has been gained . <h> Will LaunchGood 's community of users support my campaign ? <p> Although we have a growing community of users , campaign creators can not depend on LaunchGood 's community of users for the success of their campaigns . Typically , one must have friends and family invest first in a campaign , which validates it to outside supporters and encourages them to support . If a campaign creator can not get close friends and family to support , then it might not be a good idea to launch a campaign until it has garnered some initial buy-in . <p> LaunchGood displays certain campaigns in a weekly newsletter and on social media platforms . With that said , LaunchGood has a growing supporter community but it 's hard to predict what they ultimately decide to support . Thus , there are no guarantees that certain funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaunchGoods value is primarily in coaching you throughout the crowdfunding process and helping you set up your campaign in a way that is appealing and engaging to supporters . <h> Does LaunchGood provide supporters with tax receipts ? <p> We currently do not send tax receipts to supporters . If a campaign is associated with a non-profit organization , a tax I 'd will be listed on the campaign page and contributions to such campaigns are tax-deductible . Ultimately , it is the responsibility of the associated non-profit to administer tax receipts to supporters . However , you can always download your list of tax-deductible donations from your user profile . <h> Does LaunchGood provide campaign creators with 1099-K tax forms ? <p> Campaign creators in the U.S. who raise more than $20,000 online from more than 200 donors will receive a 1099-K tax form . If campaign funds are sent to a campaign creator through an automatic transfer , he or she will receive the 1099-K from our payment processor , Stripe . Alternatively , if campaign funds are sent through a manual transfer from LaunchGood , he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving a 1099-K will require providing information such as legal name , residential address , and tax identification numbers . <h> Why ca n't I support a campaign using PayPal ? <p> We currently do n't  offer PayPal as a method for payment because there are certain restrictions concerning the use of PayPal in the crowdfunding industry which can result in freezing users PayPal accounts . <p> Alternatively , supporters can contact campaign creators via email to send funds via PayPal directly to campaign creators , which can then be added as an offline donation for free . <p> For campaign creators , here are some examples of ways to direct supporters to contribute via PayPal : <h> Why is there a credit card processing fee and a platform fee ? <p> The credit card processing fee is set by Stripe , the premier payment processor in the crowdfunding industry . Stripe allows us to process payments more smoothly and pay campaign creators more quickly . <p> While we collect a 5% platform fee to keep our platform sustainable , in part , this allows us to provide campaign creators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , which means more funds are raised for more causes . <h> Do campaign giving levels have to offer any type of perk in return ? <p> Not necessarily . Offering perks in exchange for support is more conducive to pre-sale and entrepreneurial campaigns . But for other types of campaigns , giving levels can be just as effective by highlighting the impact of each contribution . For example , a $10 contribution towards a school can help one student gain access to new materials , a $20 contribution can help two students , etc . <h> What happens if campaign creators do not fulfill perks ? <p> We periodically ask campaign creators to make sure they fulfill promises made in their campaigns . Creators are solely responsible for delivering perks and rewards promised to LaunchGooders . Ultimately , it boils down to a relationship of trust between campaign creators and their supporters . <p> Failure to provide perks to LaunchGooders as promised may result in a various penalties including but not limited to ; reimbursement of LaunchGooders at the campaign 's expense , suspension of accounts and current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have more questions , what should I do ? <p> Ask away ! Reach out to us at info@launchgood.com . We 'd love to hear from LaunchGooders all over the world , whether its about a campaign you would like to crowdfund or just sending your salaams !

PLEASE help us make this DREAM a REALITY for the 4,000 refugees living in Lesvos ! <p> Funds raised will be used to execute and maintain this project . <h> Our Story .... <p> October 28th , 2015 . A day many remember as one of the most tragic nights for refugees trying to cross the sea . It was this Wednesday night in Turkey when Rafats cousin ; along with her four children , her husband , and approximately 300 other Syrian refugees , boarded an overcrowded wooden fishing ship . <p> They were destined for Greece . They were in search of a new life . They were in search of ... life . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shire writes , " you have to understand , that no one puts their children in a boat , unless the water is safer than the land " . <p> Suddenly , with Lesvos lights in sight , the second deck of their wooden ship collapsed . It collapsed down into the first deck leaving a gaping hole that flooding the boat with rushing sea water . <p> Chaos , emergency rescue operations by civilians , fear and confusion followed ; by the end of the night , several dozen people were still unaccounted for Among those missing , was Rafats cousin , two of her children , and her husband . <p> I took on the Rafats ' missing family " case " while search and rescue operations were still taking place . A couple hours after I had begun to search for them , it was announced that operations had now shifted to recovery of the deceased . <p> Two days later , on October 31st , I got the call . The bodies of the toddler and eight-year old had washed ashore . The baby was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken of him The same picture we posted everywhere praying a volunteer had stumbled across them . <p> By the time Rafat made it to the island a few days later , the bodies of the parents had washed ashore as well . Four of his family members had perished trying to reach safety . They say one cant really find closure or grieve the loss of a loved one until after the burial ; Rafat , along with the families of about 70 human beings , would do neither . There was nowhere to bury them . So in a refrigerated truck they lay for three weeks while the municipality figured it out . <p> That is when the volunteering journey for Rafat began . He came to mourn the loss of his loved ones who perished in the sea . He soon found himself on the shores , driven by resolution to help those who still had a chance . The drive was born of his grief . Rafat would use the same rubber dinghies that carried the refugees , only he was riding them out to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On my computer at home in the USA , I used an app called WhatsApp to coordinate between online activists monitoring the boat trips , and the volunteers on the ground performing rescue operations , Rafat among them . <p> I joined Rafat on the coast of Greece in December of 2015 . We pulled in hundreds of boats , with Rafat often swimming out to manually bring in those boats that were disabled safely to shore . <p> In January , the " Angel of Moria Project " baton was passed on to us from another volunteer . The baton carried very heavy responsibility . " Angel of Moria Project " provided cash assistance to the most vulnerable cases ; women traveling alone with children , the elderly and disabled . <p> Policy and rules forbid volunteers of larger NGOs to provide direct financial assistance even to the most needy of refugees . Soon , our phones were constantly ringing with calls from those very volunteers asking us to assist families standard operating procedures had forbid them to assist . <p> Because of this constant and overwhelming need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other independent volunteers In a few short months , this network was able to provide thousands of ferry tickets , thousands of Euros in cash assistance , hundreds of families placed in private accommodations , and send an aid caravan to Edomeni , Greece ! <p> No bureaucracy No delays . Just human beings simply coming together for the sake of humanity . It was thus that Humans 4 Humanity was born . <h> We strive to provide emergency humanitarian relief aid , as well as educational , medical , and womens empowerment programs to refugees that have fled their war-torn countries . 18105 @qwx638105 18106 @qwx638106 18112 @qwx638112 <p> " I wish I would have stayed in Syria/Iraq to die a quick death rather than coming to Lesvos to die slowly every single day . Is THIS the humanity the world claims to hold so dear . PLEASE . Just send me back . " <p> As volunteers , we have heard this far too many times from refugees during distribution of humanitarian aid ... <h> Together , we CAN create the solution . <h> UPDATE : <h> PHASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REFUGEES ! ! ! <p> We are ecstatic to announce that we opened our doors last Thursday , May 11th ! <p> Refugees enjoyed Chicken Shawarma ( meat is not served in the camps ) sandwiches as some " shopped " for clothing and others started stocking their food rations for Ramadan from the supermarket . Kids played soccer and rolled around on the scooters as their parents tailored their garments on the sewing machines . <p> The positive energy and laughter was contagious . We have been in Greece since December 2015 and never experienced the refugees feeling hope and happiness like we have in the center . <p> We are overjoyed by the success of this model ... And are excited to continue to phase two and even more projects that encourage the well-being of the people fleeing their war-torn countries in search of safety . A MASSIVE thank-you to everyone that has contributed and made this vision a reality ... But the work is nowhere near being done ! <h> PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TODAY ! <h> The House of Humanity ... <p> The House of Humanity will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a place that allows them to feel human again , a place that not only provides access to basic humanitarian aid in a dignified manner , but that also affords them the opportunity to engage in educational and vocational activities . <h> A place of survival .

@@73655368 @2355368/ <h> About Us <p> LaunchGood is a global crowdfunding platform to support Muslims Launching good all across the world by helping them raise funds for their campaigns <h> More than Just a Crowdfunding Platform <p> 2,000,000,000 <p> There are nearly 2 billion Muslims in the world - as in 2 million people a thousand times over . That 's a lot of people ! <p> Yet if you look at the most popular businesses , movies , books , etc. , how many come from Muslims ? Sadly few to none . <p> Is it possible that Muslims just are n't capable of being creative &amp; entrepreneurial ? Our history as the founders of algebra , chemistry , coffee , shampoo and much more plainly reject that idea . <p> LaunchGood was started as a community and ecosystem to revive that spirit of creativity and entrepreneurism that elevated Muslims globally for centuries . <p> It is a place to support great ideas in the community and also challenge ourselves to think bigger . It is a network that insists the ummah is still alive in our hearts , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our showroom to the world of all the great things Muslims are capable of . <p> Could a Muslim write the next Harry Potter novel , create the next Lord of the Rings trilogy , or discover the next great vaccine ? We firmly believe so , that 's why we 're here . <p> We invite you to be part of our global community to launch great campaigns , both as a supporter and as a campaign creator . Together , we can change our communities , our countries and the world - one campaign at a time ! <h> A Global Force for Good <p> LaunchGood is in over 20 countries and counting . <h> Our Values <h> Ecosystem for Global Good <p> Everything functions within an ecosystem - good things connect to other good things to create even greater things . Each organism has a place in the system , one thing can not function at its best without the other part.More ? <p> This is how it works : A person in China donates to a campaign in New York to help a survivor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sends her daughter to a good school . Her daughter becomes a doctor who volunteers in Aleppo as there is a dire shortage of medical aid . <p> This is what we aim to be a part of . An everliving loop of goodness . <h> Build for Sustainability <p> We are here to plant trees knowing that we may never get to sit in its shade . Our intention is for this tree to continue growing for generations to come.More ? <p> We view our work with LaunchGood in the same way . While profit is never the only bottom line , to sustain our mission we need to be financially sustainable . <h> Invest in People <p> People are everything . At the core of any idea or movement , are committed people . People who share the same values and are working towards the same thing are likely to reach their goal.More ? <p> The first Muslims grew from one person , to another , to another and finally to over a billion Muslims . One by one we impact a change of good by investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Technology is only an amplifier , people change the world . <h> Muslims are Incredible <p> We believe each campaign on LaunchGood is one chapter in the big global storybook of who Muslims are and what they 're capable of.More ? <p> Too often we are constantly telling others who Muslims are not , that we rarely can tell them who we are . We are proud of our heritage as pioneers , inventors , entrepreneurs and bearers of all things good . The Prophet +++ ++++ ++++ ++++ said , " The believer is like a life-bringing rain , wherever they are , they bring benefit . " We believe in Muslims doing great work that benefits everyone , not just Muslims . <h> Prophetic Inclusiveness <p> LaunchGood is simply here to support Muslims doing great work . We 're not interested in getting into polemical discussions , labels , sects , politics , etc.More ? <p> From a team perspective , we respect differences in opinions and make sure campaign coaches are assigned to campaigns that align with their values . <p> From a campaign standpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creators expression or creativity . We believe in creating a safe space for our community to create , develop , and grow . <p> Campaigns on the site do not represent LaunchGood or the Muslim community as a whole , they 're only one piece of the beautiful , nuanced , and intricate global Muslim community . <h> Everyone 's VIP <p> From campaign creators , to supporters , to even just simple questions from inquiring users , we believe anyone we interact with is VIP.More ? <p> We might handle hundreds of contributions and campaigns a day , but for that supporter , that contribution might be a percentage of their savings that month , and for a campaign creators that might be the one and only campaign they create their whole life and they 're putting all their hopes , passion , and drive to make an idea actually happen . <p> It takes real empathy to believe everyones VIP , but we get to practice it everyday . <h> Emotional Ihsan/Excellence <p> This means taking ownership for your role and giving it your 120% . When you 're invested emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means realizing that what you do will have a ripple effect and taking ownership on what kind of lasting impression you want to create . <h> Be the Giving Hand <p> Offer to take the lead or spearhead a new initiative while realizing you have the whole team backing you . Take the load of your fellow team members back whether they have finals , a new baby on the way , or just investing in their growth by attending a training . <h> It Starts At Home <p> Everyone on our team needs to have been or currently involved in local efforts in their own community.More ? <p> How can we build a strong ecosystem if we have n't started the efforts in our own backyards ? This also means making sure were are amazing family members , supportive siblings , spouses , daughters/sons , and in the service of our families . <h> Grit <p> Its the number one predictable factor for success beyond what resources , skills , or luck anyone has.More ? <p> Grit is perseverance , passion , and determination to achieve long-term goals . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges .

InshaAllah through helping us , may Allah ( SWT ) bless you by helping us seek knowledge for His absolute pleasure . 18108 @qwx638108 <p> This campaign was created in need of help from others . The funds will go directly to cover the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for IlmSummit retreat . Each individuals tuition price is $1575 , so for us two sisters we would need to raise $3150 . IlmSummit is being held in Houston , Texas so inshAllah we would also like to raise another $540 to cover the cost of our plane tickets . Altogether that is $3690 . <p> Learn more about us <p> We are two sisters who have been apart of the Islamic Center of Irvine 's well established youth group program . Alhamdulillah we have been attending since we have moved to Irvine , California ( around 4 years ) . Most of our time at youth group we were attendees and for a little while we were mentors . Attending IlmSummit is our opportunity to gain more knowledge and understanding of our deen so that inshAllah we are able to come back to the Irvine community and help share what we learned through youth programs for sisters . <h> How You Can Help ! <p> Please generously donate any amount that you can . Sharing this page through your social media accounts will also help us greatly . Sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very appreciated . May Allah ( swt ) bless you for helping your fellow sisters in Islam receive an unforgettable opportunity . AMEEN !

He repeatedly attacked our ethnicity and perceived religion , making racist comments . He often called us " dirty Arabs , " " filthy Lebanese , " " Aye-rabs , " and " Mooslems " a fact highlighted by the Tulsa Police Department who also heard these comments from the suspect .

Love you , Khalid . " <p> - Victoria Jabara Williams <h> Official Jabara Family Statement on the Murder of Khalid Jabara <p> # ? Justice4Khalid ? August 15 , 2016On Friday night , our world was shattered when our brother , Khalid Jabara , was murdered on the front porch of our family home . The perpetrator was not unknown to ushe is our neighborsomeone whom we continuously brought to law enforcements attention . He killed our brother while awaiting trial for running over our mother , resulting in a broken shoulder , collapsed lung , broken ankle , broken nose , head trauma , and fractured ribs amongst other injuries . Only 30 minutes prior to my brothers shooting , Khalid called the police stating this man had a gun and that he was scared for what might happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . Minutes later , the suspect murdered our brother with four shots . <p> My family lived in fear of this man and his hatred for years . Yet in May , not even one year after he ran over our mother and despite our repeated protests , he was released from jail with no conditions on his bondno ankle monitor , no drug/alcohol testing , nothing.This suspect had a history of bigotry against our family . He repeatedly attacked our ethnicity and perceived religion , making racist comments . He often called us " dirty Arabs , " " filthy Lebanese , " " Aye-rabs , " and " Mooslems " a fact highlighted by the Tulsa Police Department who also heard these comments from the suspect . The suspects bigotry was not isolated to us alone . He made xenophobic comments about many in our community -- " filthy Mexican " and the " n " word were all part of his hateful approach to anyone from a different background . <p> Today , in our pain , we are also keenly aware that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics . Our brothers death could have been prevented . This man was a known danger . He intentionally tried to kill our mother less than one year ago when he ran her over with his car . Based on his racist comments towards us , he should have been charged with a hate crime then . He should not have been released without monitoring . Yet he was released and put back next door to us , the family he assaulted just months before . This is troubling at any time , but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes . <p> Our brother Khalid was just 37 years old and had his whole life ahead of him . He was a kind spirit , loving brother , uncle and son . Khalids heart was big . He cared for our entire family , our friends and people he did n't  even know . He created every Jabara family joke and filled our lives with love and laughter . All of that has been taken away from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our community .

The Mauritanians were part of the Northwest Africans ( commonly referred to as Moors ) that conquered the Iberian peninsula in the 7th century and established the historic religious and culturally vibrant society known as Al Andalus . <p> The modern nation of Mauritania is an Islamic Republic and it gained political independence from France in 1960 after nearly 6 decades of colonial rule . Mauritania borders Algeria , Western Sahara , Mali , and Senegal and the Western part of the country is geographically situated along the Atlantic Ocean . Mauritania is the 11th largest country in the continent of Africa with regards to land mass and over 90% of the country is located in the Sahara desert . Almost all of the approximately 4 million inhabitants of Mauritania are Muslim and they traditionally adhere to the Maliki Madhab consistent with the majority of Muslim inhabitants of North , West , and Central Africa . Mauritania was largely able to avoid the cultural influence of French Colonial rule due to climate and geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Colonialism in Mauritania was largely limited to the capital city of Nouakchott . As a result of this Mauritania has been able to preserve the classical system of Islamic education to this very day without interruption . This preservation of the classical Islamic education system is one of the reasons why Mauritania has been able to produce some of the world 's most knowledgeable scholars of the Deen . While Mauritania is rich in Islamic tradition and history it is an extremely impoverished nation and over 20% of Mauritanians live on less than $2 USD per day . The overwhelming majority of Mauritanians depend on livestock and agriculture for a livelihood . <h> Significance of Sadaqah <p> We all know the importance that Allah places on giving Sadaqah as it is mentioned over and over in the Qur'an and in prophetic traditions .

Mauritania consistently experiences droughts and water shortages and most villages struggle with sustainable light sources and electricity . For a land so religiously and spiritually rich it is our obligation as an Ummah to try an enrich those in Mauritania that are afflicted with poverty and extreme economic hardship .

In addition to memorizing the entire Quran in two of its recitations , he has studied and mastered some of the most advanced texts in the disciplines of Islamic jurisprudence ( fiqh ) , Arabic grammar ( nahu ) , doctrinal creed ( aqida ) , Prophetic narration ( hadith ) , and the study of the life of the Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him ( seerah ) .

He currently runs the Dar Us Salaam school in Mauritania teaching the Qur'an , Islamic law , and numerous other subjects to children and adults of all ages . Shaykh Salek is also the founder and head of the Foundation for Mauritanian Relief and Development . <h> Brief History and Facts About Mauritania <p> Mauritania ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) <p> The original inhabitants of Mauritania were various Berber and Sub-Saharan African tribes . Arab tribes primarily from Yemen , such as Bani Hassan , settled in Mauritania beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries . Islam quickly spread throughout the country and there began a gradual intermixing of the various ethnic groups in Mauritania . The Mauritanians were part of the Northwest Africans ( commonly referred to as Moors ) that conquered the Iberian peninsula in the 7th century and established the historic religious and culturally vibrant society known as Al Andalus . <p> The modern nation of Mauritania is an Islamic Republic and it gained political independence from France in 1960 after nearly 6 decades of colonial rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senegal and the Western part of the country is geographically situated along the Atlantic Ocean . Mauritania is the 11th largest country in the continent of Africa with regards to land mass and over 90% of the country is located in the Sahara desert . Almost all of the approximately 4 million inhabitants of Mauritania are Muslim and they traditionally adhere to the Maliki Madhab consistent with the majority of Muslim inhabitants of North , West , and Central Africa . Mauritania was largely able to avoid the cultural influence of French Colonial rule due to climate and geography . In fact , the remnants of cultural influence of French Colonialism in Mauritania was largely limited to the capital city of Nouakchott . As a result of this Mauritania has been able to preserve the classical system of Islamic education to this very day without interruption . This preservation of the classical Islamic education system is one of the reasons why Mauritania has been able to produce some of the world 's most knowledgeable scholars of the Deen . While Mauritania is rich in Islamic tradition and history it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on less than $2 USD per day . The overwhelming majority of Mauritanians depend on livestock and agriculture for a livelihood . <h> Significance of Sadaqah <p> We all know the importance that Allah places on giving Sadaqah as it is mentioned over and over in the Qur'an and in prophetic traditions . While Muslims are constantly giving much needed Sadaqah to impoverished and war-torn areas such as Syria , Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , places like Sub-Saharan Africa in general and West Africa in particular often do n't receive the same attention and as a result do n't receive much of our Sadaqah . We seek to change this dynamic so that all areas of the Muslim Ummah receive their due of Sadaqah and we believe Mauritania is the perfect example of an impoverished Muslim nation that needs to be brought to the attention of the believers . Mauritania consistently experiences droughts and water shortages and most villages struggle with sustainable light sources and electricity . For a land so religiously and spiritually rich it is our obligation as an Ummah to try an enrich those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It has been established to provide support and aid for the relief and development of the people of Mauritania and their communities through various charitable initiatives . The first of these initiatives is our appeal for sponsorship of the students at the Dar Us Salaam Mahdara ( traditional Islamic School ) located near the city of Kiffa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it costs roughly $300 USD per year to sponsor a student . The students ' costs include food , clothing , healthcare , and school supplies . Since its establishment Dar Us Salaam has provided free classical Islamic education for students throughout Mauritania , West Africa , and worldwide . Dar Us Salaam was established in 2003 by Shakyh Salek Bin Siddina , one of the top scholars of our time who has taught and trained students from all over the world including many notable people in the United States . Dar Us Salaam was founded with the goal of establishing a place where the transmission of sacred knowledge could take place . Additionally the school provides clothing , food , medicine , and shelter to all of its students . In addition to providing free classical education , Dar Us Salaam also operates as the headquarters for humanitarian relief throughout the region . The school provides free health care , distributes sadaqah and zakat , and also builds houses , irrigation systems and wells . Dar Us Salaam also conducts Udhiyya as well as Aqiqah ceremonies as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students can continue to attend Dar Us Salaam and benefit from the quality classical Islamic education that it offers . We are encouraging everyone that is able to sponsor at least one student for a full year by donating $300 USD , however any charity you are able to give is welcome and greatly appreciated . All donations tax deductible . <h> Biography of Shaykh Salek Bin Siddina <p> Shaykh Salek bin Siddina <p> Shaykh Salek is from Mauritania , West Africa , a country known for producing some of the Muslim world 's most knowledgeable scholars . <p> He studied for over 17 years in the famous mountain region of Taganat , from numerous accomplished scholars including Murabit al-Hajj , one of the greatest scholars of our age . In addition to memorizing the entire Quran in two of its recitations , he has studied and mastered some of the most advanced texts in the disciplines of Islamic jurisprudence ( fiqh ) , Arabic grammar ( nahu ) , doctrinal creed ( aqida ) , Prophetic narration ( hadith ) , and the study of the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . From a family tracing its lineage back to the Prophet , peace be upon him , himself , he is respected and widely regarded amongst his peers as a scholar of the highest caliber . <p> He currently runs the Dar Us Salaam school in Mauritania teaching the Qur'an , Islamic law , and numerous other subjects to children and adults of all ages . <p> Area just behind Dar Us Salaam <h> Significance of giving Zakah and Sadaqah <p> We all know the importance that Allah places on giving Sadaqah as it is mentioned over and over in the Qur'an and in prophetic traditions . Additionally , Zakah is an individual obligation on the believer that has reached the age of maturity and meets the threshold with regards to stored wealth . Mauritania is a blessed land where the Qur'an is recited day and night and where classical Islamic teaching and training has been passed on from generation to generation until this very day . There is n't a time during the the day or night when the Qur'an is not being recited . The skyline is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is indeed a sign from Allah that this land is blessed due to the continuous recitation of the Book of Allah . Dar Us Salaam , like other traditional Mauritanian schools , employs the traditional teaching system which is a highly individualized , one-on-one setting with the instructor going through one subject and one text at a time . In each subject , students memorize the complete texts one by one until the subject is mastered . This rigorous curriculum typically begins with the memorization of Qur'an and continues with the memorization and mastery of the other Islamic Sciences such as Fiqh ( Jurisprudence ) , Aqeedah ( Creed ) , Tazkiah ( Purification ) , Nahwu ( Grammar ) and so on . Donating for this noble cause would be assisting in the preservation of the Deen which is something that is necessary and vital to our Ummah . <p> " Oh Believers , if you Help ( the Religion of ) Allah he will help you and make your feet firm .

Indeed God loves those who act justly . " Quran 60:8 <p> " To you is your religion , and to me is my religion " Quran 109:6 <p> These are just some verses in the Quran which teach Muslims the importance of treating others with respect , giving people space to develop their own ideas , and allowing people to pursue God in their own way .

The Muslims never commenced acts of aggression against others . They never initiated force or violence when propagating the religion .

As a way of keeping our donors updated we 'd like to share with you biographies of two of the many students at Dar us Salaam that directly benefited from these donations and rely on your continued support of the foundation . <p> This is Muhammad . He is 24 years of age and is also known as As'hala Masaleck by the students . His family resides in a city called Nema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) drive from Dar Us Salaam . His village is known for their knowledge . Every village and every heritage are known for something . As I was told by one student , there are villages known for playing guitar , singing , and dancing . May Allah protect us , ameen . <p> I asked him , " Your village is known for knowledge and you travel 600 kilometers to Dar Us Salaam . Why ? " He smiled and laughed and replied " What makes a student of knowledge is his detachment from his family and the hardship he goes through to seek knowledge . He then added , " I wanted to be far away from my family so that I am forced to stay and study . " Muhammad has n't been home to visit his family in 2 years . <p> A huge percentage of the students in Dar Us Salaam are named Muhammad . They usually tend to give the students nicknames as to not be confused by all of the Muhammads . Teachers and students alike will also call them by their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad is being referred to . I find it quite interesting how the Mauritanians acquire nicknames and the unique history behind each one . I asked Muhammad how he got his nickname . He said " I used to study in Geru before arriving to Dar Us Salaam . I had already memorized a couple of lines from As'hala Masaleck ( a high-level Maliki fiqh text ) . When I arrived to Dar Us Salaam , students saw me writing As'hala Masaleck on my lawh ( wooden writing tablet ) and one of them said " There are a lot of Muhammads here so we have to give you a nickname . Would you like to be called As'hala Masaleck or Muhammad Murga ? " Murga is the name of the village where Muhammad 's family lives in Nema . Muhammad preferred to just be call Muhammad , but this request was rejected and the student began to call him As'hala Masaleck . The nickname spread like a wildfire . <p> Geru is a city that is 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) from Dar Us Salaam . As Shaykh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge until the death of scholars and the mass invasion of television and music . These two things ruined the city and it 's no longer a city of knowledge , but a city of business . There are still scholars alive in the city of Geru , but they have no control over the corruption that the city faces . Hamza Yusuf has a video where he speaks about his love for Geru and his sadness and grief for its change . <p> I asked Muhammad how he heard about Dar Us Salaam and he told me that while in Geru , he did n't enjoy the atmosphere of the busy streets and the city feel to it . He asked people if there was a place around where he could study and find much benefit from and one of his friends referred him to Dar Us Salaam . And ever since then , he has n't left , Alhamdulillah . Muhammad is known as being the right-hand student of Shaykh Faqi ( Shaykh Salek 's brother ) . If Shaykh Salek or Shaykh Faqi want something done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.K who were traveling through Mauritania came to visit Shaykh Salek , but intended to only stay for about 10 minutes . In Mauritania , it is custom to slaughter a lamb for guests and have them stay for a couple of hours to eat and relax . Shaykh Salek told Muhammad to slaughter , skin , gut , and butcher a lamb in under 5 minutes . Muhammad said " Of course " and began the process . I 've never seen an animal slaughtered and prepped that quickly ; it was unbelievable . <p> Muhammad is highly respected and feared by the students . If the students do n't listen to him , they will have a very hard time with Shaykh Faqi and could potentially be kicked out of Dar Us Salaam . Shaykh Faqi runs Dar Us Salaam when Shaykh Salek is in America . He has an ijaza in Qur'an from Shaykh Salek and spent 6 years studying in Tuwamarat with Shaykh Murabit al Hajj and Shaykh Hadameen . He spent an additional 6 years studying with Shaykh Salek in Dar Us Salaam . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but people who truly know him say he is the sweetest student they have ever met . I studied and stayed in the same room as Muhammad and I noticed that every student in his room are like his little brothers . He takes care of each and every one of them . He buys them tea , sweets , bread , and milk . When I see him with money , he instantly spends it to feed us . If any of the students in the room misses lunch or dinner , he makes sure they are fed . His schedule is probably the most extreme out of all of the students . I remember conversing with him about the righteous scholars and how they would spend hours and hours studying and never slept much . He said " Asadullah , I do n't like sleep . Last year , every weeknight I only slept for one hour . " I was looking at him like he was insane . How can someone possibly sleep for one hour 5 days out of the week ? His aspirations are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations of any student at Dar Us Salaam . He also works the hardest . May Allah grant him more , ameen . <p> His schedule depends on the season . During the summer , the weather gets so hot that no one can recite during the daylight hours in Ramadan . For the other seasons , he wakes up at 2am and memorizes his lessons . He reviews until 4am and then goes to his room to wake up his fellow roommates . He then begins to review what he had just memorized while making tea . There are a couple of students who he personally teaches so at this time , they come to him with their lessons and recite with him . He then goes and prays fajr , which is around 6am . After fajr , he goes to his room and recites some more until 8am . <p> Around 8am is when students grab their breakfast from Muhammad Lameen 's room . He relaxes a bit and makes another pot of tea for everyone . Muhammad eats his bread and begins reciting until he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawh every morning and begin to write their new lessons , but with Muhammad , he does n't have a schedule when to wash his lawh . He does it whenever he has truly memorized it . <p> After all of that hard work , he takes a nap from 11am until 1-2pm . He then prays dhuhr and eats lunch with his fellow students . Once lunch is finished , he recites until ' asr . Muhammad recites even more after ' asr until 30 minutes before maghrib . At this time , he relaxes a bit and talks with his fellow roommates . After maghrib , he recites until ' isha and then after ' isha , it 's time for him to eat his dinner . He stays up until 11pm or midnight reciting . <p> His schedule is very busy . He is mainly reciting Qur'an . He memorized the whole Qur'an in Warsh and he has finished the text of Rasm . Right now , he is memorizing the whole Qur'an in Qaloon . I really do n't see any other student doing what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last year I was n't as close to Muhammad as I am to him now . I thank Allah for allowing me to be a companion of such a righteous student . I have a feeling that he will soon have his ijaza in Qur'an and be a very good teacher in sha Allah . Before attending Dar Us Salaam , he had already memorized Al Akhdari as well as Ibn Ashr . And while being here at Dar Us Salaam , he has memorized the Qur'an , Rasm , ? ? ? ? ? ? and ? ? ? ? ? ? . If I had to choose one companion in the madrasa , I would choose him due to his love of studying . He encourages you to study harder . He is always ready to help and does n't turn down any questions from students , even if he 's busy with his own lesson . <p> This is Muhammad Lameen . He is 20 years of age and is a student who hasbeen studying at Dar Us Salaam for 3 years . While at Dar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rasm , one volume of Khalil , and Al-Fiyah ibnu Malik . That 's not to mention he has also memorized the texts of Al Akhdari , Ibn Ashr and Al Sharnubi before arriving to Dar Us Salaam . His family resides in Nouakchott , Mauritania which is 600 kilometers ( 373 miles ) from Kiffa . <p> If you ask anyone who has traveled to visit Dar Us Salaam , they will first mention how far and exhausting the car ride is to get to there . But of course there are different opinions between travelers on how long the travel is from Nouakchott to Kiffa . Some say nine hours and others will say twelve . The " Nascar " drivers of Mauritania will say it takes five hours . Though it might seem strange for a parent to leave their child to study at a school that is far away , it is a norm for parents in Mauritania . They may leave their children in a madrasa for years with only short home visits every Ramadan ; even if it is an 18 hour drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one day become great teachers and scholars . <p> I had many experiences where I witnessed the amazing character of Muhammad Lameen . He is known in Dar Us Salaam as " ? ? ? ? " which literally means " director " in English . The students do n't refer to him as being the type of director that creates movies , but rather one who is a boss . He plays a very great role at Dar Us Salaam and his contributions and hard work are appreciated by students and peers alike . Every morning , students come to his room for their breakfast supplies and he distributes 3 cups of sugar ( for tea ) and French bread to them . As he distributes these supplies , you will see students in his room nonchalantly studying and making tea . After he finishes distributing breakfast to all of the students , he begins his studies . <p> Students come to him again around 12pm to pick up rice , beans , lamb , and oil in order to cook lunch for all of the students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in 17 of these rooms take turns cooking . It takes roughly 2 hours and 30min for the meal to be prepared and ready to eat . <p> After distributing supplies for food , Muhammad Lameen rests by taking a nap before dhuhr . He then wakes up to pray dhuhr and then goes to eat lunch with the students . After eating , he studies until asr time . When asr has been prayed , students come to him one last time to pick up food so they can prepare for dinner . They pick up macaroni , beans , and oil . Once this final food distribution is complete , he goes to Sheikh Saleck and reads his new lesson for the day . After his lesson , he is sometimes asked to complete a task for Sheikh Saleck such as watering plants , making tea , or cleaning the bathroom . <p> By the time he finishes , the adhan is called for maghrib . Post-maghrib is a time Muhammad relaxes and converses with fellow students until isha prayer . After isha , he goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that he goes to sleep after dinner , but he instead heads out to the desert by himself and takes his lawh ( wooden tablet ) and studies until 1am . Finally , he calls it a day . <p> If I were to use one word to describe " ? ? ? ? " , that word would be humble . He does not go around bragging to people about all of the texts he has memorized . He also does n't put himself higher than any other student , but rather says " I am just like you , a student seeking knowledge . " I was shocked to hear how many advanced texts he has memorized and studied . I originally assumed he was similar to the average student at Dar Us Salaam , who memorizes Quran and Al Akhdari . His humility blew me away as it is rare to see such a great quality embedded in a 20 year old student . It is truly a great sign for the youth that there 's hope for them .

For the other seasons , he wakes up at 2am and memorizes his lessons . He reviews until 4am and then goes to his room to wake up his fellow roommates . He then begins to review what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of students who he personally teaches so at this time , they come to him with their lessons and recite with him . He then goes and prays fajr , which is around 6am . After fajr , he goes to his room and recites some more until 8am . <p> Around 8am is when students grab their breakfast from Muhammad Lameen 's room . He relaxes a bit and makes another pot of tea for everyone . Muhammad eats his bread and begins reciting until he is ready to wash his lawh . Most students wash their lawh every morning and begin to write their new lessons , but with Muhammad , he does n't have a schedule when to wash his lawh . He does it whenever he has truly memorized it . <p> After all of that hard work , he takes a nap from 11am until 1-2pm . He then prays dhuhr and eats lunch with his fellow students . Once lunch is finished , he recites until ' asr . Muhammad recites even more after ' asr until 30 minutes before maghrib . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow roommates . After maghrib , he recites until ' isha and then after ' isha , it 's time for him to eat his dinner . He stays up until 11pm or midnight reciting . <p> His schedule is very busy . He is mainly reciting Qur'an . He memorized the whole Qur'an in Warsh and he has finished the text of Rasm . Right now , he is memorizing the whole Qur'an in Qaloon . I really do n't see any other student doing what he does , mashaAllah . May Allah grant him more . <p> Last year I was n't as close to Muhammad as I am to him now . I thank Allah for allowing me to be a companion of such a righteous student . I have a feeling that he will soon have his ijaza in Qur'an and be a very good teacher in sha Allah . Before attending Dar Us Salaam , he had already memorized Al Akhdari as well as Ibn Ashr . And while being here at Dar Us Salaam , he has memorized the Qur'an , Rasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? . If I had to choose one companion in the madrasa , I would choose him due to his love of studying . He encourages you to study harder . He is always ready to help and does n't turn down any questions from students , even if he 's busy with his own lesson . <p> This is Muhammad Lameen . He is 20 years of age and is a student who hasbeen studying at Dar Us Salaam for 3 years . While at Dar Us Salaam , he has memorized 40 hizb of Qur'an , rasm , one volume of Khalil , and Al-Fiyah ibnu Malik . That 's not to mention he has also memorized the texts of Al Akhdari , Ibn Ashr and Al Sharnubi before arriving to Dar Us Salaam . His family resides in Nouakchott , Mauritania which is 600 kilometers ( 373 miles ) from Kiffa . <p> If you ask anyone who has traveled to visit Dar Us Salaam , they will first mention how far and exhausting the car ride is to get to there . But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel is from Nouakchott to Kiffa . Some say nine hours and others will say twelve . The " Nascar " drivers of Mauritania will say it takes five hours . Though it might seem strange for a parent to leave their child to study at a school that is far away , it is a norm for parents in Mauritania . They may leave their children in a madrasa for years with only short home visits every Ramadan ; even if it is an 18 hour drive . This is a very key aspect for the students to one day become great teachers and scholars . <p> I had many experiences where I witnessed the amazing character of Muhammad Lameen . He is known in Dar Us Salaam as " ? ? ? ? " which literally means " director " in English . The students do n't refer to him as being the type of director that creates movies , but rather one who is a boss . He plays a very great role at Dar Us Salaam and his contributions and hard work are appreciated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room for their breakfast supplies and he distributes 3 cups of sugar ( for tea ) and French bread to them . As he distributes these supplies , you will see students in his room nonchalantly studying and making tea . After he finishes distributing breakfast to all of the students , he begins his studies . <p> Students come to him again around 12pm to pick up rice , beans , lamb , and oil in order to cook lunch for all of the students . There are about 20 rooms at Dar US Salaam and students in 17 of these rooms take turns cooking . It takes roughly 2 hours and 30min for the meal to be prepared and ready to eat . <p> After distributing supplies for food , Muhammad Lameen rests by taking a nap before dhuhr . He then wakes up to pray dhuhr and then goes to eat lunch with the students . After eating , he studies until asr time . When asr has been prayed , students come to him one last time to pick up food so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and oil . Once this final food distribution is complete , he goes to Sheikh Saleck and reads his new lesson for the day . After his lesson , he is sometimes asked to complete a task for Sheikh Saleck such as watering plants , making tea , or cleaning the bathroom . <p> By the time he finishes , the adhan is called for maghrib . Post-maghrib is a time Muhammad relaxes and converses with fellow students until isha prayer . After isha , he goes to his room and eats his dinner . Most people would think that he goes to sleep after dinner , but he instead heads out to the desert by himself and takes his lawh ( wooden tablet ) and studies until 1am . Finally , he calls it a day . <p> If I were to use one word to describe " ? ? ? ? " , that word would be humble . He does not go around bragging to people about all of the texts he has memorized . He also does n't put himself higher than any other student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a student seeking knowledge . " I was shocked to hear how many advanced texts he has memorized and studied . I originally assumed he was similar to the average student at Dar Us Salaam , who memorizes Quran and Al Akhdari . His humility blew me away as it is rare to see such a great quality embedded in a 20 year old student . It is truly a great sign for the youth that there 's hope for them . May Allah grant us all complete tawfeeq and forgive us for all of our shortcomings . <h> Fund Distribution <p> Funds supporting Dar Us Salaam will be distributed by Shaykh Salek , who directly manages the operations and charitable initiatives . 18103 @qwx638103 <p> Please donate whatever you are able to but we are encouraging those that can afford it to donate a minimum of $300 USD to cover the costs of a single student for an entire year . By Allah 's permission you will receive a reward for whatever you donate . If you are unable to give Sadaqah then you can assist by spreading the word via social media and word of mouth .

Students qualified for the trip by a point system that kept track of their participation in the community with activities such as halaqas , volunteer work , fundraising , social events and interfaith programs . The program turned out to be a huge success , Al-Hamdulillah ! Students were very active in the community and due to the generous donations of community members , we were able to give sponsorships to 9 students .

Using Entrepreneurship To Change The Lives of People With Disabilities . <p> Our non-profit is called EquallyAble and we are the global voice for people with disabilities globally . Our initiative is called #GiveHope1000 . We are creating 1000 small businesses for individuals with disabilities in developing countries . Businesses include tea stalls , book stores , copy centers sewing machines , juice stalls etc. , in the range of $500 per person tailored to their skill sets and abilities . <p> It was n't very long ago we set a goal to raise $500,000 for an initiative that could make change for generations to come . With the assistance of tireless volunteers , we have raised $350,000 through donations and grants . Now we turn to our community through crowd-funding efforts for the home stretch . The goal of the first phase of this crowdfunding effort is $15,000 ! Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life ? <p> Meet Amin - Living in a small village was no fun ; added to this plight was his disabilities which had rendered him unemployed and poor . EquallyAble Foundation partnered with Consumer Protection Counsel ( CPC ) in India and launched its Solar Innovation project six months ago . The sewing machines were distributed to fifteen beneficiaries and draws power from the solar panels installed on roof tops . On average , the beneficiaries were getting Indian Rupees 4000 ( USD 95 ) to 8000 ( USD 190 ) a month , which is roughly Indian Rupees 150 ( USD 3.5 ) to 300 ( USD 7.1 ) a day . The only cost to the beneficiaries is that of the thread , which means that what they earn is their for a lifetime . <p> We want to support local , grassroots efforts that empower individuals with disabilities .

This demographic is equal to the population of Florida and California combined . <p> Individuals with a disability are more likely to be self-employed " a little more than 11% versus 6.5% of individuals with no disability work in their own business , trade or farm . <h> THE PROJECT Unemployment among individuals with disabilities continues to be a major cause of concern . <p> Each small business will cost $500 . Businesses include : tea and vegetable stalls , book stores , copy centers , juice stalls , and sewing machines .

EquallyAble is working with partner organizations to assess the need and resources available . We want to be where we are needed most . Currently , EquallyAble reaches across the globe to other countries to build a greater future for those with disabilities with programs in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Uganda , etc . <h> THE REWARD Starting a business can be a great opportunity for many with disabilities . In addition to meeting career aspirations and goals , owning your own business provides work flexibility and financial stability . <p> Independence and flexibility - Oftentimes , people with disabilities feel trapped by their disabilities .

Many successful small business owners find they enjoy the respect they earn from their peers for having the courage to go out on their own . <p> Financial Stability - When the job market is difficult for individuals with disabilities , they are forced to decide between earning a lower pay or go with no pay at all . Having their own business will help them establish more financial stability . <p> EquallyAble is run exclusively on volunteer time ; all applications undergo verification before any help is provided . Betterment of people with disabilities is rooted deep in the board of trustees and the key volunteers of EquallyAble because they are either living with a disability , have a family member with a disability or are passionate about disability development . <p> Educate someone else about the unemployment issue amongst individuals with disabilities -- If you 're in a position to educate someone else how to better review their employment situation - do it ! <p> Spread the word --You can contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The success of this campaign is directly correlated with the number of people who view this page .

Using Entrepreneurship To Change The Lives of People With Disabilities . <p> Our non-profit is called EquallyAble and we are the global voice for people with disabilities globally . Our initiative is called #GiveHope1000 . We are creating 1000 small businesses for individuals with disabilities in developing countries . Businesses include tea stalls , book stores , copy centers sewing machines , juice stalls etc. , in the range of $500 per person tailored to their skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago we set a goal to raise $500,000 for an initiative that could make change for generations to come . With the assistance of tireless volunteers , we have raised $350,000 through donations and grants . Now we turn to our community through crowd-funding efforts for the home stretch . The goal of the first phase of this crowdfunding effort is $15,000 ! Can we count on your to help us bring these businesses to life ? <p> Meet Amin - Living in a small village was no fun ; added to this plight was his disabilities which had rendered him unemployed and poor . EquallyAble Foundation partnered with Consumer Protection Counsel ( CPC ) in India and launched its Solar Innovation project six months ago . The sewing machines were distributed to fifteen beneficiaries and draws power from the solar panels installed on roof tops . On average , the beneficiaries were getting Indian Rupees 4000 ( USD 95 ) to 8000 ( USD 190 ) a month , which is roughly Indian Rupees 150 ( USD 3.5 ) to 300 ( USD 7.1 ) a day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that what they earn is their for a lifetime . <p> We want to support local , grassroots efforts that empower individuals with disabilities . These efforts will not only improve their standard of living , but will also enhance their social inclusion and integration to restore honor and dignity for the disabled around the world . <p> There are over 1 billion individuals with disabilities around the world . In developing countries , 80% to 90% of persons with disabilities of working age are unemployed . <p> In the US alone , according to a U.S. Census study , 54.4 million Americans , about 1 in 5 U.S. residents has a disability of some extent . This demographic is equal to the population of Florida and California combined . <p> Individuals with a disability are more likely to be self-employed " a little more than 11% versus 6.5% of individuals with no disability work in their own business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disabilities continues to be a major cause of concern . <p> Each small business will cost $500 . Businesses include : tea and vegetable stalls , book stores , copy centers , juice stalls , and sewing machines . GiveHope1000 will help individuals with disabilities find viable businesses that meet three criteria . We believe if we set each business up with these three criteria , they will be set for a long successful career . <p> Simple to operate <p> Match skillset <p> Meets the needs of the local market demand in which they will be operating <p> Where will the #GiveHope1000 be offered ? <p> Because we are a global initiative , businesses will be offered in a number of developing countries . EquallyAble is working with partner organizations to assess the need and resources available . We want to be where we are needed most . Currently , EquallyAble reaches across the globe to other countries to build a greater future for those with disabilities with programs in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Uganda , etc . <h> THE REWARD Starting a business can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to meeting career aspirations and goals , owning your own business provides work flexibility and financial stability . <p> Independence and flexibility - Oftentimes , people with disabilities feel trapped by their disabilities . Having their own business will give them a new sense of freedom . <p> Personal fulfillment - An individual who owns and runs his/her own business can be more satisfied than working for someone else , even more so for a person with a disability who workforce does not cater to his or her needs . Many successful small business owners find they enjoy the respect they earn from their peers for having the courage to go out on their own . <p> Financial Stability - When the job market is difficult for individuals with disabilities , they are forced to decide between earning a lower pay or go with no pay at all . Having their own business will help them establish more financial stability . <p> EquallyAble is run exclusively on volunteer time ; all applications undergo verification before any help is provided .

Over the years we have helped over 10,000 low income , poor and homeless families , elderly and individuals to improve upon their quality of life . During the recent rioting , burning and looting in Baltimore City we provided or partnered with national organizations to provide needed items to over 400 elderly and 350 homeless individuals negatively impacted by the 2015 Baltimore upraising . Throughout our years of service MSSA has received numerous City of Baltimore and State of Maryland awards , recognition and citations for its helping of others with some of the following challenges : eviction prevention , homelessness prevention , job training/referral services , prisoner reentry , food purchases , purchase of diapers , providing hot meals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homelessness . Our organization exists by the will of Allah and is100% donation driven . We need your donations in order to help many more in need and to pay other expenses associated with caring for others , inshaAllah . <h> We are not afraid to bring about positive change to events negatively impacting the Baltimore City community ! <p> The next morning , after the rioting , looting and burning of Baltimore City , MSSA 's representatives were on the streets cleaning up ! <h> For every difficulty there is relief ! <p> The impact of your donations will help bring about a great and positive change in the life of those who are poor and homeless . The donations that you give will provide food , clothing , a warm place to stay , diapers , toilet paper , etc. to those who do not have the means to pay for the above items . <p> Success stories : <p> A man came to one of our resources and services events and had his blood pressure checked .

While receiving free healthcare screening she found out that one of the healthcare providers , at the event , had a healthcare plan based on a sliding scale , the less income one has the less one would have to pay for healthcare insurance . The woman was so happy to hear the news that she could now afford healthcare coverage for herself and her children . <p> Similarly , a man was walking by our event and only had bus fare in his pocket and he was hungry . His choice was to spend the bus fare on food and walk home or take the bus and be hungry .

Amin founded of Muslim Social Services Agency ( MSSA ) . MSSA was first established in 2003 . It is the oldest Muslim social services organization in the State of Maryland and perhaps in America . Over the years we have helped over 10,000 low income , poor and homeless families , elderly and individuals to improve upon their quality of life . During the recent rioting , burning and looting in Baltimore City we provided or partnered with national organizations to provide needed items to over 400 elderly and 350 homeless individuals negatively impacted by the 2015 Baltimore upraising . Throughout our years of service MSSA has received numerous City of Baltimore and State of Maryland awards , recognition and citations for its helping of others with some of the following challenges : eviction prevention , homelessness prevention , job training/referral services , prisoner reentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , blankets and addressing the multiple issues surrounding domestic violence and homelessness . Our organization exists by the will of Allah and is100% donation driven . We need your donations in order to help many more in need and to pay other expenses associated with caring for others , inshaAllah . <h> We are not afraid to bring about positive change to events negatively impacting the Baltimore City community ! <p> The next morning , after the rioting , looting and burning of Baltimore City , MSSA 's representatives were on the streets cleaning up ! <h> For every difficulty there is relief ! <p> The impact of your donations will help bring about a great and positive change in the life of those who are poor and homeless . The donations that you give will provide food , clothing , a warm place to stay , diapers , toilet paper , etc. to those who do not have the means to pay for the above items . <p> Success stories : <p> A man came to one of our resources and services events and had his blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure is dangerously high and we need to get you immediately to a hospital . " The man immediately when to the hospital where he was treated for his life threatening high blood pressure ! <p> A woman and her children came to one of our events to get free healthcare screening for herself and her children , because she could not afford healthcare insurance . While receiving free healthcare screening she found out that one of the healthcare providers , at the event , had a healthcare plan based on a sliding scale , the less income one has the less one would have to pay for healthcare insurance . The woman was so happy to hear the news that she could now afford healthcare coverage for herself and her children . <p> Similarly , a man was walking by our event and only had bus fare in his pocket and he was hungry . His choice was to spend the bus fare on food and walk home or take the bus and be hungry . So , he stop into our event , received free gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus with a full belly ! <h> Help us assist and empower others ! <p> We have a twelve year history of helping and providing for others in need .

MSSA was able to assist her with some of her immediate needs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) agencies that could afford to assist her with her long term and ongoing needs . We thank Allah for the existence and aid that these agencies can afford to provide to all in need . But , it so pained me as a Muslim and Imam that I had to refer her outside of the Muslim community , for the basic help that she needed , inshaAllah . We could not help this Muslim sister because we lacked the funding in order to assist her . Please help MSSA not have to turn another Muslim away from being helped by Muslims !
