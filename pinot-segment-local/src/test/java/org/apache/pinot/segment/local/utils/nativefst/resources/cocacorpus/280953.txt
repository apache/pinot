She will have an easier time focussing on you at these moments , and will look at you with great interest if you sing ' The Hanen Way ' ! <p> During daily routines Sing while changing your babys diaper , dressing or feeding her or going for a walk in the stroller . As daily routines happen regularly , they provide many opportunities for your baby to hear the same song over and over again . This repetition helps your baby learn the song so she can anticipate the words and actions and participate with gestures and sounds . <p> Note : When singing with your baby , watch for signs that your baby has had enough or is getting tired . If your baby starts to fuss , turns her head away , or does n't  look at you , it may not be the best time to sing .

Your baby will enjoy this time of connection with you ! <p> Here are some simple tips to help make singing an enjoyable learning experience for your baby that will promote her communication and social skills : <p> Be face to face - this allows your baby to make eye contact with you and watch your face , and learn from your facial expression , actions , and words . <p> Sing slowly - this helps your baby hear the words and see the actions . <p> Think about how your baby can participate - once a song is familiar , your baby will be able to participate in some way , depending on her age and stage of development : <p> A very young baby ( under 6 months ) might become quiet when you sing , increase her activity ( eg. kick her feet ) , turn her head towards you when you sing , look at you , smile at you , and even start to coo or make noises when you sing . Babies start to imitate facial expressions at a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and trying to copy your facial expression as you sing ! <p> Older babies ( between 6-12 months ) can grasp objects and may enjoy holding and shaking a rattle or , later on , banging on a drum . Older babies also enjoy making sounds back and forth with their caregivers , so your baby may try to " sing " along with you ! Older babies may also try to imitate your facial expression , actions and sounds , or move their bodies to the rhythm . Around 8-9 months of age , babies start to clap their hands , and may enjoy doing this while you sing . <p> Pause and wait - Once you know how your baby might participate during a familiar song , you can help her to do so by pausing and waiting during key moments in the song . A good place to pause and wait is at the end of a line of music . You can pause before you say the last word and see if your baby reacts . For example , when singing " The Eensy Weensy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( " Down came the rain and washed the spider ... ( WAIT ) out " ) . If you wait and look expectantly at your baby , she may look at you and smile or move , or an older baby may try to make a sound or do an action . Remember to give your baby a long time to react and respond at least 10 seconds . If you 've waited a long time and your baby does n't  react , fill in the word/action yourself , with emphasis . Perhaps your baby is n't ready to participate yet , or it could be that the song is n't familiar enough yet to your baby . <p> Help your baby copy your actions Older babies ( between 9-12 months ) who have started to imitate actions may respond well when you take their hands and help them to copy your simple actions during the song . For example , your baby may allow you to take her hands to help her clap during the song once you have demonstrated this yourself .

This repetition helps babies become familiar with the words , sounds , and actions , and anticipate what comes next during the song . <p> Watch carefully for any attempt to communicate - babies attempts at communication can be very subtle and easy to miss . Be sure to watch your babys facial expression , eye gaze , movements , and sounds when you sing . Your baby may be trying to participate in her own way . Interpret anything your baby does during the song as communicative . For example , if your baby turns away , this may mean she does n't  want to sing anymore .

You can use your babys name in the song and names of other important people in your babys life . Or sing about things that happen during your babys day . <p> Choose meaningful , useful words .

So repeat key lyrics and keep the number of words to a minimum . <p> Add simple actions or movements to the song . <p> You may want to add sound effects or " fun words " to the song , if appropriate . These sounds and words will catch your babys attention . Examples include : animal sounds such as " quack quack " or " moo " , vehicle sounds such as " vrooooomm " or " beep beep " , other sounds and fun words such as " achoooo ! " , " wheee ! " , " boo !

These comments are not surprising when considering the body of research on which the It Takes Two to Talk Program was based , as well as the individual studies conducted on the It Takes Two to Talk Program itself . <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program has been proven to work ! <p> Read further to learn about : <p> The research upon which the It Takes Two to Talk Program is based ; <p> Studies on the It Takes Two to Talk Program that show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principles on which the It Takes Two to Talk Program is Based <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program is based on some well-researched principles of intervention : <h> GPutting the family front and centre <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program is a family-centred program , in which parents are involved in their childs intervention in ways that strengthen their ability to help their child . Parents learn what to do to help their child learn and develop , and the earlier parents are involved in their childs intervention , the better the childs outcome . <h> GTherapy is part of everyday family life <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program makes use of everyday activities and interactions within a familys life . When children learn to communicate in their natural environment in real-life situations with their caregivers , they are more motivated to communicate and are better able to apply their newly-learned skills to other situations . <h> GLearning to communicate takes place within parent-child interactions <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program is based on the view that it is the interaction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language learning . <p> This theory is based on the belief that childrens language learning is fostered when the adult : <p> Is very responsive to the childs communication efforts ; and <p> Simplifies and fine-tunes what she says to the child so that the child can understand and learn from it . <h> GBeing responsive to the child is the key <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program teaches parents to be responsive to their child . Being responsive means : <p> Responding promptly ( often within 1-2 seconds of a child doing or saying something ) <p> Responding positively responding in a way that shows the child the parent is really interested in what she or he is saying <p> Sticking with what the child is " talking " about and not trying to get him interested in something else ( e.g. , if the child is showing the parent how he can drive his toy car along the kitchen floor , the parent then talks about what he is doing with the car , not the colour of the car or about the toy train ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their children , the children demonstrate : <p> Greater understanding of language at one year <p> More advanced speech and vocabulary development and understanding of language in the second and third year of life <p> Larger receptive vocabulary ( understanding of words ) at age 12 <h> GIn summary <p> The approach parents learn in the It Takes Two to Talk Program is based on overwhelming evidence that it is the parent-child interaction that provides the context for the childs language learning and that , when parents are more responsive and fine tune how they talk with their child , childrens communication development is accelerated . <h> Evidence for the It Takes Two to Talk Program <p> Three studies have been conducted on the It Takes Two to Talk Program itself . All three studies involved preschool children ( under age 4 ) and their mothers , who participated in an It Takes Two to Talk program . The behaviour of these mothers and children was compared to groups of mothers and children who were on a waiting list for the It Takes Two to Talk Program ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study #2 , the following results were found for the mothers and children participating in the It Takes Two to Talk Program ( vs mothers and children in the control group , who were not involved in the It Takes Two to Talk Program ) : <p> Mothers became more responsive <p> The children were more assertive , responsive and able to take more turns ( both verbally and non-verbally ) <p> Mother-child interactions were more balanced , frequent and lasted longer <p> Parents reported improved family relationships <p> These results showed that the It Takes Two to Talk Program enabled mothers and children to connect and communicate better , providing the children with many more opportunities to learn within these everyday interactions and conversations . <p> Study #3 focused on children aged 23-33 months , who had severely delayed language development . The children could say very few single words and most did not use any two-word phrases . <h> Inclusion of " target " words <p> This It Takes Two to Talk Program was the same as previous programs , but had a heightened focus on giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child . These words were selected by the speech-language pathologist and researchers based on the childs interests , stage of development and included those with sounds the child could already make . For example , if the child was heard to use the sound " buh , " the words " ball " and " bang " might be selected if those were considered to be motivating for him to say . <p> In addition to learning all the responsive strategies , the mothers learned to use these " target " words repetitively during everyday interactions with their child , and to set up routines in which the words could be used again and again . The children were never asked to say the word . <h> Results <p> When compared with mothers and children in the control group , who were not involved in the It Takes Two to Talk Program , the mothers and children who participated in the It Takes Two to Talk Program demonstrated the following changes : <p> The It Takes Two to Talk Program " kickstarted " the childrens language development , enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted " and to start combining words into sentences .

Observe silently , really watching to see what she is doing with the playdough . Often , children do n't  begin with an idea of what to do with the playdough . They manipulate it and when it starts to look like something they recognize , they may then start to turn it into something specific . To give your child time to come up with her own ideas , just observe without speaking , suggesting or instructing her . <p> Wait sit quietly and avoid showing your child things she could do with the playdough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your goal is to give your child an opportunity to do what SHE wants to do FIRST . <p> Listen to what she says , without interrupting . If she says something , respond and show interest , but avoid telling her what to do or try not to ask questions that test , such as " What are you doing ? " , or " What are you making ? " She probably does n't  know yet - she 's still experimenting ! <p> Once your child has started to show some direction as to what she wants to do with the playdough , then Join in and Play , which means : <p> Use your own materials ( rather than taking or trying to share your childs ) <p> Observe your child and look interested , without speaking <p> Once she says or does something , then follow her lead - build on what she has said or done by commenting on it and adding something to her actions and ideas , without taking over the play and telling her what to do . <p> For example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stick and says , " I have a lollipop " , you can say , " That looks delicious . I think I 'm going to make an ice cream " and then make an ice cream from your playdough and wait for her to respond again . <p> Play like a kid play how your child is playing . Preschoolers usually use playdough to create pretend events , so pretend along with her , as described below . <h> Encourage pretending <p> Your preschooler will probably start to pretend with the playdough . We want to encourage pretending as it builds more complex language skills . She may turn the playdough into a person , animal , food , vehicle , etc . This shows that she is able to use one thing as a symbol for another e.g. a long roll of playdough becomes a snake . Pretending by using one thing to represent another is an important part of language and cognitive development . After all , a word is a symbol that represents something else . <p> If your child : <p> Rolls playdough into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea . For example , make a snake noise " ssss " and talk as if you are a snake ( " I am Sammy the snake and I am coming to see what 's for lunch " ) . <p> Rolls her playdough into a ball and sticks it on her nose , saying " I am a clown " . You can do the same thing and then observe , wait and listen to see what you child thinks of that . Or you can add another idea related to clowns , such as making some playdough balls and juggling with them , saying , " Clowns like to juggle . Let me try juggling the balls " . <p> Pushes the stir sticks into a round ball of playdough and says , " This is an elephant " . You can add a new , but related idea . For example , you can make something related to the theme of elephants , such as using a book to create a mountain for the elephant to walk up , or making a playdough tree with branches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Play and Follow your Childs Lead , you are building on what your child has started and adding a fun idea .

@@100393746 @4593746/ <h> Starting early : Why its so important <p> Youve probably heard that the early years of your childs life are the most important for building strong language skills . That 's because your childs brain is developing extremely fast during this time , and he s more open to learning and more receptive to enriching experiences than he will ever be . <p> From birth to 5 years of age , children learn language by participating in back-and-forth interactions with the important adults in their lives . When a child sends a message , whether it be with a gesture , a sound , or a word , his parents ' responses serve as helpful feedback that reinforce and encourage his learning . This responsive feedback is an essential ingredient in the language-learning process for every child . <p> But if a child is communicating less than others his age , he s unlikely to receive as much of this essential feedback . Because he is n't talking , adults naturally communicate with him less , so he does n't  get the helpful input he needs to build his language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant participate fully during activities and conversations , they may fall even further behind if they are not provided with the help they need . <p> This is why its so important not to wait if you see any sign that you childs communication development may be delayed . Some parents are advised that their child will likely " grow out of it " , and they simply wait for the child to catch up . But a " wait and see " approach means that precious time can be lost during this critical learning phase . <p> On the other hand , if a child with a delay receives extra support from the important adults in his life , he can make significant gains . Early language intervention is critically important for these children to develop the communication skills necessary for future success in their academic and personal lives . <p> Simply put , the earlier a child receives the help he needs , the better his language outcome will be . <h> Knowing when to be concerned <p> To ensure that your child receives the help he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of language delay .

@@100393754 @4593754/ <h> How to Sing with Toddlers The Hanen Way ' <p> The power of music is undeniable . Music can soothe and calm , it can distract children during stressful or difficult moments , and it can also be exciting and stimulating and make kids want to dance ! Toddlers ( aged 1-3 years ) enjoy music in a variety of ways , including moving to the rhythm , dancing , beating a drum , doing some of the actions , and even singing the words of familiar songs . <p> Singing with your child the ' Hanen Way ' means : <p> Building in opportunities for your child to participate during the song . <p> Using repetition to help your child learn new words . <p> Singing the " Hanen Way " encourages your toddlers social , cognitive , and communication development while the two of you connect and have fun together ! <h> Tips for singing with your toddler <h> When to Sing <p> Any time is a good time to sing with your toddler ! There may be certain times when you routinely sing with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve movement ( such as Ring Around the Rosie ) might be more appropriate during the day . <p> Another good time to sing is during daily routines , such as when washing your childs hands ( as in the example above ) . As daily routines happen regularly , they provide many opportunities for your toddler to hear the lyrics over and over again . Examples of other daily routines include diaper changing/going potty , getting dressed , getting in the car , cleaning up the toys , and putting on shoes . Singing during routines can also make a less desirable routine more enjoyable for a child who is resisting the routine . <h> How to Sing <p> It does n't  matter what you sing or whether or not you can even carry a tune your toddler will enjoy this time connecting with you ! <p> Here are some simple tips to help make singing a learning experience for your toddler that will promote his communication and social skills : <p> Sing about what catches your childs interest Whether its a " made-up " song or a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that encourages your child to participate with you . <p> Be face to face This allows your child to make eye contact with you , and learn from your facial expression , actions , and words . <p> Create opportunities for your child to participate This will depend on your childs age , stage of development , and interests . He could bang on a drum ( or bang a wooden spoon on a kitchen pot ! ) . He might enjoy doing some of the actions during the song . Or he may try to sing a few key words during the song . As children approach their third birthday , they will likely be able to sing many or all of the words of favourite , familiar songs . <p> Pause and wait Once you know how your child might participate during the song , you can help him to do so by pausing and waiting during key moments in the song . A good place to pause and wait is at the end of the line of music . You can pause before you say the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , when singing " Twinkle Twinkle Little Star " , you might pause before saying " are " ( " how I wonder what you ..... " ) . If you wait and look expectantly at your child , he may try to say " are " . If not , you can fill it in for him after you have waited a long time . Maybe hell try next time . <p> Help your toddler perform the actions in the song If he cant do it on his own , help your child do the actions in a song . You can take your childs hands and help him do an action . However , if your child resists this or does n't  enjoy it , do the action yourself and let your child participate in his own way . <p> Substitute For children who can sing many of the words in a song , try substituting a silly or different word in the song to catch your childs attention . For example , you could sing " Old MacDonald had a zoo ... " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of different zoo animals to insert in the song ( eg. " and at his zoo he had a zebra ... " ) . <p> Repeat the song Do n't  be afraid to sing a song over and over again , if this is what your child wants . Young children often have favourite songs that they never tire of ! This repetition helps them learn the lyrics and understand what the words mean . <p> Use actions and facial expressions to help your child understand Some childrens songs have complicated lyrics or new vocabulary for your child . To ensure your toddler understands what these words mean , use actions and facial expression when you sing to help clarify the meaning . You can also try to incorporate these new words into everyday life , to expose your child further to these words and help build understanding . For example , if your child enjoys the song " London Bridge " and " bridge " is a new word for your child , you could try building bridges out of blocks or Lego to reinforce the concept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your toddler . One way is to sing well-known childrens songs , like " Twinkle Twinkle Little Star " or " Old MacDonald Had a Farm " . But another way to share music is to make up a song especially for your child . You can follow the guidelines below to create a song for your child , and then have fun singing using the tips below : <h> Recipe for a song <p> Choose a simple , familiar tune or make up your own melody <p> Make up a song about things that are familiar or interesting to your child <p> Choose meaningful , useful words that your child understands <p> Put new or important words at the end of the lines in the song this will make these words stand out , and make it easier for your child to try to sing these words <p> Keep it simple ! Kids love repetition and learn from it . So repeat key lyrics and keep the number of words to a minimum . <p> Add simple actions to the song <p> here 's a song to the tune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " Here we Go ' Round the Mulberry Bush " ) that you can sing every time you wash your childs hands . Notice that the words are very repetitive . The words " hands " and " clean " stand out because they are at the end of the line of music : <p> This is the way we wash our hands Wash our hands , wash our handsThis is the way we wash our hands Now they 're nice and clean ! <p> For even more fun , you can incorporate pretend play into your song . When getting ready for bed , sing a song to the tune of " Fr+re Jacque " . Have your child pretend he s sleeping , and nudge him at the appropriate moments in the song : <p> Adam is sleeping Adam is sleepingWake him up Wake him up <p> Adam is sleeping Adam is sleeping Wake him up Wake him up <h> What if your child does n't  like it when you to sing to him ? <p> Some children do not enjoy being sung to . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Here are some other ways to enjoy music with your child : <p> Try playing music on a CD and sing along with your child <p> Try playing musical instruments <p> March around the room or dance to music <p> Try " saying " a song . Instead of singing , say the lyrics of the song . The natural rhythm of the words will turn the song into a little poem that your child might enjoy . <p> Try nursery rhymes ( such as " Hickory Dickory Dock " or " Hey Diddle Diddle " ) or fingerplays ( such as " Round and Round the Garden " or " Five Little Monkeys " ) . Nursery rhymes and fingerplays are like songs without a tune . They have repetition and rhythm built right in that 's why they are so catchy and fun ! <p> If you follow the guidelines above , you will probably notice that your child : <p> Enjoys singing with you , and probably pays attention to the song for a longer period of time than usual

@@100393782 @4593782/ <h> Sharing Books with Toddlers , The Hanen Way <p> Toddlers ( aged 18 months 2 + years ) have figured out what books are all about , but may or may not be ready to hear a whole story . They enjoy holding a book , turning the pages , looking at the pictures and talking about what interests them . They often have their favourite books , which they want to read again and again ! <p> When reading with a toddler , the main goals include : <p> Developing his interest in books <p> Having him interact back and forth with you <p> Learning some interesting new words <p> Having fun ! <p> Types of books to read with a toddler : <p> Books with colourful , realistic photographs or pictures these types of pictures catch young childrens attention , and its been shown that toddlers learn more from these images than from abstract or black and white images 1 . <p> Board books books with thick , sturdy pages that are easier for toddlers to hold and turn . <p> Repetitive books books with predictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of language will catch your childs interest and make it easier for him to remember key words as they are repeated often . Examples of repetitive books : " Brown Bear , Brown Bear , What do you see ? " by Bill Martin Jr. , " Goodnight Moon " by Margaret Wise Brown , or " Hand , Hand , Fingers , Thumb " by Al Perkins . <p> Photo albums toddlers love to look at pictures of themselves and of the important people and events in their lives . <p> Homemade books which could include photos of favourite people or things , or objects or remnants from interesting places or outings . See " Make a Book " at the end of this article for more ideas . <p> Short , simple storybooks books with a simple storyline may interest your child . An example would be " The Very Hungry Caterpillar " by Eric Carle . If your child is n't interested in listening to the whole story at first , simplify it , or just talk about the pictures . <p> Interactive books books with parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your child to touch and feel may interest your child . However , there is conflicting evidence about how much children learn from these books . One study showed that typically developing children learned less from books that can be manipulated than from books with colourful , realistic pictures 2 . However , another study showed that children with language delay used more language when looking at interactive books 3 . Read more about these studies . <p> While looking at interactive books , it is important to observe your child to ensure that the moving parts do n't  distract him to the point that he is not interacting with you . <h> Books to avoid : <p> Lengthy , complicated story books ( including fairy tales ) - these types of books often involve an understanding of language that is more complex than your child may be ready for . They also require your child to pay attention for a longer period of time . The goal at the toddler stage is for your child to develop a love of books and a love of sharing books with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your childs interests , attention span , and language level . <h> How to share books with a toddler <p> Let your child choose the book - its okay to make suggestions about which book to read from time to time , but allowing your child to choose the book ensures that he is truly interested . <p> Sit with your child , face to face - while traditionally we think of sitting beside a child on a couch or in bed when reading , it is very helpful to face your child while reading . When you are face to face , you can read your childs cues and find out what interests him about the book . Your child will know you are interested in sharing the book with him if you are looking at him with interest . <p> Allow your child to hold the book and turn the pages - this will ensure that your child is actively involved . Do n't  worry if he skips some pages the goal is to make the book interactive and fun . <p> Let your child " read " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a few pages or flip through the book for a few moments . Others will want to look at the entire book . Let your child look at the book at his own pace and according to his interests . You do n't  have to finish the book at one sitting ! <p> Its okay to change things up ! - you do n't  have to read every word on the page . You can simplify the story or just talk about the pictures and not read the words . <p> Its ok to keep things the same ! - some children love to look at the same book over and over again . There 's no need to discourage this . The repetition and familiarity helps your child learn new words and develop a better understanding of the concepts in the book . <p> Wait for your child to do or say something . After you turn the page or read one page , wait silently . Avoid asking questions or pointing out anything particular on that page . Your goal is to give your child an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you 've found a book your child likes and you are taking turns talking about the book , you can Add Language that will stimulate your childs vocabulary , understanding , and thinking skills ( It Takes Two to Talk - A Practical Guide for Parents of Children with Language Delays . Pepper &amp; Weitzman , 2004 ) . <p> " Adding Language " during book reading means : <p> use a variety of words try to avoid just naming the pictures in the book as this will result in your child being exposed to mostly nouns ( names of things ) . While nouns are important , your child also needs to be exposed to words that describe ( e.g. " wet " , " hot " , " tall " ) , action words ( " go " , " run " , " sleep " , " eat " ) , words for feelings ( " happy " , " sad " , " tired " ) , location words ( " up " , " down " , " under " ) , words about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after " ) , etc . <p> highlight important words emphasize the most important words ( the ones that are key to your child understanding the information on the page ) with your voice , slowing down , and showing a picture in the book which demonstrates the meaning of the word . You can also use gestures to explain concepts in the book . For example , when looking at a picture of a big elephant , you can outstretch your arms to indicate " big " while you talk about the " very big elephant " . <p> expand your childs message when your child says something about the book , you can respond by elaborating on his message . For example , if he says " dog " while looking at a picture of a dog having a bath , you could say " The dog is having a bath " . Adding on to your childs idea shows your child how to produce longer sentences . <p> build your childs understanding your child will gain a better understanding of his experiences and his world when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if you look at a book about a trip to the doctor , you can talk about a recent visit your child had to the doctor . <h> Make a book <p> A homemade book , created especially for your child , is sure to become one of his favourites . By following these guidelines , you will create a book together that will be interactive and fun to read : <p> Think about your childs favourite things and outings items can include photos of favourite people or things , packages or labels from favourite foods or toys ( eg. part of the Rice Krispies box ) , or photos or small remnants from interesting places or outings ( eg. a ticket stub from a show , part of the Happy Meal box from a recent trip to McDonalds , a stone collected from the playground , a photo of your child getting a haircut or swimming in the lake , etc . ) . If you follow your childs lead and observe his interests , you will know exactly what to include in the book . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or objects , help you paste the pictures into the book , and decide what to write on the page underneath the picture . <p> Less is more include just one picture or object per page . <p> Ensure that the " text " makes sense to your child when your child is the one who decides what to write on each page , it ensures that the text is from his perspective and at his level . <p> If you follow the guidelines above when you share books with your toddler , you will probably notice that your child : <p> enjoyed sharing the book with you <p> was able to sit for longer than usual <p> communicated with you frequently during the book reading so that it turned into a conversation ! <p> Kaderavek , J. &amp; Justice , L.

She loved her job and particularly enjoyed seeing the childrens enjoyment as they participated in the daily activities she planned for them . But Kim was challenged by Nathan , a two year-old in her group who did not seem keen to interact with her or join in with the other children . He would watch the other children and appear interested in what they were doing , but he otherwise spent most of the day playing alone in the block centre or at the sand table . <p> Nathans mother reported that he communicated very well at home and used about 50-100 words , but Kim rarely heard Nathan talk at child care . If he needed to express something important , he would sometimes come and get Kim or point to what he needed . Kim tried to encourage Nathan to talk by asking him questions about what he was doing but Nathan typically responded with only a nod . She also urged him to " use his words " but , again , he typically just nodded or walked away . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her supervisor , who recommended that Kim have a look at the Learning Language and Loving It guidebook and DVD . <p> From the first chapter of Learning Language and Loving It , Kim was able to connect with the described issues and examples . As she read about the different conversational styles that children demonstrate ( click here to see sample pages ) , she began to suspect that Nathan fit the profile of a child with a reluctant conversation style . A child with a reluctant conversation style rarely initiates communication unless his need is critical but will often respond by nodding . She also began to think that she had been playing the Director role , one of the many common roles described in the guidebook , which may make it difficult for a child to play an active role in an interaction . By asking Nathan many questions and urging him to " use his words " , she realized that she may have been putting too much pressure on Nathan and actually discouraging him from communicating . <p> Kims suspicions were confirmed when she watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language and Loving It DVD . Kim was particularly impressed by the contrast videos of Jo-Anne and Mari .

When , instead , she took the time to observe , wait and listen to see what interested Mari and then followed his lead by imitating him , Mari become much more animated and eager to communicate . Kim learned more about how to OWL ( Observe , Wait and Listen ) and " Follow a Childs Lead " in Chapter 3 of the Learning Language and Loving It guidebook and was excited to try these same strategies with Nathan ( click hereto see sample pages ) . <p> The next day , Kim joined Nathan at the sand table .

As Kim continued to play with Nathan and focused on following his lead , she heard more language , such as " fall down " and " dirty sand . " Kim was thrilled that she had found a way to connect with Nathan , and excitedly returned to the Learning Language and Loving It guidebook to learn how she could keep the conversation going with Nathan ( Chapter 3 ) and also how to support Nathans communication when in a group with the other children ( Chapters 4 and 7 ) . <h> Give every child in your classroom the best possible opportunities to develop strong language and literacy skills .

While the book she selected had an interesting storyline , it included very simple words , and the children were not encouraged to think beyond the text . Some children attended throughout the reading but others appeared disinterested or distracted . Laura did n't  draw the childrens attention to the written text or talk about the rhyming words that were included in the story . <p> Michelle thought back to ABC and Beyond and realized that Laura missed many opportunities during book reading to build emergent literacy skills , such as vocabulary , narrative understanding , decontextrualized language , print knowledge and phonological awareness . <p> Speaking with Laura afterwards , the Pre-K teacher mentioned that her goal was for the children to sit quietly and listen during story time .

@@100393836 @4593836/ <h> This months Book Nook topic is ... <h> Relating Franklin Has a Sleepover to Your Childs Experiences <p> To truly understand stories , children must go beyond the words and pictures on the page and figure things out that are not specifically stated in the book . In other words , they must " read between the lines " to understand why things happen . <p> One effective technique for helping your child read between the lines is to relate what 's happening in the book to your childs existing knowledge and experience . When your child thinks about a similar situation that he or she was in , or thinks about information he already knows on a topic , he can better understand the events in the story and how they relate to the characters feelings and motivations . These ideas are often not stated explicitly in the book but are crucial for understanding the story . <p> My chosen book : <p> Franklin Has a Sleepover by Paulette Bourgeois <p> Why I picked it : <p> I really like the Franklin books because they feature a lovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children . In this book , Franklin invites Bear for a sleep over , and Bear gets homesick . <p> How to relate to past experiences and knowledge <p> There are two ways to relate the story events to your childs experiences : <p> Make comments <p> Make comments that link the story to your childs life . Unlike questions , comments do n't  require a response , but if you make a comment based on the part of the book your child is interested in , and wait , chances are your child will want to add his or her two cents ! <p> For example , in this book , the author never explicitly states why Bear is homesick . Help your child understand why Bear feels the way he does by reminding them of a time when they felt homesick , for example , " Remember when you slept at Auntie Joans house and you missed us and you wanted to come home ? That 's how Bear feels at Franklins house . He misses his mommy and daddy and he just wants to go home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when your friend Jeremy came over and got a bit homesick . " Or , " This is just like when you had your first sleepover . " After you make a comment linking the story to your childs life , wait and see what he has to say . Follow your childs lead and you 'll find many ways to relate the book to your childs experiences and knowledge . <p> Now the meaning becomes much clearer and your child has a concrete example from his own life to help him understand what 's in the story . <p> Ask questions <p> Ask questions that link what 's happening in the story with your childs own experiences . For example , if your child is looking at the page where Franklin calls Bear to invite him for a sleep-over , you could ask : " Was there a time that you 've been invited to a friends house ? " Or , when Bear gets homesick you could ask " Have you ever had a friend come over who then got homesick ?

@@100393843 @4593843/ <h> Sharing books with Preschoolers , the Hanen Way <p> Preschoolers ( aged 2 + to 5 years ) enjoy books in many different ways . Some may want you to read their favourite story book from beginning to end . Some may just want to flip quickly through the pages . Some may try to " read " the book to you , pointing out pictures of interest or reciting memorized words or lines from the story . All of these are positive ways to share books together . What 's most important is that your child enjoys looking at books with you and that the experience leads to conversation and interaction between you and your child . <p> When reading with a preschooler , the main goals include : <p> Encouraging her interest in books and in sharing them with you <p> Learning about new words , ideas and concepts , especially those that broaden her understanding of her world and stimulate her imagination <p> Understanding and enjoying stories <p> Having fun ! <p> Types of books to read with a preschooler : <p> Repetitive books younger preschoolers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the book . The language and repetition in these books will catch your childs interest and make it easier to remember important words and sentences . Examples of repetitive books : " Brown Bear , Brown Bear , What do you see ? " by Bill Martin Jr. , " Goodnight Moon " by Margaret Wise Brown , or " Hand , Hand , Fingers , Thumb " by Al Perkins . <p> Homemade books which could include photos of favourite people or things , or objects or remnants from outings or interesting places they have been ( such as a birthday party or a trip to the zoo ) . See " Make a Book " at the end of this article for more ideas . <p> Simple storybooks with a main character or a main event - the story should have a clear beginning , middle , and end . An example would be " The Very Hungry Caterpillar " by Eric Carle . The story of the Three Little Pigs is another example of a simple story which has a repetitive structure , making it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your child is n't interested in listening to the whole story at first , simplify it , or just talk about the pictures . <p> Non-Fiction books non-fiction books about interesting topics such as animals , occupations or how things work will expose your child to new vocabulary and provide new topics for conversation . <p> Books to avoid : <p> Lengthy , complicated storybooks , especially those without lots of illustrations - these types of books often involve an understanding of more complex language than your child may be ready for ( especially younger preschoolers ) . And if there are n't  enough pictures to explain the story , your child may have a difficult time following along <p> Electronic books In a study comparing an e-book with the same story in a paper book version , researchers found that children learned more from the paper book 1 . The buttons and games in the e-book distracted the childrens attention from the story .

Do n't  worry if she skips some pages the goal is to make the book an enjoyable experience and reading every page is n't a " must " at this stage . <p> Let your child " read " the book in her own way some children look at a few pages or flip through the book for a few moments . Others want to look at the entire book . Let your child look at the book at her own pace and according to her interests . You do n't  have to finish the whole book at one sitting ! <p> It 's okay to change things up ! you do n't  have to read every word on the page . You can simplify the story , or just talk about the pictures and not read the words . <p> It 's okay to keep things the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . There 's no need to discourage this . The repetition and familiarity helps your child learn new words and better understand the concepts within the book . <p> Wait for your child to do or say something . After you have either turned the page or read one page , wait silently and avoid asking questions or pointing out anything particular on that page . Your goal is to give your child an opportunity to express herself and take turns with you . <p> Try acting it out once a story is familiar to your child , she may enjoy acting out the story with actions or props . For example , if she enjoys a story about a baby bird learning to fly , you could pretend to flap your wings as you learn to " fly " around the living room with your child . <p> Once you 've found a book your child likes and you are taking turns talking about the book , you can Add Language that will stimulate your childs vocabulary , understanding , and thinking skills ( It Takes Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Language Delays . Pepper &amp; Weitzman , 2004 ) . <p> " Adding Language " means : <p> use a variety of words try to avoid just naming the pictures in the book as this will result in your child being exposed to mostly nouns ( names of things ) . While nouns are important , your child also needs to be exposed to words that describe ( e.g. " messy " , " sticky " , " enormous " ) , action words ( " climb " , " fly " , " yell " , " see " ) , words for feelings ( " grumpy " , " excited " , " tired " ) , location words ( " beside " , " under " , " through " ) , words about time ( " soon " , " later " , " after " ) , etc . <p> highlight important words emphasize the most important words ( the ones that are key to your child understanding the information on the page ) with your voice , slowing down , and showing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Repeat these new words often when talking about the story and in everyday life . This will help your child remember these new words and possibly begin to use them himself . <p> expand your childs message when your child says something about the book , you can respond by elaborating on his message . For example , if she says " there 's a frog " while pointing to a picture of a frog jumping between lily pads , you can expand by saying " Yes , the frog is jumping on the lily pads ! " Adding on to your childs idea shows your child how to produce longer sentences and gives her more information about the topic . <p> build your childs understanding your child will gain a better understanding of her experiences and her world when you draw connections between the book and her life . For example , if you look at a book about a trip to the doctor , you can talk about a recent visit your child had to the doctor . <p> go beyond the " here-and-now " go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child that will expand her thinking . You can help your child predict what might happen ( eg. " What do you think will happen when the wolf tries to blow down the brick house ? " ) , compare and contrast ( eg. " That dog is really small , just like your friend Janes dog " ) , talk about feelings ( eg. " That boy ca n't find his ball . He looks sad " ) , and make connections with her experiences ( eg. " Remember when you lost your doll and you felt sad ? " ) . These ways of talking encourage your child to think , solve problems , and imagine . <h> Make a Book <p> A homemade book , created especially for your child , is sure to become one of your childs favourites . By following these guidelines , you will create a book together that will be interactive and fun : <p> Think about your childs favourite things and outings items can include photos of favourite people or things , packages or labels from favourite foods or toys ( eg. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small remnants from interesting places or outings ( eg. a ticket stub from a show , a stone collected from the playground , a photo of your child getting a haircut or swimming in the lake , etc ) .

Other pretend ideas for water play include : giving a doll a bath , washing the dolls clothes , washing the dishes , having a car wash , or pretending the water table is an ocean full of fish and sea creatures . <p> There is no right or wrong way to play in the water !

This will make the new word stand out , and make it easier for your toddler to remember it . <p> Toddlers have not yet learned how to play collaboratively with other children , even though they like being around them . The goal for toddlers is really to help them play in parallel with other children , enjoying the same activity . Playing at a water table or in a wading pool is a great way to help your toddler play alongside another child . You can have more than one of the same toys and items so there is no need for arguments over sharing . Sharing an activity like water play helps children relax and encourages them to socialize with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again , if this is what your child wants . Young children never tire of their favourite activities ! This repetition helps them learn what to expect from the world around them and introduces important language associated with the activity . <p> Other ways to enjoy water play There are many other ways to enjoy water in the summer . You can water the flowers with a hose , spray bottle , or watering can . Or have fun running through the sprinkler ! Toddlers like to pretend to be adults , so your child might like to use water and rags to help you " clean " something outside , such as outdoor furniture or the swing set . Or pretend to be artists and " paint " the fence or sidewalk with water and a large paintbrush . Whatever way you choose to use water with your child , your child will enjoy spending time with you and talking together . <p> If you follow the guidelines above , you will probably notice that your child : <p> enjoys playing and interacting with you <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facial expression , actions , sounds , and words . <p> plays for longer than usual , if you follow his interests <p> possibly enjoys playing alongside another child during this activity <p> This approach to water play comes from It Takes Two to Talk ( Pepper and Weitzman , 2004 ) , a practical guidebook for parents who are concerned about their childs language development .

As more and more healthcare professionals move towards integrating online practices , its time to think about how technology can work for us ! <h> What is " Telepractice " ? <p> Telepractice or telehealth refers to the delivery of professional services through telecommunications technology such as two-way video conferencing online ( CASLPO , 2014 ) . Some of you may already be offering individual therapy through telepractice , but have you ever considered running a Hanen program remotely ? <p> There are several apparent advantages to doing so : <p> Time savings : parents and therapists alike will save time and money on travel <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanen programs in the absence of physical space requirements and the cost of materials ( e.g. flip chart , hard copies of resources , projector , name tags , beverages , etc . ) <p> Flexibility : we can provide services outside of a clinic setting which may allow for more flexible business hours that better accommodate families . Rescheduling individual visits if needed would be much simpler <p> Parent commitment : families may be more inclined to commit to a program offered exclusively within the comfort of their own home <p> Efficiency : we can service an increased number of clients and families <p> But is telepractice really as good as traditional in-person intervention ? Can the quality of clinical practice really be maintained when delivered electronically ? One study aimed to answer these questions . <h> The Study <p> Hedda Maedan and colleagues investigated the effectiveness of Internet-Based Parent-Implemented Communication Strategies ( i-PiCS ) for young children with autism <p> Participants ( 3 mother-child dyads ) were provided with an overview of social communication , handouts regarding parent strategies , face-to-face training over Skype , and video feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Results <p> While there was some variability between families , parents learned to effectively implement the targeted naturalistic strategies when they were trained over Skype <p> All children were observed to make positive changes following this intervention <p> Parents ability to maintain their skills was lower than at the time of intervention , but higher than at baseline <p> All parents indicated satisfaction with i-PiCS <p> An additional study out of the University of Western Washington found similarly promising results . Parent coaching strategies that were delivered to 2 families remotely via telepractice lead to gains that were maintained , and even exceeded that of traditionally delivered therapy for children with ASD ( Baharav &amp; Reiser , 2010 ) . <h> Bottom Line <p> Early studies indicate its the type of therapy , not the medium with which it is delivered that makes it successful .

@@100393878 @4593878/ <h> How Autism Affects Communication in Young Children <h> When does communication start ? <h> Communication begins long before we learn to talk . In the first few months of life , babies show their interest in communicating by listening intently to the sound of the human voice , looking at people 's faces when they talk , and then engaging in back-and-forth babbling games with their parents . These exchanges of sounds and smiles between an infant and his caregiver are the baby 's first conversations , even though he has never uttered a word . Around the first year of life , infants imitate their parents actions and single words . Then they start to use their first words on their own and , once they have many single words , children start to use little two-word sentences . <h> How does autism affect communication ? <h> For children with Autism Spectrum Disorder , communication development happens differently and more slowly . Because of the sensory challenges associated with the disorder , children with autism might seem more interested in environmental sounds , like the whirring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . They may seem distracted or even seem not to hear what people say . <h> No one knows exactly why , but children with ASD do not naturally imitate in the same way as other children . They either do n't  imitate at all or they imitate whole sentences ( called echoes ) without always understanding the meaning of the things they are saying . Among children who do n't  use echoes , first words are often delayed and are sometimes unusual ( like numbers or letters of the alphabet ) . <h> High-functioning or mild autism and communication <h> Children with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome may have an extensive vocabulary and use long sentences . But when it comes to social communication , much more is required than that the ability to use words .

To be successful communicators , children need to know how to interpret and respond to these cues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children begin paying attention to non-verbal cues as infants when they search their parents faces for support , acknowledgement and cues to what 's going on in their parents mind .

But for children with Asperger syndrome , mild autism or social communication difficulties , the ability to " tune in " to the thoughts and feelings of others often does not develop in the same way or at the same pace as other children . <h> Difficulty empathizing and seeing other points of view can make having two-sided conversations a huge challenge for these children .

@@100393909 @4593909/ <h> A Promise Kept : More Than Words- Makes it to Barbados <p> As a twenty-one year old budding speech-language pathologist , Sue McMillan made a promise to herself that she was determined to keep : one day , she would find a way to share her professional skills in areas of the world where families of children with speech and language difficulties have very limited access to the help they need . <p> Sue met with her first chance to live up to that promise in 2004 while vacationing in Barbados . She had the opportunity to meet and work with a thirteen year-old boy with autism named Fraser , who had struggled in both public and private schools and whose parents were now trying to home school him to meet his complex needs . <p> Sue saw right away what a great need Barbados had for autism services . In a country of nearly 300 000 people , there were only five speech-language pathologists . Having been recently trained to lead More Than Words - the Hanen Program for parents of children on the Autism Spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frasers play a key role in helping their children communicate , especially when speech pathology services were limited . <p> Determined to help , Sue returned to Barbados during the Christmas holiday of 2007 to offer free clinics to families of children with autism . The following year she returned again , this time in search of funding to be able to offer a full More Than Words Program to Barbadian families . <p> Success ! After meeting with a number of potential donors to express her firm belief in the effectiveness of the More Than Words Program , Sue secured enough funds to offer the very first Hanen Program in Barbados . <h> More Than Words Takes Off ! <p> Attending the first More Than Words Program were seven families whose children ranged from 3+ to 15 years of age . Although the recommended age range for children attending More Than Words is 12 months to five years , Sue made an exception in this case because she knew how limited services were and how great the need was for this kind of family-focused intervention . <p> Sue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the More Than Words Program and learn new ways for helping their child communicate and interact with others . There were several single mothers , families who had to travel great distances , and one courageous mother who suffered from Multiple Sclerosis . And yet all of these parents showed unwavering commitment to the program and to learning as much as they could to help their children . <p> And how their commitment paid off ! Sue was thrilled to see that the families had made significant changes in the way they interacted with their children , and that the childrens communication skills had grown as a result . As one parent explained after the program , " my childs communication has greatly improved because the strategies I use help him understand more and he feels less frustrated " . <p> Many of the families commented that they had no idea just how much and in how many different ways their children communicated with them . One of the most important things they learned was that communication is much " more than words " ! <h> Zwades Success Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Than Words Program shows how important it is for parents to wait for their child to communicate and help their child take turns . Small adjustments like these can make a huge difference in helping the child improve his communication and social interaction skills . <p> Zwade was a very active boy who loved to run , jump , swim , and play cricket . Before the More Than Words Program , Zwades parents would try to make him sit still at the kitchen table and concentrate on naming objects in books or on flash cards something Zwade had little interest in doing . <p> Watch the video below to see Zwade looking at a book with his parents before the More Than Words Program . Notice how Zwade jumps up and leaves the table , and how difficult it is for his parents to maintain his attention . Notice as well that Zwades parents sit beside Zwade , instead of facing him , making it difficult for him to see their faces . <p> One of the first things Zwades parents learned at the More Than Words Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less frustrating for both themselves and their son if they chose to make use of his passions and his special interests . <p> Sue helped Zwades parents choose cricket ( Zwades favourite activity ) as the perfect setting for helping Zwade learn . Sue knew that this would help to motivate Zwade to have more positive social interactions , and it would also help to motivate Zwades dad , since both he and his son would be having fun . <p> Before the game , two goals were set for Zwade : <p> Enjoy an interaction with Dad . Sue knew that getting Zwade to enjoy playing with his father would be the first step . If Zwade could have fun interacting with Dad , he would be more motivated to use language that would keep the interaction going . <p> Make a request using a word ( " bowl " ) and combine this word with eye gaze . <p> To encourage Zwade to do these things , his father used two important strategies he had learned during the program : <p> Be face to face . Simply changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to see each others faces would help Zwade pay attention to Dad . <p> Give a Reason to Communicate and Wait . The cricket game had built-in reasons for Zwade to communicate i.e. , he needed Dad to throw the ball in order to hit it with the bat . And if Dad practiced waiting instead of talking a lot and taking control , Zwade would have several opportunities to take control the game himself , and this would be good for building his self-esteem . <p> Watch the video below to see the improvement in Zwades communication when he and his father play cricket together . <p> Since Zwade is having such a good time , there is no need for Dad to give directions or tell him what to do . See how Zwades father makes sure to wait and to say very little so that Zwade successfully takes turns by hitting the ball and asking Dad to throw the ball . With Dad and Zwade face to face , Zwade also looks at Dad every time he asks Zwade to throw the ball . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball back to him . <p> Following her successful More Than Words Program , Sue returned home secure in the knowledge that she had made the right decision to push for More than Words in Barbados . The smiles and gratitude of the program participants told her that she had made a significant difference in their lives and in the lives of their children with autism . <p> Sue is currently leading her third More than Words Program in Barbados , and is engaged in fundraising efforts in the hopes of offering a fourth later this year . <h> One Year Later ... <p> Find out what Zwades Dad had to say about his sons progress 14 months after completing the More Than Words Program . <p> For more than 35 years , The Hanen Centre has taken a leading role in the development of programs and resources to help parents and professionals help young children learn to communicate to the fullest of their potential . <p> To help parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder , Hanen created the evidence-based More Than Words Program , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resources teach parents practical strategies for using everyday routines and play to foster the social communication skills of their child .

High points are the most interesting parts of a song .

Accept anything as his turn and then continue immediately . The most important thing is that he takes a turn and has fun while doing it . <h> If you found this tip helpful , fill out the form below and well email you 10 free tips right away ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hanen Centre will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone . 
@@100393926 @4593926/ <h> Clinical &amp; Program Support <h> Making the Most of Your Toys <p> By Tamara Stein Program Specialist , The Hanen Centre <p> Parents often ask me to recommend specific toys . While this question seems like it should have a straightforward answer , I often find myself reluctant to respond . I do n't  want parents spending money on something that wont engage their child , or that will be so all consuming that the child wont be able to focus on their parents while playing with it . <p> I advise parents to pick toys that have versatility that do not have one set way of being played with . Whenever I suggest a toy , I like to help the parent think of a few different activities they could do with the toy . <p> Something I often suggest are animal figurines ones that are big enough to not be a choking hazard . However , if the child is under three , the parents should make sure not to leave their child alone with them safety is essential . I like animal figurines because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at discount stores , which makes them affordable to boot . Animal figurines can stimulate pretend play and so much more . Here are some of the suggestions Ive given to parents : <p> 1 . Give a reason to communicate , and wait . <p> With children who tend to have an " own agenda " style of communication , I 'll suggest parents use the figurines to give their child a reason to communicate by putting them in unexpected places around the house . Parents tend to get a kick out of this , too . I worked with one mom who managed to spark an interaction with her son by putting an elephant in his cereal bowl . When the child realized that instead of cereal , he had an elephant , he was excited to bring it to his mothers attention . The more unexpected the spot , the better this tends to work for eliciting communication ! <p> 2 . Guess what I have <p> For children who are working on expanding their language and are communicating in sentences , I 'll suggest to parents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let their child pick one while the parent looks away . Then the parent has to ask for details about the animal until he can guess which animal the child has chosen ( examples of some things parents can ask : tell me if its big or small , what does it like to eat , where does it live the questions should vary depending on the age and abilities of the child ) . After the parent guesses the name of the animal , it is his or her turn to pick an animal . In this case , its likely easier for the child if the parent gives the child hints ( its a big animal , it makes the sound " roar " , it lives in the jungle ) and see if the child can guess which animal it is . <p> 3 . Hide and Seek <p> Hide and seek can work for children with a wide variety of language abilities whether they are speaking in sentences , single words , or even if they use gestures but have stronger language comprehension skills . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide an animal . Rather than simply looking for the toy , the parent has to respond to clues from her child ( " Look under the carpet ! " , or if the child can direct the parent with a point or eye contact ) to find the missing animal . When its the parents turn to hide an animal , the child has to listen carefully and follow his parents directions to be successful . My only word of caution is that sometimes children can be a little too good at hiding one father told me that a missing lion reappeared after about a month and a half of searching around their living room . <p> 4 . Imitation <p> For children at the very early stages of communication development , and who do not interact much , I suggest parents purchase two sets of matching animals . The parent puts a few of the animals out , in pairs , and does exactly what the child is doing with her animal , to see if that sparks the childs interest and attention . Once the child notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing the action , the parent can add a new action or word to the activity ( for example , drop the animals , kiss the animals , pick up a different set of animals ) , and then wait and see if the child imitates the parents new action . <p> When advising parents on which toys to use , its important to let them know how they can get the most mileage out of their purchase . To see more of my favourite toys , and how I use them , please check out " Take a look at what 's on our toy shelf ! " and let me know about some of your most useful toys by joining the conversation in the forum . 
@@100393927 @4593927/ <h> TalkAbility The Hanen Program for Parents of Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum <p> Whether or not they have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder , all children continue to develop their social communication skills in their preschool years . Around the age of 3 , they use language to talk not only about the present , but about the past and the future , and also to problem solve . Their conversations sound more adult-like : they consider their partners interests by making a comment or asking a question about what the other person has said , and they listen to and look at their partner when he or she talks . <p> The early years are especially crucial for verbal children on the autism spectrum because they still face special communication challenges . Often , these children find it difficult to : <p> Have conversations with others <p> Play with children their own age <p> Talk about things that interest someone else <p> Change a routine without becoming frustrated <p> If you 've noticed more than one of these difficulties in your child , the TalkAbility Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages 3-7 with social communication difficulties , the TalkAbility Program teaches parents practical ways to help their child learn people skills . <p> By " people skills " , we mean the ability to " tune in " to the thoughts and feelings of others by paying attention to non-verbal cues such as body language , facial expressions , eye gaze , and tone of voice .

She had been working with Amy , a four year-old girl with Down Syndrome , and she was providing Amys parents with suggestions from the It Takes Two to Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been progressing well , and her parents reported that she was initiating communication much more frequently at home and starting to use more single words , in addition to pointing and gesturing . However , despite Amys increasing communication at home , her parents reported that when Amy was at the child care centre , she would just sit and watch the other children , and the staff were having a hard time getting her to talk . <p> Deb decided to visit the centre to observe Amy and to hopefully provide some helpful suggestions to the staff . Deb knew there were helpful suggestions in the It Takes Two to Talk Guidebook , but this guidebook addresses 1:1 interactions between a parent and a child . A child care centre posed some very different challenges . Deb needed to be able to help the staff support Amys communication development with lots of other children around who were also competing for their attention . <p> Deb decided to take along the Learning Language and Loving It guidebook and DVD since these resources are specifically targeted at early childhood educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her classroom , she realized that the staff really did not know how to involve Amy in group interactions that were often dominated by the more verbal , sociable children . <p> During sleep time , Deb met with the two educators in Amys room , Gina and Mary , and she asked them for their input on Amy . They admitted that they just did n't  know how to involve Amy in a group since she did n't  talk like the other children . Deb agreed that it could be challenging to engage children who do n't  communicate verbally , but she added that children like Amy may be able to participate in alternative ways while their verbal language is developing . <p> Deb shared a video example from the Learning Language and Loving It DVD of a teacher named Helen interacting with Kateleen , a child at a similar communication stage as Amy . <p> After viewing the video , Gina and Mary realized that Amy may have been communicating more than they thought when they looked beyond words . Deb encouraged Gina and Mary to complete a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( click here to see this Guide ) to develop a better understanding of how and why Amy communicates . Deb also drew their attention to Chapter 5 on " Encouraging Interaction in Groups " , and showed them how the " SSCAN " strategy could provide them with specific suggestions for increasing Amys involvement . <p> Deb shared another two contrast video examples from the DVD that demonstrate how a teacher successfully increases a childs interaction in a group by making a few simple changes such as moving the child where she can be more easily seen in the group by the teacher , modeling gestures and offering the child a prop so the child can interact nonverbally in the conversation and using the childs name more frequently as a turn-taking cue . Click on the video below to view this clip : <p> Deb then referred Gina and Mary to the Learning Language and Loving It guidebook for specific examples for how they could encourage Amys interaction in a group ( click hereto see the page Deb showed them ) .
