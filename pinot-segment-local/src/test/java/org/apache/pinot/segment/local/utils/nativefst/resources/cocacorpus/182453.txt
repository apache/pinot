@@22979447 @2979447/ <p> The basic doctrines of Islam are collectively known as the Five Doctrines of Islamic Faith . They include a belief in the absolute unity of God , belief in angels , belief in prophets , belief in scriptures , and belief in the Final Judgment . In addition , some texts include a sixth pillar , that of God 's divine decree and predestination . <p> The first of the doctrines is faith in the absolute unity of God . Tawhid , meaning " making God one , " refers to the strict belief of monotheism and the refusal to compromise this position . In fact , another name for Muslims is muwahhidun , translated as " unitarians " or " upholders of divine unity " ( Denny 107 ) . He is the only creator and disposer of the Universe , has no partner and no comparable being , none but Allah is worthy of worship ( Morgan 91 ) . Tawhid is so essential and central to the faith that shirk , or the associating anything with God , is the one fundamental error for Muslims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only sin that God can not forgive : <p> God forgives not that aught should be with Him associated ; less than that He forgives to whomsoever he will . Whoso associates with God anything has gone stray into far error . ( 4:116 ) <p> The association of anything with God denies God in His true nature . In order for followers to allow belief into one 's heart they must first surrender to God in his completeness . In fact , the Arabic word , islam , is translated as " to surrender " or " to submit . " Associating anything with God is considered to be opposite to surrendering to Him , and therefore , no belief would be possible ( Glasse 370 ) . <p> The second doctrine of the faith asserts the belief in Angels as part of God 's creation ( Esposito 27 ) . In Arabic angels are known as malak , from la'aka meaning " to send on a mission " ( Glasse 42 ) . These angels have no sex and are made of light , whereas humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are considered good , except Iblis/Satan , who was sent out of heaven after he refused God 's command to bow down to Adam ( Denny 108 ) . The angels have various functions that are concerned with the spirits and souls of human that include carrying revelations , orders , and messages to the prophets , preaching the true and the good and encouraging believers by God 's good tidings and His Eternal Paradise , and registering all human deeds ( Morgan 99 ) . <p> Although the angels work as messengers and helpers of God , none are considered to be superior to humans . The angels do not have free will and are completely obedient to God 's commands . They have no central state , and therefore do not have the capacity , as humans do , to truly know God ( Glasse 42 ) . <p> Muslims also recognize another kind of supernatural creature , the Jinn . They can be differentiated from angels in several ways . Jinn , created from fire , are much lower than angels , are either male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either virtuous or wicked . Like humans , they too receive revelations through God 's prophets . <p> The third doctrine is the belief in the prophets . Muhammad was the last in a long line of prophets who were entrusted with bringing Scriptures to their peoples ( Denny 108 ) . The prophets are divided into two classes , rasuls and nabis . A rasul , or " messenger , " was given a major new revelation and was called to communicate what God had sent to them ( Denny 69 ) . A nabi , or " prophet , " is also one whom God has spoken to , but their mission lies within the framework of an existing religion ( Glasse 318 ) . <p> Regardless of the classification of the prophet , all are believed to " possess all natural perfections , excellent character , truthfulness and honesty in speech and deed before his appointment to office , because it is by virtue of these that he has deserved Prophetic mission and has come into contact with Angels , and received revelation " ( qtd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in the scriptures . The Quran , meaning " recitation " , is held to be the eternal , literal word of God . Therefore , to accept and believe in the messages of Allah is a mere consequence of belief in Angels and the prophets , the mediums by which God 's word is revealed . All Scriptures are God 's work , but the people before the dawn of Islam had corrupted the original messages to suit their own inclinations . The Quran is the purest extant scripture on Earth , as it is all the pure word of God 's and has not been subject to tampering ( Denny 108 ) . It was revealed to Muhammad and preserved in the Arabic language and was placed in an order that was commanded by divine revelation ( Esposito 9 ) . <p> The fifth doctrine , belief in the Final Judgment , is of extreme significance and is very often emphasized in Islam . With the promise of reward for a life of faith and one of punishment for the unfaithful , final judgment emphasizes ultimate moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salvation on the " Last Day " is assured for believers who displayed both faith and works . God will save the repentant sinner , but will not accept repentance on the verge of death . One must have established a pattern of repentance and good works , even if it was preceded by a life filled with evil-doing . <p> The time of the " Day of Distinguishing " is unknown to all but Allah . The angel Isafril will sound the trumpet and at that moment the order of the natural world will be inverted . The Quran describes the Garden of Paradise as a heaven filled with peace and dotted with flowing rivers , gorgeous gardens , and shining streams . It is life-affirming and emphasizes the beauty of creation and enjoyment of pleasures within the limits set by God ( Esposito 28 ) . Contrastingly , hell is a place of endless pain , suffering , and torment . It is filled with flames , boiling water , and blistering wind . This punishment is a just one for a life filled with unfaithfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief in God 's divine decree and predestination . There is great tension between a belief in God 's foreordaining and human choice , and by and large all sects of Muslims do not agree ( Farah 118 ) . <p> The sayings of Muhammad , recorded in the Hadith , tend to favor a more predestinarian viewpoint than the Quran . For example , he was quoted to say , " ... And God said : ' Write down the fate of every individual thing to be created , ' and accordingly the pen wrote all that was , and that will be , to eternity " ( Farah 120 ) . <p> However , neither the Quran nor any other source unequivocally supports the doctrine of predestination . The position of free will is also embraced and implied ( Denny 112 ) . Some Muslims assert that omnipotence of God does not prevent free will . One can have a sense that nothing can be done to oppose the will of God , but man nonetheless has gift of free will in that he still makes choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be treated as a Muslim nor subjected to Muslim rules . Muslims believe that these doctrines are the basis of every divine religion and every human is called by Allah to adopt these beliefs .

In 1985 , Zia declared elections which put in place a parliament and a civilian Prime Minister , Muhammad Khan Junejo , who was later dismissed by Zia ul-Haq . Zia waskilled in a mysterious plane crash in 1988 . After Zia ul-Haq was killed , Benazir Bhutto was elected prime minister and became the effective head of government in December 2 , 1988 . In August 1990 , President of Pakistan , Ghulam Ishaq Khan , removed Benazir Bhutto from power under allegations of corruption . In 1999 , General Pervez Musharraf took power after overthrowing Pakistans Prime Minister , Nawaz Sharif ( Gregory ) . <p> The militarys major goal is to expand its power and protect its business organizations . Changes to the constitution and the political system in Pakistan and interference in the electoral process have noticeably increased . For examples , when Musharraf took power in 1999 , he established the National Accountability Bureau ( Pakistans apex anti-corruption organization ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ban opposition leaders from participation in parliamentary elections under allegations of corruption . To maintain power over security policy and ensure a strong budget for the military , Musharraf created the National Security Council that comprises the chiefs of all military services and is in charge of making decisions about defense and national security policies to increase and institutionalize the militarys role in policymaking in Pakistan ( Gregory ) . <p> As the chart below illustrates , defense expenditures account for a large share of the Pakistans annual budget and GDP . In 2004 , defense expenditures took about thirty percent of the budget and five percent of GDP . Despite the fact that the United States has provided Pakistan with $4.93 billion to cover expenses of the fight against the Taliban , the share of defense expenditure in the budget and GDP has hardly decreased ( Gregory ) . <p> Also , in an unconstitutional move , Musharraf held a referendum in April 2002 which allowed him to remain in power for five more years . The military has made changes to the legislation for qualifications of memberships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all candidates should have college education and exclude those who are convicted for a crime ( Gregory ) . Several military officers have been placed in government positions . The number of military officers placed in government positions is difficult to determine because military officers who occupy government positions lose their military form . A large number of higher education institutes around the country are chaired by military officers , who have made several revisions to the educational curriculum . Thirty four out of seventy four civilian institutions are run by military personnel , and eight hundred retired army officers have been placed in positions in education . Musharraf and his regime revised the national curriculum to give a positive image about the history of the military and about Musharraf . According to the revised National Curriculum for Pakistan Studies of 2006 , the learning objectives of " History of Pakistan II " are " to discuss Pakistans emergence as a nuclear power , to comprehend the causes of the military takeover of October 12 , 1999 , to discuss the 2002 elections and restoration of democracy and to narrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freedom of the press has been suppressed through coercion and promulgation of laws , such as the Defamation Law of 2002 . General Syed Iqbal Haider and other military officers have warned that criticism of the armed forces is unacceptable . The Pakistani government has put a ban on the Federal Government Advertising , which used to provide financial aid for newspapers . Also , Musharrafs suspension of Chief Justice Iftikar Chaudry and Pakistani constitution provides evidence of the Military intervention in the legislative system ( Gregory ) . The ranking of Pakistan 's press freedom has declined since Pervez Musharraf took over power in 1999 .

@@22979512 @2979512/ <p> Italys immigration issues did not start as early as those of its neighbors.Not until the 1970s did foreigners start traveling there to find new jobs or better lives.In the years before this , there was a large amount of immigration into Western Europe , particularly during the de-colonization of many African countries.These people were mainly immigrating to France , which was actually encouraging immigration for a couple of reasons , one was to try to increase the labor market after World War II , and the other was to try to increase France 's domestic population in order to keep up with that of Germany ( Newman ) . The increase in foreigners was a benefit for France at first , but during the 1960 's and 1970 's many of the French colonies in Africa started gaining independence , during which time there was a boom in immigration to western Europe , for example , in 1962 nearly one million refugees fled to France when Algeria gained its independence . Unfortunately the housing situation in France is run by and paid for by the state , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1973 , due to racism against these foreigners , Algeria stopped migrating to the countries in the European Economic Community ( ECC ) , and a year later the ECC formally closed its doors to migrant workers who were not from the ECC ( Newman ) . But at this time , Italys government did not follow suit , for many years before that point , Italy had been a place people mainly emigrated from . <p> This influx of immigration was not yet a large problem . Italy has always had a very low rate of population , so it was actually welcoming these workers . These migrants that were being shut out of other western European countries looked to Italy as an easy place to get into unnoticed.At first Italy was used as a way for foreigners to get into the European Union , and eventually many decided to stay there once they crossed the border.In 1986 , a law was passed by the Italian parliament that protected those workers from outside the European Union by giving them more rights and trying to secure them more jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country even more ( the Italian exception ) . As of December 31 , 2000 , the number of non European Union citizens in Italy was over 1.2 million , an increase of about 2.5% from the 300,000 in the 1970's(Paparella) . <p> One tactic the Italian government used to get these people to come out of hiding was to hold amnesties for any illegal immigrants , a time where they could apply for Italian citizenship and not get punished for having been there illegally.This worked on one level , since this reduced the number of workers in the underground sector , thus reducing the size of this unrecognized economy.Between 1986 and 1998 , the Italian government held 4 amnesties , granting citizenship to about 700,000 people . But this did not solve the problem , it actually ended up attracting more migrants.Italys labor force fluctuates , and , like many other countries , it needs these foreigners to work in its factories ( Tessitore , 7 ) . Unfortunately , not only did these amnesties cost the government a lot of money , they made Italy 's immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to move there , and since there is so much red tape involved with getting legal citizenship , many choose to enter the country illegally . At the moment , the policy is that if a foreigner wants to find work in Italy , they must have their name put on a list by going to an Italian consulate . Italian employers then go to labor offices in Italy to hire people off of these lists , which can take a while , sometimes a couple of years ( Zincone , 3 ) . <p> Italys geography makes it a perfect spot for illegal immigration , and unfortunately many Africans have died somewhere along the route across the Mediterranean Sea to get from places like Tunisia and Libya to southern Italy ( see map ) . Officials of Italy and of some African countries have tried deter people from trying to make the trip by publicizing these boating accidents , showing them that it is not worth the risk.But maybe it is ; the Southern border of Italy is apparently very easy to get through , plus the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their countries.In the first year that Silvio Berlusconi was president , 140,000 illegal immigrants were caught , and only 82,000 of them were actually deported ( Bruni ) . Many times , once they are caught , they are given a couple of days to leave the country , they then end up going underground , or , since at this point they are already inside the European Union , it will now be easy for them to move around between most of the Western European countries ( Oketh ) . This is because the immigration policies within the European Union are much different than those between European and non-European countries . The hard part for these people is gaining entry into the EU , after that they probably will not even need a passport to travel from country to country as a result of the Schengen Treaty of 1985 , giving all members inside the EU the right to move freely across the borders(Oketh) . <p> Another way these immigrants find ways into the country is quite creative ; when their small boats are met by Italian coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants find a way to make their boat sink , or cause the motors to stop working , so that there is no way they can be turned back.At this point , they know that the coast guard will have to rescue them by bringing them inland ( Bruni ) . <p> Some of the most visible problems being caused by this immigration are regional conflicts between groups of Italians and immigrants ( racism , violence ) , fluctuating unemployment rates , increase of workers in unrecognized economic sectors , and the fact that the country is paying for a large amount of foreigners to be incarcerated in their prisons ( Tessitore , 7 ) . <p> Legislation <p> One of the reasons why these people are not deported when they should be is the 1998 immigration legislation , law 40/98 , more commonly known as the Turco-Napolitano Law . Part of this law states that those foreigners who are arrested ( for various reasons , usually crime related ) , are to be judged by a magistrate . If the magistrate decides that this person will be deported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which time they would be able to slip underground and out of sight ( Paparella ) . This law was followed by Single Act 286 , in July of 1998 , which was based on the Turco-Napolitano Law . Its two main goals were the integration of immigrant minorities while creating an environment of low conflict between nationals and migrants , and of respect for immigrants personal integrity . The act also requested full rights for legal immigrants and basic rights for illegal immigrants . Supporters of this legislation , members of center-left party , tried to match the demand of labor with the supply of migrant workers . The idea of this act was that it would handle any problems or short-comings of immigration laws that had failed in other European countries , and keep any aspects that had succeeded ( Zincone , : 2 ) . Unfortunately for those pushing this act , it was deemed too complicated , and many thought there were too many loopholes regarding immigration , it gave foreigners too many rights . <p> In July of 2002 , new legislation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bossi-Fini Law , " contained an amendment to the Turco-Napolitano Law , stating that illegal immigrants will be ordered to leave the country within five days , during which time they will be held in Italian custody . The problem with this , however , is that proper deportation procedure is not always followed ; foreigners are often not deported as they should be . For example , in 1999 , there were 11,269 immigrants that were detained awaiting deportation by the Italian Government , but only 3,987 of them were actually deported back to their countries ( Statewatch Bulletin ) . In 2000 , the government issued 64,734 deportation warrants , while only 2,867 of them were actually carried out ( Jewkes ) .

@@22979741 @2979741/ <h> Academic Costume <p> The academic costume worn in commencements across the country today originated in the Middle Ages , when a gown and hood kept scholars warm in unheated buildings . The outfit was patterned after the prevailing dress of the times . Since many scholars were clerics , the robes resembled those of the monks . The hoods were fashioned after the monk 's cowl and were attached to the gown so that they might be drawn over the head . Later , when the hood was displaced by the skull cap as a head covering , it was made separately from the gown . The skull cap evolved into a pointed cap which we recognize today as the mortarboard with its tassel . Until the end of the Civil War , students at most American universities wore caps and gowns daily . <p> In 1894 , the American Intercollegiate Commission standardized the academic costume and , as a result , hoods and gowns came to symbolize the type of degree attained . <p> There are three types of gowns and hoods : Bachelor 's , Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown is made with an open or closed front and has long pointed sleeves .

In January , The New York Times published an article about Husa that included the following about the composition : " In Music for Prague 1968 , a response to the Soviet Union 's crushing of the Prague Spring reform movement , he ( Husa ) incorporated a 15th-century Hussite anthem used previously by Dvorak and Smetana to connote solidarity and resistance , alongside eerie , unsettling microtonal passages and instrumental effects evoking bird song , church bells , Morse code and gunfire . " The piece was given its premiere by the Ithaca College Concert Band in January 1969 , becoming one of the most-played works in the wind-ensemble repertoire , with more than 10,000 known performances to date .
