If you are one of those real estate investors who can manage on their own and eliminate the need for a mediator , then kudos to you . This case usually works in a hot seller 's market , where demand is really high and you can sell your investment property very easily . If you are amongst those who prefer some guidance , then fret not because there are many advantages that come with hiring a real estate investment agent . It is worthy to mention that buyers purchase homes via real estate agencies than on their own . So if you think about it , you could be losing out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride solo . With that said , however , there is really no right way to real estate investing , and it is at your own discretion how you want to strategize your real estate business portfolio and make lots of money in return ! <h> 4 Advantages of Hiring a- Real Estate Broker <h> 1 . You save lots of time <p> When you hire a real estate broker to do the job right , you are off the hook to learn everything about buying and selling real estate properties . You save lots of time and effort when you work with a professional who has the right education and experience to close a deal on a house or any real estate transaction for that matter . Not only is this time-effective , but it is also convenient . Realtors act as mediators between buyers and sellers , and they have easy access to all other properties listed by other agents in the area . For example , if you are looking to buy a rental property , a real estate broker will find properties that meet your criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , and schedule appointments for you to view the properties . <h> 2 . Negotiation is an art <p> Not everyone has mastered the art of persuasion , and it is certainly no easy task . For real estate investors , hiring brokers to negotiate and close a deal on a property is much easier and is less of a hassle for the buyer and the seller . This way , the agent is articulate and objective in the way they negotiate a discount to get a really good deal on- your investment property. - <h> 3 . Finalizing the contract and paperwork <p> If you like reading endless pages of contract terms and filing paperwork , then you should reconsider hiring a pro and stick to a one man show . All joking aside , investors hire a full time real estate broker to finalize contracts and the required paperwork because they are familiar with the terms and conditions to ensure a legally binding contract . <p> 4 . Market trends <p> Real estate brokers have continuous knowledge of and access to analytical tools and databases to decipher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions about your investment property . All in all , you definitely get your money 's worth when you hire a pro . <h> 4 Disadvantages of Hiring a- Real Estate Broker <h> 1 . Commission margins <p> Hiring a professional real estate broker is not cheap , especially if he/she is an experienced , full-time agent . Ideally , real estate investors pay up to 6% of the total sale price of the house , and NOT from the profit they make on the sale . So , even if you do n't make profit , the agent guarantees his/her piece of the pie no matter what . Alternatively , you can hire a discount broker if you want to pay lower commission fees . <h> 2 . Be careful with whom you hire <p> It is imperative you do your research before you hire an agent . Check out credentials , experience , recent sales , etc . The key is to hire someone who can maximize your investments ' profit- instead of turning into another burden . <h> 3 . You are not the only client <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of clients and in turn , depending on how busy your agent is , your property may not get the full attention it needs . This might result in not having your calls returned in time , deadlines being missed , and deals falling through . <h> 4 . It might take a while <p> If your agent does not devote the necessary time , your income property may stay lingering in the market longer than necessary . Again , you have to work with your agents schedule and be a little patient . This is the cost of working with a real estate broker at times . <h> Finding a Real Estate Broker That Works For You <p> Did you hear of the 80/20 rule ? To put it in perspective : - 20% of realtors do 80% of the business and this applies to the majority of real estate transactions done across America .

You should not feel pressured to hire someone on the spot ; do your research and interview as many agents as possible to find the right one for you . <p> Eventually you have to consider your specific situation to decide whether you need to hire a real estate broker or not in each particular case .

You can not get out of paying these bills , even if you face vacant properties . It is worth mentioning that rental homes cost more to insure .

Maintenance Issues <p> Owning rental property- does not stop at collecting rent ; landlords have to keep up with the tenant 's constant demand for fixing and maintaining the propertys condition inside and out .

Consequently , people will have many incentives to sell houses , buy houses , and get more mortgage loans . - <h> Top 5- Housing Market Trends for 2017 <p> 1 . Growing US Economy <p> In general terms , the overall state of the economy is the most significant driver of- real estate investments and the real estate business . When the economy is strong and growing well , certain aspects of the housing market are expected to also see positive growth , but when the economy is in a downturn , the housing market forecast would n't look too optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP , unemployment , and income growth . Housing starts and home sales are directly tied to an economy 's health , i.e. , as economies slow down , financing real estate becomes harder and in turn not only do fewer home buyers enter the housing market , but real estate properties take longer to sell . As we approach the half point of the year , the US GDP growth is set to- increase to 2.1% by the end of the year , while the unemployment rate is expected to- drop to 4.5% in 2017 and beyond . With the growing economy , there will be more real estate activities and a turn up in the housing market . Ultimately , there are more home buyers , more housing supply , and more financing means to make this year 's housing market forecast hit a positive note . <p> 2 . Rising Interest Rates <p> Housing markets are active , and interest rates are higher .

More and more prospective home buyers- and real estate investors are borrowing money and getting loans to finance their real estate investments . People buy and sell houses in all interest rate packages , and it does n't look like they would stop anytime soon . Mortgage activity is up 3% year over year despite the rising interest rates in 2017 . If you are thinking of investing in real estate this year , do n't let mortgage rates deter you from finding financing means to buy your next home or investment property . The rising interest rates is a key trend in the housing market forecast because mortgage activity is strong and borrowers are taking advantage of financial resources to buy a new home and delve deep into real estate ventures . <p> 3 . More Credit <p> Starting the year on a good note , the housing market forecast- features more lenient credit qualifications for borrowers . In consequence , real estate investors are finding it easier to get a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate market . With rising interest rates , banks are cutting back on mortgage restrictions and making it easier for buyers to take out loans to finance their real estate investments . The Federal Housing Administration has lowered the mortgage fees for first-time home buyers , giving more access to- borrowers to- mortgage credit . Furthermore , mortgage finance companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac- are making it less difficult for buyers in expensive markets to finance their purchases in the housing market . In short , these lenient credit standards continue to increase the number of borrowers and entice more housing market activities across the country . All in all , you have a good chance to get approved for a mortgage loan today to finance your new rental property , - whether it is a condo , a single family home , or a multi family home .

The US housing market forecast looks sunny side up for home buyers and home builders due to the higher wages , looser credit requirements , and the increased demand from buyers . The housing market forecast includes an overall positive trend in home construction , specifically for- single family home units . This year , housing starts are projected to increase by 6.5% , with single family and multi family units increasing by 9.1% and 1.5% , respectively . An increase in home starts has the potential to increase overall demand and boost supply . <p> 5 .

While some- tend to focus on the negatives of having an influx of immigrants coming in , we decided to look at one of the positive aspects of immigration to the United States . The increasing number of immigrants throughout the United States has boosted the real estate market nationwide . <p> Immigrants arrive to a new country with high hopes and with a working attitude to succeed and build a better life for them . Some of these immigrants even come to the US with a hefty savings balance , which prompts them to invest it primarily in real estate properties . <p> Most immigrants have aspirations to own single-family homes . The longer these immigrants reside in the US and become part of its culture , the more convinced they become of the need to own property . This will lead to immigrants becoming a force in driving the housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for jobs due to the lack of employment opportunities in major cities . This results in boosting the real estate market in different areas around the US .

Changes in US policy against immigration would result in a much slower growth of the urban and suburban areas across the US . <p> Immigration in cities like San Francisco and Buffalo has helped lift these areas from the disasters of the 2008 recession . Immigrants looking to invest their money in the housing market have shortened the time frame for the recovery of those areas from the recession . <p> The report suggests that suburban areas that are growing due to immigration should consider plans for municipality growth .

The 2016 US Presidential Elections saw Donald Trump and his anti-immigration rules rise to power . Trump 's travel ban and crackdown on the Mexican border issue have made many immigrants in the US reconsider or give up their plans to become homeowners . <p> The ban basically creates a sense of uncertainty for- the future for immigrants or asylum- seekers to the US . This uncertainty has reportedly made many immigrants to back out of home purchases .

However , a large segment of the United States society feels threatened . Immigrants are not sure if they would last 6 months or 10 years in the US with the current political situation in the US .

Deals with tangible assets <p> Potentially the most important feature which makes real estate investing one of the best ways to make money is that it deals with tangible assets . Real estate properties , unlike stocks and many other investments and products , is something that you can actually see and touch . That makes it attractive for people . Moreover , because as a real estate investor you own actual assets in the form of rental properties , it is hard to just lose everything . Even if the US housing market collapses again , you will retain your income properties and can start renting them out or decide to sell them when things come back to normal . <h> 6 . Requires minimum prior knowledge <p> Most real estate investors are not professionals , meaning that they have another full-time job and invest in real estate only part-time .

Can be worked from home <p> Real estate investing can be a full-time job which you work from an office or from the comfort of your home . Moreover , it can be a part-time job which you perform from your apartment or house . While a real estate investor has to visit properties , go to the bank , and manage his/her rental properties , this work on the go can be minimized through various means such as professional property management .

@@44409294 @4409294/ <h> 1 . Those who have been previously evicted <p> Before you rent out your property , you should make a very careful check on your potential tenants . Although this will take time and money , it is absolutely obligatory as these are the people on whom your profits will depend . When checking potential tenants ' rental history , never ever rent out your property to someone who has been previously evicted . Of course this person will try to explain that it was not his/her fault but the fault of the landlord who for some unknown reason held a grudge against exactly this particular tenant . Let 's face it , landlords have no other motivation to love or hate their tenants except for the money they make out of them . Someone with previous eviction history is most likely to be a tenant who will again delay rental payments or try to skip them altogether . <h> 2 . Individuals who are unemployed or changing jobs too often <p> Another important factor to check before you rent out your property to someone is his/her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access such kind of information in order to evaluate how reliable your potential tenant is . Needless to say , stable , high income is no guarantee that your tenant will pay his/her rent on time and cause no troubles but is still a better indication than being unemployed or flipping jobs too frequently . Such a person has no stable source of income and is expected to delay his/her payments or avoid making them at all . It is much safer to rent out your property to someone with a permanent , secure job and established income . <h> 3 . Tenants with bad credit history <p> Once again , you rent out your property to tenants with the sole purpose of making money . This means that you have to find people who are likely to pay you the due money at the end of each month . Someone with poor credit history is not likely to be such an individual . Remember . People do n't end up being tenants just because they are incapable of buying their own home , meaning that potential tenants do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant source of income , and terrible credit history . Someone might become a tenant because he/she moves too often for work or because he/she decided to spend his/her savings on buying an income property instead of a home . So , do n't settle for a tenant with bad credit history . <h> 4 . Individuals with criminal records <p> As a landlord , you want to make sure that you , your other tenants ( in case of multi-family properties or condos ) , and your neighbors are safe . This means that you should perform a check on the criminal record of any potential tenant and avoid individuals with criminal history , regardless of how small their wrongdoing might seem . While it is by no means OK to be discriminative against tenants ( and it 's actually illegal in many places ) , you also want to protect your safety and the wellbeing of your real estate investing business . <h> 5 . Tenants who know the legal system too well <p> We 've just said above that you can not simply discriminate against tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your property to such professionals as lawyers , prosecutors , judges , and anyone else too well familiar with the legal system . It is very easy for these people to find the smallest gap in your landlord-tenant agreement and take advantage of it . <h> 6 . Pet lovers <p> Depending on your specific case and your personal preferences , having pets in your rental property could be allowed or not allowed . Well , be careful with people who love pets too much and/or have too many of them . While having a fish tank or even a big dog in a single-family home with a garden could be fine , it is absolutely not OK to rent out your property to the owner of 5 dogs and 10 cats in case of an apartment . The final result will be a massive destruction , in addition to a myriad of problems with the neighbors. <h> 7 . Tenants who seem too noisy , too messy , too dirty <p> If your potential tenants just look dirty and messy and make a ton of noises when visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be once they live in it . While you should not avoid families in general , tenants with several young children who do n't stop running around and screaming their lungs out are not good candidates to rent out your property to . <h> 8 . People who are too picky or feel entitled <p> The last type of tenants to not rent out your property to is people who were born believing they are entitled to everything and are thus too picky . If during the visit to your income property , a potential tenant starts complaining that the dishwasher is too old or the paint is not a nice shade of yellow ( given that that 's not the truth ) , avoid him/her . Such a person would keep demanding more and more from you and would make the experience of being a landlord a nightmare . <p> Once you 've bought a rental property , how successful of a real estate investor you will be depends mostly on the tenants whom you let in your investment property because your rental income will be determined by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spend the needed money to assure that you rent out your property to tenants who are likely to pay on time and in full , not destroy your property , act decently , and keep in good terms with the neighbors. 
@@44409295 @4409295/ <p> As a real estate investor , you are exposed to a wide range of choices : single-family homes vs. multi-family properties or condos ; city vs. countryside properties ; traditional vs . Airbnb renting ; etc . Whereas all these kinds of real estate investments can make you gain or lose money , there are certain types of investments which have been proven over the years as the worst kinds of real estate investments . Following is a list of the investment properties which you should simply avoid as an investor , if you want to make money . <h> 1 . Real estate investments that do n't generate rental income <p> Yes , you hear right . There are various types of investments in real estate which simply do NOT make any rental income . Examples include second homes and lands which you do n't rent out to tenants . You are asking yourself : Why would a real estate investor even think about such an investment ? Well , usually the reason would be that he/she expects high appreciation in the future . However , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always aim for real estate investments which promise high appreciation in order to make money in the long run , you should NEVER EVER go for a property just for appreciation . First of all , it 's risky because you have no guarantee that the value of your property will actually go up . Second , when calculating the final profit , you should factor in the money you could have made if investing the same amount in stocks or just putting it in the bank . So , any successful real estate investor should avoid no-rental-income properties . <h> 3 . Overly luxurious real estate investments <p> Directly related to the previous point is buying investment properties that are just too luxurious . You should keep in mind that people who rent " i.e. , tenants " are generally not too well-off individuals . Otherwise , they would have bought their own home instead of living in someone 's income property and paying for it every month . Thus , they simply ca n't afford to rent a property that will cost a few thousand dollars each month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expensive rental property , you may end up not being able to find tenants or having to rent it out for a much lower rent than what it is worth . In either case , you will have a negative cash flow property . Moreover , expensive properties to buy are expensive to maintain as well , which will put further upward pressure on your costs and push your profitability down . <h> 4 . Real estate investments that you can not afford <p> Sometimes there are these amazing real estate investments that would make wonderful , positive cash flow investment properties . Except for the fact that you simply CAN NOT afford them . For example , rental properties in San Francisco tend to generate great cap rates and CoC returns , but the prices are so high that few real estate investors can afford them . That is to say , do n't go for an investment without budgeting carefully by including all costs associated with it and calculating exactly how much you can afford to invest . If you end up losing a great property to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then that 's one of the worst real estate investments you could possibly make . <p> Airbnb renting has experienced some significant growth in recent years due to the profitability which it offers . In response , many states and/or cities have started issuing prohibitive legislation under pressure from local hotel lobbies . So , although in general Airbnb real estate investments can generate great rental income , you should always check carefully the local laws related to Airbnb prior to buying a property that you plan to use for Airbnb . Otherwise , you run the risk of making one of the worst real estate investments . <h> 6 . Tenant-in-common real estate investments <p> Tenant-in-common ( TIC ) real estate investments are arrangements under which a property is co-owned by two or more individuals through separate , undivided interest . While partnerships can be a great way of diversifying a real estate investment portfolio and of affording a property which you might not be able to buy on your own , experts generally agree that TIC investments should be avoided . TIC investments were particularly popular about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them because of the high costs and fees associated with setting and managing the required agreements . <h> 7 . Timeshares and intervals <p> Another type of bad real estate investments according to many experts includes timeshares and intervals . Timeshares are ownership models in which many individuals own allotments of usage in the same property . Let 's say , in the case of a vacation home in Florida , you could be allowed to use it for the first 2 weeks of June , while other co-owners would use it for the rest of the year . Of course , you can then decide to rent out your timeshares to tenants as a form of real estate investment . Interval funds , on the other hand , are closed-end funds whose shares do not trade on the secondary market . The main problem with both timeshares and intervals is that they are very hard to sell and usually sell for only a fraction of the original price . Moreover , they do not generally produce rental income . So , real estate investors are advised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Real estate development refers to a complicated process comprised of anything related to purchasing land , building on it , designing , constructing new uses , manipulating , renovating , and releasing properties .

Most people are usually attracted to real estate investment in metropolitan areas because of the higher expected return and demand . However , investing in a rural property appeals to a significant number of investors such as those who are looking to spend less , purchase multiple properties or pay fewer taxes . The issue with investing in a rural property is it requires extensive research and experience in real estate because unlike urban properties it- bears more risk . This risk exists because the market- is smaller scaled . <p> The scale of rural properties stretches from ranches , farmhouses and lake houses all the way to mountain cottages or houses in forests . The rural property options available to investors are of a wider variety than those found in cities . So why are people hesitant when it comes to purchasing rural properties ? And what are the advantages that could make people invest in rural properties ? To answer these questions we will consider the pros and cons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competition in the Market <p> There 's usually less competition for a rural property because of the large number of properties available in America 's vast rural landscape . High number of rural properties coupled with the low demand for them eventually creates a minimal or non-existent competition in most rural areas . Compare this with in a big city like New York for example and you understand that competition is fierce and unmerciful at times compared to rural areas . <h> Property Prices are Significantly Cheaper <p> A single rural property usually has an average of one offer per property outside the urban zones . The price decrease is of course influenced by lack of competition in rural areas , which pushes prices down . In some cases like auction sales there is only one interested buyer at court auctions . The price an average investor would pay in a rural property could be as low as half of what they would pay in a big urban city . <h> Expansion and Development <p> Many people purchase a rural property as a long-term planning scheme .

The prices of rural properties certainly help investors to achieve that dream of becoming real estate market leaders . <h> Less Regulations and Laws <p> The regulation and laws advantage for rural properties are less than those present in urban areas in terms of property development . Restrictions are not as close as big cities where property development is restricted by municipality or state laws . The regulations of rural zones also makes it easier for owners to rent their homes on a service like Airbnb without having to deal with strict Airbnb regulations- in cities like New York or Los Angeles . <h> Cons <h> Fewer Public Service <p> Purchasing a rural property comes with its own disadvantages .

If an investor is lending money to purchase a rural property it might not be wise to depend on any revenue from the property to cover the loan . After all , rural properties are long term investments that wo n't pay their dividends any time soon . <h> Small Towns and Tourism <p> Small towns are evidently more quiet and peaceful than the big cities .

One of the main advantages which out-of-state real estate investing can offer comparing to purchasing a property nearby is the actual market .

Which are the best neighborhoods ? What are the economic trends ? How are the people there ? These are all questions you wo n't be able to answer yourself just from living in the place . Simply , you do n't have the same intimate knowledge of a distant market . However , there are a few things you can do to alleviate the problems : <p> Consider a place you are somewhat familiar with : where you grew up , where you go for vacations , where you went to college , where you have friends and relatives ( they will be an invaluable source of information about the place ) , etc. ; <p> Do some good ( online ) research : this is basically the same as buying in your own state .

In addition , key calculations and comps are provided , which can help you understand the market and how existing rentals are performing . <h> 2 . Unfamiliarity with the Legal Regulations . <p> If you live in a place and own a home there , you are likely to be familiar with all the bank and legal procedures for purchasing and managing a house or apartment in that place . However , regulations vary vastly from one place to another , so you are most likely to be very unaware of the laws in case of out-of-state real estate investing . That 's manageable though .

Even if you have to travel from afar , it is always a good idea to check out a property several times " in different hours , on different days " before making the final decision . To save yourself some time and trouble , you can hire a real estate agent to do some of the work for you . You can also arrange for a professional inspection of the property before you visit . If the inspection shows too many problems , then maybe you do n't have to visit at all . <h> 4 .

This will save you a lot of time and stress " and potentially even money " compared to the situation in which you have to travel several hundred ( or thousand ) miles every time a pipe breaks . <p> If you are looking for a rental property and your local market does not seem to offer the perfect solution , do n't be scared to look out of state .

@@44409304 @4409304/ <h> 6 Things to Know About Real Estate Appreciation <p> One of the greatest ongoing debates in real estate investing has been whether you should invest for cash flow or for appreciation . Which investment model is better for you depends mostly on your reasons to invest in real estate and for how long you plan to keep your property . If you are in real estate investing for some extra monthly income and you do n't plan to keep your property for more than 10-15 years , then you should focus on the cash flow , i.e. , the amount of money left from the rent you charge after you cover all expenses . If , on the other hand , you are in real estate with the goal of selling your property in the long run after the price has risen significantly , then you must concentrate on real estate appreciation . <p> There are many factors which determine real estate appreciation , some of which are more obvious , while others are rather obscure . <h> 1. - Land <p> If you are looking for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to buy a home , do n't allow yourself to overstress the appearance and the structure of the property . Of course , the actual physical property is important especially if you plan to live there yourself in the long term , but that 's actually what depreciates in value year after year . Regardless of how beautiful your property is , the physical structure will lose its worth over time . The IRS also acknowledges that as it factors in depreciation in determining taxes . In addition , maintaining the property will require more and more capital investments over time to keep it running . Thus , you must focus on the land . Land does not only decrease in value as it ages ; on the contrary , it is what drives real estate appreciation . As the population is constantly increasing , more people are looking for homes , more and more properties are getting built , land becomes more and more expensive . So , if you have the option of buying a larger and nicer house on a smaller piece of land or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land for the same amount of money , go for the latter . This will bring you more real estate appreciation in the long run . <h> 2. - Location <p> The second factor determining real estate appreciation is closely related to land . Once again , the actual physical structure is only of secondary importance . Real estate property value at any point is a function of supply and demand , while the appearance , the functionality , and the maintenance of the physical structure have a lesser impact . Location is the key ! Location refers to many aspects " the state , the city , the neighborhood , the exact place within the neighborhood . Locations within markets with higher population growths , better economies , more developed infrastructures , and off main roads are in higher demand and are also more likely to provoke real estate appreciation in the future . <p> You can use Mashvisor to obtain comparative analytics for various locations across the US. <h> 3. - Future Development Plans <p> The currently existing infrastructure will significantly impact the market value of your real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should also study the governmental and commercial plans for the further development of the area in the future . If you buy a decent house in a not very lively suburb which is scheduled to undergo major infrastructural and commercial developments ( connection with the city , schools , hospitals , banks , restaurants , etc. ) in the next 5-10 years , you are guaranteed to benefit from massive real estate appreciation . <h> 4. - The Physical Structure <p> Although we kept repeating that the structure and functionality of the building are not the number 1 factor in real estate appreciation , they still do matter . Generally smaller , less attractive properties tend to appreciate faster . There is a pretty simple explanation for that , once again related to land . Let 's say you have two houses on equal land parcels next to each other , one of the houses being twice bigger and thus more expensive than the other . Both land parcels will appreciate by the same amount over a certain amount of time . So , while the bigger house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market value of the second one will rise by 20% . It turns out that the smaller , cheaper house provides a better return on investment . <h> 5. - The Economy <p> While you can control the physical structure and the location of your real estate property , there are other determinants of real estate appreciation that are well beyond your control . One of them is the economy " the local economy , the national economy , and the global economy . As we mentioned above , locations within more vibrant local economies will appreciate more over time . Moreover , if the US economy is doing well and people are employed , the demand for housing will increase , which means that prices of both land and properties will go up . Similarly , specific large economies and the global economy as a whole affect the US stock market , which in return impacts the entire US economy . <h> 6. - Interest Rates and Lending Guidelines <p> Another important factor which will influence not only your property 's real estate appreciation but the whole housing market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Fed pushes the interest rate up , people will be less able to afford loans , which means that real estate prices will go down . In reverse , lower interest rates will push prices up as more people will look for homes . Similarly , tighter lending guidelines , like those imposed immediately after the housing crisis , will disqualify any potential buyers . Loosening guidelines , on the other hand , will make it easier for more people to afford buying a home , which will bring prices up . <p> Finally , there are many other factors which influence the real estate market and could lead to real estate appreciation or depreciation . These include demographics ( how fact the population is growing ) , the availability of building materials , and foreclosures , to list a few .

@@44409307 @4409307/ <h> What are the challenges of owning an Airbnb investment property ? <p> There is no arguing that Airbnb is the up and coming trend in the real estate market in recent times . Airbnb has revolutionized the real estate industry in so many ways that it has brought in a new batch investors who are willing and able to take risks on an- investment property . These people who were not prepared to risk their money on traditional long-term investments have decided that short-term Airbnb investments are actually worth it and for a good reason . <p> Unlike traditional renting methods , Airbnb rentals have proven they generate more money for a shorter amount of time stayed by tenants . This happens basically because Airbnb properties are n't considered ordinary rental houses but they 're being labeled as luxury rentals because of the services they provide . <p> While Airbnb sounds like an easy and laid-back plan to earn money throughout the year , there are some downfalls and challenges facing landlords all the time . Your Airbnb investment property becomes your reputation for the future of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't face this problem because none of their tenants have the chance to post their reviews online to million of other users to see and take a point from . In Airbnb , any mistake or unpreparedness will lead to negative reviews . I have personally throughout my travels just skipped past an Airbnb investment property so many times- just as soon as I notice a couple of bad reviews . It is such a competitive rental platforms with so many options that I could afford time and luxury of being picky . <p> I will be discussing the challenges faced by Airbnb investment property owners to maintain a high quality standard for their listing while also generating a stable- income every year . <h> Time Management <p> If you do n't  have enough time to manage and be in control of your investment property then you will find itchallenging to increase demand for your listing . An Airbnb listing will need time to clean the house , being available for emergencies like repairs and finally being there to greet the guests and let them in . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a routine plan in place . For example , you can send guests the information they need , they can use an app such as Lockitron to access the property , and a housekeeper can take care of turnover and restocking supplies . Its important to build and maintain - an efficient system . <h> Expenses <p> Whether you are new to the real estate market or switching your focus from traditional rentals to short-term Airbnb rentals , you will find that expenses will be higher than usual . This affects most Airbnb hosts because when guests are making a booking on Airbnb they are expecting a few amenities to be provided by default . This includes consumables like shampoo , toothpaste , fresh towels , cleaning services , drinking water and in some houses refreshments or wine to give a good impression to the guest . All this comes with high expenses , but we have to look at it from a different angle . These expenses you make should n't be scaring you into thinking that your turnover will be less than what you expected because these services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person marketing techniques . If guests are staying at your property and all this leaves a good impression on them you can rest assured that their Airbnb review on your property will only serve as bait to attract more and more guests . <h> Having a Killer Location <p> The simple answer is that it is very important to screen locations and check if tourists or short-term rental guests do rate that location to be desirable. - They aim to be at the heart of cities they visit because the idea of commuting around town all day does n't appeal to a person who has a limited amount of time to explore his/her surroundings . However , in some cities investing in the city center can be too expensive . In that case the investor should be purchasing property that is easy to commute to or one that revolves around another busy district of the city . In real estate business , the more central the location of the property you are purchasing the higher the return it will yield in the future and in the case of Airbnb hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Off-Season <p> There are many ways to challenge this daunting prospect of having some months where your bookings will suffer a significant blow because of winter season mainly . During the off-season , your main concern should be minimizing your losses because for most investment property owners they will still need to pay taxes , mortgages and expenses . You can start by reducing the price of your listing for that time period to make enticing for guests to pursue their holiday at your place . Adding some incentives for guests like free breakfast or a free city bus tour can also make guests put your listing on the top of their list when choosing a vacation booking . <h> Be prepared to deal with damages and troublesome guests <p> It goes without saying that any investment property that is up for rent will face this risk . However , with Airbnb it is higher because of the short-term rental system that gives a higher turnover of guests per year . This can make your property more prone to damages and it would mean at some point you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve these issues in a way that would n't damage your reviews and reputation by studying the legal aspects of damages and fining or kicking out guests . <p> An investment property is - a way to boost your income , with Airbnb it has become easier .

Knowing these challenges and being prepared for them can act as a guideline to ensuring the quality of your investment . 
@@44409309 @4409309/ <h> The Advantages and Disadvantages of Buying a Duplex House as an Investment Property <p> One of the best things about real estate investing is that it offers a variety of options for potential owners . The options can range from single apartments to full residential buildings , from single family homes to multi family properties , and each investment can bring success in its own right to the real estate investor . The trick to making any type of real estate investment work is to understand all the aspects of the property and the profits it can generate . One type of investment that has divided opinion amongst real estate investors is a duplex house purchase . <p> A duplex property- is basically a residential building that hosts two households , each with their own separate entrance . That feature of buying a 2-in-1 investment property makes the prices of a duplex house higher than normal apartments due to their bigger size and unique features . However , it is cheaper than buying separate houses because of the common wall and others . <p> The ideal real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to invest in a property that gives him/her a place to live while also making money from renting the other part of the duplex . On paper it is a very smart investment move , which begs the question " Why are- duplex house purchases not a common trend ? " Well , the thing about duplex house investments is that they are very hard to find . The availability of that type of property is usually limited , and in addition most duplex houses are not worth their price . To find one that will generate rental income and pay off your mortgages , it has to be a really great duplex house . <p> Owning a duplex house as an investment property has its advantages and disadvantages , which is why they usually divide opinions . Let 's look at the most important pros and cons : <h> Advantages of Investing in a Duplex House <h> 1 . Increased Rental Income <p> For investors who will be renting out both parts of the property , there is a possibility to generate more rental income compared to what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire place could be an option as well if a tenant wants to rent both parts . A duplex house , a good one , would also have an outdoor space or a garden that could pump up the price , which means that the opportunities to make more profit are there . <h> 2 . Positive Reselling Value <p> Like most real estate investments , buying a duplex house and then turning it into a better quality one with added renovation costs can increase the value of the property . An owner can even renovate and sell only one part of the duplex and make a considerable profit on that sale . That both units of the duplex have their own entrance , bathrooms , kitchen , and utilities gives it a strong selling point . <h> 3 . Good Intro to Real Estate Investing <p> Buying a duplex house can be a learning experience for beginners in the real estate market . While finding an investment property that will serve a double purpose is not easy , it is still easier than to find a rental property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house investment would be ideal . An investor can purchase the property- and use one part of the duplex as a home for him/herself and his/her family , while- the other part can be rented out to a tenant . Being close to your own rental property and to the tenant can prove to be a very helpful experience without requiring too much effort due to the proximity to the rental property . <h> 4 . Perfect for Airbnb <p> A duplex house might be the perfect fit to become an Airbnb rental property while providing convenience to the owner . Renting homes on Airbnb has proved to be tiresome for most owners because of the preparations needed like cleaning and the high turnover of guests . However , living next to your own Airbnb rental while still enjoying the comforts of privacy will lead to bigger profits without losing much time , effort , or money . <h> Disadvantages of Investing in a Duplex House <h> 1 . Dealing with Bad Tenants <p> Owning a duplex house and then sharing the other part with a tenant could prove troublesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bad tenants because of the financial losses they might face as a result of- damages . Living next to your tenant brings a new dimension to the problem of bad tenants that you have to suffer living in close proximity to them . Loud or noisy tenants could disrupt the living environment of the owners . <h> 2 . Limited Location Options <p> Finding a duplex house is not easy , that is a fact . They are not available in all areas or neighborhoods in cities . If you are looking to buy a duplex house in a central zone of most cities , chances of finding one- will be very slim . This forces investors interested in such an investment to suffer forced locations that will be mostly suburban areas . <h> Conclusion <p> Investing in a duplex house can be a very profitable investment for owners if they are able to avoid certain mistakes associated with investing in such properties . Overpaying for a duplex property might result in a horrible investment , relatively low rental income , and even negative cash flow . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing and living in a bad neighborhood . However , if these mistakes can be avoided and the investor is sure of the demand and calculates well the profit , then investing in a duplex house would prove a masterstroke .

Most people will talk about the good and exciting sides of real estate investments to advertise it and make it more appealing to neutrals and potential investors . The reality is , investing in real estate has risks and a hidden ugly side that you probably wo n't hear about or experience until you are there . The best possible way to prepare you entirely for all possibilities in real estate is to discuss all of them at length to be prepared , whether it is the good or ugly side of real estate . <p> The idea of discussing the ugly side of real estate is not to demotivate you as a potential investor ; on the contrary , it is the best possible way to prepare you for the obstacles that are ahead . If you are already familiar with the risks and negatives already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to fight through them accordingly . <p> We will discuss in length some of the major negatives and challenges that face investors in the real estate market today . Dealing with them will vary on personality , experience and financial power certainly . However , I will discuss briefly ways to deal with these challenges . <h> 5 Negatives of Investing in Real Estate <h> Vacancies in Real Estate <p> Problem : Vacancies are a problem but are being minimized greatly in real estate . Many in the business try to underestimate it and not give it too much attention but the truth is , the issue is real and it is big . There is so much competition in the market nowadays . The chances of not finding tenants are higher than before because you need to compete in terms of quality , price and location with other investors . <h> Beware of Maintenance Costs <p> Problem : The thing about maintenance costs is that you can never be prepared for it . Investing in real estate comes with maintenance risks , everyone agrees on that . Investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will need to pay more in maintenance and that can be the difference between profiting and losing your investment . <p> Solution : Avoiding this problem only requires you to pay attention and make proper overall inspections for the investment property you intend to purchase . After that , it is important to insure your property from tenant damages either by a legal agreement or security deposit which guarantees to hold them accountable for any damages them do . <h> Overpaying for a Property <p> Problem : When you are investing in real estate , - you always look for the cheapest price available in the criteria of property you need . The price is dependent on market prices , location , appreciation and renovations . It is possible to overpay for a property because you might visit four or five different properties , yet your emotional attachment has been to the most expensive one . That basically means that you overpaid already , without taking into consideration possibilities of dip in market prices . <p> Solution : Emotional attachment for investment properties should be non-existent for you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose based on logical reasoning that takes into consideration your financial situation and your financial goals . If you have to over-pay , then find a way to increase monthly income in order to maintain positive cash-flow . <h> The Tenant Dilemma <p> Problem : Tenants who are living in your property are the best example of how things can go bad in real estate . Having bad tenants that are regularly damaging property and putting you at risk of legal action from neighbors or authorities is the worst thing to deal with . The problem with tenants is it does n't much how much screening you make ; there is no certainty to avoid the bad apples in a sea of tenants . <p> Solution : The only possible solution to avoid clashing or legal/financial issues from tenants is to have legal protection . Hire a lawyer that will draft you a lease agreement that protects you from the actions of your tenants when it comes to damages or contract laws being broken . That way you are at least somehow secure on that front . <h> Property Selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier when you know what you are looking for , what your budget permits , and what the objectives . Selling your investment is a completely different thing . You will be listing your property , along with thousands of other properties for sale , each of them having different prices and characteristics . Most people think they are able to sell their properties without professional help from third parties who are experienced in that area , but it is recommended to use an agent . <p> Solution : There is only one way to avoid being stale for years on the market trying to sell your property . Be sure to ask for a reasonable price from potential buyers , being greedy wo n't help . Buyers do their research too . Use real estate agents to advertise the property and bring in visitors to see it and to negotiate with you . Finally , do n't invest in an " unsellable " location . Before purchasing , educate yourself about future construction plans ensure people will favor the area . <p> These are a short list of the negatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what type of investor you are will determine if you 'll face all these issues or not . It all depends on so many factors that are decided by your choices . The ugly side of real estate is sometimes unavoidable ; the purpose of this article is problem solving in these certain cases .

Investing in real estate is often perceived as less risky than investing in stocks because you are very unlikely to just lose everything in real estate . However , people sometimes get the wrong impression that buying a rental property with the extra cash they have and a loan from the bank will definitely guarantee them quick returns with virtually no risk . If you yourself are considering buying a rental property and becoming a landlord , do n't be confused . Real estate investing is not risk-free . <p> In this article , we summarize some of the most popular and important risks that come with a rental property . <h> 1. - Buying Worse Than Expected Rental Property <p> Definitely , buying the right property in the right location is one of the most important factors that will determine how profitable your investment in real estate is . When you are choosing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part-time job . You are not buying the home of your dreams to live there with your beloved ones . You are buying a property that will make money for you . In order to make some good profit , it is important not to overspend on this property before you even get your first tenant . Do n't get tricked by some unneeded extras while missing on major defects . Make sure you do n't buy a rental property that is more damaged than it first looks just because you are blinded by a beautiful fireplace or an amazing view from the window . <p> To avoid the risk of buying a rental property that is in a worse shape than you initially thought , get an inspection . Bringing an inspector to the property you are considering will take a few hours of your time , but this professional will discover any hidden damages or problems that you will need to fix before renting out the property . <h> 2. - Not Being Able to Get Tenants . <p> Buying a rental property does not automatically guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a good property and prepared it for renting , you might get stuck finding tenants . This problem is especially risky if you 've taken a loan from the bank to purchase the property expecting that the monthly rent will cover the mortgage payments . If you can not find an appropriate tenant , you will have to cover the mortgage , insurance , property taxes , and other expenses from your other sources of income such as salary , savings , and other investments . Having said that , though , do n't make the mistake of allowing just any tenant to move into your rental property because you are so desperate to get some positive cash flow . The next point discusses the risks associated with having a bad tenant . <p> To minimize the risk of being unable to find a good tenant , you should do your homework well before purchasing an actual rental property . Make sure you choose a property that is in high demand . Choose a location with high occupancy rates . You can always consult Mashvisor to check out vacancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3. - Having Bad Tenants <p> Obviously , getting tenants is a prerequisite for making money from your rental property . However , getting just any tenant does not guarantee you profitability . The risk of having a bad tenant and getting stuck with him/her could be even worse than the risk of not having a tenant at all . True , not having tenants means 0 rental income . However , if you get bad tenants , you run the risk of your rent not being paid on time while utility costs being accumulated . Additionally , depending on how bad your tenants are , your rental property might get more damaged that normal use supposes . If your tenant is a really bad one , refuses to pay the rent for several months in a row , and destroys the property too much , you might even risk dealing with an eviction . You will have to go to the local court , file a notice , schedule a court date , show up on that date , empty the property , and repair it . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ) and time-consuming ( up to a few months ) procedures . Thus , it is crucial that you do everything possible to choose good tenants . <p> To try to avoid the risk of having bad tenants , go through the process of selecting tenants carefully . Put for yourself some unwritten rules about what kind of tenants you would feel most comfortable in dealing with . Meanwhile , make sure you do n't discriminate against potential tenants on the basis of age , gender , religion , social status , etc . When you choose possible tenants , ask for recommendations from previous landlords and/or employers . Write a very specific lease agreement . If you are unable to find good tenants , it might be a better idea to lower a bit the rent that you are asking for for your rental property than getting just any tenant to start receiving rental income . Another important thing " make sure you get the landlord insurance . It is higher than the insurance you pay for the property you live in , but the risks associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you have this insurance if you will have to deal with any serious damage caused by bad tenants . <p> Another option is to hire a professional property manager " either an individual or a company which will deal with your tenants directly . You will have to pay the property manager a fee , but this will save you a lot of troubles in communicating and following up with the tenants . <h> 4. - Higher Than Expected Expenses <p> Let 's face it . The cost related to being a landlord does not finish with the purchase of the actual rental property . Just like any other property , rental properties require constant expenses . You have the mortgage payment , taxes ( higher than for your primary home ) , insurance ( higher than for your home ) , and maintenance ( potentially higher than in your home because of the risks associated with tenants ) . Ideally , the rental income will cover all these costs , and there will be plenty left to guarantee you a positive cash flow " that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having to pay money for your rental property instead of making money from it , do your homework carefully before becoming a landlord . Do the math . Make the proper calculations before buying a rental property to know how much it will cost you and how much it will bring to you . Make sure you will get positive cash flow . <h> 5. - Real Estate Market Failure <p> The real estate market has been growing quite well in the past few years , but there is no guarantee that this positive trend will continue . One risk with investing in real estate is the concentration of assets . For most people , owning a rental property is a serious concentration of assets because purchasing this property will require a major portion of their net worth , potentially even all of it . Since as a landlord , your investment will not be diversified , if let 's say the neighborhood , the city , or even the national economy goes downhill , you risk losing lots and lots of money in depreciation . <p> An option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your investment is to pull your money with some other investors and launch a residential investment company . This is a small business for buying , renting out , and selling rental properties . It is very similar to what you would do as an individual investor but will give you the possibility of distributing your money as shares in several properties in different neighborhoods , cities , states , and why not even countries . In this way , you can minimize the risks associated with local economic and real estate market conditions . <p> While you should be careful when making the decision to enter real estate investing , please do n't allow these risks to prevent you from buying a rental property and becoming a successful landlord . Just make sure to consider the risks in advance and build a strategy for how to avoid them . 
@@44409317 @4409317/ <h> 5 Reasons to Avoid Investing in Condos Because of the Condo Fees <p> In real estate investing there is no shortage of options available to potential real estate investors and landlords.An investor can choose to purchase a house , an apartment , a duplex house , or even a condo . Personal preference , location , and finances influence the purchasing choices of buyers . Condominium or condo is a type of real estate property that is divided into multiple units , with each unit being separately owned . The definition of condo might sound identical to an apartment building ; however , the main difference is that condos generally offer a wider range of service or facilities to the people who live there . These services of course come at a price , which is called- condo fees- and which is- paid monthly by the condo owner . <p> Owners pay condo fees in return for maintenance and running costs of the building . Condo fees include concierge , security services , gyms , pools , carpet and wall cleaning , maintenance of common areas , insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . These monthly fees are decided upon by the condo 's board of directors who oversee the operations of the condo as a whole . Condo owners share the fees equally because each owner has the same rights to access the common areas as the rest . <p> The dilemma facing most investors interested in purchasing a condo is a justified one . Condo fees play a huge role in pushing buyers away because it 's an additional monthly cost that could become a bad investment over time . Other , meanwhile , - argue that condos are worth it because even single-family homeowners- pay costs for maintenance and upkeep without getting the services offered in condos . To understand if condo fees are worth their price , an owner must consider a number of factors . <h> Are Condo Fees Worth It ? <h> 1 . Financial Implications of Condos <p> An interested condo buyer who is aiming to finance the purchase by applying for a mortgage might be pushed away from the idea . Condo fees are generally included in the mortgage calculation when applying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the mortgage calculation , which could result in the need of a bigger down payment or more years to pay off the monthly mortgage payments . Thus , a condo does not look like an ideal purchase considering the financial implications . <h> 2 . Overvalued Cost of Services <p> Condos are very attractive real estate investments because of the services they provide for owners . But are these services worth it ? For example , if condo fees are calculated at $600 per month for security , maintenance of common areas , pool , gym and garbage collection , - the amount being paid is considerably high because a condo owner will still have to pay for utilities and in some cases mortgage payments . <h> 3 . Bad Management of Condos <p> A condo is managed by a group of condo owners ( the condos board of directors ) who make all the decisions about how the condo fees collected from owners will be spent to maintain and improve the property . The downside of- this idea is that in many cases bad management can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad management will directly affect condo owners with a lower standard of services and eventually more condo fees to be paid to fix the situation . Moreover , in the case of real estate investors , it will be hard to find tenants willing to pay the extra rent for questionable services . In most cases , the condo owner ends up on the losing side . <h> 4 . Not A Great Investment <p> Paying condo fees in the hopes of having a higher valued property after years to come would appeal to many real estate investors . Unfortunately , this is not the case . Condo values have a lower resale value than single-family homes or apartments . The reason is that single-family homes give owners complete control over the property they purchase unlike a condo , which gives ( limited ) control over the owned area only . Apartments also have more freedom in terms of redecorating and renovations that can push their price upwards , but condos meet a lot of restrictions in that aspect . <h> 5 . Unused Facilities <p> Paying condo fees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tenants means it is definitely a bad investment . After all , the appeal of condos for buyers is the services they provide such as swimming pools and gyms . So , if an investor feels that the money to be paid for services which might not attract tenants willing to spend more on rent , - then it is better to stay away . <h> A Case for Condo Ownership <p> Purchasing and enduring condo fees might sound like a step in the wrong direction considering the nature of the investment . However , it is important to note that condo fees can in some cases be worth the investment . Buying a condo is usually cheaper than purchasing a house that would give a justification of those fees if they included utilities . A condo that provides gas , water , electricity , and Internet as part of its fees could be a great purchase given that the condo fees are reasonably priced . It can give the buyer room to save more money or use it for the mortgage payments . Also , it eliminates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves or to hire a professional property management company . <h> Conclusion <p> In a logical thinking process , it is extremely evident that condo fees are only worth the money in very rare cases . The analysis of the market and the other property options that are available to real estate investors make condos a bad investment if building a real estate portfolio is the aim . People invest in real estate to make money and to write their own path of success . Condos are too risky because owners do n't have the power they need in order to succeed . Owning a house means a real estate investor gains full control to ensure that his/her efforts will pay off at the end . <p> To learn more about the pros and cons of owning a condo as a real estate investment property and other aspects of the real estate investing business , check out Mashvisor.

Some hosts have become- full-time investor hosts and have been able to purchase more Airbnb investment properties from their income . Joining the world of Airbnb hosts is taking advantage of Airbnb 's high-demand service , intertwined with two huge industries " tourism and real estate . Here 's why more and more people are taking up Airbnb as an investment . <p> 1 . No Shortage of Customers <p> The main reason travelers prefer Airbnb over short-term lodging is the ability to rent out an entire house for the same or cheaper price as a hotel . Now tourists get to roam around the city as a local and come home to a place that is actually a home . With different properties to choose from , travelers can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether they 're looking to stay in a boat or a castle , they can find it on Airbnb . <p> 2 . Flexibility <p> While managing a property on Airbnb means work and has been adopted as a full-time job by some , there is flexibility in this type of investing . No matter the property type , an investor can gain rental income . There 's no worry about leases or interviewing tenants . Airbnb is a platform to invest and build a business at one 's own pace and terms . Bottom line , Airbnb means quickly finding tenants , completing transactions , and eliminating a lot of paperwork using one platform . <p> However , there are rules and regulations regarding short-term rentals . A successful Airbnb investor is one who knows what 's Airbnb legal and acts accordingly . <p> For those living in cities with high home price to rent ratios , it 's impossible to meet the 1% or 2% rule . This rule states the minimum rent should be equal to or greater than 1% of the purchase price . Imagine trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Airbnb capacitates investors to follow this rule and more . In this case , Airbnb investors should set the nightly price to be greater than daily rent ( monthly rent/30 days ) . Hence , assuming there is a 100% occupancy rate , investors can easily meet or exceed the 1% rule . Even with a 30% occupancy rate , investors can still profit more than a traditional lease . <p> Take a look at the example below . <p> 4 . Quick Income <p> Branching off from the previous point , Airbnb investment can follow the 1% rule in an even shorter amount of time . Let 's look at an Airbnb case study reported by our friends at BiggerPockets .

They are usually seeking touristy ( aka expensive ) places . Based on the financial breakdown above , it is now feasible to compete in highly sought-after , pricey cities . This is a great advantage for investments because the number one rule in real estate is location , location , location . <p> 6 . Easier Labor <p> Assuming the property is not damaged ( fingers crossed ) , the turnover between tenants can be much easier and less expensive to handle than with long-term leases . The vacation property should not require the same transforming recovery as a leased apartment . If there are short-term rentals in high demand , then the property is constantly being maintained which is an easier approach than an entire renovation .

The unfortunate series of events that led to the housing crisis- left house prices at an all time low in the 21st- century . The recovery of the housing market only began to show after 2012 , when property prices started to increase gradually showing recovery of the real estate market . However , due to the nature of the real estate business , some sectors of the industry actually recovered faster than others . This includes- luxury rentals- which were among- the investment properties- that were affected the least . So does it make sense to invest in luxury rentals in today 's market ? <p> To understand more if luxury rentals are profitable or not for investment purposes , it 's important to define what they are exactly . Price , location , features , and facilities can define luxury rentals in the real estate market . However , in todays market the criteria of what makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tenants- have different understandings of what a luxury rental property is . However , there is a certain set of widely recognized criteria that define a luxury property compared to others : <p> Higher Price : A luxury rental property will most probably have a higher price and charge more rent than most of the other properties present in the same- location . <p> Prime Location : It does n't matter where exactly the luxury property is in terms of a city or a state . If the location of the property is as a coveted location by many people , then the property on that location can qualify as a luxury rental property . <p> Best Quality : The material used for the constructing and finishing of the property has to be above the average standard of other properties . <p> Amenities and Appliances : Luxury rentals will most likely have the highest quality and availability of amenities and appliances for tenants . Amenities like swimming pools , cinemas , and arcade rooms make a property qualify as a luxury home . <p> Privacy and Security : People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them comfortably . Many of them require the security of their property to be of the highest standard . Luxury rentals provide that in the form of high walls , big yards , and gated entrances to keep the privacy of tenants . <p> These criteria are the basic ones that define luxury rentals . Judging by the specifications of these properties , it is inevitable that they will cost real estate investors a lot of money to purchase and renovate them . What must investors look for before purchasing a luxury rental property ? <h> Reasons for Investing in Luxury Rentals <h> 1 . Investment Goals <p> This is the most important aspect of luxury rentals investing . A potential owner who has enough money or a good credit score to be able to purchase a luxury property has two options : renting out the property or fix-and-flip . Both depend on the goals of the investor . If the aim is short-term profit making then , the owner of the property might have to go for the- fix and flip strategy . Fix and flip basically means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of making it better in terms of quality i.e. , making it even more luxurious and then resells it for a higher price . <p> The second option is luxury rentals , which is the better option for real estate investors who have set their investment goals for the long-term . A luxury rental can be a great source of income because of the rental income that can be generated monthly . The rental of a luxury property is not only a source of income for an investor 's long-term plans , but it also serves well in case of appreciation for the property . Having the property rented for years before deciding to sell it will prevent from premature selling that could cost so much in appreciation income that could be earned later . <h> 2 . Attractive Locations <p> Luxury rentals are usually built in the most attractive neighborhoods or areas in a certain location . The ability to advertise that location with that type of luxury property makes it way easier to market the property and be positive about avoiding vacancies . Tenants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location of their new home ; this is why finding a luxury rental with a location appeal is extremely important . The location is also another factor that helps in the real estate appreciation aspect of the property . A property with an amazing location will almost surely have high appreciation rates . <h> 3 . MakIng Serious Money <p> Luxury rentals make serious money for their owners because they 're unique to find and above standard properties . An investment of this type usually takes time to pay off its dues , but in the long term the property can give massive profit in return on investment . For example , buying a 300-square-meter apartment that needs renovations would cost $400,000 . If the renovations cost an additional $80,000 , this makes the initial investment in the property equivalent to $480,000 . Pricing that property after all renovations at $800,000 means that the investor will surely make money off this property sooner rather than later .

The fact that this type of market has n't been affected massively by the global financial crisis and its ability to recover in such swift manner make it a safer bet for real estate investors . Luxury rentals can be a source of great income if the investor is prepared to turn a property into a luxury rental . This needs the best of the best in all aspects of the business . Luxury properties can be defined as the hardest investment to have because they require a long-term vision and patience in the real estate market for them to pay off eventually . <p> Once you have decided on the type of investment property that is best for you either a luxury rental or a more common one do n't  forget to check out Mashvisor for numerous properties available in the US.

There is no denying that to have a safe investment , a certain level of responsibility rests on the shoulders of the owner because it is their duty . <p> Renters expect to rent a property that is safe and functioning that will not put them in any danger or risks . The renters have a contractual obligation to keep the property they rent clean and not damaged to please the owner of the flat . In return , an owner needs to cross off a list of routine checks that are extremely necessary to avoid any issues . <h> 4 Steps for Having a Safe Investment Property <h> Physical Condition of the Property <p> Owning a property that passes the minimum physical requirements is solely reliant on the owner . There is a legal rule called the Implied Warranty of Habitability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure that the- property is habitable when tenants move in and throughout the tenancy period . <h> Removing Any Hazards from the Property <p> Electrical wiring , plumbing , heating systems and carbon monoxide detection are the main list of hazards that could affect tenants renting your property . Any faults in these areas can result in damages to the property or injuries to tenants , which is even worse . Injuries to tenants because of a faulty electrical wire can place you as an owner at risk of a lawsuit because it is the responsibility of the owner to prevent these problems from happening . Safety checks are key to owning a safe investment property . <h> Security of the Property and Tenants <p> The security and safety of your tenants should be of paramount importance . Tenants who feel unsafe living in a rental property are more than likely to leave because of the risks they feel . As an owner it is an obligation to invest money in good security systems , which includes secure windows , doors and intercom systems .

The most common issue landlords face is damages to property that leaves their property at a constant risk and in need of repairs that cost a lot of money . Airtight lease agreements with your tenants are one way of protecting your property to keep it safe . <h> Reviews <p> The real estate market depends on reviews and reputations .

But the extra work a landlord will put in to have a safe investment that is fully operational removes any liability of harm or damages to tenants or property from the owner . The risk becomes lower on the landlord to take responsibility . Safety procedures for properties are not a recommendation but they are an obligation of a landlord to the tenant to keep them safe .

For real estate owners and potential buyers , there comes an investing solution that could benefit both : lease options . It gives the owner a chance to make profit of the investment while renting to a potential buyer . For a tenant , it gives them a lease , but the chance to own their own property after a number of years . <p> The basic definition- of a lease to own option is when an owner gives the tenant the option to buy the property at the end of the lease .

This gives the buyer time to prepare a down payment or improve their credit ratings for a mortgage before the purchase date . <p> A purchase price for the property is usually agreed upon at the signing of the agreement . This is a huge advantage for the buyer who will avoid additional costs of appreciation of the property after a number of years of renting have passed . <p> Lease to own can act as a trial period for the buyer .

It allows them the opportunity to get settled in at their future home until they are able to purchase it completely . <h> Disadvantages <p> Lease to own does not make the buyer an owner of that property . It will still belong to the seller , which provides him or her with full control over the property . It might be a minor issue but for the buyer , it will feel like being a tenant and not a homeowner . <p> The plan might not work out because as buyer you might not be able to improve credit rating or save up for a down payment .

Instead of having a vacant house , then a monthly fee in the form of rent will be ideal with an option to purchase . <p> Unlike normal rentals , a lease to own tenant is more likely to maintain the conditions of your property because of their option on purchasing it eventually . This allows the seller to save some money in repairs and maintenance costs over the years . <h> Disadvantages <p> If the seller is in need of bigger amounts of cash then lease to own wo n't help with that .

@@44409333 @4409333/ <h> How to Pick the Perfect Tenant from Multiple Applications <p> The real estate market is a very competitive business . For a landlord , it is normal to receive a huge number of applications from potential tenants who are interested in renting a property . While this is great news for property owners , it can be difficult choosing the best tenant . Having a number of qualified applicants to choose from gives the owner power in being selective to rent the property for tenants who fit a list of criteria . This dilemma can sometimes become a problem for owners who get confused because of an inability to select an applicant when many fit the profile of a perfect tenant . <h> Complying with the Fair Housing Act <p> Some owners who are inexperienced in the real estate market make errors in their listings . One of the primary mistakes made by owners is that they fail to narrow down their criteria . The narrowing down of criteria should be based on the Fair Housing Act , which makes it illegal for owners to be selective based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability to name a few . <p> A fair and equal qualification criterion for tenants should be based on credit score , rental history , income , employment history and criminal background . It is easy to make tenants aware of the minimum requirements set for each area by stating it in the listing website or on printed paper when viewing . An owner can also ask tenants about these areas directly if they are inquiring by phone or email . <p> Credit Score : A credit score gives the owner an overall summary of a tenant 's financial situation . A tenant with a low credit score does n't mean that they 're unqualified to be tenants , but in order to consider one tenant with a bad credit score , the rest with a similar rating must be considered . However , owners tend to favor tenants with a good credit score because of they are more financially stable . <p> Rental History : Rental history is one of the most important criteria an owner evaluates . The references a potential tenant can show to a property owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner . References show that a perfect tenant can pay the rent on time , be well mannered- and finally responsible in taking care of the property of the owner . <p> Tenant 's Income : The required income of a potential tenant is important to establish criteria that could eliminate many undesired applications that ca n't cover the rent requirements . Most owners request that the rent of a property be one third or less of a tenant 's income . <p> Employment History:Having a stable job is important for a landlord because it shows that a tenant will have a source of income to pay rent . This can come in the form of a job contract or payment slips from the employer . <p> Criminal History : Checking criminal history varies from state to state . Some states do n't allow discrimination against people convicted with a crime unless the crime involved violence or anything that makes them a liability to the property . <p> Having this list of requirements to make the selection process easier will surely eliminate many unnecessary applications for you as an owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many people will still fit all the criteria , and the owner has to come up with a selection strategy that does n't discriminate . <h> First Come , First Serve <p> This is considered the easiest selection process , where the owner basically rents the property to the first qualified tenant . This selection system makes it simpler for the owner to overcome the thinking process of choosing a tenant . First come first serve is the most common method used by owners . <h> Strength of Application <p> For an owner , there is always the better candidate that ticks the boxes of the requirements . The strength of a tenant 's application could be the- deciding factor for the owner of the property . For example , if two potential tenants have submitted their applications and both qualify based on the requirements set by the owner , select between them based their applications .

One of the most importance source of risk is the tenant . A rental agreement between a landlord and a tenant gives the tenant the right to live in the property with varying degrees of freedoms and options as well restrictions and limitations , depending on the specific rental agreement . However , a substantial problem with tenants is that some of them are simply not responsible enough to leave the property free of damages , regardless of how strict the rental agreement might be . <p> For landlords the cost of repairs of damages caused by a bad tenant or hefty cleaning fees for cleaning the mess after a reckless tenant might become a major financial burden , particularly in cases of high average tenant turnover . This leaves owners having to deal with a double load : having to take the time and the responsibility for cleaning a mess as well as having to incur the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually tenants do not go on a destructive phase of properties by intent ; in most cases , it is their negligence and carelessness ( often resulting from the fact that the property is not their own home ) that cause these damages . Many tenants do n't have the urgency to fix or even report minor damages ( especially if they do n't  plan to remain in the rental property for too long ) that could eventually become much bigger problems . A minor pipe leakage that would cost the investment property owner a $100 to fix right away could lead to a number of severe problems ( destroyed walls , damaged electric appliances , etc. ) that would cost the owner thousands of dollars in repairs . <p> So this pending risk in real estate investing raises an important question : How can landlords protect themselves from these types of tenants ? There are several ways to deal with tenants and to keep them in line with the rules of the landlord without infringing on their rights or making your property undesirable . These steps should as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he/she will cover any damages caused during his/her stay . <h> Preventing a Tenant from Damaging Your Rental Property <h> 1 . Security Deposits <p> Asking the tenant for a security deposit before he/she moves into your property is the best way to ensure that you have a financial guarantee for damages or missing items . The security deposit 's main purpose is to act as a reminder for the tenant that he/she should take care of the property . If a tenant 's financial guarantee is under risk of being deducted , then it gives him/her an incentive to treat the property as their own . Moreover , security deposits have the added benefit that they are very popular in tenant-landlord relations , so having such a requirement would not make you less competitive than other real estate investors . <h> 2 . Building a Healthy Relationship with Your Tenant <p> Like any business , real estate investing is also about the interaction among different people with different positions . Thus , as a landlord it is important to have good social skills that make you communicate well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants makes them be more respectful to you as a landlord and to your property . It makes the tenant not feel obligated to take care of the property but rather want to do it out of respect to the landlord . An owner is supposed to encourage tenants to- have a standard when it comes to property cleanliness or functionality ; it means they care about the living conditions they are in . This reflects positively on the owner . Do n't  take it wrong though you do n't  have to become besties with your tenant and watch football together . Just make sure to build an understanding , kind , and amiable relations . <h> 3 . Set a Standard and Keep It <p> Tenants- expectations of the future state and cleanliness of the rental property- by you as the landlord will depend largely on how the property is on their arrival for their first visit . If the property is well managed , clean and completely functional , then the tenant will view this as a standard that he/she should uphold . However , showing a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major repairs sends the wrong message , specifically that the landlord is negligent towards their own property , so why should the tenant care . Thus , it is absolutely worth it putting enough time and effort to maintain and clean up your investment property after the last tenant leaves before you start looking for new ones . Its better to lose one month of rental income due to vacancy than to get a tenant who will cause damages worth 5 months of rent . <h> 4 . Detailed Lease Agreements <p> In the lease agreement , landlords should state specifically how they expect the apartment to be returned once the tenancy period is finished . Lease agreements are legally binding and therefore they force the tenant to fix any pending repairs or cleaning required before he/she leaves. - The lease agreement is n't just to keep the tenant in line but to also keep the landlords on their toes to retain the highest standards . That 's why it is very important to draft and sign a lease agreement which is as detailed as possible . You might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you handed it to the new tenant to show how you expect to receive it back , of course taking into consideration some normal wear . <h> 5 . Tenant Screenings <p> Choosing tenants is never easy . Landlords must be careful when selecting the people who will be using their property . Tenant screenings involve references from previous landlords , and this should be the biggest indication about the responsibility of the tenant towards rental properties . As a real estate investor , do not ever opt for the choice of shortening the tenant search period just so that you start receiving rental income immediately . Instead , take your time to make sure that you get a good tenant who will not cost you thousands of dollars . Develop your own screening criteria , and stick to them strictly . With so many people out there looking to find a place to rent , you are guaranteed to find the right candidate . <p> When it comes to rental agreements , the one who stands to suffer more if - unprepared is the landlord . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described above in order to protect their properties from a negligent tenant who will not pay attention to the cleanliness and the overall condition of the property . Having a completely bulletproof way of preventing damages is never guaranteed , but with these steps a landlord is more likely to minimize them . 
@@44409336 @4409336/ <h> Can You Afford Buying Rental Property ? <p> When it comes to buying rental property , there seems to be one thing that concerns or deters potential investors the most : how much will it cost ? Of course , this concern is valid . After all , buying rental property is a major financial and investment decision ; one that could help you get rich , one might add . <p> There are many costs associated with buying rental property , all of which can impact an investor 's decision to buy . So , for the aspiring real estate investors out there who want to get an idea if they can afford buying rental property , here 's a list of the costs to consider : <h> 1 . ) Down Payment <p> Probably the most fundamental cost to discuss is the- down payment . Whoever came up with the idea of down payment , bless your heart . Because of down payments , investors do not need to purchase a property fully in cash . Instead , a loan can cover a large portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smaller percentage . This percentage might vary , but most loans have a down payment of 20% of the purchase price . If a real estate investor has had 4 mortgages or more already , the down payment will boost to 25% . Of course , paying back the loans comes with an interest rate . The ratedepends on the loan amount and the number of years to pay back . For instance , most 15-year fixed loans have an interest rate of over 3.4% . Be sure to consider the costs of the down payment and the interest rates of the mortgage when deciding whether- buying rental property- is affordable at the moment or not . <h> 2 . ) Property Taxes and Homeowners Insurance <p> Property taxes and homeowners insurance are two costs that will partially depend on the location of the property . Property tax is a tax that is particularly paid on- real estate . The tax is used to fund services like removing garbage , fixing roads , and building schools . The rate of property taxes will depend on two things : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . Both values are influenced by the property 's location . For instance , some areas even within close proximity have higher property tax rates than others . <p> On the other hand , homeowners insurance is a type of property insurance that protects one 's property . This insurance will cover damages that could result in major losses for a real estate investor otherwise . Rates for this insurance will also vary depending on the property . A property 's location can influence the rate , too . Properties in areas prone to natural disasters will have higher rates . Assess your location , and see if it significantly impacts your ability to buy a rental property . If so , you could look into other location options including out-of-state real estate investing . <h> 3 . ) Homeowners Association Fees <p> Here 's another cost that will depend on the area of your property . Homeowners Association fees are fees an investor must pay if the property is part of a planned community . Some communities include condominiums , single-family homes , or multiple units . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision related to- buying rental property . The fees are used to help maintain the community 's properties or add shared amenities to the properties , like a swimming pool . The fee could vary . Usually- it is in a range of $100 to $700 , but the average is about $200 . If you plan on buying rental property in a planned community , consider these association fees . <h> 4 . ) Maintenance and Vacancies <p> Once you have tenants , costs for maintenance will start to pile up . Maintenance should cover up anything that allows the property to run properly . - The costs of maintenance will depend on the condition of the property while it is rented . A good starting base is around 10% of the rent . Having good tenants and good property functionality should lower the costs of maintenance . <p> When a tenant leaves and the property remains unoccupied , you have a vacancy . Vacancies will hurt your cash flow , so it 's always a good idea to set some money reserved for when a vacancy occurs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is vacant for and the condition of the property . About 1% of the property 's value would be a suitable cost to cover the vacancy . <h> 5 . ) Repairs and Utilities <p> Covering repairs and utilities is an ongoing process . Whether the property is occupied or not , you will have to cover these costs . The costs of utilities tend to be pretty straightforward , depending on what services you will cover and what is covered in the rent . The costs of repairs , however , is not as constant . Features and items will need repairs at random times , and they must be repaired immediately , especially if a tenant is occupying the property . Most investors tend to underestimate the costs of repairs , so when you plan on repairing , go ahead and overestimate the costs . <h> 6 . ) Closing Costs <p> Closing comes into play when an investor is buying rental property . Doing so brings along some closing costs . Closing costs typically include interest , appraisals , title insurance fees , recording fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cost around 2-3% of the mortgage loan amount .

Well , thanks to Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 , that is possible . Tenants who qualify for Section 8 of the Act have their rent and utilities covered in full or partially by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development . Section 8 financially assists 4 million homes by aiding tenants in paying landlords . <p> While this is a great program for low-income tenants , its a whole different story for property owners . For the owners of Section 8 real estate investments , the general consensus is that the negatives far outweigh the positives . Even though these owners are getting paid on a regular basis , Section 8 tenants limit the potential of their properties in so many ways . <p> How severe are the negatives that make Section 8 bad for real estate investors ? To answer those questions , we need to analyze the pros and cons in detail . <h> Pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Getting a rental payment on time is probably the biggest plus of Section 8 rentals . Since the government is responsible for depositing either full or at least 70% of the payment , then the owner will get- rent steadily and continuously . <p> No Risk of Vacancies : Section 8 real estate investments could be extremely beneficial if you are living in an area where vacancies are common . Section 8 has a long waiting list for tenants who benefit from it and this eliminates vacancies . If you are an owner who is paying a mortgage for the property and suffering from a vacancy , then renting to Section 8 tenants- could be a solution . <h> Negatives of Section 8 Real Estate Investments <p> Inspections of Section 8 Households : The fact that Section 8 tenants are funded by the government means- regular inspections are required to make sure that the property meets housing standards . For investment- property- owners , they would have to deal with regular inspections that could uncover problems not caused by the owner . But the owners are requested to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-inspection . <p> First Payment Delays : If an owner is looking for instant profit , they will find it is hard to get that through Section 8 rentals . These types of rentals are funded by the government , which means administration and procedural requirements take a long time . In some cases , Section 8 real estate investment owners do n't  receive their first payment for months . <p> No Security Deposits : Section 8 vouchers and payments exclude any form of security deposit for the owner of the property . If an owner wishes to collect a security deposit , they will have to do it by reaching an agreement with the tenants . This is of course almost impossible because a Section 8 tenant is already struggling financially . Not having a security deposit is a big risk for owners in case of damages and repairs for the property . <p> Section 8 Stereotype : Real estate investment owners who have had experience with Section 8 tenants are divided in opinion about the tenants responsibility toward their homes . The truth is , do n't  listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter their income . However , keep in mind , there are Section 8 tenants likely to be careless about the condition of an owner 's property because they have no financial obligations towards its damages . <p> Rental Price Ceiling : The biggest disadvantage of Section 8 rentals , which is considered a deal breaker for most owners , is the- price limitation . The amount of rent that is received is based on Fair Market Rents list produced by HUD for more than 2,500 areas nationwide . That means , the price to be paid by Section 8 has a maximum price that ca n't be exceeded . This does n't appeal to owners at all because there is a chance to make more rental profit- in areas where demand for housing is high . <p> Once you analyze the pros and cons of Section 8 real estate investments as an owner , you realize how damaging it might be to your finances and property .

@@44409339 @4409339/ <h> Why Property Valuation is Important <p> Property valuation is a key concept in real estate investing . If you do n't know the value of an investment property , you wo n't be able to know how much rent to charge or how much to pay in property taxes . Estimating these two figures , along with others like property insurance , is not possible without knowing a property 's value . <p> So , how do you find out a property 's value ? The answer is through a home appraisal . A home appraisal is a professional opinion about the value of a- real estate asset at a specific point in time . An appraiser is a professional who evaluates a property 's value . The value of a rental property is known as its fair market value . Market conditions , location , and a variety of other factors influence fair market value . <h> 1 . ) Sales Comparison Approach <p> The most popular of the property valuation methods is the sales comparison approach . Also known as the market data or comparable sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential real estate , especially single family homes . Valuation in this method is done by comparing a real estate property with similar properties in terms of sales prices , hence the name of the method . The properties used for comparison are called comparables . Not just any properties work as comparisons , however . Properties are only considered comparables if they are very similar to the property and have been sold within the year under ordinary market conditions . <p> Overall , three or four comparables are used in this method . Obviously , no two comparables are exactly the same . So , how can this method be more accurate ? <p> To account for differences in comparables , some adjustments are made to sales prices . These alterations are based on other factors that influence the rental property 's market value . The most important of these factors is , you guessed , location . Location can significantly alter the sales prices of investment properties . Physical aspects of the property also come into play . Some of these include the square footage , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of the income property . The age of the property is also taken into consideration , as well as the market 's conditions during the purchase . As a matter of fact , the purchase itself is analyzed , to see if the seller sold in a desperate attempt or sold to family . <h> 2 . ) Cost Approach <p> The second approach from the main property valuation methods is the cost approach . The concept of the cost approach is that a real estate investor should n't buy a rental property for more than what it could cost to construct a replicate of said property . This approach uses one of the common property valuation methods , the sales comparison approach . The sales comparison approach is used to find the value of the property 's land based on comparables . Then the costs of building the property are estimated , taking depreciation into consideration . <p> Another aspect that separates this method from other property valuation methods is what kind of real estate it is used for . The cost approach is not used for residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties that are usually constructed and not sold , like schools , religious institutions , government buildings , and hospitals . <p> Once the property 's land value is estimated , it is summed with the estimated building costs of the real estate property . Building costs can be estimated in different ways . One common way includes finding out the cost of a square foot and multiplying it by the total square footage of the comparables . <p> After a sum of the building costs and land value is found , the- depreciation costs are subtracted . There are three types of depreciation costs . The first is physical deterioration costs , which include deterioration that can be repaired , like old paint . The second type is functional obsolescence . This refers to aspects of the property that are not desirable in the present time . Examples include low ceiling and homes with one bathroom but multiple bedrooms . The third type of depreciation is economic obsolescence , or deterrents based off location , like being next to a loud airport . <h> 3 . ) Income Capitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the income capitalization approach . This method is all for income properties . Apartment buildings , commercial real estate , and multifamily homes are examples that can be used in this approach . The income capitalization approach takes into account the return on investment and the net income of a property . <p> This method subdivides into two property valuation methods : <p> Direct capitalization focuses on a property 's income . A property 's annual gross income is estimated . The effective gross income is then estimated by considering the impact of vacancies . From there , the net operating income is calculated after subtracting expenses . The property 's value is then estimated using the property 's capitalization rate , or cap rate , and net operating income . <p> The second approach is through gross income multipliers . This method is used for real estate properties that are not initially purchased as income properties but end up being used as such . Examples include family homes .

@@44409343 @4409343/ <h> How Do You Create the Best Airbnb Property in Town ? <p> The Airbnb concept can be best described as an online marketplace that gives users the opportunity to rent out , or host in , their property on their platform . People from any place in the world can list their income properties to be rented to guests and travelers . This is a prime example of a sharing economy , which promotes trust and innovation between all users of the platform . The accessibility of Airbnb to anyone who has an Internet connection has seen it grow beyond expectations . The competition between hosts who are vying to become the best Airbnb hosts in town has accelerated that growth . <p> The growth of Airbnb has been rapid and unprecedented . Airbnb hosting has been responsible for elevating the real estate market and tourism business . This has all been achieved because hosts responded to the idea in a spectacular way . Property owners who want to earn more money through short-term rentals started listing their properties on Airbnb . That created competition between hosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting the best Airbnb listing . <p> Having the best Airbnb in town is not an easy task , but it is worth the effort if the host is willing to work hard to achieve it . Being unique in a good way as an Airbnb host means that guests will be automatically more willing to rent your listing and discard other listings of the same kind of rental property in the same area which they see . The fact that the Airbnb industry is built on trust and communication between guests and hosts makes all parties interested in improving the general experience of Airbnb . <p> The Airbnb rental property is reviewed on the basis of a 5-star rating system developed by Airbnb , where 5 stars mark the- best Airbnb . The rating system gives guests the opportunity to voice their opinion about the investment property they have stayed at . The rating also includes an evaluation of the host and his/her abilities in that area . The better the rating of a host , the more chances he/she has- of becoming unique in a market that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of guest reviews or feedback on their stay with a host at his/her property . <h> How to Create the Best Listing <h> A Unique Title for the Listing <p> Coming up with a new title- depends on understanding the listing , the area , and the needs of guests in that particular location . The title of the listing- is the first step in marketing your property on Airbnb . Having a catchy name for your listing means that guests will be intrigued to view it to consider it for a booking for themselves . Alternatively , having a boring and ordinary title for the property means that it will be like a needle lost in haystack ; it will be the same as thousands of other listings that do n't attract attention . To have the best Airbnb , be sure to have the best possible title that presents your listing . <h> The Art of Photography <p> This is a criterion that many Airbnb hosts choose to neglect because they find it not that important . On the contrary , photos of the rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play a pivotal role in the decision of guests whether to book a certain- property or not . Hiring a professional photographer that will display your property in the best possible way is a must if you want to have one of the best Airbnb listings . Guests choose properties based on what they see ; that 's why presentation plays a huge role in the Airbnb community . <h> How to Create the Best Airbnb Property <h> Provide An Experience <p> Airbnb users are always attracted to- uniqueness and creativity . A host that can provide guests with an experience that fits their location will be rewarded with better reviews . Providing an experience can cost some extra bucks for the host but the gesture is priceless for guests . If a Los Angeles host provides a couple of guests that are staying in his/her studio with two free bus tour tickets of the city , then that provides a unique experience . People do n't usually go the extra mile for their guests , but those who do are considered the best Airbnb hosts . <h> Maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep accumulating positive reviews over the years . Hosts need to work hard to- maintain the highest standard- once they have found a way to achieve it , because previous reviews will give future guests expectations . If these expectations are n't met , then a backlash in the form of negative reviews is inevitable . This applies to pricing , presentation , cleanliness , and the experience you provide in your rental property . <h> Amenities and Appliances <p> When an Airbnb host offers more services and complimentary amenities for the guests , that raises the property standard . Guests depend on the usage of amenities in particular because that has become part of the Airbnb experience . For example , nobody thinks about packing up towels when they have an Airbnb booking . While appliances are considered a bonus by many guests , the essentials such as a washing machine , a fridge , a TV and an iron are of course taken as a must . Offering and expanding on the usage of such services makes your Airbnb flawless in terms of what it can offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management has found a creative way to make hosts who are invested in the industry stand out amongst others . This comes in the form of a Superhost title . The Superhost title basically means that this particular host has excellent reviews , listing , response time , and care for guests . To become a Superhost , an owner must follow a set of criteria that has been laid out by Airbnb . A Superhost means that the best Airbnb listing is there . <p> Keeping up with these guidelines will surely result in making your property one of the best Airbnb listings available for guests . The main motivation for the hard work needed to achieve that status is the demand and ultimately the profit that can be reached . Being a recognized host will make guests line up to book your property . Creativity on Airbnb will be rewarded with a faster way to boosting your rental income .

Why or Why Not ? <p> Potential real estate investors should study carefully the decision whether to- purchase a rental property . Investment- properties come with an added responsibility on the part of the owner . Maintaining and managing a property will exhaust significant amount of time and effort from the landlord on a consistent basis . This makes property management a skill that not many income property owners are willing to learn or adapt to . Here lies a dilemma for property owners if they should be hiring a professional property management company or not . <p> Professional property management companies provide real estate investors- with a set of services that rids property owners of the responsibility of managing their properties . The services provided by these companies include marketing , financing , occupancy , and management , among others .

For owners , this makes hiring such professionals highly tempting and in many cases worth it . Thus , evaluating the pros and cons of hiring a property management company as an owner would be advisable . <h> Pros of Professional Property Management <h> 1 . Experience in the Real Estate Market <p> Property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to property owners . Investors and landlords that are new to the real estate market would probably benefit from the learning experience provided by property managers the most . Making mistakes when it comes to your rental property can prove to be costly for inexperienced owners . Property managers have- all the contacts , know all the legalities , and are aware of all the frameworks of the property rental market . Working with professional property management means that your rental property will be more competitive compared to the properties of other owners who are managing everything- by themselves . They are bound to make silly mistakes , while your property manager will not . <h> 2 . Multiple Properties ? No Problem <p> The most common clients of professional property management companies are actually real estate investors- who own more than a single property . The reason is that these owners find it very hard to manage so many properties even if they have enough experience in the market . Therefore , they hire property managers that will take care of every detail in every property they own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit from their rentals without having to break a sweat . Or alternatively , they can spend their time and energy strategizing about their next move in real estate investing. - Property managers might also be able to maximize profit . <h> 3 . Management of Tenants <p> Probably the toughest job that most real estate investors- encounter is - managing- the process of choosing tenants and then dealing with them . Owners who list their properties could receive tens of applications from potential tenants . However , landlords- are not very experienced in the industry to tell- the bad tenants from the good ones simply based on applications . A property manager deals with these issues without facing any difficulties by studying a tenant 's financials , recommendations , and legal situation . Property managers also deal with any issues tenants have after they have moved into an income property , something that most property owners dread . <h> Cons of Professional Property Management <h> 1 .

Owners who have multiple properties pay a monthly fee per property , which means paying a huge amount of money for property management . The price that comes along with these services is certainly a downside and might not always be commensurate with the benefits- they receive . <h> 2. insufficient Attention to Details <p> Property managers get negative reviews mostly- for not being too detailed in- the tenant screening process , the repairs , or the cleanliness of the property . Owners are more detail oriented when it comes to their own property . It is the truth that a property manager will not care about the property as much as its owner . Property managers deal with this job as a business transaction and nothing more ; they will not go the extra mile to better it .

Sometimes it can be a sign of impending financial problems ; other times it 's just a minor anomaly . Having the ability to discern between the two can be the saving grace for your relationship . With that in mind , here 's what to do when a tenant 's rent is late . <p> The first thing you should do is check the lease agreement to confirm they are in fact late . Most leases permit a three to five day grace period , so make sure they 're out of that window as well . If they really are late , place a phone call to the tenant in question to ascertain the cause of the issue and try to work out a solution .

Download late rent notices for free here . This document should detail the past due amount plus the late fee . It should also remind them of the due date as set forth in the lease agreement and notify them of your intention to take legal action should the rent not be paid in full within three to five days . This document should be emailed and sent by standard mail with a tracking number to confirm the date of delivery . This way , if the situation goes legal you 'll have a record . <p> Should this fail , serve them with a pay or quit notice . The document should inform them of your intention to institute eviction proceedings , detail the amount owed and the date by which it should be paid to curtail the action ( usually three to five days after delivery ) .

You 'll pay a filing fee , which can be added to the amount the tenant owes when the judgment goes your way . To ensure it does , make sure you 've documented every aspect of the situation . Bring a copy of the lease agreement to court , as well as documentation of all of your efforts to collect . In extreme cases , tenants may damage the unit out of spite . It is very important to get into the unit as soon as possible after filing the complaint to document the condition of the place should you need to present evidence of damage during the hearing . <p> Remember , you must get the tenant 's permission to enter the unit for this purpose and you must provide adequate notice . Under no circumstances should you ever become verbally or physically abusive , try to physically remove them from the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lock the tenant out. - All of these actions are illegal and will open you to charges . <p> Further , you should never accept partial payments ; this could be a problem if you have to go to court .

Co-signors should be informed and given a chance to bring the rent current . If they do not , they should be named in the suit as well . <p> Above all , make sure you follow the rules of your state to the letter .

@@44409357 @4409357/ <h> What to Expect When You Do n't  Use a Real Estate Agent <p> One of the biggest issues most real estate investors face is contemplating hiring a real estate agent or trying their luck on their own . There is no one right or wrong way to go about this ; it will always be the personal decision of the real estate investor investor whether to hire one or not based on his/her skills , situation , and preference . A real estate agent will be charging the investor serious money for the services being provided , while going- on your own means you get to save that money for other uses . So how can real estate investors make the decision of hiring a real estate agent or not ? Is there a process involved in making a decision of that type ? The answer is yes ; a real estate investor must be capable of analyzing his/her situation carefully in order to decide whether to use- a real estate agent- or not . <p> A real estate agent can belong to one of three different categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realtors . <p> Regular Real Estate Agents : Those who have no extra training in the business and are not members of any professional society . <p> Real Estate Brokers : They possess more training and knowledge than regular real estate agents , but they are still labeled as agents . <p> Realtors : The elite group of the real estate agent professionals . They are highly trained and belong to a professional association of agents . <p> The fact is that all these types of professionals are technically real estate agents because that 's the basis of the job . Having a higher training makes a real estate agent rise up in the rank due to knowledge or belonging to a real estate professional society . <h> Benefits of Hiring a Real Estate Agent <h> Variety of Options <p> A real estate agent can provide real estate investors with a huge variety of investment properties to view until the investor is satisfied with a specific rental property . Real estate agents also operate in networks , which means that they sometimes can contact each other to have more viewings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to an agreement with minimum effort because they have many contacts . A real estate agent is quickly able to contact sellers , arrange a viewing , and broker a deal that all parties agree on . <h> Negotiations are- Not a Piece of Cake <p> Many real estate investors assume that negotiating with a seller of a real estate property directly will be an easy task because it gives them direct contact to discuss terms . However , while that can be hypothetically true , in reality it is n't . Many sellers or buyers can be difficult to deal with because everyone wants to maximize profit and get the better deal . <p> A real estate agent handles negotiations with ease because it is part of the experience he/she possesses from many years of practice . An agent is able to bring out the reasoning of all parties because he/she is- able to factually prove to all parties what is acceptable for a deal and what is not . For example , if a buyer is interested in a house that is overpriced , a real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer by basically telling the seller that he/she is overpricing the income property . <h> Handling of Contracts <p> A real estate agents experience in drafting contracts for both buyers and sellers of real estate properties is invaluable . That experience makes the real estate agent know what conditions are best for you , when to waive them , and how to use the terms of the contract to protect your interests as a real estate investor . <h> Buying Property Without a Real Estate Agent <p> For real estate investors who are confident in pulling off better deals by themselves compared to deals brokered by real estate agents , there is a process that needs to be done every time you purchase an investment property : <h> Searching for Properties <p> The first step to buying any real estate property is to start the searching process for properties that fit the criteria you have established . In the Internet age , this process has without a doubt become more accessible and easier to everyone . There are hundreds of websites where sellers post their real estate properties with pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Attorney <p> The idea is that while ignoring the need for a real estate agent could be doable , hiring an attorney is a must . Purchasing a rental property involves many legal contracts that must be viewed and understood to the very core . Neglecting the need to do this could result in many legal risks that could prove extremely costly for the buyer or the seller . <h> Schedule Visits <p> Buying an investment property is not possible without viewing the properties you are interested in before . While pictures might give a general perception of the real estate property , they do not provide the whole picture . A real estate agent usually organizes these visits effortlessly , but as a real estate investor you will need to get on top of things very quickly to not miss out on an income property you are interested in . The real estate market is very competitive , and organization with property viewings will help you act swiftly to seal a deal . <h> Making an Offer <p> After finding a rental property that the real estate investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made to the agent responsible of the listing or the owner directly . An offer will depend on the buyers understanding of the value of the property. - Without hiring a real estate agent , it becomes harder of course to value investment properties , especially if you have no or little experience in real estate investing . Real estate investors who jump in- without realtors usually have to do more research and check out other real estate properties with similar features to understand if the value meets the asking price . <h> Closing the Deal <p> Closing the deal involves a lot of paper work that the attorney you hired should be taking care of . This includes contracts , deeds , and forms that transfer all ownership of and rights to the property to the investor . A real estate agent is also able to do these tasks if one choose to hire one . <h> Real Estate Agent : Yes or No ? <p> The general consensus is that hiring a real estate agent is worth every penny that will be paid . Agents provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real estate market . They will act in the best interest of the party they represent by trying to cut out the best deal for the client . While some real estate investors might think its wise to dip into real estate investing without hiring an agent because they believe in their own abilities , inexperienced investors should definitely spend the money needed to hire a real estate agent . Having the assurance of an experienced representative on your behalf would be invaluable , and you can learn a thing or two . 
@@44409358 @4409358/ <p> If you plan on making any major financial investment , then you 're going to need to learn about credit . Of course , as a real estate investor , the question you 're most concerned with is what is a good credit score and how does it impact your investment decisions ? Before we get into the answers , let 's backtrack and discuss what exactly a credit score is . <h> What is a credit score ? <p> A credit score is a three-digit value , based on various factors , that assesses the creditworthiness of an individual . And you thought your report cards were important . <p> Credit scores are important for various financial investment and purchases . Things like opening a new credit card , buying a new house , purchasing a new car , and even switching to a cell phone service provider are all impacted by one 's credit score . <p> While there are many types of credit scores , many of which are industry-specific , there are two common scores to be aware of . The most common type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common is theVantageScore . With the latest VantageScore system , both scores range from 300 to 850 . <p> Before we delve into what is a good credit score it 's important to know what factors affect credit scores . As previously mentioned , different types of credit scores exist . While the types of scores can be different , the factors that influence them are largely the same . Each factor mentioned includes a percentage of its impact on FICO Scores . <h> Payment History " 35% <p> This factor is the most influential for both FICO Scores and VantageScores , which is why it is the part most people mess up on . Points are earned by paying off things on time . Conversely , paying things late or missing payments altogether will lose points . Having public records including bankruptcies and civil judgements will also deduce points . When these issues are resolved , points are regained . <h> Outstanding Balances " 30% <p> Having multiple revolving credit accounts will improve your credit , if the accounts themselves have good credit . Using that credit should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit on the account will result in lost points . Try to use less than 30% , or better yet , 20% of the available credit . <h> Length of Credit History " 15% <p> If you are a credit history veteran , the higher your score can be . This also assumes the longevity of not having issues with that credit . Keep your accounts old yet prosperous for better credit . <h> Types of Accounts " 10% <p> You can have a higher credit score for having a wide range of accounts . For instance , using different kinds of loans ( like college loans and home loans ) will diversify your account , leading to a higher credit score . <h> What is a good credit score ? <p> The previous five factors contribute to what is a good credit score . Since there are different types of credit scores , what is a good credit score will vary from type to type . In the FICO Score , a range from 670 to 739 is considered a good credit score . Past that range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and anything above that up to 850 is considered excellent . On the flipside , a very poor credit score is from 300 to 579 and a fair credit score is from 580 to 669 . <p> The good credit score range is more restricted in the VantageScore . In the VantageScore , a score from 700 to 749 is considered a good score . From 750 to 850 is an excellent score , 300 to 549 is a bad score , 550 to 649 is a poor score , and 650 to 699 is a fair score . <p> Answering the question of what is a good credit score needs to take perspective into account . The good credit score ranges mentioned can qualify for different investments and purchases . In terms of real estate investments , the required score is around 620 , but a very good score is at 720 or higher . <h> Why is it important for real estate investors ? <p> Having a good credit score has significant implications for potential real estate investors . It boils down to two things : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval <p> Your credit score helps lenders assess how qualified you are financially . Specifically , lenders are interested in finding out how likely you will be able to pay back the loan or mortgage in time . Therefore , a higher credit showcases less risk for lenders . Credit scores are often referred to as risk scores for this reason . <h> 2 . Higher Credit = Lower Interest on Loans <p> As a result of the previous point , having higher credit speeds up the approval process , places you and the lender at lower risk , and thus gives you lower interest on loans and mortgage . <h> 3 . Better Terms of the Loan <p> Having a high credit can give you leverage in negotiations with the lender . Remember , the lender is also concerned with high credit , not just you . <p> Awesome , so now you know what is a good credit score , but what if you actually have bad credit . After all , building up credit takes time , does this mean you ca n't participate in real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ! <p> All in all , it 's extremely important for every investor to know what is a good credit score and how to achieve one .

Becoming a landlord is not an easy task . <p> For property owners , they are required to follow a certain set of rules that make them fair in their treatment of their tenants . In 1968 , the Fair Housing Act was endorsed to protect both tenants and landlords from discriminatory screening processes .

Landlords who offend their tenants with a wrong comment about their race , color or anything discriminatory can lead to a lawsuit . Being assumptive is another thing to be aware of .

This will help your long-term strategy . <p> Meanwhile , if you 've already had your property for a couple of years , and your Airbnb occupancy rate is not where you want it to be , try to lower your price a bit . This should attract new guests to your property . Remember that your profit is positively correlated to both your per night rate and Airbnb occupancy rate , and it is very likely that the positive effect of the rise in the occupancy rate will exceed the negative effect of the drop in the price . <p> 2 . Differentiate Between Seasons . <p> Most top Airbnb cities are highly seasonal , and here we do n't mean just the four astronomical seasons but also weekdays versus weekends , workdays versus holidays , etc . To increase your Airbnb occupancy rate throughout the week , the month , and the year , it is of crucial importance to ask for very different rates when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price differentiation will help you remain competitive in low-season , while still allowing you to make your due profit during the high-season . <p> 3 . Know Your Location Well . <p> Following up on #2 , you have to know your local market and your location . There are cities and neighborhoods which get more tourists and other visitors during the summer and such which get more demand in the winter . Business hubs are busy during the week , while vacation spots are occupied mostly on weekends . In addition , you must study well the local events " conferences , festivals , celebrations , and others " which are most popular in your city . <p> 4 . Get A- LOT of Reviews . <p> You might be surprised to hear that quantity is more important than quality when it comes to reviews of your Airbnb investment property . But it works that way . When people consider whether to book your property for their summer vacation or business trip , it feels reassuring to see that many more have already stayed there . So , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices to attract many guests initially and to get numerous reviews . It will pay off soon by bringing your Airbnb occupancy rate up . And once you have a lot of people wanting to book your property , which means a lot of competition among customers , you can afford raising prices . <p> 5 . Get Quality Reviews . <p> OK , even if quality is more important than quantity with regards to Airbnb property reviews , this does n't mean that your reviews should be bad . People function in such a way that the small things " the details " make all the difference . So , work on the details " leave a welcome card or a small box of chocolate or some flowers or a fruit basket or just fold the towels in a nice way " to make a first positive impression on your guests . This will play a very significant role when they sit down to write a review of your property after their stay . <p> 6 . A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words . <p> This old saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to attract new guests to your property and thus raise your Airbnb occupancy rate by simply writing how amazing your place is without having an attractive picture . Put the necessary efforts into taking a really good picture of your property that shows how amazing it is . This picture will do miracles for you . <p> Airbnb investment properties are here to stay , so really " consider this option for your existing or your next income property . And make sure to work hard to get a high occupancy rate . It is not less important than charging a good price . Meanwhile , remember to check out Mashvisor for thousands of available properties throughout the US and their estimated Airbnb occupancy rate , as well as the average Airbnb occupancy rate in the neighborhood .

You saw it on TV , attended a couple workshops , and did your homework ; the only thing left is to find your fix and flip deal and get started ! At Asset Based Lending , we see at least a dozen first-time real estate investors each month embark on their real estate journey " and do so profitably . However , before you jump in head-first , ask yourself these three questions . <h> Do the numbers make sense ? <p> There is no such thing as love when it comes to your investment property . Successful investors remain emotionally detached from the project and approach every facet of the deal with an analytical mindset ; either the numbers work , or they do n't . The quickest way to doom a fix and flip is to fall in love and make an emotional decision , usually in the form of paying too much for the property . <p> As a general rule of thumb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Repair Value on the deal . This includes both purchase and renovation costs . Any more than this , and there is a high likelihood that unforeseen expenses , holding costs , or a plethora of other things could eat away at your bottom line and reduce your profit margin . If you 're not careful , you could end up investing a significant amount of money for a marginal return that just is n't worth the risk . <h> How will I finance it ? <p> When it comes to money , you have options . Most real estate investors fund their deals one of three ways : with their own ( or their partners ' ) capital , with a conventional mortgage , or with a hard money fix and flip loan . Each method has advantages and disadvantages , so do your homework ! For example , a conventional 203K loan typically only requires the investor to bring less than 5% of the purchase price to the table . On the other hand , a hard money loan comes with a higher interest rate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes for a conventional mortgage " a feature that is absolutely essential for most investors . <p> Regardless of the route you take , be sure to line up and secure your funding prior to committing to the deal . Nobody likes having to scramble for cash last-minute and potentially having to decide between a last-resort financing option or losing the deal . <h> Is the team ready ? <p> Believe it or not , real estate investing is a team sport . The most successful flippers have built and refined a stable of trusted service providers that help them achieve their real estate goals . Your real estate investing team should include a good local realtor , general contractor , appraiser , accountant , attorney , and lender . Do n't try to penny-pinch too much when it comes to your service providers ; professionalism and quality work will save you time , money , and headaches in the long run ! <p> As a new investor , one of the easiest ways to build your investing team is to attend local Real Estate Investor Associations ( REIAs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue your education and connect with like-minded investors and service providers . <p> Author Bio : Eric Krattenstein is the Chief Marketing Officer and Head Of Sales for Asset Based Lending , a private commercial lending firm that finances fix and flip investments for hundreds of real estate investors each year .

@@44409365 @4409365/ <h> Which cities are currently in a housing market bubble ? <p> Uh-oh , not again . Nearly a decade after the last major US housing market bubble popped , we may be nearing another . A housing market bubble is not easy to define , but generally is when prices and demand increase for houses , while supply begins to rise as demand lowers , resulting in lower prices and an eventual crash . <p> But according to most experts , the nation as a whole is not in a housing market bubble . Some areas , however , are more at risk than others . If you plan on investing in any of these areas , be aware of their market conditions . Research properly before you decide on an investment . <h> Florida <p> Florida is no stranger to the housing market bubble crash . Along with states like California and Nevada , it was severely impacted by the latest crash . It has tremendously recovered , however , due to a large amount of foreign investments . But recently , some areas in Florida are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen a significant decrease in the number of homes sold . Flips have also contributed to the situation in South Florida . The Sunshine State is not in total despair , though . Other cities in Florida , like Orlando and Tampa , are projected to do very well for 2017 . <h> Texas <p> One Texan city is in the bubble , Midland . Midland 's housing market has taken a hit as a result of cheaper oil prices . Other major cities and areas in Texas are somewhat near housing market bubble . Dallas and Austin have had their property prices reach new highs . Austin , in particular , might be nearing a bubble , as its market is 20% overvalued . Other Texan cities are overvalued at around 15%. - In Houston , there has been a 53% increase in the number of vacant homes . Not all of the areas in Texas are struggling however , some are doing relatively well . <h> Massachusetts <p> The Boston metro area may be at a risk for a housing market bubble . Home prices have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this would not do much damage in terms of a crash . But since Boston has had a low supply of housing for some time , these conditions could potentially sow the seeds for a market bubble . <h> California <p> As previously mentioned , California knows what it 's like to be in a housing market bubble . And during its recovery years , it still had very high home prices compared to the national level . Although the state at large and its areas are not in a bubble , there still is some cause for concern . For instance , in San Jose , the median home price is nearly ten times that of the median household income . Also , San Diego home prices have reached their highest for the first time in nine years . These incredibly high property prices are attributed to an overvalued housing market . Riverside , for example , is 17% overvalued . As it the condition has been for a while now , California 's housing market has been very suspect . <h> Washington <p> The home prices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last five years , it has increased a whopping 74% . At one point in 2016 , the median home price was over $650,000 . Home construction has significantly reduced as well , with a record breaking low number of home building permits in May 2016 . And as for the rest of the state , property prices have been soaring for the past year . Is it a bubble ? Nobody is too sure at the moment , but it does gather some attention . Only time will tell how Seattle 's market plays out . <h> Nevada <p> Reno , Nevada does not look in good shape . The city is at a staggering overvalued percentage at 23 , making it one of the most overvalued housing markets in the country . In the beginning of 2016 , home construction reached a record high . The problem is that home prices in the city have shot up as well . Poor supply for the right demand has been the main culprit of these high prices . With very low home affordability , Reno is on borderline with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge blemish when it comes to its overall real estate market . It has an overvaluation percentage at 9% . That 's not all , a couple of cities in the state are very susceptible to a housing market bubble . Portland is known as one of the least affordable cities in the country . Adding to this mess is the fact that the median home price is about four times higher than the average household income . It 's normal for a market to have the median property prices three times the average household income . And although Portland 's is not sharply higher , like San Jose , CA , when coupled with the low affordability , a crash is possible to ensue . Another unfortunate case in Oregon is Bend . The city 's housing market is 20% overvalued . It is probably best to avoid the situation in most of Oregon . <h> Tennessee <p> Some cities in Tennessee are not looking too great .

If you ever decide to invest in any of these areas , make sure you have conducted proper research and have not taken a great risk . 
@@44409366 @4409366/ <h> Top 5 Things to Look For in a Real Estate Investment <p> Have you ever wanted to invest in real estate , but did n't know what makes a good egg from a bad egg ? Real estate investments can be challenging , but very beneficial . So focus on these top five priorities when searching for a real estate investment , to avoid getting a bad egg . <h> 1 . Location . . . It 's Everything <p> Without a doubt , location is the most important factor to consider when looking for a real estate investment property . <p> Knowing the area of the property will give you an idea of the type of tenants to expect and how successful the property can possibly be . For example , properties near universities tend to be successful , as you can expect students to be of the primary tenants . The types of tenants and nearby area can also provide insight to expected vacancy and occupancy rates . Sticking with the university example , you can predict occupancy rates to be higher during the school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once students go home . <p> Consider other aspects that make an area attractive , such as its job market , schools , and amenities. - More job opportunities in an area means more people in that area , which in turn , means more potential renters . This can secure and increase the property 's value . In contrast , having the property 's value linked to a single company can be risky if the company is not doing well or if it shuts down entirely . To find out how well your desired area fares in job markets , check the- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . <p> Areas with schools of respectful reputations will definitely attract more people into that area . A real estate investment property with near amenities such as movie theaters , gyms , parks , will also generate more demand to move into the area . <p> Always keep in mind of any potential detriments to the area . If the area is susceptible to natural disasters , you can expect part of your returns to be taken away to cover insurance costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these areas . Crime in an area is obviously a huge turnoff , check with the police for crime statistics of the area of your selected property . <h> 2 . A Pretty Property <p> Now that we 've covered the things to consider about the property 's location , let 's shift our attention to the property itself . <p> The success of your real estate investment can be affected by the property you choose to invest in . Some things to consider about the property are the property 's type , its appearance , its quality , and your investment strategy a traditional lease or a vacation rental . <p> If you are new to real estate investing , consider investing in a condo . What makes investing in condo great for real estate novices is that they require less maintenance . The condominium association will assist you with external repairs , that way you 're mainly concerned with the interior . Condo fees , however , can be a downside . <p> Single-family homes are also lucrative investments . One advantage to such homes is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term . A possible disadvantage is having more demands from renters and more maintenance on your part . <p> An appealing appearance of the investment property will certainly lure renters , especially if the property is a vacation rental or an Airbnb rental . Some features to consider are balconies , pools , fireplaces , good views , and storage space . These features can be desirable for both vocational and housing rentals . <p> The quality of the building is almost a no-brainer . Well-constructed and well-designed properties fare off better in the long run over poorly constructed and designed properties . Not only that , but they tend to rent out more and at higher rates , while requiring less maintenance and repairs . A home inspection will assess a property 's quality . <h> 3 . Decent Price and Property Taxes <p> The physical aspects of the property and its location are not the only ones to consider . The financial aspects are just as important ! <p> Obviously , you will need to know the price of the real estate investment property . Try purchasing based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property at or below the cost it would require to construct that building today . This cost is also known as the replacement cost . For example , if costs $400 per square foot to build a new building , but you buy one for $350 per square foot , then you have made a valuable rest estate investment . Not only does buying at value save money , it can help you generate more profit if the price increases in the long run . <p> With any kind of income comes one 's most despised burden " taxes . Property taxes will vary . You will need to know how much you are losing to taxes , so refer to the area 's assessment office or talk with homeowners in the community to get an idea of the amount of taxes you will pay . Sometimes high property taxes are not a bad thing if the area is a great place for long-term renters . This may not always be the case , though , keep that in mind . <h> 4 . Positive Cash Flow <p> You definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business . Positive cash flow is when you still have money from your earnings after paying off monthly payments ( such as mortgage payments , taxes , and maintenance ) . If you do not receive positive cash flow , you should n't invest in the property . If you 've bought the property and are n't receiving positive cash flow , it is important that you keep your finances stable . In time , with some renovations and improvements , a successful property will begin producing positive cash flow . <p> Need to calculate these costs ? Use Mashvisor 's investment property calculator . It will also provide you with a better insight on seasonality trends , vacancies , history of occupancy rates and more . <h> 5 . Risk vs . Reward <p> Finally , after combining all the mentioned aspects together , ask yourself this : is the risk higher than the reward for this investment property ? Hopefully the answer is a solid NO . Avoid these potential risks to assure that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the property to keep it suitable for your tenants , but make sure the property does not require too much maintenance . This tends to happen if the property was poorly constructed or is in a bad area . If maintenance begins to consume too much of your time and resources , it would be wise to halt the real estate investment , ditch the area , or find an alternative solution . <p> Another detrimental risk is when you are not gaining money ( even in the long run ) off of the investment but are insteadlosing . Make sure that some profit remains after you 've covered the appropriate expenses from the rental income . <p> A good way to anticipate potential risks is to analyze , review , and test given reports and documents about the property , before and even after you make the investment . Accumulate enough research to predict where the area and the property will be heading in the near future , perhaps a five-year time span . Your present conditions , expenses , and earnings could be projected to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements soon , but property taxes are also expected to skyrocket , your earnings could downtick or even vanish and lead you in bankruptcy . <p> It 's no secret that a real estate investment can be risky , especially for a novice . Hopefully with these tips , smart choices , calculated moves , and creative adjustments , it can produce stable and profitable income .

If the interest expense of remortgaging is less , go for a remortgage to buy a rental property . Moreover , if remortgaging allows you to downright buy another property , then go for it . Many times , remortgage rates for a residential property are lower than those for by-to-let properties .

You will also need to tend to the legal matters before you remortgage to buy a rental property . What are the terms and conditions of your current mortgage ? Do they allow you to remortgage your property ? <p> Another important factor you must also pay attention to is equity . Remortgaging highly depends on the equity on your property . Make sure to value your property and calculate whether remortgaging is a smart option .

The Airbnb website has created a platform in which guests and hosts can communicate and interact freely to serve the best interest of all parties . The system that Airbnb established promotes clarity , innovation , and self-improvement from everyone involved , both guests and hosts . Guests are finally adapting to Airbnb 's concept and now they have high expectations from their hosts . Meanwhile , the most straightforward and obvious way to measure the success of Airbnb hosts is by the quality and amount of Airbnb reviews- that they receive from their guests . <p> Airbnb reviews were created so that the Airbnb community could prosper by helping each other out . Guests rely largely on the experience of previous users to know more about the hosts and their listings . It makes sense for Airbnb to establish a system like this because after all they are the mediator , a third party connecting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets passed on from one guest to another- in the form of Airbnb reviews , where a guest can write about the positives and negatives experienced during his/her stay . <p> The reviews system is created for two reasons . The first is to allow guests to interact with each other to give a brief summary about their experience with a host and his/her property . The second reason is to provide hosts with constant feedback to give them the opportunity to improve all the time to meet the demands of guests . Airbnb reviews are measured on a scale of up to 5 stars , with 5 being the highest and 0 being the lowest . But what is the standard that hosts need to deliver to obtain the 5-star rating from reviews ? Let 's take a look at some proven methods to increase your Airbnb reviews as a host : <h> How to Boost Your Airbnb Reviews <h> 1 . Be Accurate and Descriptive <p> The success of your hosting experience will depend on the honesty you give to potential guests . As an Airbnb host it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flat , or room you are renting out . The accuracy of details must include location , useful information about the surroundings , and a general description of your listing ( number of room , number of bathrooms , balconies , verandas , amenities , services , etc ) . Remember to be precise and fair ; promising more than you can deliver just to attract this first customer will eventually backfire because of the negative reviews afterwards . On the other hand , if guests end up getting what they signed up for , then they will definitely mention that in the reviews as something positive about- the host . To the contrary , guests who have booked an entire flat due to its amazing location only to find out that the location was not described and depicted- correctly will supply the host with a very bad review for deceiving them . <h> 2 . Photos Matching the Listing <p> The display and the photographs that are posted by the host is the main thing that attracts guests to an Airbnb listing . The truth is that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos of the listing . The photos of the listing give the guests a general overview of the place they are renting and paying money for . This results in a level of expectations that has to be met by the host , because if a host shows pictures that do n't match the listing , then a bad review and even a cancellation are inevitable . Guests like to get what they pay for , and this is why hosts have to post accurate and recent photos of the listing . After all , even if you manage to deceive a guest once , he/she will reveal the true nature of your rental property in the reviews . <h> 3 . Respond to Guests <p> Positive Airbnb reviews will always mention the availability of the host to address the issues and concerns of the guests . A host that is available to reply to guests in a short period of time will be getting positive reviews for the effort to make the guests feel cared for- and to assure them that their comfort and concerns will be answered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests once they check in at- your property . <h> 4 . Provide the Best Amenities <p> The area that differentiates regular hosts from 5-star hosts is the services they provide to their guests . Providing amenities is part of the Airbnb experience nowadays . The minimum amenities Airbnb guests expect are bathing products , towels , clean sheets , and access to some kitchen supplies . However , to stand out and to get better reviews , a host must go the extra mile . Hosts who provide better services such as Netflix , bike rentals , or breakfast will get outstanding reviews from their guests . <h> 5 . Learn from Criticism <p> Nobody starts being an Airbnb host and immediately perfects it from the first try . Owning and managing an Airbnb rental property- is overwhelming in its own way because you would have to deal with bookings , pricing , cleaning , resupplying , and communicating- with guests . Being an Airbnb host is much learning by doing. - Airbnb reviews improve gradually as you improve . Hosts who have had some very negative reviews have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put efforts into becoming better . If one guest leaves an Airbnb review that the house was a little bit dirty , as a host you will now know what to focus on to improve . <p> Airbnb reviews are the selling point of the host on the Airbnb platform . The better your reviews , the more attracted guests will be to book your listing even if it 's a bit more expensive than the competitors . A 5-star review places the host in a higher ranking than the competitors . Staying innovative , caring for guests , and being detailed about the listing are the ways to ensure that your reviews will be increasing constantly .

@@44409375 @4409375/ <h> Why It Totally Makes Sense to Rent Out Your Vacation Homes <p> The trend of purchasing vacation homes is an increasing pattern in today 's real estate market . Investing in vacation homes usually stems from an investors personal choice of having a getaway property that can be used by the owner throughout the year . However , some owners also see this kind of real estate property as an opportunity to make profit by renting out their vacation homes- to short-term renters . What makes owners hesitate about renting their vacation homes is that they do n't know how profitable or doable this real estate investing has become . <p> The evolution of the real estate market and the growth of short-term rentals have prompted many experienced owners to comply with the increasing demand as long as they can provide it . The concept behind this type of renting is that it can give its owner substantial profit in a short period of time . Short-term rental properties are usually more profitable than long-term rentals because they omit the time factor , which creates a risk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand more about whether it is worth it or not to rent out your vacation home , you must understand the expectations and opportunities that make it happen . <h> Why Rent Out Your Vacation Homes ? <h> 1 . Rise of the Short-Term Rental Industry <p> The rise of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb , VRBO , and Booking.com- has made short-term rentals a direct replacement for hotels and luxury apartments . These platforms are built on peoples listing their houses , vacation homes , or apartments for rent on per night basis . The fact that these websites have made it easier for real estate investors and landlords to deal efficiently- with the many issues that usually make renting out hard- is a driving factor . <p> Most homeowners worry about the logistics of short-term rentals because of the high tenant turnover . However , these websites provide credit card processing for payments , marketing for your home , and most importantly protection from damages which makes the whole process significantly less painful . <h> 2 . Easy Way to Make Profit <p> Owning a vacation rental home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tourists . The truth is that vacation homes will generally be in touristic areas , or in other words areas that can attract tourism . In the nature of things , these tourists are prepared to pay more than what usual rent costs . The rental income you can generate depends on the quality of the vacation home , its location , and the services provided for it . <p> If we consider Palm Springs , California as an example , on Airbnb the average price per night for a vacation home is $80 . Renting a property there for 60 days throughout the year for $80 will give the home owner $4,800 in profit . That is an amazing return considering that the property will be rented for two months total in a year . This is what renting out your vacation home can give you , so why not grasp the opportunity . <h> 3 . Better Rented than Empty <p> Owners who want to be real and stop beating around the bush will admit that they ca n't use their vacation home all year round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing to owners not being there year round . So if you ca n't use it , why not rent it to people who would pay you money to inhibit it ? It serves a double purpose for owners . Firstly , leaving a house empty for a long period of time might cause damages that occur because of a lack of upkeep or cleaning . Secondly , it helps with the security of your home ; a house that does n't have residents for a longer time is an easier target for burglars . <h> 4 . Property Management Solutions <p> People usually hesitate about renting vacation homes because they are not sure if they can do the work that comes with this real estate investing business . This is where property managers come in . There are three reasons why hiring a professional property management company makes perfect sense for people who own vacation homes . Property management companies provide their clients with services that will take care of every detail of the property on behalf of the owner . <p> Not living close to a vacation property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their properties . Short-term rentals require constant attention because of the high guest turnover , which includes cleaning , check-ins , and maintenance . If you live far ( as in the case of out-of-state real estate properties ) , then property managers are there to do it for you . <p> Vacation rentals are a bit hectic and demanding according to all owners . They require so much more effort and time compared to traditional renting . Again , it is related to the higher number of guests that will use the property and the fact that they expect keys to be delivered or cleaning to be made . With a property manager , you wo n't have to worry about any of those things . <p> Property management companies can actually provide renting services . Owners who are not comfortable with using platforms like Airbnb might find that their best alternative is a professional property manager . Property managers can list your vacation home and keep renting it for guests on the dates approved by you . <h> 5 . Opportunity to- grow <p> Vacation homes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path into real estate wealth . Renting out your property for a certain amount of time can generate you enough money to buy another vacation rental property . It gives you the chance to build a portfolio of investments that center around the vocational rental market . Why not put your assets and your possibilities to good use ? Your vacation home can be the source of cash flow you need to grow more as a real estate investor . <h> Conclusion <p> Renting out vacation homes is obviously a step in the right direction considering that owners are not using them for the vast majority of the year . The short-term and long-term rewards of using your property for rental purposes will lead to more money and success . It 's not hard to become successful at it because the tools are there for owners to utilize .

Investment Schemes <p> One potential problem with real estate is that it is full of scams that aim to take advantage of new investors .

Actually , if you want to expand your knowledge of real estate investing , the best options are to engage with other investors and real estate experts through real estate investment networks and to make use of any real estate investing resources you can possibly access ( books , websites , magazines , newspapers , apps ) . <h> 2 . Paying for Listings <p> There are plenty of websites , newspapers , and companies that offer landlords as well as real estate sellers the opportunity to list their rental property or property for sale- for an amount of money which usually exceeds by far the value of the service that they actually offer . That is an unnecessary expense that an real estate property owner should avoid at all costs .

Of course , all these services are supplied for a non-modest fee which is entirely avoidable for an investor who is looking for ways how to save money and invest .

@@44409377 @4409377/ <h> Tips for Choosing the Best Mutual Fund Investments for Your Needs <p> The world of finance is frothing at the brim with different financial tools to satisfy the palette of every would-be investor , making finding genuinely good investments a time consuming job . <p> However , some of the oldest and simplest vehicles , mutual funds , offer one of the best havens for your hard earned cash . So , let 's take a closer look at mutual funds and try to figure out how you can find the best investments for your money . <p> To better explain a mutual fund , I will resort to a simple analogy : <p> Let 's say you want to buy a piece of land , but you do n't have the necessary capital . As a result , you go to your relatives and closest friends and convince them to invest money with you on condition that each one of them would own a part of the land . <p> However , none of your relatives and friends will have a say in how you invest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool of collected funds , you can buy that piece of land and wait for it to appreciate in value . <p> Afterwards , some of your more distant friends , having heard of your recent successes in the real estate market , decide to give you some of their money to invest along with the pool you already manage . <p> So , you go out looking for other pieces of land and find a large building which you can rent out . Once you 've bought the building , you collect the monthly rent , only to distribute that income proportionally over the participants in your pool . <p> Every time a new individual comes to invest in your pool , you perform a quick calculation to figure out how much this individual is contributing : you calculate the net asset value ( NAV ) , which is basically the value of all the properties you own , and compare that to the amount the new investor is bringing . <p> In fact , to make things easier , you 've decided to just issue shares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The value of each share is equal to the net asset value divided by the number of shares you issued , which will be called the net asset value per share ( NAVPS ) . <p> Finally , seeing as how managing this pool of money is extremely time-consuming , you have decided to give yourself an annual salary , which will be equal to about 1% of all the money managed . <p> Congratulations , you have just created a real estate mutual fund . <p> Buying assets with the use of pooled capital is what mutual funds do . Nevertheless , just as in our example , none of the individual investors can affect the direction the fund takes ; only the fund manager gets to steer the ship . <p> As a result , mutual funds are quite costly , be it the management fees , the exchange fees , distribution and service fees or other expenses . In return , a mutual fund can make money in one of two ways : either the assets increase in value creating capital gains or the fund collects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from its investments . <p> The value of a fund is contingent upon the aggregate sum of all of its assets , which is the same as saying that the value of the fund in our example is equal to the sum of the value of all of the properties it owns . <p> Our example illustrated only one kind of fund : a specialty fund focusing on real estate . In actuality , there are numerous types of mutual funds , among which are funds that : <p> focus on short-term government bonds ( aka money market funds ) , <p> funds that focus on more lucrative but risky bonds like corporate bonds ( aka fixed income funds ) <p> funds that focus on stocks and company shares ( aka equity funds ) <p> funds that split their portfolio between stocks and bonds ( aka balanced funds ) <p> funds that grow and shrink with the general market ( aka index funds ) <p> funds that focus on a specific sector of industry or geographical region ( aka specialty funds ) <p> funds that invest in other funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on international and foreign markets ( aka international/ global funds ) . <p> Each kind of fund has its own advantages and drawbacks and can be separated into further different subtypes of funds . <p> Besides focusing on different assets , each fund differs from the other with regards to its objectives and investment strategy . An aggressive mutual fund will pursue high rewards while bearing the higher risk , while a conservative mutual fund will do the exact opposite . <p> Having taken a quick foray into the world of mutual funds , let 's see what goes into picking the perfect mutual fund for you : <p> 1 . The first thing you need to do is to set clear goals and objectives for your investments . This can be achieved through answering pivotal questions like whether you are after long-term capital gain or a more immediate source of income . You have to figure out how long you are willing to let your money be tied up in assets as well as how much risk you are willing to shoulder . <p> Furthermore , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd prefer : are you looking for devoting all your money to the real estate sector or do you want to invest some of your money in foreign stock markets ? Do you want to invest your money in socially responsible corporations or are you indifferent to that aspect ? <p> 2 . There are a few other issues you need to face , including the amount of money you are willing to invest , your concern for taxes , and your keenness to beat the market . <p> 3 . Once all these questions are answered , your next move is to start looking for funds that meet your criteria . Some things to look out for when selecting a fund is its past performance , its proneness to risk , its associated fees , its size ( which is the amount of assets and capital within it ) , its price , and its managerial team . <p> Each one of these factors plays an important role in sketching a more complete picture of the fund and its prospects . In addition , compare the fund 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund that proves much more volatile than a standard index can mean trouble . <p> 4 . There are countless websites and resources that can help you in your search for that ideal mutual fund . Online service providers such as MAXFunds , Fundreveal , Morningstar and Kiplinger all offer information about the numerous mutual funds out there . Some service providers go an extra step by evaluating the funds for you , based on a set of criteria . <p> Hopefully , by now you can see that finding a solid mutual fund to invest in is easy ; it just requires you to know what you want and to do your homework . <p> After all , the best investments are the ones that are tailored for the investor . And remember , should you at any point in time feel overwhelmed by any of this , feel free to consult a financial advisor ; they would only be too happy to help . 
@@44409380 @4409380/ <h> 4 Factors That Result In A Negative Cash Flow Property <p> One of the risks of - real estate investing is that without proper financial planning , it is hard to see steady profit . When an investor decides to enter the world of real estate and purchase a cash flow property , the first step should be to craft a detailed business plan . Unfortunately , with the excitement and frenzy of investing , it can be easy to make a poorly outlined business plan or even not to make one at all . Weve outline everything you need to know to make sure you do n't  end up in financial ruin . Here are 4 factors that can result in a negative cash flow property . <h> What is negative cash flow in real estate ? <p> First things first : let 's understand exactly what a negative cash flow is . Negative cash flow can be best described as making overall losses from your investment . That means that the costs you are paying are exceed your profit . Remember when you sold lemonade as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lemons ? That 's a negative cash flow . <p> This is the case not just for a cash flow property but all areas of business and investment . The real estate market contains less risk of a risk , however , thanks to the stability of the market as a whole . In other areas of investment , many factors can go against you ; in real estate the only thing that can go against you is lack of knowledge . It can be lack of knowledge about market prices , managing real estate , taxation and tenants even . Its a good thing you 're taking the time to read this . <h> 4 Factors that Cause Negative Cash Flow <h> 1 . Out of Range Property <p> The goal of a- cash flow property is to generate cash . So , it makes no sense to buy a property that 's more than you can afford and keep up with ; you certainly wont make money and will probably lose it . The fee itself will be hard to claim back unless you decide to resell the propertychances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . Add to that the possibility of huge mortgage fees for years and you already have a negative cash flow . <p> Avoiding this mistake is simple : make an outline for the property you are planning to purchase . That means studying the property 's price compared to the market prices . Researching the location is important because it will show you whether there is demand for rental properties or not . Inquiring about the potential expenses of the property ( mortgages , taxes and utilities ) will also help you make a detailed and accurate business plan . A business plan that shows positive cash flow is the one you want . <h> 2 . Understanding Demand and Vacancies <p> One of the biggest reasons investors lose money money is a vacant house with no tenants . If you have purchased a property in a location that can be rented for three or four months then in all likelihood you 'll see a negative cash flow . Location is vital to reduce vacancy periods for your property . - Another reason for vacancies is not having enough channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Without advertising your property , it can be impossible for it to get noticed by potential tenants . <p> To minimize vacancies it is vital to invest in an in-demand location for your property to guarantee demand and to take advantage of the peak seasons . It is also advisable to hire a real estate agent- as they are experts in advertising and facilitating agreements between tenants and owners . <h> 3 . Excessive Upkeep <p> You ca n't expect your investment to be a positive cash flow property if you 're spending too much on utilities , furnishing or renovations . The money you generate from rent should be split between maintaining the property and profit . Many people make the mistake of starting to spend too much on their property to make it more appealing for tenants . It is unnecessary to start treating the property as a dream house , because in the end tenants are not expecting something so luxurious . On the other hand , paying too little can make your property unattractive for potential tenants . While tenants are not looking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get something in return for money they pay . <p> The trick to maintain upkeep is to find the right balance by checking your rent and how much profit you are planning to make . It is all about the business plan you make again ; a property with a naturally high upkeep cost will be a property worth avoiding if your purpose is profit . Find the balance in maintaining a comfortable and updated property and avoid a negative cash flow . <h> 4 . Flawed Rental Pricing <p> Many people have no idea how the real estate market prices are going at the moment . Economics plays a role in determining the best- renting price . Asking for too little might give you higher demand , but after paying your expenses it can put you in a negative cash flow spiral . Asking for too much rent compared to the market will make your property over-priced and undesirable . <p> The best way to avoid this situation is to understand the market and to ask professionals who are already in the business . Finding a rent price- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a stable demand for your property and a positive cash flow . <p> Without the proper planning you might as well forget about making money in real estate .

There are many kinds of income producing assets you could roll with , ranging from different real estate options to bonds and more . Many investors invest in income producing assets with an end goal of earning passive income . While no invest is ever truly passive , these income producing assets are great choices for passive income to become a close reality , in the long-run at least . These assets have great financial potential , and the risk associated with each will differ . Therefore , be sure to choose what best suits your goals and circumstances . <p> It 's easy to think of real estate as a way to house tenants and earn income based on that . But if you 're looking to instead house a business , and make larger sums of rent , then commercial real estate is a great option to consider . Investing in commercial real estate leads to higher income because business pay more than individual tenants . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on the type and success of the business , vacancies can be more common . Vacancies tend to be longer as well . Still , investing in commercial real estate is a solid way for large cash flow . <p> By investing in single-family homes or condos , you could be in for some big bucks when everything is well executed . Earning more rent than the costs of the expenses ( which you can calculate here ) is key to creating positive cash flow , which is ultimately the goal of renting . Renting such buildings can be a great way to pay off mortgage used to purchase it or any other loans . If you are not interested in renting for long-term and are instead interested in selling the property , then have no fear . Equity can build up for the property , which will make it profitable to sell . As with any kind of real estate investment , the usual risks , such as vacancies , are involved . Still , investing in a single-family home or condo is among the most versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could have an income producing asset without necessarily having to purchase a new property ? Well , that could be the case if you decide to rent a part of your house . By renting a part of your house , whether it 's an extra room , attic , or garage , you could earn an amount of rent , mostly passively . Like with other renting forms , this method could be used to pay off loans . The success and possibility for this strategy to become lucrative and passive depends on one key player : the tenant . A good tenant could be the difference between saving money and losing money . Therefore , it is extremely important ( for all renting strategies , but more so for this one ) to SCREEN prospective tenants meticulously . <p> If you 're looking for a large pool of tenants , then renting to college students is the way to go . Having many tenants is n't the only perk of renting to college students . Since students are usually financially backed by their parents or scholarships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all is n't kind and dandy with college students . The typical college students will more likely throw parties or find other ways to damage the property . Also , since students tend to stay for a semester at a time , there will be periods of time ( the summer ) when the properties are vacant . Nonetheless , renting to college students is among the best income producing assets out there . <p> A REIT , or Real Estate Investment Trust , is a company that owns different kinds of properties , and investors pitch in for the investment . The investors who participate are rewarded with high yields and some pretty simple tax rules . Still , things could be risky depending on the type of company you invest in . Also , while tax rules are simple , taxes could be relatively high . <p> As one of the trendiest income producing assets as of late , Airbnb has revolutionized short-term rentals .

If you decide to fund a bond , whether owned by the government or a business , you 're in for the most passive investments of them all . All you have to do is lend the money . The group receiving the funding will monitor it and eventually pay you back , the original amount plus little interest . Depending on the group you lend to , risk could be low or high . Usually however , risk is low , making bonds among the safest income producing assets out there . <p> Crowdfunding has many benefits as an income producing asset .

Other options include trading some other possessions ( like another real estate property or a car ) , wholesaling , and leasing with option of buying .

Having said that , make sure you do n't leave yourself with zero money after buying your real estate property as there will be unexpected expenses related to it . <p> Just like buying your own home , purchasing a rental property requires a lot of time and energy .

Stuck in the decision whether to invest in stocks or in real estate ? When in doubt , always go for real estate investments because they are generally safer while offering returns not smaller than those offered by stocks . In order to convince you that investing in real estate is the best investment , here are- 8 reasons to invest in real estate . <h> Reason #1 : Monthly Income <p> The first among many reasons to invest in real estate is that it will provide you with a regular source of income " usually on a monthly basis . As a landlord , you will receive rental income from your income property , like any other part-time job with the potential of turning into a full-time job in the long run . If your mortgage is designed well and you are careful not to overspend on other costs related to your investment property , at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This basically means that you will start making money from your real estate investment right away . <h> Reason #2 : Real Estate Appreciation <p> Appreciation " or the fact that properties ' values generally increase ( significantly ) over time due to scarcity in land and other factors " is the second of the reasons to invest in real estate . Because of real estate appreciation , you will not only make money from your rental property on regular basis , but will also be able to increase your value as an investor and create wealth . Ultimately , if and when you decide to sell your property , it is nearly always the case that you will be able to sell it for much better than what you bought it . This leads to the next reason . <h> Reason #3 : Hedge Against Inflation <p> In general , the prices of real estate properties and the land on which they are built tend to increase considerably faster than the general price level . Moreover , as economies grow ( a main driver of inflation ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to an increase in rents . This means that the inflationary pressure will be passed on to tenants , while landlords will be protected from the negative effect of inflation through higher rental income . Hedging against inflation is another of the many reasons to invest in real estate . <h> Reason #4 : Easy to Research and to Get Started <p> Contrary to popular opinion , you do n't have to be an expert on real estate in order to become a real estate investor . All you need is some basic research skills , elementary math capabilities , and a lot of common sense . And some luck Researching the basics of investing in real estate and searching for real estate investment opportunities is quite simple nowadays and due to modern technology can usually be done from the comfort of your own home or office . There are plenty of real estate investing resources at your disposal such as books , websites , mobile apps , and of course networking .

On the other hand , if you decide to go for stocks instead , you will need solid prior knowledge and understanding of financial markets , shares , bonds , and many more things . That 's not the case with real estate because everyone knows something about properties , whether single-family homes or multi-family properties . So , the ease of starting is another one among the reasons to invest in real estate . <h> Reason #5 : Easy to Find Financing <p> If you need more reasons to invest in real estate , here is the next one . Debunking a popular myth in real estate investing , you do n't need to have a ton of cash in order to enter the business . Although you will need some hard work to obtain a mortgage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to other enterprises . Banks and other financial institutions LOVE real estate because there is always a guarantee that they will get their money back , regardless of whether you manage to pay your mortgage payments or default on them . Thus , the fact that you have access to financing options should be one of your reasons to invest in real estate over other investment options . <h> Reason #6 : It 's Safe <p> #6 from our reasons to invest in real estate is that it is a relatively safe form of investment , which is one of the two most important features of an investment , together with return . The real estate market is by and large much safer than financial markets , despite the collapse a few years ago . Moreover , even if you are unable to rent out your property to tenants in the short term ( which admittedly is a huge bummer ) , you still have a tangible asset which you can hold on to for better times or simply sell and try out with a different property or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Business <p> Need yet more reasons to invest in real estate ? Here 's another one . As a real estate investor , you have so many options to grow . After paying off some of the mortgage on your property , you can decide to sell it , pay the rest of the mortgage , and invest in a new , larger , more profitable income property . Or you can use the rental income from your current property to save for the down payment on a second property and then use the cash flow for the mortgage payments on the second one . Alternatively , you can use some of your income to partially renovate your investment property in order to rent it out for more money . So even though real estate investing rarely provides instant opportunities to become rich , it can bring you a lot of wealth in the long term , which is one of the reasons to invest in real estate . <h> Reason #8 : Tax Benefits <p> The tax benefits which you can derive as a result of your income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate . Depreciation , tax deduction on the interest on the mortgage payment , deductions on the cost of repair , deductions on property-related travel , and others are some examples of how you can extract tax benefits as- a real estate investor . <p> Needless to say , there are many , many more reasons to invest in real estate . Being fully in control , diversifying your investment portfolio , having an asset you can actually use , non-stop demand , passing it on to your kids , and having a diversity of sizes and prices are some additional reasons to invest in real estate which should not be overlooked .

@@44409392 @4409392/ <h> 4 Ways Airbnb Rental Properties Are Affecting the Housing Market <p> Big cities around the world are getting over-populated to unprecedented levels . Everyone wants to live in the big cities especially the young people who are just starting out their lives and want to make a name for themselves in a big corporation in a big city . This makes rental properties and traditional ones even harder to find . Overpopulation in certain areas and neighborhoods leads to a massive hike in rental and property prices . In the real estate business it is normal to witness a rise in prices like this ; it is not an anomaly . <p> Rising prices can partially - be blamed on Airbnb rental properties . The expansion of Airbnb rental properties and its familiarity with most property owners and investors can have that type of effect . This has affected major cities in the U.S. like New York , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Oakland and Seattle . If you are planning to invest in rental properties in any of these cities you will notice that the purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental properties affected this increase in prices ? There are four main reason- that explain how Airbnb was in the invisible hand in rising housing prices in cities . <h> 1 . Competition on Airbnb is Fierce <p> The Airbnb platform and other vacation- rental property- websites create a lot of competition between hosts or property owners . Most owners want to invest their money in the best and most touristic locations so that they are guaranteed to be renting the property most of the year . For them , it is about profit . Property owners are concentrated on buying and renovating property in selected neighborhoods that have become over-populated and trendy . If all Airbnb hosts or potential ones are focusing on buying property in the city center , then property sellers will see an advantage ; demanding more and raising prices . It is well within their rights to do that because they can obviously see the rising demand for rental properties because of platforms like Airbnb . Other investors are just more opportunistic , they bought property years ago only to resell it years later for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 . Commercial Operators Entering the Market <p> This problem of commercial operators is undermining anyone involved with Airbnb or rental properties . Commercial operators are just buying so many properties in so many cities and giving them a hotel atmosphere to rent them for high prices . Commercial operators are usually big real estate companies that have decided to invest their money in Airbnb and try to cope with the evolving market . In New York , commercial operators who are just abusing the market own 30% of the Airbnb listings . When these big sharks are out there buying any property they can get their hands on , it means normal investors will have it more difficult . <h> 3 . Illegal Airbnb Housing <p> Major cities have tried to protect inhabitants of their districts by issuance of rules that require owners of rental properties to register as a vacation rental or tourist rental . Taking New York as an example again , reports suggest that 55% of rooms and houses listed on Airbnb are illegal . This affects prices of the housing market in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to rent their places on Airbnb for short-term rental then that means they would have to rent them traditionally for long-term . Long-term rentals are cheaper and when so many are available again it will take the housing market prices down eventually . This problem has proved to be international as well , in Barcelona one of the most visited cities in Europe ; protests were organized by locals to stop the illegal use of Airbnb rental properties by landlords . <h> 4 . Airbnb Hosts and Greed <p> The thing is , Airbnb rental properties are money-making machines . If you 're an investor in a big city , you 're guaranteed a respectable sum of profit to be made each year . This is why property owners have decided to dedicate the entire year for short-term rentals instead of doing half short-term on high touristic seasons and half long-term in the off-season . This created a gap , a huge percentage of previously existing flats for long-term rental are no longer available . A declining number of flats for rent means more tenants to compete on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demand . <p> All the factors that contribute to the growing prices of in the housing industry are purely economical based because of the choices people make and how all of they are trying to make as much profit as possible . In big cities , demand is the enemy that is pushing prices , tourists are more ready to be wallet happy spenders unlike locals that 's why landlords are focusing on hosting tourists rather than locals . It is all connected in the end , but the conclusion is that Airbnb rental properties are now probably biggest player in the housing market . A system- needs to be created that helps housing affordability while not preventing people from listing properties on Airbnb.

When we hear rent control , we automatically think about big cities like New York or Los Angeles or Washington DC . Areas with rent control laws always manage to make the list of least affordable areas to rent apartments and alternatively of the locations with most profitable real estate investing opportunities . So what is rent control ? And how can real estate investors make money in rent control areas ? Let 's find out ! <h> What is rent control ? <p> Basically rent control- is a legally obliging regulations that limits and controls the amount of rent a property owner can charge for his/her property . It does n't allow the landlords to raise the rent by more than a certain amount each year . In fact , it 's a law and it protects every tenant that lives in a- rental property under the program . According to the rent control law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be increased by a certain percentage . In specific , the amount of the annual rent increase can not be more than the rate of inflation plus 2% and your rent can never be increased by more than 10% in one year . For tenants who are over 62 or have a disability rent can only be raised by the rate of inflation and never more than 5% . So , with all these protections for tenants , you are probably already asking yourself : How can landlords make profit in areas with such regulations ? <h> Is rent control good for investors ? <p> You might be surprised , but- rent control regulations offer such a great opportunity for real estate investors since these regulations decrease the supply of rental units and increase the extra number of tenants in need of rental properties . So , this allows investors to negotiate with future tenants who are in search of rental units . Investors also have the opportunity to find income properties that have been deteriorated due to the owner 's inability to raise income effectively . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How to make money under rent control ? <p> The question here is n't about just making money but rather about making money in a smart way by being- a better owner of a rent controlled property than the previous owner ( i.e. , the seller ) . - Learning from previous investor 's mistakes is by far the best learning strategy and can ensure you better success . So , here are a few methods that you can take advantage of when doing real estate investing- in rent control areas in specific : <p> 1 . Apply for hardship increases <p> Landlords are not the bad guys here simply because they want to make some money from their investment property . After all , those impose rent control regulations want to protect vulnerable tenants while still providing landlords with the opportunity to receive a fair return on their investment and eventually benefit from their property . That is why for any investor who thinks about investing in a property with below market rents should apply for hardship increase because rent control allows raises for special hardship cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows investors to apply for hardship increases . <p> There are various ways to decrease your expenses one of the two determinants of cash flow from an investment property along with income including by considering the repairs that you do on your property . Regular repairs such as painting and cosmetic rehab that you would normally have to do in non-rent control areas can be reduced to a minimum in rent control places as long as the property is in a rentable state by local regulations standards . Reductions in turnover expenses allows landlords to increases the bottom line cash flow and have the negotiation power with tenants when it comes to these repairs . <p> 3 . Capital improvements <p> Real estate investors can increase rent in areas with rent control by doing certain capital improvements to the unit or property . This means that you should always aim to make your property stand out from other units by doing- different maintenance and repairs and adding some amenities . For example , add items such as a laundry and a dryer machine , parking space or self storage space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . Through this you can increase your cash flow and asset value . The trick is to make such improvements at the minimal possible cost . <h> A final word <p> When we think about rent control , we form this image in our minds that the residents living in rent control units are living the life . We imagine that they are living in really low cost apartments far below the market value . And when we think about landlords who own those rent control units , we imagine them as not making any money from their property . It is important to realize that both the tenant and the landlord are in one way or another affected by rent control . Tenants are faced with limited housing stocks , while landlords might end up losing more money than they gain . However , real estate investors in such locations do n't  have to be at a disadvantage . Just those interested in investing in areas with rent control must carefully study the situation and evaluate how profitable the property will be for them .

@@44409395 @4409395/ <h> Is Summer a Good Time for Buying Rental Property ? <p> Timing is everything in real estate , that 's what all experts say . Purchasing your dream property might require you to look at many , many houses before you find the right investment for yourself . The number of houses that are available varies depending on what time of the year you you explore the real estate market . The truth is that understanding when you should be buying rental property does not have one definite and final solution . Buying rental property depends on the opportunity and the expectations the buyer has for that investment . Most people believe that summer time is ideal for buying a rental property due to the large number of houses on sale . <p> The end of spring is the time when all sellers start listing their properties on the market . For sellers , it makes sense because they know demand is higher in the summer , and they would rather wait till then to ensure they maximize on profits . This means that logically speaking , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea for real estate investors . This kind of dealing with competition , making multiple offers , and going through negotiations for income properties only pushes the prices upwards , so why even think about- it ? Why not wait until demand goes down to make your move as a real estate investor ? <h> Summer vs . Winter Prices <p> Buying rental property in the summer or in the winter is not just a matter of preference . It is an important investment decision which can save you a lot of money . Waiting for the fall and winter seasons to make a move in the real estate is a smart business if you are looking to save money . For example , in the summer of 2014 , the average price of homes was above $220,000 , while in the winter of the same year the average home price dropped to below $200,000 . If investors were to consider that they would save more than $20,000 just by waiting for a few more months , it makes buying rental property worth the wait . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lower . From an economic point of view , its all about demand and supply . Not all buyers of properties are real estate investors ; in fact most of them are future homeowners- looking for their first owned property . This makes most buyers picky , and not having a lot of buyers ultimately pushes the prices down for the properties that are listed in that period . <h> Buying Rental Property or Home <p> Paying those extra dollars in the summer can be worth the money if the buyer is looking for something other than buying rental property . Buying rental property means that the investor most probably already owns a home and is looking to invest his/her money in real estate . This makes it easier to choose a property because the purposes of it will be economic , i.e. , to make money through as fix-and-flip or a long-term rental . <p> Buying rental property should be about saving you money and not finding ways to spend more . If the investor will save $20,000 by buying in the winter , this leads to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your pocket . It could be used to renovate the new property and make it even better . It can be used to pay a bigger down payment on your mortgage to save money in interest paid in the future . <p> If summer season is more expensive than winter for buying a rental property , then it gives investors a new angle of short-term money making . An investor can purchase a property in the winter when its the cheapest . If the property is considered lucrative for renters and buyers , then the investor can rent it for 7 months to make money , and then list it for a higher price in the summer season to make money in a very short period of time . The rental income and added value profit ( real estate appreciation ) would give the real estate investor a bigger budget for the next investment property that is on the market . <p> For homebuyers , the scenario is entirely different . When there are much fewer options and they are paying a vast amount of money for a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the extra costs should not be the main concern , because for a homebuyer it is worth it for the quality and the property they are getting for themselves . <h> Sniping for Value- in Summer Season <p> While the summer season is the most expensive time of the year for- buying rental property , there is no reason that an investor should stop looking . There are many cases of real estate properties being listed on sale by owners for less than what they are worth because of dire financial reasons or needing to move to a different city . The fact that there are way more properties listed in the summer season means that as an investor who is looking to make profit out of real estate , you should be checking the best-valued properties . <p> Real estate experts will undoubtedly find it easier to identify properties that give return for their value . For investors who are looking to have the power of identifying and valuing properties in their city or neighborhood in any season of the year , there are tools that would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can allow you to search for properties based on budget , rental profits , and mortgage rates which will help give you an edge over other competitors due to its one-click property analysis . <h> Conclusion <p> Buying rental property requires- knowledge , experience , and above all commitment . Property buyers are those who influence most factors and aspects of the real estate market . They are the ones who push the demand or lower it causing a ripple effect in the real estate market as a whole . A good investor will know how to tiptoe around these situations . Summer and winter effects on real estate are caused by buyers behavior . This does n't mean that as an investor you should be fixated on that idea , opportunities can arise at any moment in the real estate . Identifying and taking advantage of- these opportunities is what builds success in the world of real estate investing .

With step-by-step guides , making money as an investor and property manager can be deceivingly simple path . Without accounting for the risks and hardship , you can end up realizing that buying a house was a big mistake . Below , 4 lessons to learn from as an investor : <h> 1 . When Renters Can Do More Damage Than You Realized <p> It 's no secret that anyone who has owned rental properties has shared a few horror stories about the kind of damage renters can leave behind . One homeowner and property manager was fully aware of such stories , but was not prepared or expecting to experience and deal with it . <p> This property manager ended up in this stressful situation when one of the tenant families abruptly- broke their month-to-month lease and moved out in the dead of winter .

The picture window in the front of the house had been broken , replaced with a window , and did n't fit or match the windows in the rest of the property . <p> The house had- been in exceptional condition the last time the property manager had visited only eight months before. - An unfortunate and tragic personal situation between the tenants had led to the total destruction of the home in a relatively short amount of time . <p> After fixing and replacing everything in the home ( having the previous tenants paying for most of the damage ) , the property owners could n't help but feel that buying a house was a big mistake .

The property taxes on the home had increased by nearly 300% overnight , resulting in weeks of stress . These investors immediately felt that buying a house was a big mistake . <p> Knowing that the property taxes would go up somewhat , the investor was still surprised due to a misunderstanding of the state taxes . The state offered a homeowner 's exemption on a property owner 's primary residence , but charges a property tax on properties other than the primary residence . <p> The problem was that the homeowners had based the rental price on their previous mortgage bill rather than the new one . So , for the first year that they rented out the home , they only broke even instead of making a profit . Fortunately , they were able to readjust the rent accordingly and raise it to take the higher property taxes into account . <h> 3 . When Repairs Are Expensive and Unexpected <p> When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable struggles is fixing repairs .

They paid for a new sump pump and underwater drain system in one of the crawl spaces . They have spent hundreds of dollars on drywall repair , paint , and carpet . None of those expenses even include the $6,000 they spent to repair the property their renters had severely damaged over the course of one year . <p> Fortunately , most of those costs were charged straight to their renters .

When You Ca n't Find Tenants <p> It 's been said that landlords need to look at property management as a rotating door . Tenants come in , stay their lease , and then go . While some tenants will renew a lease , most will move on to the next place when the lease is through and leave you with an empty house .

@@44409403 @4409403/ <p> Have you been thinking about investing in real estate ? Then , you 've probably done some reading on the matter and come across one of the eternal debates in the field " should you invest in single-family homes or in multi-family homes ? Both kinds of rental properties have some pros and cons , but single-family homes are overall the better investment . Below we show you why . <p> 1. - More Affordable : In general the prices of single-family homes are cheaper than those of multi-family homes , simple because of the size , all else equal ( such as the city , the neighborhood , the age , the quality , the finishing , the maintenance , the furnishing , the amenities , the attractions , the infrastructure , etc . ) . Most importantly , this means that they are more affordable , it is easier to buy a single-family home than a multi-family one . This , on the other hand , means that you can start investing in single-family homes earlier in life ( before you have saved a significant amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less difficulty . <p> 3. - Less Time to Get Rented : Because of the convenience they offer , single-family homes on average get rented significantly faster than multi-family ones . <p> 4. - One Tenant Only : Dealing with tenants can be a real headache " delayed rent payments , destroyed property , unpaid utility bills , etc . Single-family homes give you the advantage of having to deal with only one tenant at a time . <p> 6. - Tenants Stay for Longer : On average , tenants who rent single-family homes tend to remain there for longer , including for over a decade in some cases . This has a few important benefits . First of all , you wo n't need to go through the frustrating process of choosing new tenants every few months as is often the case with multi-family homes . Second , if tenants are renting your investment property with the idea to stay there for a while , they are more likely to keep it in good shape and to think about it as their own home . This means that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own instead of bothering you with them . <p> 7. - No Fights Between Tenants : That 's a big plus of single-family homes . Humans are humans and often find something to pick a fight with someone , especially if they live in the same property . Oftentimes , the families occupying a multi-family home will keep fighting over who has the right over the patio or the barbeque , who mows the lawn , who cleans the snow , who throws away the garbage , and all sorts of other things . Such fights will inevitably reach you , and you will have to intervene , risking getting some of the tenants angry at you . Worse goes to worse , you might even have to deal with an eviction . <p> 9. - Lower Maintenance Costs : Maintaining a single-family home is significantly cheaper than maintaining a multi-family home . The reasons are a few . First , single-family homes are smaller , which means that there is less to maintain . You only need to paint a few rooms , fix one laundry machine , unclog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the size of your multi-family home , you might end up with an enormous amount of work which will take a lot of money and time . Second , we 've already mentioned that tenants at single-family homes tend to be neater and even take care of some of the needed repairs . <p> 10. - No Need for a Property Manager : Most single-family home landlords succeed in managing their rental property on their own because it is smaller , because they deal with one tenant only , and because maintenance is more doable . This brings down the cost and eliminates the need to deal with a property manager as well as all the distresses associated with that . In contrast , if you end up buying a multi-family home , you will almost- definitely have to hire a professional property manager unless you want to drive yourself crazy with the big size , the numerous tenants , and the always-pending repairs . <p> 11. - No Need for a Partner : Again , because single-family homes are cheaper and more manageable , in this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed on your own and not need a partner to bring in money or work or anything else . Having said that , it does n't mean that you can not purchase a single-family home through a- real estate partnership , but you do n't have to . You have the freedom to decide how to go about it . With multi-family homes , you will almost certainly need some sort of partner . <p> 12. - More Diversified Portfolio : It is true that when you buy a multi-family home , you essentially add a few units to your real estate investment portfolio . However , eventually all these units are in the same property , so they are all associated with the same risks . On the other hand , with the money that you would spend on a single multi-family home , you can buy several single-family homes , which will really diversify your portfolio in a meaningful way . You can purchase various kinds of properties in different neighborhoods , cities , states , and even countries . <p> 13. - Lower Risk : Directly related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less risky as a type of investment . First , they are cheaper , so you need to take a smaller loan and are thus less likely to default on it . Second , unlike with multi-family homes , you do n't concentrate all your money in a single asset but can spread it across multiple properties . <p> 15. - More Potential Buyers : Following up on the previous point , it is also easier to find buyers for a single-family home when you decide that it is time to sell . After all , both investors and families looking for a home will be in the pool of potential buyers . <p> So , if you 've decided that a single-family home is the right real estate investment for you , do n't hesitate to check out- Mashvisor for various analytics on this type of rental properties across the US.

Being a member of a real estate investment club or association has a lot of perks , many of which you might not have thought about . So , let 's see what are the benefits of being in a real estate investing club ? <h> What Is a Real Estate Investing Club ? <p> To begin with , we should see what a real estate investing club is . A real estate investment club is any formal or informal , non-profit or for-profit group of real estate investment professionals who get together to network and support each other . A real estate investment association ( REIA ) is a bit more formal , with specific rules , membership criteria , agenda , etc . It could be based in a neighborhood , a city ( Chicago , Boston , Miami , etc. ) , a state , or be nationwide . Regardless of whether you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now starting to think about real estate investing , it is highly advisable to join your local real estate investing club or association . But why ? <h> What Are the Perks of Membership in a Real Estate Investing Club ? <p> Being an active member of a real estate investment club has numerous advantages , so let 's look at the most important ones : <h> 1 . Educating yourself . <p> As a real estate investor , you can never get too educated . The world of real estate investing is a dynamic one with constantly changing trends and prices , so there is always something new to learn . One great nearly free source of education " excluding the membership fees " is being in a REIA . There you will have plenty of informal opportunities to hear the experiences and know-how of more knowledgeable experts in the field through conversations . You will learn about their success stories and about the ways in which they deal with challenges and manage investment risks . You will even be able to casually ask for advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a real estate investing club would periodically organize presentations , seminars , or workshops by various professionals which will help you stay up to date with the most recent trends and developments in real estate investing . All in all , the amount and kind of knowledge you will gain from personal communication and interaction with the other members of a real estate investing club ca n't compare with education through other sources such as books , magazines , and websites. <h> 2 . Getting discounts on trainings and courses . <p> Closely related to #1 , as a member of a REIA , you will be able to use discounts on all sorts of real estate investing trainings and courses and more general ones such as running a business , budgeting and accounting , planning skills , and others .

Getting a free professional real estate investing website . <p> Some real estate investing clubs would even offer their members access to a free professional real estate investment website , where you can post your property listings , buyers forms , sellers forms , properties for rent , tenant application forms , and any other relevant information .

Hopefully , the property has made you money , made tenants happy , and given you tax breaks . But now you 're ready to make an even bigger profit by selling the property . Everyone knows that home appreciation is one of the biggest gains that comes with real estate investing . Just make sure you 're gaining as much as possible . <p> Before listing your property , think carefully about why you want to sell and if your reasons are valid ( smart ) . <h> Reasons You Should Sell Your Investment Property <h> 1 . You 're Not Making Money <p> If youre- not even breaking even on an investment property , that 's a reason to sell . Making money is the number one objective in real estate . Maybe your investment property was making money initially , but due to various reasons , its generating negative cash-flow . This can be from vacancies , damages , - or costs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , an investor could be making money but is anticipating some major repairs . <p> So definitely sell if you 're experiencing this , right ? Well , understand the market conditions really well . You might be able to make more money by holding on to the property for a bit longer . Check out appreciation , rental rates , and future development plans . If these are going to increase soon , hold on to the property and consult an agent in the meantime . <h> 2 . You 're Moving On <p> If the investment property is making money , the changing factor could be you . Some investors do n't  want to leave their property behind if they 're moving away or are just tired of dealing with property . Maybe you 're seeking a better investment property or a better opportunity . Fair . But , still you want to make sure you 're not selling at the wrong time and giving up what could be a opportunity to make money in real estate . <p> No matter what the scenario is , understanding market conditions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some investors who regret selling because rushed and should have waited , while there are others who waited too long because they- thought " more time equals more money . " <h> Ways To Make Bank Selling An Investment Property <h> 1 . Hire An Agent <p> It might seem like an obvious suggestion , but hiring an agent will do at least two things for you : 1 ) save you time by taking care of logistics like showings , callings , and updating listing and 2 ) give you the market information you need and better advise you . <p> One example of how agents will help is setting the listing price . A lot of homeowners and investors will set the price way too high ( above market value ) . However , agents will help owners set the price in order to start bidding wars ( below market value ) , which allows the seller to list the investment property above market value , without turning buyers away from the get-go. <h> 2 . A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Dollars <p> A listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally vouch for this , I close a listing after seeing more than three ugly pictures . Not all buyers are able to overlook the appearance of a property and think of the opportunity or value that lies underneath . Pictures are a magnet for sellers , so invest in the time to create high-quality , professional- photos . <h> 3 . Give The People What They Want <p> If you really want to make a huge profit from selling your investment property , then know what buyers want . Whether its an updated kitchen , bathroom , outdoor space , or balcony . Spending money to renovate or make additions should get you a higher evaluation . Calculate it right though , do n't  spend an insane amount of money on renovations and hurt your potential profit . <h> 4 . Fake It Til You Make Money <p> Stage the property and set the scene . This really is n't as hard as it sounds . This can be done just be cleaning up , getting rid of clutter , and adding " magazine-like " elements . Make it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tenants . <h> 5 . Keep Your Money To Yourself <p> You might sell your investment property for a great profit , but there 's someone that wants a piece of the pie the government . After- an investors sells an asset , they have to pay capital gains tax . However , there are ways to legally avoid paying capital gains tax . Make sure to educate yourself about these different options and if there are any catches . <p> The key with making the most money from your investment property is letting data tell you when you should sell your investment property . Do n't  miss out on an opportunity simply because of rushing to sell or lingering around for too long . Once you know the optimal time to sell , know your niche tenant market and appeal to them . If the property appeals to many people , bidding wars are undoubtedly going to occur , allowing you to get the selling price you want . <p> Do n't  forget to search for a markets investment performance on Mashvisor.

Better to live within your means , set aside a percentage every month until you have a nice little nest egg , then look to strategic investing . <p> You 'll want to consider your reason for investing . Are you looking for residential or commercial property ? Will you live on it or rent it out ?

There are companies that can help you select property , manage it for you , rent it out , collect payments , and perform maintenance . Know whether doing that all yourself is worth saving the fees , or whether your freedom and peace of mind are worth the cost of professional support . <p> Once you have funds to invest and you 've defined your reasons and goals , you 're ready to start looking into properties . You may want to do some research on property values , rental rates , and market trends . Is there a perfect little lot down the street that you 've been dying to fix up ? You might consider buying property somewhere else , where growth and rising prices are more likely . If you 're clear about your goals , choosing the right property can be fairly straightforward . <p> A real estate professional is almost always a wise next step . There are increasing numbers of pitfalls to be aware of , legal requirements , and details you need to have in writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so take it seriously . If your property will not be your own residence , your real estate agent can help you choose a property manager or publicize the rental availability for you . <p> Once you 've gone through the process of determining whether you 're ready to invest in real estate , you 'll likely wonder what took you so long ! Down payment in hand , goals clarified , professional support lined up , and you 're ready to make some money , build some security , assure your future , and enjoy the satisfaction of owning property . <p> Bio : Rachel is a media relations specialist and content writer for- CreditSoup.com .

While some tenants might have a preference for location , facilities , and price ; cleanliness of the apartment has no preference . All tenants prefer to rent a property that is clean . <p> Landlords could find it challenging to have proper cleaning done especially after a tenant moves out and a new one is expected , or turnover time .

@@44409419 @4409419/ <p> It is overwhelming how quickly things change and how fast time flies by ! The last couple of years brought many changes in the U.S economy , technology , and real estate investing industry . During these years , people dramatically changed the way they handled their finances , affecting the market in many ways . From new online platforms and technology devices to more sophisticated transactions and securities , innovation in every area fundamentally changed the way real estate investment functions . Why does real estate investing change from one year to another ? What are the key factors that affect these changes ? And are these changes always for the better ? - Let us begin by briefly discussing how- real estate investment trends changed over the years . <h> 1 . Change in the market <p> We all know that after the housing boom of 2003-2005 , home prices increased dramatically . This caused the rise and fall of the real estate market . Housing prices started to decline and reached its largest price drop . Rates of foreclosure increased among homeowners . This change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home valuations , but mortgage markets , home builders and real estate investments . Now when we look back at all the changes real estate went through , we notice what a huge improvement it underwent from past years to now . <h> 2 . Technology 's effect <p> One great real estate investment trend that tends to develop every year is the effect of technology . As technological devices developed quickly and became present in the home and office , consumer behavior evolved dramatically . Information technology changed the way real estate information was shared . With many online sites now available that provide real estate information to the public , this trend continues to be the most useful . Many real estate investors used to suffer from not having easy access to information , but this technological change effected real estate investment positively . <p> This real estate trend definitely changed from past years . When you look back at real estate investment ten years ago , you notice that the majority of the people perceived real estate investing as the domain of the hyper-wealthy . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting capital . However , throughout the years this perception changed for many when crowdfunding was introduced . The proliferation of crowdfunding platforms is perhaps the most important new development in real estate investment . It allowed investors to place their funds in a variety of properties , so crowdfunding platforms made real estate investing simple for ordinary people . Before , real estate required thousands of dollars and all that money went into the same investment . Now real estate crowdfunding platforms require so much less of an initial investment . <p> The paradox of crowdfunding has been increased by the passing of the 2012 JOBS Act . The JOBS Act made the general application of equity and debt securities legal . This opened up the real estate investment space to new participants . The JOBS Act of 2012 allows for general application of real estate projects to a much broader range of investors . This real estate trend really benefited real estate investing throughout the years . Because of the JOBS act , the growth of online investing in real estate has been dramatic . The predictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also known as the study of the population , demographics can definitely affect real estate investing trends . Factors such as age , gender , income , and population growth help a lot of investors when it comes to making any real estate decision . Demographic statistics help in determining what type of property is in demand and the price of real estate . Is the population composed more of millennials or of seniors ? Is the majority of the population employed with stable incomes or new graduates that are unemployed ? Is the population growth in a certain area gradually increasing suggesting a demand in real estate property ? Questions like these are continually being raised every year determining any change that may occur in real estate trends . <p> The economy <p> Of course the economy is a key factor of any change in real estate trends . The U.S economy plays an essential role in real estate investments . Take for example the economic uncertainties around the country . Stock markets have been highly volatile and international currencies are always in constant trouble which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater demand for rental properties since owning a property is not affordable for everyone . Any change in economy , good or bad , will led to a change in real estate investment trends for the future . <p> Government policies <p> Government policies are another key factor that can have an impact on real estate investment trends . Governmental forces on real estate values can be significant . For example , taxes . Higher city and state income taxes result in less disposable income for real estate purchases . Another governmental force that can affect real estate investing is labor issues . Labor issues can have a major influence on a business 's choice when building or relocating a facility . A company may decide for a certain location because of certain labor laws and regulations , including whether or not labor unions are prevalent . So in the end any governmental policy can drastically change real estate investment trends for the future . <p> We can go on and on about factors that affect real estate investments and how real estate developed a variety of different trends throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past is the future ; and we can not end this discussion without simply mentioning what 's expected for the future in terms of real estate investment . <h> Real estate trends for the future <p> Obviously many investors strife for better opportunities in real estate and one way to open up these opportunities is by first building the future . It is predicted that global megatrends will change the real estate landscape . The changing landscape will have major implications for real estate investments and development . Of course with Donald Trump as the new president , it is likely to presage some dramatic changes for the housing industry , seeing how the values went up so high . Also another trend that is likely to occur in the upcoming years is millennials and their continued role in real estate . More millennials are expected to buy more houses . You never know what the future holds or what it might bring . As for real estate investment trends , it is like a roller coaster ride with many ups and downs .

An- income property can be defined , as a property an investor purchased or developed that will generate an income to its owner through leasing , renting or reselling . An income property like all businesses and ventures has a source or an output that it feeds on to create a positive cash flow . <p> In real estate , that source is basically tenants and potential investors . The tenants are the most important factor of owning a successful income property . Without tenants , most property owners would spend their entire lives owning property just to resell it when its value increases . The focus point here is how to offer a unique experience for your tenants which eventually makes your income property more profitable because of demand . Here are 6 important factors to keeping income property tenants happy and adhering to the highest standards . <h> 1 . Show details to agreement , legalities and rules . <p> First impressions are important . Communication about the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive vibe to the potential tenant . The preparation from the income property owner to prepare a legally biding contract shows organization and dedication to make them happy by laying out a set of rules that serve both parties . <h> 2 . Be available . <p> Being there for your tenants in person while they are living in your property makes a personal difference for tenants because it just shows them that their landlord cares about their well-being and comfort . <h> 3 . Stand out among competitors . <p> Turning your investment into an income property one is not easy when there is a lot of competition in the market . Most people are opening up to the idea of real estate investments to generate income . To offer a different house than what people usually see on the market is not that hard to achieve . It all depends on the culture , location and climate . It all comes down to the creativity of the landlord on creating an in-demand property that keeps tenants happy . <h> 4 . Provide all the bells and whistles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has full functioning utilities and equipment . It is normal that a tenant will be dissatisfied with the landlord 's unwillingness to address these issues if they ever arise . Therefore , it is absolutely imperative that a landlord is able to address all issues affecting the tenants as quickly as possible to ensure their comfort and satisfaction . This way the tenant will also have the mutual feeling that they should be punctual with rental payments . A satisfied tenant that sees the landlord making the effort will be more than willing to renew the lease as soon as the opportunity comes up . <h> 5 . Add small touches . <p> For short-term rental income property owners , there are many ways to make a guest feel their host is concerned about their stay . In some Airbnbs I have stayed at , the owners would leave many leaflets that would help me in finding my way around the area in terms of pharmacies , restaurants , grocery stores and more . These could be lifesavers when you are in a new area for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could reward loyal tenants can be extremely helpful in gaining their trust to stay longer . In the end it is all about having an income property that keeps generating money for you as the landlord . Having this system of rewards will make you also stand out among other property owners because word of mouth in real estate and rental is a very fast and important way to advertise your place . For example , rewarding tenants who re-sign their lease and stay longer with you by getting them a bigger TV or a barbecue grill would go a long way in making them see how much you value their happiness and comfort in your property . <h> 7 . Give them their space . <p> Even if a tenant is renting a house , they still want it to be home-like , a place of comfort and peace of mind . Some landlords however violate this by invading the privacy of their tenants on a regular basis . This ultimately pushes the tenant to seek a different place and it will only generate bad reviews for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants their own privacy , and to ask for permission beforehand to check the place or to be there to repair something . These simple rules of politeness and manners mean everything to the tenant . <p> These are the basic ideas that every income property owner should follow to see a rise in the demand of their property through the satisfaction of the tenants . By achieving this , you build a reputation of uniqueness that makes you edge all your competitors in a very competitive market .

The question is how do you- maximize your profit ? How do you invest in a property that will generate a pretty penny ? - These are the questions you need to ask yourself before thinking about the next step . Lucky for you , we 've got the answers . Here is everything you need to know to turn your Airbnb investment property into a multi-profit property . <h> Airbnb and Profits <p> Making profit is the ultimate goal for any real estate investor . Financial security is the reason most Airbnb investment property owners are willing to dedicate their time and energy to make it work . Making money via Airbnb has proved to be a good income because of its higher prices in comparison to- traditional rentals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation chain for short-term rentals . Hotels are considered the high-class zone because of its higher prices and luxuries such as swimming pools , spas and 24-hour room service . Hostels can be considered the bottom of the chain due to their cheaper prices , lack of emenities , and communal spaces . <p> Airbnb investment properties are the balance in that system . It provides mid range prices that are affordable . It also provides a set of established services agreed on like free Internet , appliances for use , towels and amenities . For guests that 's all perfect and great because they get what they pay for in the end . Investors are ambitious ; they do n't want to stop there . <h> A New Concept <p> The new Airbnb investing trend that has shown promise for owners who simply ca n't afford to buy multiple properties is buying a large property ( tyhink something like a flipped two story house ) . Its a relitively simple feat and has brought success in many parts of the world because . The idea behind flipping is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation . <p> This might sound costly at first , yes . Renovating an entire property can definitely be expensive . The costs can include changing pipelines , sockets , entrances , windows and even walls . The cost will inevitably depend on the extent of the renovation and the size of the property itself . <p> After the restructuring of the property is made , the owner divides the house into smaller renting spaces , such as studios or one-bedroom apartments . All of them should involve the most basic necessities required of an Airbnb property like a fully equipped bathroom and a kitchenette . The investor will have eventually more than one Airbnb property that can be rented for a cheaper price . Yes , while the individual rental rates are cheaper than the whole propertys rates , consider this : An investor turns the property into 4 separate studios , each one accessible through the front door with privacy for each one . If the rental price of the whole property before remodeling was $90 per day , then 4 studios to be rented at a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more per day . <p> This idea can revolutionize the Airbnb industry . If you 're thinking of taking advantage of this revolution , there are some things an owner- should be wear of . <h> Risks and Precautions <p> The risk of opting to go down this path with your property is the chance that not all mini-properties will be rented simultaneously , which means fewer profits . But that risk lies with the owner 's ability to advertise their property within the Airbnb community . A property of this type will need extensive marketing and customer engagement to make it work and cut the risk of vacancies . <p> The main precaution that an owner must be aware of is the Airbnb investment property regulation within their state or town . Each city has its own regulations regarding Airbnb investment properties and it would be advisable to consult with your lawyer before engaging in this business activity . Cities like New York , Los Angeles and Austin for example have stricter rules than Tampa or Buffalo . <p> In conclusion , to make this type of investment work an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits their location and property size . Paying a bit more to provide more services for your smaller properties will result in higher demand ; their prices would be considered lower average . This is where the benefit lies : maximizing profit for investors by decreasing costs for tenants .

There are many jobs and businesses which give you this opportunity , and surprisingly or not , real estate investing is one of them . Probably when you hear about investing in real estate , the first thing you imagine is someone going from one property to another , visiting the bank on weekly basis , shopping from the home appliances store , running after tenants to collect his/her rental income , etc .

All you have to do is follow developments in the real estate market " usually on your computer " in order to buy or sell shares in REITs . That 's an excellent option to make money from home for those with background in both real estate and investing in stocks who do not like to deal with actual rental properties . <h> 4 .

Each candidate comes up with their own agendas and ideas for every aspect of the country 's political , economical and social factors . In January 2017 , Donald Trump assumed office of the President of the United State of America ending an era where his predecessor , Barrack Obama , has helped shape the housing market as we see it today . Real estate investing without a doubt witnessed a significant boom during the Obama administration because of legislation that helped low-income owners with mortgages . <p> The Trump administration is proving in the short time of its office , that they are going to have a different approach for the housing market . The truth is that real estate investing has become more expensive since Trump became president . New policies adopted by Trump have made borrowing more expensive for homebuyers and labor costs to become more expensive for homebuilders . <p> One of the first acts of the Trump administration was to reverse an executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that borrowers would get a reduction on their mortgage insurance premiums by 0.25% of total amount borrowed . Trump moved swiftly to to- suspend the- reduction on mortgage insurance premiums for Federal Housing Administration loans . - The order was met with mixed opinions , while some say that the order aims at taking money from low-income homeowners ; others argue that the Federal Housing Administration insured loans would be there to protect taxpayers in case of another housing market crash . <p> What does this mean for you when it comes to real estate investing ? The order not coming into effect yet means that people who already have mortgages will not be affected by the suspension of the Federal Housing Administration reduction . For potential buyers , suspending the Federal Housing Administration rate reductions will put them in a more vulnerable spot .

Mortgage rates are expected to be on the rise throughout 2017 but because of Trump 's unknown taxation agenda it is difficult to be sure that the mortgage rates wo n't be unpredictable as well . New policies from Trump could eventually trigger the mortgage rates to decline and open up the real estate investing door again <p> The good news for investors who are not dependent on mortgages is that it is highly predictable that house prices will continue to hike up during the Trump administration . Trump has promised to come up with policies that will allow borrowers more freedom when applying for loans and mortgages from banks . <p> Trump 's administration has strictly vowed to reevaluate the Dodd-Frank Act , which was passed by Congress after the 2008 housing market crash . Trump wants to change some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of regulation on banks . Loose regulations means it will allow banks to lend more to people , hence increasing possibilities of real estate investing . <p> The real estate investing market is facing a dramatic change in fortunes right now because of the change of regimes in the US government . There are some conclusions to be made after analyzing Trump and his administration 's stance on housing in all its aspects . With the uncertainty at the moment , it is only natural that investors have their doubts when it comes to mortgage rates , property prices and demand . The indication that property prices will remain on the rise is good news for existing investors and anyone who plans to purchase property now , rent it and sell it later down the years .

The Metro area of Miami featured the highest number of flipped houses in the US real estate market in 2015 . The proportion of flips to total sales increased from 4.7% to 6.4% over a year . So , although experts recommend long-term Miami real estate investing , do n't overlook this option either . <p> We 've saved the best two trends in Miami real estate investing for the end : <p> Miami is ranked#9 in the highest average median rents in the US . The rent for a one-bedroom is $1,810 and for a two-bedroom " $2,500 . Now that should compel you to invest in the Miami real estate market ! <p> In the past year Miami real estate properties appreciated at an average rate of 8.2% , compared to 6.1% for the US . The three-year Miami appreciation is 27.4% versus 22.6% in the US .

The main reason is growing prices . Real estate prices in Miami increased by 40% in the last 3 years , and they are expected to grow at 10% per year from now on . This rise will be pushed by the growing economy , the growing Latino population , baby-boomers retirees , South American investors , and investors pushed by Brexit . This means that the best strategy in Miami is long-time real estate investments as both rents and property prices will keep going up . <h> Top Neighborhoods <p> One very important question that you should answer for yourself before purchasing your income property in the Miami real estate market is which neighborhood is the best for you ( for traditional renting as opposed to Airbnb ) .

Either way , the question of how much to charge for rent remains a critical one . Setting a rental rate treads the fine line between making a profit and keeping potential renters away . We 've sorted through the factors you need to consider in setting your rate so that you do n't have to eat SpaghettiOs for dinner while your properties collect dust . Below , 4 things that determine how much rent to charge for your investment property : <h> MARKET WORTH- <p> The amount you charge for rent is typically a percentage of your property 's market value . Before taking the percentage , you need to get an accurate value of your property . <p> There are few ways you can determine the value . A quick google search leads you to some online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advice ? Use a few different calculators , keeping in mind that some include factors that others might not . For example , one calculator takes into consideration square footage while leaving out the number of bedrooms and bathrooms . All of the above are important so be sure to choose a calculator inclusive of all important information . <p> It might be a good idea to simply pay a visit to a real estate agent to get an idea of what similar properties are going for . A simple inquiry ( or a few ) can give you an idea of what properties with similar size and location are valued at . <p> After doing your research , you should end up with an accurate value for your property . Typically , the rental rate is a percentage of this value . On average , the percentage falls in between 0.8% and 1.1% .

To do this , you can call around , pose as an interested renter and ask what the landlord is charging . Maybe even pay a few visits to other rentals and compare the condition , amenities , and location with the price they 're asking . You can also browse websites with property listings similar to yours . Are the rates reasonable ? Way too high ? <p> You want to stay competitive , offering rental rates that give your tenants a good price for a pretty sweet spot " especially compared to other landlords .

Chances are that the properties on your street all fall into the same range , so do n't stray too far from the pack . The neighborhood is something potential tenants consider when property-hunting .

@@44409442 @4409442/ <h> Should I Use My Savings to Buy a Family Home or a Rental Property ? <p> For many people the struggle of saving money in order to purchase their first family home is increasing with the continued rise of the real estate market . Owning a personal family home brings stability and ends years of paying rent for many people . But is this the right move for real estate investors ? Does it make more sense to buy a family home or a rental property first ? These are questions facing investors that are confused about which path to undertake first . <p> Family homes are a great choice for buying real estate properties if you are already rich and financial stable . For those who have money saved up for either a rental property or a family home , the idea of investing in a family home becomes worrisome . Owning a home costs a lot of money in terms of interest , down payments , repairs , and taxes . Owning a rental property would be costly as well , but it offers the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real estate investing point of view , buying an income property before buying your personal home makes a lot of sense . <h> Why Invest in Rental Property Instead of Family Home ? <h> Source of Income <p> Unlike family homes , which can drain your income through mortgage payments and taxes , - rental properties are actually a good source to have a secondary source of income other than the one you already have from your full-time job . A mortgage for a rental property could be practically paying for itself depending on the rental income- that you manage to generate and the mortgage payments that you have to make . Family homes do n't provide that because it will be you who lives there rather than tenants paying rent . Moreover , purchasing your home will have drained your entire savings for a down payment . Of course , to become a real estate investor , you will need to sacrifice the need for a family home by getting a rental property that will make you money , which is totally worth the inconvenience from living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have a certain amount of savings which they plan to spend on buying a family home should think again . A family home is not equivalent to saving money ( from not paying rent ) because it will cost you a lot , especially in the beginning . Not all real estate properties are built and decorated in the way that their buyers have always imagined their dream home ; everyone sees their future home in a different way . This makes family home purchases costly due to the renovations and repairs that will be needed in order to make the property as you want it to be , because that 's the only way you 'll feel it was money well spent . After all those expenses have been paid , you will still need to pay monthly utility bills including electricity , gas , and water . <p> Compare that to rental properties , and you will find a major difference in the operational expenses . A rental property might need necessary repairs , but the renovation quality and cost do n't have to be to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Renting out your investment property also means that you do n't need to worry about utility bills- as the tenants will pay for them . <h> Leads to a Second Investment <p> To put this point in the simplest way , we are going to consider two scenarios : A and B. Scenario A explains the possibility of buying a second real estate property if a family home was purchased first , and scenario B looks at the opportunity to- buy a second property if a rental property was purchased instead . <p> Scenario A : Purchasing a family home as we mentioned before will undoubtedly consume all your saving account and/or cost you mortgage payments for years to come . This family home has already forced its buyer to chase financial stability , between mortgage payments and trying to save again to buy a second property . It 'll be years before you are thinking of purchasing another property again . <p> Scenario B : If you ditch the plans to buy a family home for now and go for a rental property , what happens ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have mortgage payments , the rental income of your property will cover them and perhaps give you more profit to save on the side . The positive cash flow from a rental property gives you the ability to keep building your real estate investment portfolio because it provides you with another income source . If you are successful , then what is to stop you from getting that family home you dream of and becoming an owner of two properties : one for profit and one to live in ? Or you might even get so much into real estate investing that you decide to go for another rental property before you buy a home . <h> Being Less Picky <p> Let 's be real , you are always more picky about what property you buy when you start visualizing yourself living there and it being your family home . For rental properties it is an entirely different prospect . Yes , you would want the property to be of high standard and to constitute a good investment , but all these personal reasons go away . Personal preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if it is close to your childrens school , while these things wo n't matter if you will be renting that property out to tenants . <h> Young Investor <p> The youth are more flexible when having a choice between a rental property or family home . This is because their current living habitat will suffice for now- and they would rather focus on making money , at least in the time being . Rental properties can guarantee young people a way to make extra money to build their futures . If you are a young investor- whether married or single then a family home would seem redundant at this point . <h> Creating Partnerships <p> Buying a family home eliminates the possibility of having real estate partnerships . You ca n't offer a proposal to anyone to jointly own your property ; its risky and unreasonable . Becoming a real estate investor who makes profit from investments means you are able to seek out partners . A partner can help you expand on those investments and make it easier for you to purchase better quality rental properties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above is that the smartest move would be avoiding a family home as your first investment in real estate . Saving money does n't come easy to many people , and in order to save money again you need to be debt free . This is why a rental property is the logical choice ; it gives you more security for the future , a rental income , less expenses to pay , and most importantly investing experience . Investing and profiting should be the priority ; the family home will come eventually as a result of that investment in real estate .

@@44409443 @4409443/ <p> As a form of a rental expense , Airbnb taxes and fees are unique in some ways . For starters , you have no control over the tax rate , while you have more control over other expenses , like renovations and repairs . And while expenses like renovations and repairs are not always or necessarily mandatory , Airbnb taxes and fees are . Different Airbnb tax rates in cities are things to consider for your overall Airbnb cash flow . So , that begs the question , which cities have the worst tax rules for Airbnb ? <p> A great place to find an answer is in R Street 's Roomscore 2016 study . The report assesses the short-term rental ( including Airbnb ) regulations in the largest 59 cities across the United States . There are 5 different criteria in which cities are assessed , and tax obligations is one of them . <p> According to the report , laws and regulations for Airbnb taxes and fees in all of the 59 cities were not that significant in influencing the overall ranking . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report . Still , though , Airbnb taxes and fees can influence your cash flow , but maybe not to any extreme or worrisome level . Here are the five cities mentioned in the report and their tax rules according to Airbnb . <p> Transient Occupancy Tax . You 'll hear that term a few more times in this blog . This tax is set for hotels and short-term rentals in California and many other states . According to Airbnb , hosts in Oakland are required to pay 14% of the listing price ( including cleaning fees ) as a transient occupancy tax for reservations that are 30 days or less . <p> By Oakland 's definition , a short-term rental is used for 30 days or less , so Airbnb is included by default . Hotels are also required to pay at the same rate for this tax . So why is Oakland on this list if both short-term rentals and hotels pay the same rate for this tax ? Well , according to the Roomscore report , short-term rentals in Oakland pay a higher rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland have to pay more in the overall taxes of their property compared to hotels . <p> Once again , the transient occupancy tax is implemented . Just like in the previous Californian city , San Fran 's transient occupancy tax rate is at 14% , including any guest fees and cleaning fees . Unlike Oakland 's tax rate , however , the tax applies to reservations that are 29 days or less . Just like Oakland , the tax is collected and remitted by Airbnb . However , unlike Oakland , you may not have to pay the transient occupancy tax . Airbnb is the only Qualified Website Company in San Francisco . So , if you only rent through Airbnb , you are n't required to pay the transient occupancy tax . San Francisco and Airbnb have a history of legal issues , to say the least . Be sure to check out the most recent complication here . <p> Unlike the two previous cities , Portland hosts are required to pay a transient lodging tax . As a matter of fact , Portland is unlike all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only city that requires short-term rentals to pay a transient lodging tax . A transient lodging tax is a tax on renting rooms to transient occupants , i.e. guests , for any time less than 90 days . As in most cities , a short-term rental is defined as a rental for guests for 30 days or less . According to Airbnb , Portland hosts are required to pay a transient lodging tax of 6% of the listing price and cleaning fees . Even with its Airbnb taxes and fees issues , Portland is a great place to rent for this year , whether it 's traditional or Airbnb . <p> The City Beautiful is n't so beautiful when it comes to the different Airbnb taxes and fees hosts have to take into account . For starters , there 's the tourist development tax . In Orange County , where Orlando is located , this tax is at 6% of the listing price including cleaning fees for reservations of 182 days or less . Then there 's the transient rental tax , in which all counties of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tax is set as 6% of the listing price including cleaning fees for reservations of 182 days or less . Finally , there 's the discretionary sales tax . Like the development tax , this tax applies to all Florida counties . This tax is at 0.5-1.5% of the listing plus cleaning fees . Why are Orlando 's taxes applicable for 182 days or less ? A short-term rental in the city is set for 6 months or less , unlike 30 days or less in most cities . <h> 5 . ) Galveston , Texas <p> The Island of Texas has a relatively similar Airbnb taxes and fees rate compared to the other cities on this list . A total of 15% of the listing price and cleaning fees , 9% from local tax and 6% from state hotel occupancy tax , accounts for the Airbnb taxes and fees of Galveston . The hotel occupancy tax is pretty moderate itself , sure . However , according to the Roomscore report , hosts must report on this tax monthly , regardless of rental activity . Sounds annoying , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report , so the overall impact of the city 's regulations may not be very detrimental . <p> All in all , Airbnb taxes and fees should be in the back of every host 's mind . It may not worsen the overall hosting experience , as in Galveston and Orlando . Regardless , the Airbnb taxes and fees rules of these two cities , and the others mentioned , are not pleasant .

Before making any purchase , we have to think and consult with others to take an opinion about doing it or not . All of us at some point assumed that when you 're buying the house , the seller is the winner and you are a loser . Finally this is about to change . A dramatic shift in the US housing market will see the scale balance switch . Buyers will finally be able to have the last laugh about their purchase because it will soon be a buyers market . <p> The housing industry was favoring the sellers and not buyers for- one simple reason . Selling power . The sellers were holding the strings controlling the price to suit their needs and demands .

But to answer the most important question , why is the tide shifting ? What factors have caused this change ? The answer rests in four fundamental housing purchase factors , which are increased number of houses for sale , historically low mortgage rates and a stable economy . These things put together decide whether you are ready for buying an investment property or not . <h> Increase in Number of Houses <p> It is universally known that when there is an excessive amount of supply of a valuable property or service , its price will be pushed down . The same law applies here , with more houses being built and put up for sale it creates less chances of the sellers controlling the power of the process . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only and around 200 potential buyers .

Not all potential buyers have the same taste , price and location preference ; therefore chances are that they are going to dictate how the selling game is being played . Buying an investment property will be a whole lot easier when you have so many options to choose from . <p> The increasing number of homes had one more effect on the housing market from another dimension .

Even at its rise the mortgage rate is still low compared to ten years ago after the global financial crisis . Buying an investment property is hugely dependent on the mortgage rates you need to pay because it determines if you will be using that investment to pay off the mortgage rate or making some profit . <h> Stable Economy <p> The fact remains that the U.S. economy is witnessing an increase in fortunes in the last couple of years due to political , economic and social stability .

There has never been a better time to buying an investment property and using it for the sole purpose of making profit . Too many buyers have stood up to what they thought what was wrong ; the price tinkering that was being made by sellers for years .

@@44409455 @4409455/ <p> But the big question that remains is : How do you buy low and sell high in real estate investing ? Let 's take a look at several strategies for buying an investment property low and selling it high . <h> 1 . Follow the real estate market cycle <p> Every few years , each real estate market goes through a full cycle including the following stages : early downturn , full downturn , bottom , early recovery , early stable , and late stable . Each of these stages has certain characteristic features , and you should learn them well if you want to be a successful real estate investor . Most importantly , early downturn is the point at which the real estate market has reached its peak . Prices have achieved a maximum value and start falling down , while the cap rate and CoC return are going up . Mortgages are becoming harder to get . At the bottom of the real estate market , prices and rents are the lowest , while the cap rate has reached a peak level . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched in 1995 , the best strategy for buying an investment property low and selling it high is to plan your real estate investments based on the real estate market cycle . This means that you should be buying an investment property at the bottom of the cycle , when prices are low . Then , once you 've decided it 's time to part with your income property , you should wait till the peak ( between the late stable and early downturn periods ) , when prices are high . It sounds like a smart move , no ? This means that your rental property will make significant money for you through appreciation without even taking into consideration the rental income that you will receive between the purchase and the sale times . <p> An important note : if you decide to go for this strategy , you should keep in mind that different real estate markets within the US reach their peak and trough at different times , so you should keep an eye at the particular market you are interested in . Just because prices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that prices in San Francisco are also at their lowest.2 <h> 3 . Consider out-of-state real estate investing <p> Directly related to the points above , if you are looking for buying an investment property low and selling it high , you should be open to out-of-state real estate investing . Although this strategy definitely has some disadvantages , the benefits it offers could be much more significant . Let 's face it , if you want to grow as a real estate investor , experts recommend to buy a new rental property every 2 to 3 years . To do this , you have to be proactive , you ca n't just sit there and wait for the right moment in your local market for respectively buying an investment property low or selling it high . You have to go after opportunities in other states , beyond the 20-mile radius , to find the right properties . Mashvisor will help you in this regard as the available investment property calculator will provide with figures for thousands of available rental properties across the US , from the comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel hundreds or thousands of miles to just see the property and take the numbers . <h> 5 . Weigh up fix-and-flip <p> At the other end of the real estate investing spectrum is the fix-and-flip strategy , which means buying an investment property in a poor state , doing the biggest possible fixes at the lowest achievable cost , and then selling it to buy another property . In this case , you are certain to buy low ( because the income property is in such a bad condition ) and to sell high ( after the renovations that you have implemented ) . However , you should be careful not to spend too much on the fixes : the cost of fixing should always be significantly less than the difference in the sale and purchase price . <h> 6 .

Before you can decide on the best US housing market at the moment and find the best rental property , you need to do a real estate market analysis , conduct an investment property analysis , and get all the real estate comps . Without a rental property calculator , this can take months , and the most profitable income properties will probably be long gone before you arrive at the conclusion that you should have bought exactly them .

@@44409468 @4409468/ <h> What 's the big deal about a sublet agreement ? <p> Finding the right tenants for your property can be one of the most difficult tasks for a landlord to go through . The process involves interviews , background checks , financial guarantees or money if an agency is involved . This is why its important to choose tenants that will respect your rules and your property . Subletting is a common problem many property owners face . Subletting is when a long-term tenant rents out the property to a third party through a sublet agreement . <p> Many tenants who wo n't be using the property for a period of time and want the rent paid do so by subletting . It 's a very common and simple process for tenants to do . While authorizing your tenants to issue a sublet agreement for renters- is risky , let 's start off with some of the pros . <h> Pros of Subletting <p> Unlike finding tenants , owners will find subtenants are easier to find because it 's easier and cheaper to rent . Subtenants do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This results in a larger demand for the property at a time when the tenant wo n't be living in the property . <p> Allowing your tenant to issue a sublet agreement will result in a much lower vacancy rate for your property . This is especially the case if the tenant decides to leave the property with a short-term notice . The tenant can provide a subtenant that will save the owner from vacancy problems in the near future . <p> If a tenant is travelling and the property is empty for months , then an owners property becomes under the risk of burglary . Subletting the property- reduces the chances of burglary . <h> Cons of Subletting <p> The problem with a sublet agreement for the owner is that they do n't have control over the terms of the contract because its between tenant and subtenant . Unless an owner has an agreement with the tenant to have full control , then the subtenant wo n't recognize the owner 's power to control their property . <p> Subletting to make profit is becoming a common thing among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sublet it for a higher price to a third party resulting in profit for the tenant at the expense of the owner . For an owner , this is a problem because it is money that the owner could be profiting from to pay off a mortgage or to expand their investment . Profiting from subletting is the new trend in the real estate market today , which is why owners have to be careful . <p> Selecting a tenant based on their references and financial situation is easy for an owner if they fit the requirements . However , a subtenant might not have the same qualifications as the tenant . The owner could be faced with a bad subtenant abusing and destroying the property and it becomes very complicated to sue that person if the owner does not authorize the sublet personally . The tenant and the owner would have to face off in a legal battle that will cost lots of money . <p> Subletting could be illegal per state laws , which places the landlord at risk of being fined . So even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state laws regarding subletting could land the owner in financial and legal trouble with the government . For example , in New York it is illegal to rent an apartment or a room for less than 30 days unless the tenant or owner is living there as well . <p> The subtenant might have a financial situation where they are unable to pay the rent . The landlord would have to go a different channel to claim the money , which would be the original tenant . It becomes too complicated to collect rent money if there are too many parties conflicting that are involved . <h> Is Subletting Risky for the Owner ? <p> From a basic viewpoint , it is very obvious that subletting benefits the tenants more than the owner of the property . Property owners are in fact usually left harmed financially by subletting due to one of the reasons listed above . <p> The owner should have a clause in the lease agreement that makes it clear that a tenant is not allowed under any circumstances to sublet the property unless approved by the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a sublet agreement and if violated , the tenant risks eviction from the property . The owner can warn the tenant if they violate the terms of the agreement but if the warnings go on deaf ears , then the owner has the legal power to act as deemed necessary . A lease agreement preventing subletting is the only and most effective way to legally prevent any tenant from abusing your terms for renting . <p> A sublet agreement between tenant and subtenant might sound harmless at first to an owner , but if you think about it more , what does an owner profit from such an agreement ? The answer is , unfortunately , nothing . An owner will not make more money or have a better tenant when they allow subletting for their properties . The only thing they will be getting in return is uncertainty , losing control and possibly financial loss for their investment . This is why it is risky- to authorize tenants to have that power within their grasp .

In addition to this , the lock itself should ideally have measures in place to reduce the chances of anyone bypassing it .

In addition , many surveillance cameras can be integrated with other smart home devices , which let you have a network of security devices in place . This simple measure of layering your security helps provide a system of backup measures in case any one security protocol should fail . <h> 3 .

Also , the minor security improvements that you have to make to the exterior of your home are cost-effective and very high yielding . <p> Real estate investors should let their landscape work for them . In order to do this , make sure you plant hedges and bushes around secondary access points like windows . It 's an even better idea to make these plants thorny . This makes it harder for anyone to take advantage of your windows as an entry point . Also , using gravel and loose stones on walkways makes it much harder for anyone to sneak up to your property . These measures are meant to reduce the possibility of burglars or criminals using your exterior against you . <h> 4 .

For instance , with the use of exterior lighting , a security camera will be able to pick up more information , since it is monitoring a better lit environment . Real estate investors can make use of either automated exterior lights or switch operated ones . <h> 5 .

@@44409472 @4409472/ <p> It is universally known that investing in rental properties can bring a good return on the initial investment paid . This is more guaranteed if a real estate investor is able to find a specific winning investment strategy to follow . Having a defined investment strategy helps set the tone for the future as far as the investor is concerned even though real estate investors usually tend to diverse once they have gained enough experience . Two of the most common real estate investment strategies that people pursue are single family homes and multi family homes . <p> To better understand the difference between single family homes and multi family homes , one must first understand what each one is as an investment opportunity . Single family homes are defined as real estate properties that consist of one property unit that houses only one family ; the property can be a condo , a house , or a townhouse amongst others . On the other hand , - multi family homes are defined as real estate properties that have more than one unit , which can ultimately house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment building , a duplex , or triplex , to name a few . <p> Now that we know what single family homes and multi family homes are , it is time to answer a more important question that- real estate investors have . What is the difference between the two in terms of real estate investing and which one should investors go for ? However , to answer the question about their differences , we must first find the similarities between the two as investment properties : <h> Similarities between Single Family Homes and Multi Family- Homes <p> Investing in either of these rental property types will require an investor to pay high interest rates and a down payment of at least 20% , which could be a hefty price for some real estate investors . However , this can change if the purpose of buying this property is for residential purposes for the owner and not as a real estate investment . Banks are stricter on investment properties because they are more risky . <p> Single family homes and multi family homes have a good return on investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually able to generate more than 1% of the cost of the property per month ; this will lead to a positive cash flow . Taking a mortgage loan to fund the purchase of either rental property type can be beneficial for investors ; through rental income , real estate investors are able to pay off mortgage expenses with ease . <p> Investing in either of these income property types will give the owner tax benefits in the form of tax deductions related to mortgage and property- tax , which can be very helpful to reduce expenses . <p> Now that we have gotten a basic understanding of how single family and multi family properties can be similar in many aspects , understanding the differences between the two can be more detailed : <h> Differences between Single Family Homes and- Multi Family Homes <h> Single Family Homes <h> Affordability <p> This is one of the main advantages of single family homes . This type of rental property has a lower cost for investment than multi-family properties , which makes it more affordable to more investors . The total cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by other factors- as well . Insurance rates for single family homes are lower less because the insurance covers only one housing unit . Utility expenses are usually non-existent ( from the point of view of the investor and landlord ) in a single-family property rentals since most rental agreements require tenants to pay most or all of the utility expenses . <h> Appreciation is Higher <p> Due to more demand and focus on single family homes , these tend to appreciate more than multi family homes . Lenders usually see the difference between both when valuing them . Multi-family properties are valued based on the conditions of the real estate property and the rental income they make ; meanwhile , the valuation of single-family properties is purely based on supply and demand factors , and demand is not lacking at all . <h> Better Tenants <p> The fact is that tenants who rent single family homes usually view that rental property as their own home and tend to take good care of its condition by constantly communicating with the landlord . Single-family properties also have way less turnovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also makes it easier for first time investors in the real estate market . Having the daunting task to manage a multi family home with little real estate experience can be a bit tricky to navigate through . <h> More- Exit Strategies <p> If a real estate investor decides to sell a single-family property , he/she will have more chances of selling it quicker and for better money than multi-family properties ; this creates better exit strategies for investors . Single family homes are in demand by investors , families buying a home , and as a lease-to-own option . Multi-family properties are limited to investors in real estate . <h> Multi-Family Homes <h> Higher- Rental Income <p> This factor is the main reason that makes investors go for multi-family properties as a real estate investment . The fact that an investor can purchase a rental property that has multiple units with each one of them generating a monthly rental income makes it a very desirable investment . Compare that to single family homes where a real estate investor has only one source of rental income from one tenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant cash flow from various sources . <h> Less Vacancy Issues <p> The possibility of vacancies in multi family homes is not absent ; - however , it is definitely less costly and less frequent than vacancies in single family homes . If one of the units is vacant for a month or two , the landlord will still be making rental income from the other units that are being rented . Single-family property owners do n't have that luxury , and having a vacancy basically means that their rental income goes to zero . <h> Controlling the Value <p> With a multi-family property , a landlord will have the chance to have the fate of the income property in his/her own hands . The fact that these type of real estate properties are valued based on the rental income they generate makes real estate investors become more motivated to get the maximum income from their property . The future valuation of the real estate property rests solely on the hard work and creativity of the investor . Single family homes are subject to economical factors in their valuation process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single family homes and multi family homes can be a very profitable real estate investment . It comes down to which strategy or type of investment an owner wants to be a part of : Investing more money in a risky yet more profitable investment like a multi-family property or choosing the more stable long-term investment of a single-family home . It all depends on preferences , involvement level expected , and budget that each investor chooses .

Consistent Demand <p> Sixty percent of full-time college students at public universities and 26% in private universities live off campus ( For a list of the top 100 US colleges and universities with the highest percentages of off-campus residence click here ) . Most of these students either live with their parents or in rental properties . <p> Students find rentals near universities attractive , especially if the property is very close to the university . There is always a constant demand in college towns ( or simply properties near universities ) as a semester draws near . <p> Although we just mentioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more that comes into play .

Parents tend to cover the rent , and sometimes even pay in advance , as it 's easier to pay for a full semester at once rather than to pay month by month . Student loans are also used to pay rent . Either way , you will be getting your money on time . <p> 3 . Higher Rent <p> You could be able to charge a higher rent from students than non-student tenants , because as we previously mentioned , there is a higher demand on rentals closer to the university .

Annual Turnover <p> Leasing will normally take place before a semester begins , but once the school year is over , it is possible that the property becomes vacant over the summer .

But even if the student is not a minor , consider having parents cosign the lease . <p> Tenant Screening : To further guarantee a safe and well-behaved tenant , find out more about the student . For example , does the student have a criminal track record ? Has the student been banned from living on campus for any reason ?

So the question remains , is real estate the best way to get rich ? <p> Based on the rise of investors in the real estate market , it is safe to assume that real estate investment is definitely a safe way to get rich . Just because you decide to buy a real estate investment , does n't make it a given that you will get rich because it all depends on so many factors , the biggest of them , yourself . There are so many aspects that can make you successful and rich in the real estate market including knowledge , hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate the best way to get rich , I personally think that the question is somehow misguided . The best way to get rich is yourself but in the real estate market you have a low-risk , low-cost and high return market that will give you the chance to prosper . <p> The major difference between real estate investments and other types of investments is that in real estate it all depends on you . There is always room for self-improvement and creativity to have an edge over others . Consider the stock market for example , nothing is in your control , your investment 's fate is tied to political , economic and even social aspects that can make you poorer or richer . Real estate is the exact same opposite because no matter how tough the times get for the market as a whole , a property is unlikely to- lose its full value . In the end , you will be able to recoup some of the money even in the worst-case scenarios . <p> Is real estate the best way to get rich ? We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conclusion yourself based on your expectations and your investment plans . <h> 5 Reasons Real Estate Could Make You Richer <h> A Rising Appreciation <p> Real estate properties are arguably one of the fewest investments that have an ever-rising value in the property price because the demand for the market increases . Appreciation can also be controlled- by the owner of the investment through minor or major improvements in the property that will cause its value to rise . Appreciation is one way that can make you richer if we are talking about long-term holding of investments to be sold later . If you ask people who bought properties 10 years ago in central locations in major cities , they will admit that if they sell now , they are more than likely to make a fortune . This has happened because of the rapid rise of population growth and people moving to major cities for job opportunities or studies . <h> Consistency in Cash Flows <p> On the small scale , if you own one property , then you will be getting a rental income every month as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income that is n't likely to drop or disappear . Now when you think about wealth and getting rich , people who own 10 or 20 properties and then are generating rental income from all of them , this is where getting rich happens . The more rental income you have , the faster you go from financial sufficiency to financial growth with your cashflow . <h> Self-Paying Mortgages <p> When you take a loan to buy a property , you basically assume that you have all these mortgage payments to make every month that will basically not make you rich . How can you get rich when you have expenses and mortgages to pay right ? But if you think about it , renting your property for the average prices will produce an income that will at the very least cover the mortgage payments of the property . That means that after a number of years , the rental income of your property will have paid out your mortgage fully and you would still have an apartment in your name . That 's one way property owners get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cash ? <h> Demand on Rental Properties <p> The risk of demand going down in rental properties or the real estate market in general does n't exist . Why ? Because people will always need to rent flats because of lack of money to buy or other personal reasons . This is why entering the real estate market strongly gives you a chance for wealth because you are almost certain one way or the other that you will have your property rented . <h> Tax Benefits <p> Real estate investors get a lot of tax deductions from the U.S. government . The government has made the tax system work in the favor of real estate investors compared to other business investors . That money being saved on taxes over the years is enough for some people to make another property purchase , taking their wealth and real estate market plans to another level . <p> So , - is real estate the best way to get rich ? Your answer would probably not change , but at least now you know all the facts that support the claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of the creativity of people to make so much money from real estate . If you are committed enough to succeed and to give it your all , then you have all the necessary tools to cope .

@@44409488 @4409488/ <h> How to Save Money on an Income Property <p> If you 're like the rest of us , then you try to save as many hard-earned bucks as you can . Obviously though , you can only save within reason . As an income property investor , you will find yourself spending money on your property from time to time , but this is to the betterment of your investment . Spending considerable amounts in the meantime will often save you massive payments in the future . Here are four ways to save money on an income property . <h> Get Help <p> Running an income property does not have to be a one-man show . To save time , energy , and money , hire some professionals that will provide help . <p> At some point , doors will need to be repaired , circuits will get loose , and the toilet will leak . These problems could be solved by handymen , electricians , and plumbers , respectively . Sure , you could conduct these tasks if you know how , but you would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform the fix . <p> It 's important that every damage is repaired quickly . If not , you could lose money in two ways . The tenant will become upset and will be more likely to leave . Keeping tenants ( especially good ones ) is a top priority . Also , the damage could become worse , along with your property . Hire handymen , contractors , and other professionals who will fix up your rental . Those working freelance tend to charge less than those tied with companies . <p> A great income property has great management . Having a property manager will save you a lot of time and money by taking care of multiple duties . The property manager will take care of tenants ' problems , advertise your rentals , review applications , present the property to interested tenants , review local laws , sometimes act as a handyman , and collect rent . As you can see , having a manager places a lot of temporal and financial stress off your shoulders . <h> Recurring Renovations <p> Wait , how do renovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost money ! That 's true , but here 's why this works . Renovations repair issues that can worsen in the long-term , that end up costing you much more . Not only that , but renovations make your tenants happy and they become more likely to stay . You get lower vacancies and the tenants get satisfied , it 's a win-win situation ! <p> Renovations in kitchens and bathrooms in particular are both very useful and appealing to tenants . That 's because these two areas need a heightened degree of neatness , order , and cleanliness . Your main renovations in kitchens and bathrooms should attempt to improve maintenance and function . Doing things like changing the showerhead , adding a new dishwasher , and cleaning drains will definitely make your income property better . Renovations for alluring value also do n't hurt . Painting walls and adding a backsplash will make the income property look better . <p> Here 's another renovation tip : try to repair something before you replace it . This generally holds true . But , if repairing costs are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace . The call is yours ; do what you can to save money on your income property . If repairing a TV costs $50 , and getting a brand new TV of the same type is $300 , then it should be obvious which path to take . <h> Do n't Act The Fool <p> Sometimes you can save money but not dealing with the property , but instead with the tenant . The way you deal with the tenant , either foolishly or rationally , pre- and post-renting , will influence your income . <p> It 's a jubilating feeling to get a tenant interested in your income property , especially if you 're a new landlord . The problem , though , is that landlords may rush when accepting a tenant . How does this happen and what consequences can it have ? Landlords may forget or poorly screen the tenant . And , only after the furniture in the rental is all gone , does the landlord find out that the tenant ' is on the police 's most wanted burglars list . <p> Ok , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still valid . Landlords may not get a proper background on their tenants , which can make them lose cash . Be sure to screen the tenant and have him/her fill out a rental application . The goals of the application and screening are to obtain the tenant 's basic information . You need to know who this person actually is and if he/she will be able to pay rent .

@@44409491 @4409491/ <h> Invest in Condos or Single-Family Homes ? <p> This is a common question in real estate investing , is a condo or a single-family residence ( SFR ) better as an- investment property ? We did n't want to just provide a list of pros and cons , because you 're probably looking for flat-out , direct answer . Well , we think we have one. - SFRs are generally better investments- but here 's why and how you can decide . <p> Condos are great they 're usually in the best locations , offer great amenities and cater to people looking for a simple lifestyle . The main downside to condos is the- HOA fees . Depending on the location , these fees can be as much as the mortgage payment and really hurt cash flow . The benefit to paying these fees is having maintenance and some- insurance- costs calculated in , which can relieve the landlord . However , if your condo decides to do a- special assessment , that can impair the entire investment . <p> So , is paying the HOA fees worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I hesitate to say it , but it depends . If the HOA fees are just a couple of hundred dollars a month or year , then it 's worth it . But if you 're in area where the fees range from $500-$1,000/month , then it 's probably throwing money away. - Fixing a SFR on a need-be basis is more likely to be a lot cheaper . <p> Which brings us to our next point , - maintenance . Condos do n't require as much maintenance as SFRs , which means less costs for landlords . SFRs definitely require maintenance but the difference is tenants are more prone to take up property maintenance . Tenants of SFRs are prepared to do all the little things to upkeep the residence because they are likely to be long-term residents . Taking out the trash , mowing the lawn , and taking care of the washer and dryer to avoid laundromats are habits of long-term tenants . Hence , tenants of SFR take care of their property more , reducing the amount of maintenance and costs . <p> Next and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( selling prices ) and can bring in significant rental income . On the other hand , it 's well-know that SFRs- appreciate- more because of the the land that is attached to the home . People are n't willing to pay more for condos on top of the increasing condo fees . Another interesting point to keep in mind is , the higher an HOA fee , the lower the loan a buyer can qualify for , which can eliminate your opportunity to sell a condo later . Income is also affected by- vacancies- and condos tend to have higher vacancies than SFRs . Finally , depending on location , renting out individual bedrooms in SFRs could generate more income than an entire condo . <p> The last main advantage of SFRs is the amount of power a landlord has . With condos , there are bylaws that have to be followed . Furthermore , there are limits to the number of condos that can be rented out by owners as investment properties which can take away your investment opportunity all together . Rent regulation also affects your ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that numbers are what count and are more important than any generalization made . For any investment property , calculate the cash flow using an- investment property calculator- and consult experienced investors . SFRs could be a better investment than a condo but sometimes multi-family units are better . If you 're able to purchase a small multi-family building , then you become the HOA and can make your own rules and own fees . Multi-family buildings can be the best option because of the ability to have a personal residence while having one or- multiple income properties . <p> Among the other things to consider are your personal goals and financial situation . If you 're planning on eventually living in the investment property after renting it out for a while , then choosing between a SFR and a condo has to be based on your preferred lifestyle . Your budget also directs your- property search ; if you ca n't afford a SFR , that does n't mean you should n't consider investing in a townhouse or condo . The location also greatly contributes to the cash flow from condos. 
@@44409492 @4409492/ <h> What are mobile homes and mobile home parks ? <p> To be honest , when we talk about real estate investing , mobile homes and mobile home parks are not the first thing which comes to mind . That 's why it is important to define them and explain what they are before discussing how to invest in them : <p> Mobile homes : A mobile home , built in the US since the 1970s , is a form of housing comprised of a prefabricated structure , built on a permanently attached chassis , which then gets transported to a site . A mobile home can be located in a certain place permanently or semi-permanently or can also be moved around , hence the name . While mobile homes might have many disadvantages compared to regular homes , their biggest benefit is that they are very cheap . And that 's what has secured them their status as one of the top US real estate trends . Mobile homes can be used as a permanent home , as a vacation home , or as a rental property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has many pros and cons , which will be discussed in a bit . <p> Mobile home parks : A mobile home park , on the other hand , is a permanent or semi-permanent area for mobile homes . They offer excellent opportunities for less wealthy individuals and households and for people who move a lot . <h> Why are mobile homes and mobile home parks among the hottest US real estate trends ? <p> Despite some negative perceptions , mobile homes and mobile home parks have gained significant popularity in the US in the past decade to emerge as one of the leading US real estate trends . This holds true both in terms of housing and real estate investing . But why would so many people across the US prefer to live in a prefabricated , not permanently attached home or rental property ? The answer is simple " affordability . Mobile homes cost only a fraction of the price of typical homes , which is a huge plus in a society where many individuals are forced to live on $20,000 or less per year . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US population now lives in rental properties , with rents averaging above $1,000 a month . In such a market , tenants will naturally be drawn to investment properties rented for $500 or less , as is the case with mobile homes . Thus , it is no surprise that mobile homes and entire mobile home parks have emerged as one of the most popular US real estate trends . <h> What are the pros of mobile homes and mobile home parks as a real estate investing option ? <p> As one of the hottest US real estate trends , mobile homes and mobile home parks have many advantages over other , more traditional forms of real estate investments . Let 's look at the most important ones of them : <p> Low maintenance cost : Mobile homes are generally small and simple , which makes them easy and cheap to maintain . You will not have to worry about fixing the fence or cleaning the swimming pool or anything else like this when you have a mobile home as an investment property . <p> No need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain and manage and because in most cases they are close to your primary home , you do n't have to hire a professional property manager to take care of your income property . You can do all the work associated with owning and renting a mobile home on your own . Thus , being a landlord is cheap and easy in this case . <p> Return on investment : Because of the low investment property price and the low maintenance costs , mobile homes might end up generating very good return on investment , in terms of both CoC return and cap rate . That 's probably the main reason why you should think about one of the hottest US real estate trends . <p> New segment of tenants : If you become the landlord of a mobile home , you will be able to attract a new segment of tenants " namely lower income individuals and households who can not pay for a standard rental property . <p> Investment diversification : Every real estate investor should look for opportunities to diversify his/her real estate investment portfolio , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , they are a very different kind of investment from your typical rental property ; and second , you can buy many of them . <p> Easy to grow : It is much easier to grow as a mobile home real estate investor than as someone who invests in traditional single-family homes or condos . Mobile homes are so cheap that you can often pay for a second one with the rental income from the first one without much effort . Soon you can be the owner of an entire mobile home park . <p> No need for partnerships : Although networking is crucially important in real estate investing and partnerships offer opportunities you would not have as a sole investor , when it comes to mobile homes real estate investing , you do n't have to have a partner to start and grow . If you prefer to work on your own , that 's an excellent option . <p> Can move with you : If your full-time job requires you to relocate frequently , mobile homes will give you the option to take your investment property with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top US real estate trends . <p> Available loans : Though you might not need a loan to buy a mobile home , mortgages are still available for this type of investment . <p> Traditional and Airbnb : Mobile homes give you freedom as a real estate investor as they can be rented out traditional or Airbnb , depending on the exact location . <h> What are the cons of mobile homes and mobile home parks as a real estate investing option ? <p> Not much cash flow : If you are looking for a huge monthly check ( rental income ) , mobile homes are not the right kind of investment for you . However , remember that in real estate investing it is important to have positive cash flow which is easy to secure with mobile homes . <p> Low appreciation : If you go for appreciation as a real estate investor , mobile homes are not for you . Their prices do not increase significantly over time . <p> Bad tenants : Experience shows that lower income tenants are more likely to be bad tenants ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is exactly the kind of tenants you would have for a mobile home rental property . <p> Less available loans : Generally fewer loan ( mortgage ) options are available for people looking for buy a mobile home , mostly because they are seen as riskier due to their lower income .

They require a different kind of thinking . Moreover , they might attract some ridicule from other , conservative investors . <p> When you start considering your next investment property purchase , do n't limit yourself to traditional types of homes only .

@@44409495 @4409495/ <h> What Features Make the Best Investment Property ? <p> Probably the most important decision in real estate investing is about the income property that you will buy . How good of a rental property you own will be the main determinant of your success or failure as a real estate investor . While different markets and different tenant cohorts prefer different rental properties , it is possible to draw a profile of the best investment property , a property that will guarantee high profitability and little headaches to its owner . So , let 's have a look at what makes for the best investment property : <h> 1 . The best investment property has a strategic location <p> Maybe you are getting tired of hearing that location is a key factor in real estate investments , but that 's the truth . The first indicator to consider when thinking of buying a new income property is where it is located . In real estate investing , location means a number of things : the state , the city , the neighborhood , the street , the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure , etc . Once you start thinking about a certain market , make sure to conduct proper real estate market analysis to be able to make the right investment decision . If you have already selected a certain area , you should look for a location close to public transportation , good schools , reasonable shopping opportunities , and even hospitals . <h> 2 . The best investment property is located in a place with a strong economy <p> The local economy and labor market will determine how much demand there will be for your income property now and in the future in addition to how much rent you can charge ( i.e. , how much your rental income will be ) . Economies set to grow in the coming years and decades guarantee an influx of new incomers who will support a strong demand among tenants . <h> 3 . The best investment property is in a location with low property tax <h> 4 . The best investment property is in a city which allows Airbnb <p> Regardless of whether you are a fan of Airbnb or prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Airbnb is growing nationwide . This means that even if you decide that traditional is the better strategy for you at the moment , things might change tomorrow and you might want to switch to Airbnb . Thus , it is crucially important to select a location which allows for short-term rentals without an unnecessary burden on the landlord . As Airbnb is growing in popularity , many hotel associations are feeling threatened and are therefore lobbying hard to regulate and minimize or even fully eliminate Airbnb . So , you need to take a careful look at the local legislation in this regard before being able to choose the best investment property . <h> 5 . The best investment property is in a familiar market <p> This does n't mean that you should only invest in your own city or even state . Sometimes out-of-state real estate investing offers much better opportunities than investing within the 20-mile radius . What this rather means is that you should familiarize yourself well with the real estate market in the location you choose before being ready to purchase your new rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experience unpleasant surprises related to property taxes , landlord laws , Airbnb legislation , supply of and demand for properties , supply of and demand for rentals , and other crucially important factors . <h> 6 . The best investment property is likely to experience significant real estate appreciation <p> Another factor related to location which makes for the best investment property is choosing a place which is expected to undergo strong real estate appreciation in the coming years and decades . This means that you should go for areas where major infrastructure development projects have been planned and where the economy is expected to grow significantly as well as places where land is starting to become limited . While instant positive cash flow should be the main aim of a real estate investor , the importance of appreciation should not be underestimated for your overall profitability . <h> 7 . The best investment property is ( nearly ) ready to rent out immediately <p> As a real estate investor , you should rather go for income properties that are turnkey or at least require only minimal maintenance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste too much time , effort , and money on your new rental property before you can start making money from it . <h> 8 . The best investment property requires minimal maintenance and management <p> When buying a rental property , remember that you are buying exactly that and not your own home . Do n't make the mistake of going for an extremely luxurious property which will not only cost a lot to buy but also to maintain and manage . You want a property that is decent while still easy and cheap to take care of . <h> 9 . The best investment property is good for both traditional and Airbnb <p> Coming back to the issue of traditional vs . Airbnb , regardless of what strategy you prefer at the moment , your best investment property would be suitable for both ways of renting . The local economy , the real estate market , and the demand from tenants might change in the future , and you should be able to respond to this change . <h> 10 . The best investment property provides good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important factor which determines whether a certain rental property is a good investment choice or a bad one is the expected cash flow . You must always go for positive cash flow , regardless of how large of appreciation you might expect in the future . If your cash flow is negative , it means you are losing money instead of making money from your property , and this can not possibly be the best investment property . Obviously , the larger the cash flow , the better the property .

Real Estate Crowdfunding <p> Crowdfunding has been on the rise in recent years , and that holds true for real estate too . It is similar to a partnership in that you end up owning a rental property together with a few more people , but in this case it is a lot more people . Real estate crowdfunding has two advantages over a partnership : 1 ) It allows you to make money in real estate by investing even a smaller amount than in a partnership ; and 2 ) Thus , it allows you to own small parts of a few properties which will diversify your real estate investment portfolio . <h> 4 .

The most important advantage is that this allows you to make money in real estate with very little initial capital . Moreover , you will not be engaged in maintaining a rental property , dealing with tenants , arranging with contractors , and any other inconveniences of being a landlord . However , there is one serious disadvantage : investing in a REIT is much less exciting than buying a property because you will have no first-hand experience .

@@44409501 @4409501/ <h> What Is a Mortgage ? <p> A mortgage is a loan obtained from a lender used by real estate investors to purchase investment properties . Instead of paying for a property entirely in cash , an investor can use a mortgage to pay off most of the purchase . The part of the purchase the investor must cover is called the down payment . Over a number of years , the investor must repay the lender the amount of the loan , in addition to included- interest . <h> Three Types of Mortgages <p> There are three types of mortgage loans . The loans are differentiated based on how the property will be used and the occupancies in the property . <h> Owner-occupied mortgages <p> These mortgages are used for properties intended to be used as a primary residence . The buyer must move into the property within 60 days of closing the loan . Afterwards , the buyer must live in the property for at least a year . After that year , the buyer can choose to use the property as a rental . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan terms will not change . <h> Second-home mortgages <p> Second-home mortgages , as you could guess , are mortgages used to purchase properties used as second homes . This mortgage prevents using the property as a rental . If the property is used as a rental , the mortgage may be called due , which means that the investor would have to repay the loan in full . <h> Non-owner occupied mortgages <p> This type of loan is used as a mortgage for rental property . If an investor chooses to convert the rental to a primary residence , they are free to do so . This will not change the terms of the loan . <h> Interest on Mortgages <p> A mortgage for rental property has higher interest rates compared to mortgages for homes . In fact , that 's why rentals under non-owner occupied mortgages can be converted to residences . This puts the lender at less risk . Rates of rental property mortgages are about 0.25% to 0.75% higher than those of home mortgages . <p> Interest rates for rental property mortgages have been relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this writing in May 2017 , interest rates are in the low 4s . This may remain as it is or uptick as the year goes on . <h> Tax Status of a Mortgage for Rental Property <p> As a real estate investor , you could claim various expenses ( which you can calculate with Mashvisor ) in Schedule E of your tax forms . When it comes to mortgage for rental property , mortgage interest is tax deductible . The amount of mortgage interest paid during the taxable year is deducted from the rental income of the year . If the number is positive , the number is the investor 's income , which is taxable . If the number is negative , the number is loss , which reduces taxable income . This second scenario could vary depending on your income , so be sure to seek the help of a tax advisor . <h> How to Get a Mortgage for Rental Property <h> Contact a Lender <p> You 'll need to find a suitable lender to get a mortgage for rental property . It 's recommended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than national ones , are more likely to ask for lower down payments . Also , chances of getting a loan from these lenders are higher , since they- are usually more interested in investing locally . <p> It 's also recommended to work with a direct lender rather than a mortgage broker . A direct lender allows you to cut to the chase and get a mortgage for rental property directly . A mortgage broker , on the other hand , acts as a middleman between you and different lenders . By working with a direct lender , you 'll be in contact with the one who makes the head decisions . <p> This goes without saying , but you will need to research a lender before committing to one . Even once you 've found a lender that suits you , do n't shy away from asking any questions about more mortgage that come to your mind . <h> Requirements <p> There are a number of requirements you will need to be able to cover- a mortgage for rental property . Having these requirements will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan on buying rental property or buying a car , you will need to have good credit . What if you have bad credit ? Do n't worry , it 's still possible , here 's how . <p> Generally , if you are getting a mortgage loan for the first time , you will need a FICO credit score of at least 630 . After you have received four loans , the credit requirement boosts to 720 . <p> Credit is n't the only thing you 'll need for a mortgage for rental property , you 'll still need some cash . Aside from the down payment , most lenders will require from you to have 6 months ' worth of the mortgage payment as cash reserves . You can find out the estimated monthly payments from the lender . <p> The amount you pay on the down payment will depend on how many times you 've taken a loan and the property type . For single-family homes , the down payment is 20% for the first to the forth loan . From the fifth to the tenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , the down payment is 25% for the first to the forth loan . The down payment goes up to 30% after the forth loan . <p> Finally , lenders will want to see your W-2 income to see if you 've been working for the last two years . If you are working independently , you will need two years of tax returns and a year-to-date profit and loss statement .

The new trend that investors are following nowadays which is purchasing vacation rentals for tourists or travelers has become very successful . The rise of vacation rental websites is proof of how big the industry has become with the likes of Airbnb , VRBO , - Booking.com , and others . <p> Vacation rental websites have become so popular with all kinds of travelers ( from business people to families going on vacation ) that they are posing some serious competition to- the hotel industry around the globe and mostly in the US . The general view about hotels being more expensive is not a myth ; it is solid facts because they provide more services and because they have to secure salaries and profits for a larger number of people . However , these services are deemed luxurious and unneeded for many , which is why vacation rentals are turning into the new best choice . <p> With so many vacation rental websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of the most popular and reliable ones and compare their services : <h> The Most Popular Vacation Rental Websites <h> 1 . Airbnb <p> Airbnb is by far the biggest vacation rental website on the planet . It has over one million listings worldwide covering most regions around the globe . Its reach has expanded to over 34,000 cities in 190 countries . What makes Airbnb stand out amongst its competitors is that is it extremely popular among guests and hosts alike . <p> The Airbnb platform gives its users so many tools to stay organized , save time , and spend less money with minimum effort . The fact that the website has a well developed communication platform between guests and hosts serves all users perfectly . Calendars that organize the check-ins and checkouts keep hosts on top of things for their rental properties . Financing tools that keep track of your profits for each month also offer hosts much needed information about- their investment in an organized manner . <p> Becoming an Airbnb user is considered way cheaper than using other vacation rental websites for owners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees that are determined by the property owners . The Airbnb customer service , which is available 24/7 all year round , also gives them an edge over their competitors . Eventually , it seems that the Airbnb customer relations team is working hard to ensure that all guests and hosts are offered the best services with regards to- bookings , payments , and everything else . <h> 2 . VRBO <p> The main difference to notice when comparing VRBO to Airbnb is that the former acts as a platform to connect two parties ( a guest and a host ) . However , VRBO does n't engage in acting as a mediator between the two should a problem arise . This leaves guests in particular wondering about the quality and completeness of services offered by VRBO . <p> Payments on VRBO are not processed by the website ; instead , the guests and hosts have to facilitate payments between each other . This creates a more complex marketplace for both parties . On the other side , Airbnb 's attractiveness comes from the fact that the website ensures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $399 annual subscription fee that needs to be paid by property owners , and it is actually one of few vacation rental websites that charge hosts an annual fee for using their services . The fee is actually risky for hosts because they are not sure if their property will be appealing to guests or not . The amount also means that hosts could eventually be paying way more than what Airbnb users pay in their 3% booking fee . A particularly serious problem is if VRBO users can not attract enough visitors to pay for this payment or they barely break even . It all depends on the number of bookings per year in the end . <h> 3 . Booking.com <p> Booking.com can be considered a traditional or even old-fashioned vacation rental website because it has n't broken an important barrier . In specific , Booking.com does not support direct communication between the guest and the host through the website but instead acts as the facilitator of communication between the two . This feature gives the website a more commercial standing rather than a social one like Airbnb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee amongst the main competitors in the vacation rental market . With a whooping 15% booking fee per booking , it is easy to understand why real estate investors are not thrilled about advertising their property on Booking.com . <p> While Airbnb is one of the biggest vacation rental websites , Booking.com also stretches to all corners of the world . The difference is that Booking.com is more focused on the hotel industry and its partnership with many hotels around the world than on short-term property rentals . <h> The Best Option among Vacation Rental Websites <p> The best platform amongst these three ( and many other ) - vacation rental websites without a doubt has to be Airbnb . Its platform that empowers both the host and the guest has revolutionized- the real estate vacation market . The fact that Airbnb does n't charge hosts so much money makes it a preference for hosts in most countries . Airbnb 's popularity and marketing reach also makes it not only a major competitor in the vacation rental industry but also a major competitor for the glamorous hotel industry that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . If you are a host starting out and are feeling lost in the pool of vacation rental websites which all claim to offer you the most , then the simplicity and benefits offered by Airbnb will put you on the path to becoming an Airbnb super-host.

Real estate partnerships " if done properly " are a great way to extract the maximum benefit from your investment . Of course , they can turn into a nightmare if not planned and executed well . Thus , before you decide to embark not only on a real estate investment but also on a real estate partnership , you should think carefully whom you partner with and why . To help you in the process , here we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of real estate partnerships , what makes a good partner , and how you should organize the partnerships . <h> What Are the Advantages of Real Estate Partnerships ? <p> 1. - Pooling Together Resources : There is a point to entering a real estate partnership only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all partners bring in the same assets , most probably it is better to go on your own . The basic things which you need for a real estate investment are : <p> Money <p> A good property <p> Experience <p> Knowledge of real estate investing in general as well as of the local market <p> Time <p> A network <p> So , if let 's say , - you have come across this wonderful rental property but have no cash , it might be very beneficial to seek a partner who can bring in the necessary money for the appropriate share in the business . On the contrary , you might be sitting on piles of money and have no clue how or no time to invest them in real estate . Then again , it might be advantageous to find someone who is capable of and willing to do the work for you and split the profit . Also , if you are relatively new to the world of real estate investing , you should consider a real estate partnership with an experienced investor who will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network to make a successful investment . In this case , your partner will be your- mentor in the process of learning about dealing with rental properties and being a landlord . <p> 2. - Affording a Larger Investment Property : OK , we 've just said that you should never enter into a real estate partnership with people who bring in the same assets as you . Well , this is not entirely true when we talk about money . That is , it is sometimes necessary to find a partner so that you can afford a certain property . Let 's say you have $10,000 in the bank , so that 's all you can put as a down payment . If you find another trustworthy person willing to put $10,000 as well , you will be able to afford a property that is twice more expensive ( and can thus hopefully bring twice the profits ) . <p> 3. - Diversifying Your Investment Portfolio : Just like with investing in stocks , in real estate investments it is better to have a more diversified portfolio to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy rental properties through real estate partnerships , you will be able to buy more of them ( in case your partners bring money into the deal ) . <p> 4. - Have a Second Opinion : Depending on how you and your partner(s) split the work based on your qualities and experience , you will each be expected to perform certain tasks . Nonetheless , you will all have to agree on the major decisions such as how much you can afford , which property to buy , how to manage it , what tenants to have , etc . This means that you will have double ( or more if you enter with more partners ) the analysis that you would have if you invest on your own . Since you start your real estate partnership with intelligent , responsible people , it should be beneficial to hear another ( professional ) opinion . <p> 6. - Task Division : If you work with partners , you will not have to do every single thing , and remember " real estate investing is not easy even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the right partner ) to split the necessary work with someone . <p> 8. - Accountability : Let 's face it . As much as we would like to be , most of us are not too well organized and might fall behind in documenting our real estate business . But if you have to divide the expenses and profits with someone else , you will be forced to stay on track and be very accountable , which will in turn be beneficial for your business . <h> What Are the Disadvantages of Real Estate Partnerships ? <p> Well , if it not necessarily all roses when it comes to real estate partnerships . In the worst scenarios , they might turn into real nightmares . Here are some potential shortcomings you should keep in mind : <p> 1. - Poor Planning and Structuring : If you and your partners are bringing in exactly the same assets to the real estate partnership and/or if you do n't spell out clearly who is doing and getting what , your partnership is very likely to fail miserably . <p> 2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership you enter , even with what you consider the most trustworthy person . People are greedy and lazy , so they might try to trick you into giving them more of the profit or forcing you to do more work . <p> 3. - Unexpected Liability : You might end up being held liable for things you did not expect , and you might even be sued if responsibilities and liabilities are not clearly divided and written down . <p> 4. - Guilt : If you are the one doing most of the actual work ( choosing the property , managing it , dealing with tenants , etc. ) , you might get blamed for factors beyond your control if things do n't go as expected . <p> 3. - Agree on the Profit-Sharing : Based on who brings what in , agree who will take what out . If one partner puts down all the money and the other does all the work , maybe it is fair to split the profit in half . <p> 5. - Be Fair and Honest : Do n't try to cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the profit . In real estate investing , networking is crucial . You do n't want to ruin your reputation for future deals and partnerships . <p> 6. - Communicate Regularly : It is not necessary to talk on daily basis , but both you and your partners should be aware of what is going on with your common investment . If your partner brought in the money , while you are managing the property , tell them well in advance about expected future needs to maintain the property , tell them when a tenant leaves , ask for their approval on a new tenant , tell them if finances are looking bad or if you expect a large profit this year . <p> 7. - Sign a Contract : A real estate partnership is a business and should be treated as such , so sign a contract with your partners which clearly specifies each one 's responsibilities and benefits . <p> Real estate partnerships have given many investors the opportunity to make much more money over the course of a few years than they would have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have given headaches and even driven bankrupt many people who might have done just fine on their own .

What do they value most ? Location and amenities . That means all the bells and whistles and amenities that you can think of .

It is hard to really pinpoint the right age to start investing , want to know why ? Because there is no right or wrong age . Investing in property at a young age seems like a bit of a frightening prospect sometimes . Most young people do n't have a lot of disposable income , often have poor credit , and might have- student loans . However , young investors have such a good opportunity if they start investing at such a young age because they can get their compound interest started . Before they know it , theyve set up a retirement fund. - If they start now and do it solid for 5-10 years they can be set for the rest of their lives . So for all you young investors , now is your time ! <h> Why invest in real estate at a young age ? <p> It 's never too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner the better . Investing in real estate while you are young gives you an education . The money is great , of course . Yet , real estate investment teaches you to think in new ways . It requires problem solving and determination to wait for the best deals . You will learn to assess things differently . It 's great for young investors to start investing while they are still young and in control and while they still have time to make mistakes and understand from them . <h> How to start young ? <p> Watch your debt <p> This is probably the most important thing to getting started . Pay off things like student loans and credit cards and keep these things under control because banks look at your debt and credit before they even think about giving you money . <p> Watch your credit <p> Whether you 're looking for that dream home to live in or a property to rent out , you 'll likely have to work with a bank to get a mortgage unless you 're blessed with heaps of cash . Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at your credit history , which probably is n't the strongest when you 're young . So as a- young investor , watch your credit history and keep it under control by paying your bills and loans on time . <p> Learn from those who have been there , done that . <p> Speak to others who started investing young , to gain a realistic view of the financial journey , sacrifices they took , and the rewards . Educating yourself through the experiences of other people is crucial for young investors who want to start investing in real estate . <p> Save wisely <p> Lenders look for evidence of consistent savings over time . Get into good saving habits from an early age by putting aside money from any working income , even casual jobs . To meet lender 's guidelines , you 'll need to show savings of 3% of your purchase price , generally over a six-month period . <p> One main advantage to investing when you are young is that if anything goes wrong , you will have more time to make mistakes and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose and everything to gain , so why not get started ? <h> Avoid- these mistakes <p> 1 . Hesitating <p> The market is constantly changing and evolving and one common mistake that young investors make is that they hesitate when a good deal arrives . Good investment deals are hard to find so when one comes your way do n't delay the opportunity because you are indecisive . <p> 2 . Heart over head <p> When buying a property , about 90% of your purchasing decision will be based on emotion and only 10% on logic . This is understandable , as your home is where your heart is . It 's your sanctuary . When it comes to investing however , letting your heart rule your buying decision is a common trap and should be avoided at all costs . Allowing your emotions to rule your judgement means you are more likely to over-capitalize on your purchase , rather than negotiating the best possible price and outcome for your investment goals . - You should always buy an investment property based on research ! Ask yourself questions such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you require ? <p> It is in the best location to attract quality tenants ? <p> 3 . Not doing your homework <p> Understanding the markets takes time and one common mistake young investors make is that they do n't study their investments correctly . Getting to grips with the nature of real estate is something that even experts have trouble with . So do n't think you can read a couple of books and have a handle on exactly what to buy . You need to know the neighborhood you intend to invest in like the back of your hand . Make yourself completely familiar with any given area by talking to the locals , real estate agents and property managers . Find out all about the amenities , vacancy rates and historical values of properties in the area . When you know the area , get to know the street you intend to buy in and the property you intend to buy . You can never know too much about your investment ! <p> It 's easy to fall into the trap of poor cashflow management as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring and holding property can be difficult . Always seek the advice of a professional accountant who knows about real estate investments to ensure you know exactly what you 're getting into financially .

If not , can you manage any shortfall ? Do n't forget to account for any possibilities such as unexpected maintenance costs . <p> It 's great to dream about the riches you can make from real estate no matter how young or old you are , but it 's critical to enter into property investment with your eyes wide open when it comes to all the out of pocket expenses you 'll acquire along the way . As young investors , you need to make sure to examine each potential investment analytically and reasonably . Most of all , you need to enjoy the ride of real estate investing and not be afraid to take the opportunity because it truly is a great experience .

@@44409514 @4409514/ <h> 4 Different Ways of Renting Out Your Property <p> When it comes to renting out your property , you would commonly assume that there is only one way : give your tenants a one-year lease and receive a rent check every month . However , there are different ways to make bank on your property . Check out these four different strategies to creatively rent out your property . <h> 1 . Corporate Housing <p> Corporate housing means renting out your property to a business . The property is fully furnished before it is rented . It is similar to hotels in the sense that services and utilities are included except that you are not responsible for housework . In fact , corporate housing is rented out by employees on traveling on business who do not want to spend more money on hotels . <p> The main benefit of corporate housing is that it is more profitable than typical renting . Although many factors such as location , property , and the market will dictate how much you will earn from corporate housing , it is generally more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect two or even three times the income from a traditional rental . <p> Another pro of renting out your property though corporate housing is that vacancies are not as detrimental as they would be with traditional rentals . You will still be earning much more than from a typical rental unit , and this can give you time to enhance the property when necessary , which brings us to our next point . <p> A common con is that will you have to spend a lot on the property in terms of amenities , cleaning , furnishing , and maintenance . Your tenants will expect a premium unit , therefore it should look and function like one , which compels you to spend more . You can calculate these expenses with Mashvisor . <p> Overall , corporate housing is more profitable than renting in a typical fashion . It will cost more to maintain , but when conducted properly and in the right market , the potential earnings outweigh the expenses . <h> 2 . Vacation Homes <p> Renting out your property as a vacation home can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rented throughout the year , usually in a particular season , but is also used by its owner for more than 14 days or 10% of the number of days it is rented during the year , whichever one is greater . <p> Location is perhaps one of the most important considerations when selecting a vacation home . Beach houses and ski resorts are common forms of vacation homes . Consider what makes your selected location luring to tourists and apply that to the property you want to rent . <p> Like corporate housing , vacation homes are seen as an alternative to hotels . During particular seasons , vacation homes are on very high demand and thus generate a lot of income . On the opposite end , however , they will likely become vacant during the offseason . Whether you decide to rent them out during the offseason is up to you , but demand can fluctuate greatly between different seasons . <p> Consider renting your vacation property on Airbnb . Potential tenants from around the world can view photos of vacation rental you list , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable Airbnb properties , be sure to use Mashvisor . <p> Mashvisor data shows that on many occasions , vacation homes can cash flow better than traditional rentals . However , as mentioned earlier , vacation homes are not rented all year round as traditional rentals . Hence , it is very important to pay attention to a citys Airbnb occupancy rate and to play with pricing correctlyin order to get the optimal occupancy rate . - <p> Keep in mind that renting out traditionally makes you eligible for more tax benefits compared to renting a vacation rental. - In terms of income , it is best to check the rental strategy comparisonto determine if listing the property traditionally or on Airbnb will generate a higher monthly income , cash on cash return , and cap rate. - <h> 3 . Senior Co-Housing <p> The demographics of the number of seniors is increasing . By 2030 , 20% of the U.S. 's population will be senior citizens . So , it would be a smart idea for investors to rent out different kinds of senior living homes . Some types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and senior co-housing . In this blog , we will focus on senior co-housing . <p> Renting your properties in senior co-housing means forming a community of senior rentals in which tenants share properties . It is a very good source of cash flow , which you can calculate on Mashvisor. - <p> Just like other types of senior housing , you need to adhere to specific laws for renting through senior co-housing . <p> You will also need to provide specific amenities when renting to seniors . For instance , having elevators on every floor and stair-lifts for every stairway will make your property much more attractive . Other aspects of the property , such as its proximity to public transportation and medical centers , presence of laundry facilities , and usage of electronic keys will also make the property more appealing . Always be sure to review the specific laws and requirements when it comes to renting to senior citizens , to make sure you are abiding by the law and to ensure the satisfaction of our elders . <h> 4 . Low-Income Tenants <p> Another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income tenants on government assistance , also known as Section 8 tenants . To some , renting your property to Section 8 tenants is a bad idea , due to the assumption- that tenants will damage the property . This does mean that the risks of renting to Section 8 tenants compared to- higher earning tenants are the same . There tends to be less risk with higher earning tenants since they will more likely be able to pay for any damage they have caused , however , there are some definite benefits of renting to Section 8 tenants. - <p> Guaranteed rent is one of the main benefits of Section 8 investing , since the government will be paying you a big chunk of the rent . Since the government is covering most of the rent , it is less likely tenants will leave the property , leading to lower vacancy rates . Renting to Section 8 tenants can be an option if you have a property in lower-income neighborhoods . <p> There are different ways of renting out your property . Some ways will require high expenses but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ways will generate good cash flow , almost guaranteed ( senior co-housing and Section 8 tenants ) , and some ways will generate high demand during a particular season ( vacation homes ) . Whatever method of renting your property you choose to follow , mentioned in this blog or not , be sure to review the legality of the rental . Also , depending on your circumstance and goals , consider if the particular way of renting is right for you . To search for rental properties , analyze the cash on cash return you will receive by renting out your property , and to get an idea of your property 's performance , be sure to visit Mashvisor. 
@@44409517 @4409517/ <h> Memphis Investment Properties " Why You Should Buy Now <p> If you are checking out our website , we assume that you are a real estate investor or looking forward to becoming one . And what a successful real estate investor needs first is a LOCATION . One of the most important decisions that you will make in real estate investing is choosing the right city " and then the right neighborhood " for your income property . In this article we will show you why you should seriously consider Memphis investment properties if you are looking for a good deal likely to bring you sound profits . <h> Memphis Real Estate Overview <p> When thinking about investing in real estate , Memphis , TN might not be the first market that comes to mind . However , this should change . Memphis is one of the hot real estate markets for 2016 , and this will continue in 2017 and beyond . Wondering why ? <p> Here are the reasons why Memphis investment properties are a great idea at the moment : <p> Affordability <p> Both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key factor . Memphis investment properties are really affordable right now . Median home prices in Memphis are less than half of the national average . Condos , single-family homes , townhomes Various types of Memphis investment properties are all available at very reasonable prices , below the national averages . <p> Well , part of the explanation for the relatively low property prices in Memphis is that household income is also below the nationwide average values . This fact will work well to your benefit if you are not from Memphis ( and thus enjoy a higher income ) and are considering out-of-state real estate investing . <p> If you are thinking about Memphis investment properties , your target tenants should be the Millennials . The Memphis population is generally young , which means that they still can not afford buying a home on their own , at least not in the next few years . You should take advantage of this reality and invest in a rental property which can accommodate a small family . <p> Southward Migration <p> It is not only local Millennials that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from northern locations with less amiable climates . As Millennials across the nation are starting to get married and have children , many of them are willing to move away from the busy 24-hour cities into places which offer a home with a yard with place for a car and a dog . Memphis is an ideal location because of the availability of such homes and because of the nice weather . <p> Young Population <p> The next reason you should really think seriously about Memphis investment properties is demographic again . As we 've just mentioned , Memphis enjoys a relatively young population ( 15% of the people are under 9 years of age ) . So , investing in the Memphis real estate market is not only an excellent option in the short run ( to accommodate the Millennials without a home yet ) but also in the long term ( to provide housing for these youngsters when they grow up in 10-15 years and want to move out of their parents ' homes ) . <p> Moving Towards a Seller 's Market <p> It is not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a seller 's one at the moment . What is clear though is that it will soon be an evidently seller 's market as inventories have started to decline . If demand continues increasing , inventories will drop even further , while prices will go up . So , it is now the time to buy Memphis investment properties . <h> Top Memphis Neighborhoods <p> Once you 've settled on buying one of Memphis investment properties , you have to make another important decision : which neighborhood is the best . Mashvisor data points out to a few top neighborhoods in Memphis for investing in real estate . The common thing among them ? That they are all much better suited for Airbnb rather than traditional renting . <p> So , let 's look at the top 3 Memphis neighborhoods for real estate investments : <p> 1 .

The Airbnb occupancy rate is quite high at 64.9% . Midtown is a lively area with many cultural , entertainment , food , and drink options for any taste .

@@44409520 @4409520/ <p> Are turnkey real estate investment properties worth it or not from an investor 's perspective ? - Here you come to another major reason for debate in real estate investing . As usual , many experts and professionals will jump right away to say that turnkey properties are the worst because you can not benefit from real estate appreciation ( after fixing them up ) and have to rely on rental income as your only source of profit from your real estate investing business . These same people will argue that you should only buy real estate investment properties under market value , unlike turnkey ones . While it is true that not ready rental properties come at a lower price , this is the case only because they are actually worth less . If you buy an income property that needs lots and lots of fixes , you will spend so much time and money on bringing it to a rentable state that it will end up costing the same or even more than a turnkey property . From this point of view , turnkey real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy an overpriced property ) and totally make sense . Let 's see why in specific . <p> First , before looking at the reasons why turnkey properties are an excellent choice for any real estate investor , let 's make sure that it is clear what this type of properties are : <h> Why do turnkey real estate investment properties make sense ? <p> 1 . Turnkey real estate investment properties save time and energy <p> Whereas a turnkey income property will generally cost you more than one that needs some serious work before being rented out , the extra money is worth it because you will not have to waste any of your precious time ( work time at your 9-to-5 job , after work , weekends , or vacations ) to bring the property to a rentable state . Real estate investing is actually a very demanding enterprise ( being both a part-time job and an investment ) , so a real estate investor should try to save up as much time and energy for the important investment decisions as possible . <p> 2 . Turnkey real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property that requires fixing the roof ( due to leakages ) , changing the tiles , painting the walls , maintaining the kitchen and the bathrooms Unless you possess a wide range of skills related to these fields , you will have to hire contractors and/or a range of handymen and supervise their work . Now that 's some very stressful work , especially for someone who is not a full-time real estate investor . On the other hand , if you go for a turnkey rental property , you can start looking for tenants " instead of handymen " right away , in a stress-free manner . <p> 3 . Turnkey real estate investment properties bring down risk <p> Fixing up an income property is related not only to a lot of money , time , energy , work , and stress but also to unnecessary risk . By choosing to invest in a turnkey property , you avert a great amount of risk which stems from such a heavy work load . <p> 4 . Turnkey real estate investment properties make sense financially <p> It is absolutely true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all else equal ( location , type of property , size , etc . ) . However , it is not true that you will be able to do all the necessary fixes to a non-ready property with the same quality at the same price as a professional company . Above we said that turnkey real estate investment properties are usually sold by companies specializing in restoration and management . This means that they have access to needed services at preferential rates which you can not access . Thus , it will be significantly cheaper for such a company to prepare a turnkey property than for you . <p> 5 . Turnkey real estate investment properties can be rented out right away <p> This means that you can start making money from your new income property immediately , instead of having to fix it first . <p> Sometimes there are these great opportunities to invest out of state , which investors feel compelled to reject because of the traveling they will have to do while preparing them for renting out . Well , turnkey properties eliminate this inconvenience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the property , buy it , meet potential tenants , and then keep an eye on it . However , you will not need to go there in order to do the fixes yourself or supervise the process . <h> What should you consider when deciding in favor of or against turnkey real estate investment properties ? <p> Investment strategy : One of the most important factors to take into consideration when deciding whether turnkey is the right property for you is your investment strategy . If , let 's say , you are interested in fix-and-flip , then turnkey is definitely not the right choice . However , if you are going for long-term real estate investment for traditional or Airbnb , then buying a turnkey income property makes lots of sense as you can rent it out right away . <p> Budget : Another thing you have to think about before going for a turnkey rental property is the budget you have available . If you are quite limited financially , you might decide to invest in a not ready property and do only the minimum fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that this might not be optimal because then you will be able to rent out the property for only a fraction of the rental income that you would be able to receive from- a better maintained income property . <p> Every income property is different , and generalizations should be avoided . However , it is safe to say that turnkey real estate investment properties make a lot of sense because of the multiple benefits which they bring .

@@44409522 @4409522/ <h> Why You Should Buy an Investment Property While Renting <p> The average American fiscal timetable puts in place a common path we are all familiar with : get a degree , land a job , rent an apartment , get married , and save enough money to purchase a house . The main hitter here , for our purposes , is that buying a house is a must . But is it really ? What if you instead used that money to buy an investment property while renting out a residence ? - <p> Perhaps the main reason there is much emphasis on buying a home is the belief that it is a good investment . This does make sense . For instance , there is more stability in living in a house you own rather than in a rental property . There is also more freedom in some aspects of owning a house . You would n't need permission from your landlord or property manager to renovate , fix issues with the property , and decorate . There far less restrictions when it comes to home ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while renting ? Although it may appear unconventional , here are some reasons why you should do so . <p> Source of Income : Using a property for the sake of investment instead of a residence will obviously generate income . You 'll be able to earn money as soon as you find tenants . <p> This is especially great since the property can pay itself off ( when managed properly ) . Generating positive cash flow by renting the property can help cover mortgage payments and other expenses . It can even build up profit . <p> You can even decide to rent out a unit or even just a room on Airbnb instead of the entire property and still earn income . <p> Even if you buy an investment property while renting is not your goal and you intend on living in the property later on , renting it out early can be a reliable source of income . <p> FHA Loans : Typically , there is a 20% down payment when purchasing a property . But what if you ca n't afford that much ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be as low as 3% . If your credit is less-than-perfect , then a FHA loan can help pay for mortgage insurance . This is also great because the lower down payments and lower interest rates will help with future cash flow . There is a catch , though . FHA loansallow you to purchase up to a 4-unit property only if you occupy one of those units for the first year. - <p> Cost of house expenses can be very , very high : - According to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , the cost of expenses over 30 years on a $290,000 house equals $783,000 . Even if you want to fluctuate the amounts assigned to expenses ( such as property taxes , insurance , and mortgage interest ) in the report , and deduct about $100,000 to $200,000 , the total cost of expenses is still high , nearing double the amount used to purchase the property . In this regard , opting to instead rent will save you more money , and leasing other properties will add profit . Buying investment properties while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Appreciation on a house may not be in your favor : Sometimes appreciation is not as smooth as we might perceive it to be . The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight provides another example . A $50,000 property in 1977 became worth over $290,000 in 30 years . From this alone , it seems clear that the property has appreciated greatly through time , but when you compare this new value with the expenses costs , a different picture arises . The expenses during the same time period were $340,000 . Now if we were to compare the appreciation with the expenses we can see that there is a negative result ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 . The high appreciation does not seem as lucrative anymore . You can avoid this debacle if you buy an investment property while renting instead of owning a home in which you live in . <p> Easier to purchase as an investment property : Purchasing a property as an investment can be easier than buying it as a house , as family members and friends are more likely to contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect some gain out of it . <p> Distance : Usually , properties located in the heart of a city are more expensive than those located elsewhere . If your desired property is located far from the city yet you regularly need to be in the city ( for work or other reasons ) , then choosing to buy an investment property while renting in the city would be a good idea . That way , you are not too far from where you normally spend most of your time in and you can earn income from the property . <p> Flexibility to move : Selling a house can sometimes be a hassle if you plan on moving , whether for an emergency or not . The market value could be different depending on the time you decide sell , which could result in a potential loss in terms of an investment . The process of selling could be tedious as well . On the other hand , if buy an investment property while you rent out instead of living in a purchased home , you can easily move without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you are n't spending much on living expenses , why not give it a shot ? If you are young and are living alone or with a roommate and do not spend too much on living expenses , then the choice to buy an investment property while renting can help you save and earn more money than owning and maintaining a house . <p> With all of this being said , is buying investment properties while renting superior to owning a home , or vice versa ? There is no surefire answer ; it all depends . It depends on your current situation , your goals in real estate investment , and your property . There are some pros and cons to both buy investment properties while renting and to simply buying a property as a home . Consult advisors and carefully plan your decisions .

@@44409525 @4409525/ <h> 5 Ways to Find a Buyer 's Market <p> Simply put , a buyer 's market refers to markets where the supply is greater than the demand . That is , when there are more houses listed to be sold than there are buyers ready to purchase . If you 're buying a rental property , a buyer 's market is what you 're after . For one , you have many more options to choose from but more importantly , you 're better able to find cheaper deals that give you higher returns . After all , a buyer 's market ( as the name suggests ) , favors the buyer . Here 's how to find that buyer 's market . <h> 1 . Look for areas with a lot of houses to choose from <p> This is usually a great indicator that you 're in buyer 's market . When there are many properties to choose from , not only do you get more variety , but you 'll also have greater negotiating power . In this type of market , there just are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough money to do so . That is good news for you , because the seller will then work on your terms . <h> 2 . Keep an eye on price cuts <p> If home prices are decreasing , that 's an indication- that no one is buying . The demand is low and there is no bidding competition , unlike a seller 's market where prices might actually go up . Think of it like shopping during a- sale season - enjoy the price cuts and use it to find your ideal real estate property . Sometimes , you 'll find a gem in a seller 's marketand notice a property 's prices are consistently going down . Inquire about that property and why no one is buying it , but make sure to get an inspection . <h> 3 .

Peaked Interest <p> Maybe this wo n't be the best news about a buyer 's market at a first glance ; when prices are declining and more options are available , interest rates tend to go a bit higher . This is usually an indicator that you 're in a buyer 's market . Might sound scary , but you can make up for the higher interest rates from rental property tax deductions. <h> 5 . Are the real estate ads getting bigger ? <p> Check areas with many real estate ads ! Usually in a buyer 's market , more real estate ads go up to encourage people from purchasing homes . So , having a bunch in an area is a good indicator that you 'll have the negotiating power . <h> Why should you find a buyer 's market ? <p> Some people have a hard time wondering why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low demand for property . If you 're purchasing a real estate property for traditional or Airbnb uses , then your target audiences will be much different than those who are trying to purchase homes .

Make sure it has an established and developing economic growth , median income citizens , and steady industries . These are usually indicators that you will find renters . If you 're hoping to sell the investment property and reap in the benefits of home appreciation , hold on tight and wait for a seller 's market .

Well , a place " or a location " has various dimensions in real estate investing including urban vs. rural , which city/town/village , which neighborhood , which street , which side of the street , etc . Different locations offer very different opportunities and have very different requirements . In an effort to help you in your choice of a rental property , let 's look at whether cities or small towns/the countryside make for the best places for investment properties . <p> In order to determine what the best places for investment properties are , we first need to look at the advantages and disadvantages of having an income property in the city and in the countryside . <h> Investing in Real Estate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best places for investment properties , there is no general consensus among real estate investors .

A strong economy automatically translates into many newly created jobs , which in turn means that people will be moving into the city , and many of them will be looking to rent a rental property . <p> More demand for rental properties <p> The point above simply means that cities offer high demand for traditional investment properties as there are many full-time tenants . At the same time , cities also enjoy high demand for Airbnb since they usually have numerous business and tourist opportunities to offer . Having a large pool of tenants " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to consider cities as the best places for investment properties . <p> Higher rental income <p> Because of the vibrant economy and labor market as well as due to the kind of income properties , you as a landlord can charge much higher rent and thus make much higher rental income in the city than in the countryside .

The advantages of investing in the countryside are essentially the disadvantages of investing in the city and vice versa , but let 's take a look at the most features in real estate investing in small towns : <h> The Advantages <p> Low property prices <p> Arguably the major factor which could make small towns and rural locations the best places for investment properties is the low average price of real estate properties .

That means your costs will be lower and your return on investment " higher . <p> Similar to urban locations , in the countryside you could go for either traditional or Airbnb rental strategy , as long as your location has something to offer to potential tenants . <p> Easy , cheap advertising <p> How you advertise and market your property is of crucial importance in real estate investing , and there is no better ad than word of mouth . If you make a good impression in your small-town location , people will just keep talking about you and recommending you . That 's how small places work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations offer blooming economies , which means that not many people look to move there and live in a rental property . Moreover , rental incomes will be lower because of the less promising average income levels . <p> Less help <p> If you live in the city and decide to go for an investment property in the countryside , especially if it is out-of-state real estate investing , you will need professional support including potentially a professional property manager and definitely some handymen . Well , such professionals are fewer in smaller towns than in large cities , which might make them not the best places for investment properties . <p> Hard to sell <p> When you decide it 's time to part with your income property , you might face serious difficulties in selling it to someone else in the countryside .

After renovating it , the investor asks for a much higher price that covers their investment , renovation costs , and a profit margin . It might sound simple but in reality , it requires experience to perfect it on all fronts . The trick is finding out the best way to finance a rental property- that needs fixing . <p> The most common ways to finance a fix-and-flip are traditional bank financing , home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or borrowing from family or friends . Each one of these options will appeal to a certain investor in a different way due to the personal and financial situation of each investor that can vary from others . <h> Traditional Bank Financing <p> Borrowing money from the bank to finance a fix-and-flip is one of the first steps- to getting stared . It is similar to- any other mortgage loan agreement with a bank . The investor decides the duration of the loan and puts a down payment . If the bank agrees to those terms , then they give the investors the money needed to get a fix-and-flip property . An investor with a good credit score will find this to be the easiest and possibly the best way to finance a rental property . <h> Home Equity Loan <p> This is probably the riskiest form of loan an investor can commit to when financing a fix-and-flip . The concept of home equity loan is getting a second mortgage on your existing property while repaying the loan over a fixed time period . The major risk is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate the profit , you need to repay the loan . Your existing property is then used as collateral for failure to pay back the loan . <h> Hard Money Loan <p> Hard money lenders offer opportunities for fix-and-flip investors and developers by offering different terms than those of the bank . Hard moneylenders are usually more lenient than banks in terms of credit score evaluations . The downside of having a hard money loan is that usually these type of loans need to be repaid within a year approximately . They are also a more expensive option , because the interest rate is normally in double figures . This might not be the best way to finance a rental property , but it is an option if you are in need of a small loan and do n't have a good credit score to borrow from a bank . <h> Borrowing From Friends or Family <p> The final option is- borrowing funds from friends or family . While this loan is from someone that the investor trusts , a formal , written agreement should still be used . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not always charge interest or require extra payments . The problem that many people face with these types of loans is commitment and failure to pay back the loans . Each individual wants to protect their own interests , which makes legal problems between friends and family a possibility in these types of loans . <p> The best way to finance a rental property can be subjective- because each investor will have his or her own idea about what suits them best . If an investor is looking to make a quick profit from an investment property , fix-and-flips can do that but it requires a an investor to understand their financial limitations , risks and chances of success .

@@44409540 @4409540/ <h> Is It OK to Invest in Real Estate Just for Appreciation ? <p> Another important question in real estate investing with no clear YES/NO answer . Once again , it all depends . In this case , it depends on the goals that you put for yourself which encourage you to invest in real estate . <p> Generally any investor decides to invest in real estate for one single reason : TO MAKE PROFITS . There are two basic ways in which your income property can make money for you : 1 ) through regular ( monthly ) cash flow or 2 ) through long-term appreciation . Let 's look at these two sources of profits : <h> 1 . Cash Flow <p> When you decide to invest in real estate , you will most probably rent out your property " or at least that 's what you should be doing . This means that your property will be generating some income for you from the monthly rent ( monthly rental income ) . Meanwhile , your property will also be requiring some money , i.e. , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unless you were lucky enough to be able to afford paying all in cash ) , property tax , insurance , property management , maintenance , utilities , and others . Note that some of these costs you will only need to pay once a year ( such as the property tax ) , so make sure to divide them by 12 when calculating the monthly expenses . You need to do some basic investment property analysis to see what cash flow you will have at the end of the month : <p> Cash flow = monthly rental income monthly expenses <p> Now , this number can be positive , negative , or zero . If your expected cash flow is positive , you will be making immediate profits from your real estate property . If your expected cash flow is zero , in the short run you will be just breaking even . If , on the other hand , you estimate the cash flow to be negative , it means that your rental property will be generating losses for you . <p> Remember that when you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide you with evidence-based , realistic estimates of all vital indicators such as rent , recurrent expenses , vacancy rates , and others on thousands of actual properties available throughout the US . Moreover , Mashvisor will supply all these numbers for both traditional renting and Airbnb. <h> 2 . Appreciation <p> In addition to having some additional source of income every month , there is another reason for which people invest in real estate " the long-term appreciation . Because of population dynamics , demographic shifts , economic growth , limited land resources , and all sorts of other reasons , real estate property prices are set to keep going up in the future . True , they might drop from one year to another , but in the long run ( 10-20-30 years ) , they are ( almost ) guaranteed to go up . This means that if you buy a property for let 's say $150,000 now , you may be able to sell it for $300,000 in 15 years . <p> There are many factors on which real estate appreciation depends " land , location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interest rates , and others " and you should be careful to select a property within a location which will appreciate a lot . <h> Short Term versus Long Term Goals <p> Making Money in the Short Run <p> If you want to invest in real estate with the main objective of making money in the short term , then IT IS NOT OK to invest just for appreciation . You should make sure to buy a property that will provide you with positive , considerable cash flow . This will allow you to increase your monthly income or to save up money for a down payment on another investment property . <p> If , however , you are investing today because you want to reap your profits in the future , then IT IS OK to invest in real estate just for appreciation . There is a big attraction to invest in real estate for appreciation " namely , that your profit will come in one single , large package which will make it really , really eye-catching . Once you receive this bulk of money , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property or in two small ones . Investing for cash flow , on the other hand , will deliver your profits in small amounts over a long period of time , and you might actually end of spending them without even noticing them . <p> But there is a trick . Investing only for appreciation is risky because there is no way to be absolutely certain that for some odd reason the prices in your real estate market will not drop in a few years . Structural changes occur in the nationwide real estate market all the time , and you can fall victim to them . So , even if you are not looking forward to realizing immediate gains from your income property , it is still better to not rely solely on appreciation . It is always recommended to aim for positive cash flow when deciding whether to invest in real estate or not . Nonetheless , if you still choose to buy an investment property with the aim of selling it for more money in the future , make sure it will not bring about a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big NO because it will mean that you are losing money instead of making money from your rental property . And no investment should ever do that . <h> Conclusion <p> So , to make a long story short , while it could be OK to invest in real estate just for appreciation , it is better to try to have a positive cash flow .

If you were to go and do the exact same thing now and open the subject with the same group of friends ; you will most likely be given suggestions on which Airbnb investment properties are the best ones to stay at . This is how a new industry was born and its future looks bright . <p> The success of this industry is understandable and very much expected . It is not that the hotel industry has failed or could n't provide what we need , but we live in a world where comfort and financial stability are of paramount importance . We like to have options . Vacation rental investment properties are surely going to become the leading market in tourism and vacation bookings taking over from hotels and hostels . There are three main criteria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 1 . Competition and Prices <p> This is most probably the most important factor in shaping the future of rental investment properties as a whole market . The reason that hotels are losing the battle to remain dominant is because they cant provide the- lucrative prices that Airbnb and other platforms offer . This can be explained in simple economic methodology , high demand and high supply . <p> People interested in real estate investing and with enough capital can purchase- investment properties for the sole purpose of renting them as vacation rentals . In return , such properties can be listed on online platforms like Airbnb , and this has created a very competitive scene that almost everyone has benefited from . The price range of Airbnb houses can be best described as when two parties meet half way to reach a positive agreement . Prices are much lower than hotels and luxury resorts that the customers are happy to pay the amounts asked . <p> At the same time the people who own investment properties are satisfied with the income they are making due to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable future in this category is in favor of vacation rentals . Hotels can not compete with property owners ' prices because hotels employ so many workers and are required to pay tons- of bills .

It allows you to find properties and their relevant data like cash-flow- and Airbnb occupancy rate . It is a very useful planning tool to help you budget and manage your future investment properties . <h> 2 . Investors and Hospitality <p> This is a key area in making rental investment properties unique . Owners of properties are going out of their way to come up with innovative and thoughtful ways to increase hospitality ratings in their rental properties . <p> If you go stay at a hotel , odds are that you will pay double the amount you 'd pay at an Airbnb house without getting any hospitable feeling . Hotels gave us a different understanding of hospitality . We used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally pay or going to your hotel and finding a bottle of water is considered hospitable . What vacation rental owners have done is challenge this concept and change our perception of hospitality . <p> I have traveled to many places and have been in many Airbnb homes . The hospitality ranges from the owner cooking you dinner in his upstairs flat to finding a bottle of wine and a box of chocolate when you check in . This is hospitality that appeals to people , that makes them want to do this again . It is particularly why investment properties are so appealing to purchase because people can be creative to become something better and different . <h> 3. - Providing Accommodation . . . Anywhere <p> This area is what will shape the future of platforms like Airbnb . Let 's consider two important facts . First , hotels are not everywhere because of their expensive costs and big size which limits them to be in cities for example . Secondly , the fact that the world is becoming smaller and that borders are disappearing because people travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rental investment properties have more ability to expand to anywhere , because all it would take is for an investor to purchase a property and list it on a vacation rental platform .

I have personally once stayed for three nights on a sailing boat in the middle of Barcelona 's main central port , how many hotels can offer that ? These examples shows how vacation rentals have the edge in the future struggle for this market domination . <p> The future of rental investment properties is projected to be heading upwards for the foreseeable future . Revolutionary platforms like Airbnb have released the shackles from so many people and liberated them to take control of a major industry that has so much growth and potential . The key for investors to grow with it is to be creative and never stop expanding your horizons .

Capitalization rate is one of the most commonly used metrics to measure the profitability of a real estate investment . It describes the rate of return of a rental property regardless of the method of financing . In theory , cap rates are a measurement of the level of risk associated with an investment property . A lower cap rate corresponds to a lower level of risk , whereas a higher cap rate means a higher level of risk . This is logical as investing in low risk is associated with low profitability , while high risk is related to the possibility for big gains . <h> So , how do we calculate the cap rate ? <p> The formula is simple : you divide- the net operating income ( NOI ) by the property price ( or value ) . <p> NOI : To calculate the NOI , you need to start with the annual rental income from an investment property and subtract from it all costs associated with operating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities , maintenance , and others . The basic cap rate formula , as we show above , assumes that acquisitions are all paid for in cash and do not involve finance costs . If you , however , are financing a purchase ( through a bank loan , let 's say ) , you will need to include the annual cost of financing your property as an operating expense . <p> Price : The price is the price that you pay for the rental property in addition to all other acquisition costs such as brokerage fee , closing costs , rehab costs , etc . <p> Example : <p> Let 's say it costs you a total of $170,000 to buy a rental property . You can rent it out for $1,500 per month . All annual costs related to your property add up to $3,000 . To calculate the cap rate : <p> Now that we 've gone over the calculations , let 's go back to our initial question : what 's a good cap rate for an investment property . There is no unanimous answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the- value of a cap rate should be around 10% . For most rental properties around the U.S. , the value- is between 8% and 12% . <h> What is an acceptable cap rate for my property ? <p> First , the cap rate varies based on the asset type . For instance , multifamily properties consistently have the lowest cap rate because they are considered to provide among the lowest risk . The reason is simple . Apartment buildings generate their rental income from numerous tenants every month . So even if one or two of your tenants do n't pay their rent for a certain month , the change in your cash flow for that month relatively small . Conversely , imagine a large , luxurious house that you out to a single family . If the tenants do n't pay their rent for this month , you 're left with no income . The risk is high . <p> Second , the cap rate is different in different markets . As you 've heard many times , in real estate investing location is everything . States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is partially because rents , operating costs , and acquisition costs change from one place to another . They also change over time . Different markets also exhibit different supply and demand , which will also cause significant differences . So while you can use cap rate to- compare the risk and the profitability of comparable properties in the same market , you should n't decide between buying- a small apartment in Boston or a two-story house in Miami solely based on it . As a general rule , set the average cap rate in the area that you are considering as your minimum goal when purchasing an investment property . <h> To sum up <p> In conclusion , the capitalization rate is a helpful metric to use when shopping for a market and for a property . However , you should not base your final decision regarding your property purchase entirely on- cap rate . A major disadvantage of the cap rate is that it does n't take into consideration the **25;0;TOOLONG of a rental property , which plays a major role in determining the return on your real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of financing your property . Importantly , the cap rates may be misleading in growing markets . For example , even if the cap rate is not great at the moment , it might be worth it if you invested in a property in a market that is set to grow . This gives you the opportunity to enjoy higher rents and a significant appreciation of your property in a few years .

Most other investments such as stocks are evaluated by the return on investment ( ROI ) , not the cash on cash return . In order to calculate the ROI , you need to know all the money that you made from an investment in addition to the cash that you invested . However , you can not possibly know how much a rental property will bring you in total before you sell it . Thus , it does not make much sense to talk about ROI when deciding whether to purchase a certain investment property or not . <p> Instead , the most popular and easy metric to use in real estate investing is the cash on cash return .

It does n't make sense to calculate the cash on cash return on your property if you ignore this cost because you can not rent it out if it 's not in good condition . So , these add up to $12,500 in additional costs . Thus : <p> Total cash investment = $250,000 + $12,500 = $262,500 . <p> You can charge $2,100 of rent per month for your rental property .

Though- you do n't need to be an expert- in real estate investments or even in real estate , you have to do your homework properly . Start answering some simple questions to determine the best investment property for you : <p> What kind of investment property do you want to buy ?

Identify the best places to buy rental property. - Choose carefully the area- in which you would like to buy an income property . Is it attractive for tenants ? Is there demand ? How is the infrastructure around ? Is it getting overcrowded ? What are average prices ? Are prices on the rise ?

Paying for a rental property is equally as important as finding the right property . Thus , start arranging the- financing- as soon as you start looking for a potential income property . Talk with your bank about how much you can afford to buy for . This will depend on your startup capital , if any , and the expected rent for the investment property that you will end of buying . <h> 3. - Do the math . <p> Once you have an idea about the kind of income property you want to invest in and the mortgage you can afford , do some calculations .

The most obvious one is the- mortgage . Online investment property mortgage calculators can be helpful here . Then , you come to taxes . Remember that- property taxes- might grow exponentially . Many states offer homeowners exemptions on their primary residence , so property taxes on rental properties are significantly higher . Then , you need to include other less apparent costs such as maintenance . Just like your home , your income property will require- maintenance . As soon as you become a landlord , you will start receiving phone calls from your tenants about problems with your property all the time . And you will need to fix them " for a price .

This is a lot faster than creating spreadsheets. <h> 4. - Make a plan . <p> After you have done some research and thinking , - set specific goals- and make a plan . It is best to write down your goals and periodically check that you are sticking to them . If you decide to buy a simple family home for $500,000 , do n't get tempted by a $600,000 house with a beautiful garden . Remember that investing in rental property is a business and should be treated as such . Be sure to make the decisions that will provide you with the most profitable income property at a price that you can afford . <h> 5. - Network . <p> Probably the best way for a beginner real estate investor to learn is to- connect with local investors .

There are many website which you can use to find listings . Mashvisor offers many in various US cities and neighborhoods . However , these sites do n't usually contain all the information you will need before making your decision . Thus , consider contacting- a local real estate agent . Agents are usually paid by the seller , so you do n't have to worry about the cost . It 's important to find a real estate agent who works with investors as this person will be better aware of what makes a good real estate investment rather than a good home . Although a real estate agent can be of indispensable help , he/she can also bring unnecessary pressure to buy a property before you have found the best income property for you . <h> 7. - Make an offer . <p> When you have found the investment property you want to go for and have clarified all necessary details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate agent " if you are using one " will fill out the paperwork and submit your offer to the seller. - Make sure to only spend an amount that works for you .

This topic is highly debatable since so many factors must be taken into consideration . Who does n't dream about paying off their mortgage and freeing up all that monthly cash ? Yet , it comes down to two options 1 ) pay your mortgage off early or 2 ) invest the money instead . The answer depends on each person individually . Let us first take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of paying off your investment property mortgage early . <h> Advantages of paying off mortgage early <p> Paying off your investment property mortgage early will save you lots of money . Once you pay off your mortgage you will have extra space in your monthly budget . If you are an owner-occupant , you will keep a big piece of your paycheck . And if you are a real estate investor , you will increase your- rental income . Either way it 's a win-win scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more interest payments <p> The longer you carry a mortgage , the higher your total interest amount will be . The higher the interest rate on mortgage , the better it is to pay it off early. - Better a dollar in your pocket than the banks . <h> 4 . Reduces your debt-to-income ratio <p> Debt-to-income ratio is one way lenders and mortgage lenders see an individual 's ability to manage monthly payments and pay debts . When you pay off your investment property mortgage early , this reduces your debt-to-income ratio and gives you more opportunities to purchase investment properties . <h> Disadvantages of paying off mortgage early <h> 1 . Lose out on mortgage interest deduction <p> When you do n't pay off your mortgage you lose out on mortgage interest deduction , which means more of your rental income is taxable at your regular tax rate . You lose this tax benefit that many investors rely on . <h> 2 . Your time until retirement <p> If you pay off your investment property mortgage early , you take away your means to invest for retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factor to consider before paying off your mortgage early . Having multiple investments can secure your retirement . <h> 3 . You can not borrow it back <p> A lot of the times , paying off the mortgage means its difficult- or expensive to borrow it again . There are people who call back their lenders a year later saying that they need cash and find themselves no longer qualified to borrow . <h> 4 . You wo n't be able to invest elsewhere <p> Paying off your mortgage wo n't allow you to invest in other properties . For many people , it would make more sense for them to invest the funds elsewhere so they can establish financial savings in other portfolios . <h> What should YOU do ? <p> When you begin to consider paying off your investment property mortgage sooner rather than later , you must first examine you financial situation and both short-and-long term goals . What is your current rate and term as your loan ? Do you carry several other debts like car payment or other loans that you wish were off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you paying down high-interest rate debts like credit cards or paying toward owning your home free and clear ? So many questions come to mind and so many factors must be kept in mind to decide on whether or not paying off mortgage early is good or not . <p> If you are a person that chooses to pay off your investment property mortgage early here is how to do it : <h> Make bi-weekly payments <p> This is a great way to start when you plan on paying off you mortgage . Bi-weekly payments are n't magic but they take advantage of the fact that there are 13 weeks in each year , not 12 , and there are 52 weeks in a year , not 48 . So by paying one half of your mortgage payment every other week , you end up making one extra full payment each year ! So for example , if you have a- fixed rate mortgage just under $160,000 to be repaid over 30 years at 6.5% interest . Your payment is $1,000 per month or $12,000 per year . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan you will pay a total of about $202,000 in interest . But if you make biweekly payments , you pay half the monthly payment , or $500 , every other week . That means you pay a total of $13,000 per year instead of $12,000 . Keeping a biweekly schedule reduces your interest expense from about $202,000 to $184,000 , saving $18,000 . Not to mention that you would pay off the loan in just over 27 years instead of 30 . <h> Add an extra amount each month <p> If you are determined to pay off your investment property mortgage early , every little bit helps . Instead of saving to make an additional large payment once a year , pay an extra amount each month . So for instance let us say you have a $100,000 , 30-year , fixed-rate mortgage at 4.5% . If you add an extra $100 to your payment each month , you will pay it off almost 9 years earlier and save over $26,000 in interest . Every little counts ! <h> Round up your payments <p> If you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mortgage early , you could simply round up your monthly payments . For example if your payment is $870 why not just pay $1000 ? Of course you have to make sure that the extra goes towards paying down you principal balance . <h> Get rid of private mortgage insurance <p> This is charged by lenders when you take out a conventional home loan with less than a 20% down payment . But you can request a cancellation after you pay down your mortgage balance to 80% of the original value of the property . This will definitely make paying off your investment property mortgage easier . <p> The idea of paying of your mortgage early or not is a personal choice that depends on each individual 's financial situation . For every situation , there are pros and cons and the best way to decide is by taking the long-term consequences and goals into consideration .

The typical real estate investor is in it for the profit mostly through rental income . The most common way of rentals for real estate is the traditional one , which is basically finding a tenant that will rent the property on a long-term basis . But the most trending in today 's market are the short-term rentals like Airbnb properties . <p> The decision of whether to go for a traditional or Airbnb investment property is not really complicated if the investor truly understands the differences . Each type of investment has its own market , positives and negatives , and claiming otherwise would be a mistake . That is why research and market data is needed to make the final decision . Each business related decision has to be made based on the facts involved , analyzing the numbers involved and checking customer exposure with that type of market . <h> Traditional vs . Airbnb Properties <p> People who opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of short-term rentals . However , the decision of making your property a traditional one depends on many factors like tenant turnover , location , property management capabilities , profits and regulations . <h> Tenant Turnover <p> Airbnb Properties : When it comes to short-term rental properties , it is important to understand that the property has to be appealing , mainly , to tourists . Airbnb owners thrive when they own property in an area that sees a lot of tourism because they can increase their prices in the high seasons to make more profit from tenants . <p> Traditional Properties : If your investment property is an area that is witnessing high vacancy rates because of the lack of travelers or tourists , it is probably better to list your property- on a long-term basis to avoid high vacancies . <h> Location <p> Airbnb Properties : It is easier to find guests who are willing to pay the prices you ask for if the location of your property complies with the requirements of short-term renters . Having a central location for your investment guarantees you a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outskirts of the same city . <p> Traditional Properties : Not having a central location that appeals to renters means you should go for a traditional property . It 's simple logic : long-term renters are either people who are studying , working or just living there for a long period of time . They do n't mind being in central locations because it means less rent to be paid and a more quiet neighborhood . <h> Property Management <p> Airbnb Properties : The concept behind Airbnb 's success is its ability to offer a range of services as a host to the guests . Whether it is city guides , amenities or towels , these things require constant attention and time from the investment property owner . Having time to do this is important for success and if not , then it is advisable to hire a property management company . <p> Traditional Properties : In the case of long-term rentals , the only thing an owner needs to worry about is having the property meet the minimum standards , such as providing furniture and amenities that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-consuming but it is n't even close to the time needed to manage an Airbnb property . <h> Profits <p> Airbnb Properties : Short-term rentals have shown that even if they are rented out for a shorter time period compared to traditional properties , they are capable of generating more income . It is easy to make so much profit in three months if you own a property in downtown Los Angeles . People are willing to pay the prices you ask for which is less than hotels- but provides more space and amenities . <p> Traditional Properties : Take Boston as an example of a city where investors thrive financially on long-term investment properties . Boston houses a big student population in which most of them are staying for the long-term . It is possible to make more money off Airbnb there if you compare monthly prices but the risk of high vacancy rates is a possibility . <h> Regulations <p> An investor who lives in an area that has limited short-term rental regulations and laws will have no problem staying as an Airbnb host for the long haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a lot of taxes for example , or - eradicate the possibility of making any money at all , then this strategy has to be reconsidered . <p> In conclusion , understanding these aspects of both investment property types helps in making a final decision .

Many people believe that Airbnb is the way forward because it has no limits to its expansion horizons and I am personally one of them .

@@44409575 @4409575/ <h> Why Real Estate Investing Is the Safest Investment Option <p> The debate about which is the best type of investment is as old as one can remember . However , even for the firm stocks aficionados , it is hard to refute the fact that real estate investing is the safest investment option around , which consequently makes it also the best one . Here are 7 reasons why real estate is the best investment , being the safest one . <h> 1 . Investing in land <p> Investing in real estate automatically means investing in land as well . Actually land can be quite a big chunk of your real estate investment , sometimes reaching well beyond 50% of the total amount . The best quality of land from a real estate investor 's point of view is that it is a limited resource . There is no way to make more land that what is already available ( except for the very expensive method of land reclamation from ocean , sea , or river beds ) . This means that the price of land is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general economic conditions . As a result , the total value of your real estate investment will also continue increasing in the long term . In addition , you can always use the land on which your income property is built to build a new , bigger property , which will generate more rental income for you ; for example , you can replace a single-family property with a multi-family home . Last but not least , you can always leave land as inheritance for your children and grandchildren . So , the first reason why real estate is the best investment is because a large portion of it is investing in land , which is extremely safe . <h> 2 . Investing in tangible assets <p> The next reason why real estate is the best investment strategy is the fact that when you invest in real estate , you actually buy a tangible asset " an income property . While no market is insured against a collapse , including the real estate one , you will always have something physical in case you choose to invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case scenario you ca n't find tenants to rent your rental property to or rents are so low it does not make sense to rent out , you can still turn your income property into your primary home or you can sell it to make profit . On the other hand , if you lose money when investing in stocks , you will be left with nothing . That 's why real estate is the best investment option . <h> 3 . Real estate markets are relatively stable <p> In comparison with stock markets , real estate markets are quite stable . Stock markets are highly volatile , which means that you can make lots of money or alternatively lose lots of money within a few days or even hours . While the real estate market is also subject to some volatility , it is significantly less than in the case of stocks . This means that there is less risk associated with investing in real estate , which makes this type of investment safer . And safer investments are better investments . So , that 's reason #3 why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long term appreciation <p> As we said above , real estate markets are generally considered to be stable . Nonetheless , the overall long-term trend is that prices will always go up. - Even if income property prices do n't increase significantly every single year in a particular city or neighborhood , long-run appreciation is a fact in real estate investing . If you buy an investment property today , you will definitely be able to sell it for more in 10- or 15-year time . One of the main drivers of rental property prices , as highlighted in point 1 , is the fact that every single income property is built on some land , and land is a very limited resource . So , real estate appreciation is the 4th reason why real estate is the best investment , as it is the safest investment strategy in the long term . <h> 5 . Regular income <p> However , investing in real estate does not have to bring you profit in the long term only . Indeed , most investors purchase investment properties to make money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how big or small your income property is , it will generate some monthly rental income for you , provided that you are able to rent it out to tenants , of course . Any smart real estate investor will only go for a rental property which provides more rental income than recurrent costs , meaning that it creates positive cash flow . In this sense , investing in real estate is quite different from investing in stocks , which do not guarantee to make money every month or not even every year . The fact that income properties provide regular income is another reason why real estate is the best investment strategy , both in the short and in the long run . <h> 6 . Hedge against inflation <p> Inflation is a fact " i.e. , the general price level goes up over time even if some prices drop down from one month to another . Real estate investing , thus , is an excellent protection against inflation . Even though all prices go up with time , the prices of investment properties go up more rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome inflation , which means that real estate investing provides hedge against inflation . And that 's why real estate is the best investment option , as it is the safest option for investing your money to avoid losing its value to inflation . <h> 7 . Accessible to everyone <p> In order to invest in stocks , you have to an expert in financial markets , which is no easy task . At the same time , anyone can become a real estate investor as it requires nearly no preliminary knowledge . All you have to have in order to start a real estate investment business is some common sense . Real estate investing is very much learning by doing , so you need to buy an income property and become a landlord in order to gain knowledge and experience . While investing in stocks can be very risky if you are not an expert , investing in real estate is generally safe even for beginners .

If you are a new investor , it is almost impossible to do that , you ca n't succeed in an area that requires so much experience and contacts . <h> Wholesaling is Unstable <p> Real estate wholesaling is not set in stone and it is not a science . A person who is setting out to start a career as a real estate wholesaler will find obtaining reliable information is hard to come by , because there are so many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust ? Real estate has always depended on numbers , profits and potential but wholesaling is a personal craft that is hard to understand completely . A few wholesalers would advise to focus on your network , while others advise to focus on finding the cheapest properties , and your networks will create themselves . <p> To give a verdict about real estate wholesaling is perhaps unwise because as a real estate investing strategy , it has seen success and people have made money . But most investors aim for profit when they enter the real estate market and unfortunately , wholesaling does not give any guarantees of that . A wholesaler can buy contracts of two properties and fail to sell either of them , which mean they can lose their determination . <p> Time and consistency are the two most important underlying factors in wholesaling . Not all investors are able to quickly close deals . When deals are n't  closed , time is lost , investors lose motivation , and a huge gap is created between deals , leaving investors with no profits for long periods of time .

The stock market is very come-and-go . One day you 're in , the next day you 're out . Whereas real estate flows much more naturally .

To ease the burden of answering the many questions that your guests may ask , I imagined using Airbnb for the first time and came up with this list of questions . Here 's how you can address them . <h> 1. - What amenities are available for use ? <p> When occupants question amenities , they are generally asking to what degree their comfort level will be . The more amenities provided , the easier and more relaxing their stay . Amenities can be higher-end finishes available at your Airbnb investment property such as a high-end gas stove or a pool . However , things such as WiFi , TVs , and pet accommodations are also worth mentioning . <p> Be sure to also list items such as towels and linens ( and if and how often you plan to replace them ) . Keep in mind that if you indicate you have a fully stocked kitchen , it needs to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a meal from scratch . <h> 2. - What languages does the host speak ? <p> This may seem like a bizarre question at first but considering that Airbnb is used on a global level , your investment property guests may be arriving from anywhere around the world . List all languages you are comfortable with speaking on your Airbnb listing . You may even have other language speaking contacts aside that may help you arrange and host your guest 's stays . This allows your Airbnb investment property to be more marketable to travelers from around the world . <h> 3. - What is the property like ? <p> One of the biggest concerns for guests may be that the property does not match the description or the host is unresponsive to a guest 's additional needs . Be sure to list as much information as possible about your Airbnb investment property . Occupants may further question the listing . This can include if appliances are working , if air conditioning and heating is available , and whether or not handicap features exist . Having a property that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly properties can include fenced in pools and yards , child proofed outlets and cabinets , and even the availability of a crib. <h> 4. - How can I assure that there is a secure transaction between the host and guest ? <p> Both hosts and guests can limit their risk of fraud and scams by using Airbnb features . This includes verifying IDs , profiles , reviews , messaging , the secure payment feature and the host guarantee available through the site . If the guest is acting suspicious in their intended use for the property or insists on making payments outside of the secure payment feature on the Airbnb website , this may be a red flag . <h> 5. - What restrictions are there on uses for the property ? <p> It is common for Airbnb users to book a property for the sole purpose of an event or gathering . Be sure to indicate on the profile if the space and neighborhood permits large gatherings , excessive noise , and additional parking . Specify if the property welcomes pets or limits specific animals . <h> 6. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> In case of an emergency , the host and occupants need to be able to contact one another . This can be done through the Airbnb 's messaging system . As a host , you should also leave a list of emergency contacts at your Airbnb investment property . This should include local police and fire stations , a few local hospitals and pharmacies , and your contact information . This is especially important to guests visiting from abroad as they may be unfamiliar of where to get help in case of an emergency . Also keep in mind that your guests have the option to contact Airbnb if any issues may arise . They have a 24/7 customer experience team that can assist them . <h> 7. - How can I cancel my reservation ? <p> If the guests at your Airbnb investment property must cancel their reservations at the last minute , you have the right to keep some or all of the payment for their scheduled stay . You can indicate your cancellation policy on the Airbnb site and also list your contact information for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8. - How do I get to the property ? <p> When your guests first arrive to the city they are visiting , it is essential for them to know how to get to your Airbnb investment property . Provide clear driving and public transportation directions . Also , leave a list of the best routes and transportation options they have during their stay . This will help them better enjoy their stay and might even score you a good review on the Airbnb site ! <h> 9. - What is the area like ? <p> No host likes to admit that their investment property may be in a non-affluent area or in an area that has a high crime rate ; however it is important to be honest . Remind your occupants to be smart with the valuables they have . Also indicate if it 's safe to walk around at night or alone . Let your guests know what your relationship is with your neighbors . Are they helpful or do they dislike guests ? You can also provide information on the nearest supermarkets , convenient stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better acquainted during their stay . <h> 10. - What insider tips can you give me ? <p> This question will probably be the most fun one to answer . Your Airbnb investment property ownership status has made you the king/queen of insider tips on the neighborhood/city you are in . Feel free to provide your occupants with as much information you have to offer .

@@44409586 @4409586/ <h> Real Estate Investment Agent : Do You Need One and Why ? <p> There is a general misconception when it comes to real estate agents and what their purpose is . One of the- most common question that investors have is , why do I need a real estate investment agent ? What does a real estate agent do for me ? And would n't I save money if I just cut the middleman and sell or buy the house myself ? The answers lie in the purpose and efficiency you require from a real estate investment agent . A real estate agent is a licensed professional that has the task of representing both buyers and sellers in a transaction involving any type of real estate . An agent 's payroll is dependent on the completion of sales and transactions for them to cash in on their commissions. - An agent 's tasks will of course be different depending on what end of the deal they are and which party they represent . <p> Seller 's Agent : When an agent is representing the selling party , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the seller maximum profit for their property .

The main task is finding the cheapest property that fits the profile the buyer is looking for . Based on their experience in sales and the market prices , real estate investment agents are able to identify areas and particular properties that fit the budget . <p> That answers the question of the tasks and duties of a real estate investment agent . However , based on this information , how do you decide if you need one for your property in particular or not ? <h> Why Hire a Real Estate Agent ? <h> Buyer <p> Hiring a real estate investment agent is a way for the buyer to get rid of the daunting task of looking and finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already employed by a real estate agency , will provide you with choices almost instantly in a location you ask for . An real estate agent will be able to give you a tour in the property you are interested in at a time that is convenient for you . This is almost impossible to happen without an agent if you were house hunting on your own because of all the technicalities involved between buyer and seller . <p> The only negative that makes people think twice before hiring a real estate investment agent is the commission that has to be paid when the transaction is done . If you compare that to the most appealing trait- of real estate agents , then the balance should edge more to hiring one .

An agent 's main task is finding you the property you want for the price you want , an agent negotiates directly with the seller on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seller <p> For the seller , it is a different prospect because for a seller to proceed without a real estate investment agent means that they have to deal with showing the house , negotiating , finding the right price and arranging legal issues . For sellers , it is always recommended to hire an agent because of their ability to do the little tasks that can become distracting and hard for a seller . <p> Also consider the fact that most sellers have no clue about pricing , which makes hiring an agent even more important . That happens because most sellers usually buy their properties , hold on to them , then decide to sell or renovate them and decide to sell them . Either way a seller is not fully equipped to give an assessment of that type to get the best price possible for the money they invested . <p> In conclusion , your need for a real estate investment agent is a personal choice that can lead you either way .

It can even be flat-out illegal too in some states or cities . You can be penalized by the law for not ensuring certain aspects to the rented area .

And if you are in any way involved in real estate investing , we are sure it is with the ultimate goal of making money . So , you must be very interested in the question HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL ESTATE . Well , there is no simple answer to this question . There are many different ways of how to make money in real estate depending on your interests , preferences , and financial capabilities . In this article , you will look at 7 different ways of how to make money in real estate . <h> 1 . Become a Landlord <p> Maybe the first thought that comes to mind when you think about how to make money in real estate is by becoming a landlord . This means that you purchase an investment property and rent it out to tenants . Well , easier said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and energy as you will have to look for tenants , deal with them , and manage your property while working your full-time job . But it is absolutely doable if you prepare yourself well and are ready to learn . One of the most important first steps you will have to take before starting your search for a rental property to buy is to decide what kind of property is best for you : an apartment , a single-family home , a condo , a multi-family home , an entire apartment building <p> Rental property strategies can broadly be divided into two streams : traditional and Airbnb . <p> a . Traditional Rental Strategy <p> This simply means that you offer your rental property for long-term leases , usually anything more than a month . Traditional renting has some advantages as more stability and fewer legal issues , but it does not always yield as much profitability as short-term rentals . <p> b . Airbnb Rental Strategy <p> The other option is to offer your investment property for short-term leases , anything from one night up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular , but it 's also attracting more and more opposition from the hotel lobby and local councils .

Remember that real estate partnerships are all about complimenting each other , i.e. , do n't enter into a partnership with people who have the same strengths and weaknesses like you . Real estate partnerships give you the extra benefit of sharing the investment risk . <h> 3 . Fix and Flips <p> Yet another way of how to make money in real estate is through fix-and-flips . This real estate investment strategy means that you buy a rental property ( under market value ) , do some fixes around , and resell the property immediately at a higher price . The trick is to find a property whose price will increase significantly after only minimal maintenance work . This strategy is best for dynamic individuals who are not afraid to get their hands dirty with paint . <h> 4 . Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs ) <p> If you wonder how to make money in real estate but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) , which is a more passive form of investing in real estate . Buying shares in an REIT is very similar to investing in stocks , but your profits will be coming from rents and real estate appreciation .

Real Estate Properties Wholesaling <p> Number 5 in our list of how to make money in real estate is by real estate properties wholesaling . This strategy is similar to fix-and-flip , but you do n't even have to worry about fixing the investment property .

You can do that with very little money as you do n't have to pay anything to the buyer .

Real Estate Crowdfunding <p> In the investment world , crowdfunding has been on the rise in recent years , including in real estate . If you are new to real estate investing or do n't have much money to invest , real estate crowdfunding is an excellent way to learn how to make money in real estate . It 's very similar to a partnership but involves many more partners .

@@44409596 @4409596/ <h> 8 Things That Make a Good Tenant <p> After investing in a rental property , you want to be sure that those renting will cherish your investment . By creating a list of qualities to look for in a tenant , you can avoid costly evictions , non-payments , and potential damage to your property . So we 've created a list for you , these are 8 things you should inquire about when fishing for a good tenant . <h> 1 . Good Credit <p> First and foremost , you want to choose a tenant with good credit . Having a high credit score indicates they must be financially responsible , so you know they will pay their rent on time . During the application process , run a credit check to see if they have a history of paying their bills on time . You can use online services such as Tenant Verification or TenaCheck , to screen tenants and check an applicant 's credit score . <h> 2 . Income <p> In order to pay rent on time , a good tenant must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of their pay stubs . Ideally , a tenant 's monthly income is- roughly three times the monthly rent . However , even if their income is three times the rent , you have to factor in any debt they have . While running a credit check , look for the debt they have accumulated . A high amount of debt indicates the tenant may have other costly bills to worry about each month , potentially making it difficult to make full , on-time rent payments to you . A potential renter that has low debt but does not have an income three times the rent may have a greater guarantee of making full , on-time rental payments in that case . <h> 3 . Criminal Background . . . the lack of . . . <p> Checking the criminal history is vital when looking for a good tenant . In order to check on criminal information , you need the tenant 's name and date of birth . Be sure to check the potential tenant 's I 'd to ensure the information they are providing is accurate . Criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no nationwide database for criminal records , it may be easier to hire a tenant screening company to search the criminal databases in your state and across the country . <h> 4 . Stability <p> Stability is a good indicator as to whether or not a tenant will be reliable in making on-time rental payments and being a long-term leaseholder . By looking at past rental and job history , you can see whether or not the tenant has a stable life and income . Moving several times or being inconsistent with employment in a short period of time may raise a red flag . A good tenant has a steady life . <h> 5 . Good- Rental History <p> Rental history allows you to get a glimpse on whether the individual made a good tenant in the past . Ask for information on where they are relocating from and why they are moving . You can also ask for contact information to speak to at least two of the tenant 's previous landlords . It is important to speak to at least two landlords because the most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their current location . Ask landlords questions such as if their rent was on time , - if they gave at least 30 days- notice prior to relocating , and if they maintained the property . <h> 6 . Respect <p> One of the best ways to tell if an individual makes a good tenant is if they are respectful . Not only does a good tenant pay the rent and other bills on time , but they take care of maintenance issues that are their responsibility . If they respect you as a landlord , they will alert you if - something needs your attention . You can indicate if they are respectful tenants by asking their past landlords if and how they cared for the property . Did they cause damage ? Were there complaints from neighbors ? A tenant that is not respectful will likely try to take advantage of you by making late rental payments , coming up with excuses about damages , or simply neglecting the property . You can tell whether they respect you by how professional they are when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time to tour the property ? Were they helpful during the application process ? Remember , a respectful tenant will shine through in the future as a good tenant . <h> 7 . Honesty <p> A good tenant is an honest tenant that does not lie about making rent , their employment status , and any damages that have occurred during their time as a lessee . During the application process , test the honesty of a potential tenant by verifying the information on their application . Call their past landlords and employers and check their I 'd to verify information . <h> 8 . Cleanliness <p> Having your money invested in a residential property means that maintenance is key . A good tenant will help protect your investment by taking care of the property and keeping it clean . The bigger the mess the tenant makes while renting , - the more you will have to deal with when they move out . One way to check if a tenant is clean is drop by their home unexpectedly or walk them out to their car and take a look. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the property during and after the tenant 's lease . <p> As you are searching for a good tenant , be sure to refer to the laws and regulations regarding tenants and landlords . Although finding a good tenant is important , it needs to be done in a nondiscriminatory manner . Use a potential renter 's application as your line of defense for weeding out undesirable tenants . Staying true to the application process will help you avoid a loss on your investment property .

Divide that by total investment costs . <p> Annual Return/Investment Cost = ROI <p> Tip : Cash Flow and ROI are the most important formulas in making the best decision during an investment analysis. - <p> What is a Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calculating all these numbers if an investor does n't know what to aim for ? Here are some additional numbers to look at when inferring this . <p> This number tells the returns of the property independent of the financing . Why is this number important ? This is an utter way to understand a property 's returns independent of how the property is financed . In other words , this is the return of a property as if it was already paid off . <p> Cap Rate = NOI/Property Price <p> Cap rates are usually 8-12% but the best way to determine if a property has a good cap rate is dependent on the location . Set the average cap rate in an area as the minimum goal . <p> B. Cash-on-Cash Return ( CoC ) - <p> This number tells the returns of a property based on the amount of cash put in the investment. - <p> CoC = NOI/Investment Costs <p> Generally , 10% is considered a good cash on cash return but again , that depends on property type , location , and rental strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get overwhelming but these are the major ones to look at. - There are- other values- that are good to know when comparing an- investment properties . They can be helpful in indicating what are the average ranges based on areas since property performance is so dependent on location . <p> The thing to remember when doing a real estate investment analysis , - costs are current but they can change every year . For example , rental rates and expenses will most likely increase every year so do n't expect these calculations to stay constant throughout the investment . Appreciation is another factor when calculating returns . Although it is not guaranteed , an investor can include this in the Total Return to calculate Total ROI . <p> Finally , there are- different tools that provide- real estate analytics . Instead of creating spreadsheets , Mashvisor provides a predictive analysis for each property which is based on historical and comparative data . An investor can instantly get a break-down of cash flow , cash on cash return , cap rate , etc . The investment property analysis is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are performing , and neighborhood insights . <p> That was a lot of information , huh ? Ok , let 's quickly go over the qualitative data . <h> The Market <p> When selecting a market or an area , - see if the market is growing . If there 's a lot of construction going on , that means people will move to that area and bring tenants . The job market is another very important factor because tenants go where there are job opportunities . Markets with low unemployment rates are favorable . <p> Tip : Do n't select a market that is dominated by one job industry . If that industry fails , there is no more job market . <h> The Neighborhood <p> When choosing a neighborhood , make sure the- location is on point ! Understand what the target tenants are looking for . Depending on tenants , schools , crime rate , amenities , public transportation , noise levels , zoning laws are all things to look into . <h> The Property- <p> Getting an- appraisal and inspection- are crucial when selecting a property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set and to know the deal-breakers after inspecting a property . <p> While all of this criteria should be carefully contemplated , it should also go hand-in-hand with the cash flow and budget . A city center is a great location but if the investor ca n't afford it , the investment will not get the returns hoped for . Analyzing real estate investments takes time and patience but the benefits are securing a good investment and learning about different markets and properties in the meantime . 
@@44409599 @4409599/ <h> 8 Reasons Why You Should Buy an Investment Property Instead of Stocks <p> One of the longest standing and most complicated questions in front of any investor is whether to buy an investment property or stocks . Both types of investments have multiple pros and cons , which makes the decision rather problematical . Here we show you the 8 most important advantages of buying an investment property over investing in stocks : <h> 1. - You Have Full Control <p> The moment you buy an investment property , you are in charge . Instantly you become the CEO , if you want to look at it that way . You are free to decide on how much to spend on improvements in your rental property ; you are free to increase or decrease the monthly rent ; you are free to decide who your tenants will be ; you are free to sell your property whenever you decide to do so . Alternatively , if you own stocks , chances are your share will be negligible compared to the overall value of the company , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do or not do . Thus , if you are one of those people who like to be in control of their money and to be the one making the decisions , real estate investing is the right option for you . <h> 2. - Tangible Assets <p> When you buy an investment property , you have something that you can physically see , touch , feel , and even smell . Thus , for many investors a tangible asset makes them more comfortable with such an investment . Stocks , on the other hand , are not even sheets of paper anymore ; they are just something that you own but never get to actually see . <h> 3. - Less Volatility <p> While stocks have the advantage of being way more liquid and flexible ( you can sell them at any moment ) , they are also very , very volatile . The general state of the economy affects real estate properties too but to a much lesser extent than it affects stocks . Consequently , if you buy an investment property instead of stocks , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 4. - More Isolated and Protected <p> Related to our previous point , if you buy an investment property , you can also benefit from more isolation than if you invest in stocks . Real estate is generally local . Rental properties in strong , growing markets are likely to be quite protected from events in both the national and global economy " both in terms of property value and monthly rent . Prices in 24-hour cities such as New York City , San Francisco , London , Paris , and Singapore fall the least , recover the fastest , and appreciate the most . <p> Do n't forget to check out Mashvisor for comparative and predictive analytics that will tell you the best cities and neighborhoods for traditional and Airbnb investment properties throughout the US at the moment . <h> 5. - Hedge Against Inflation <p> If you decide to buy an investment property , for once , inflation will be on your side . In the long run , real estate property prices tend to go along with inflation . This means that you can raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also means that the value of your rental property will go up enough to cover for inflation . Meanwhile , your mortgage payments will remain the same in nominal value , so they will actually decrease in real terms with inflation . This is not necessarily true for stocks . Equity investments do n't follow inflation as directly as real estate prices do . <h> 6. - Easier to Analyze <p> In order to buy an investment property and see whether it will be profitable for you , all you need is some basic math to do the calculations . Calculating realistic expenses and rental income is all you need to see whether an investment property is a good idea or not . Your life as a real estate investor has been made even easier by the hundreds of online real estate calculators that you can download for just a few dollars . You do n't even need to use spreadsheets anymore to make your calculations . Analysis is less straightforward with investing in stocks . In addition to the cash flow , you will need to also factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stocks , you will need to trust the company with the figures in their reports . And needless to say , there are hundreds and hundreds of ways to massage the numbers to make them look better than they are and to keep investors happier than they should be . <h> 7. - More Leverage <p> When you buy an investment property through a bank loan , you benefit from significant leverage . Most loans require a down payment equal to 20% of the property purchase price , while the bank finances the other 80% . So , let 's say you want to buy an investment property that costs $100,000 . You will have to pay $20,000 now , and you will have 15 or 20 or even more years to pay the remaining $80,000 ( plus the interest ) . However , as soon as you find your first tenant , you will start making money ( maybe $800 or $900 ) on the entire value of your property , i.e. , on all the $100,000 . Being able to finance the purchase of your rental property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment property early in life when you still have very little savings and to start making money right on . It also gives you a chance to invest in several properties at the same time which will increase your rental income as well as your net worth . If we go back to the $100,000 property , with a down payment of 20% , you can buy five of those for a total value of $500,000 . With stocks , you can only buy stocks worth this $100,000. <h> 8. - Tax Benefits <p> Last but not least , when you buy an investment property , your cash flow will essentially be tax free . You will get tax deductions on the mortgage interest , the operating expenses , property taxes , insurance , and depreciation . With regards to depreciation , the IRS allows you to write off the value of your property over 27.5 years , so on paper depreciation will count as negative income . Exactly how much in total you can deduct will depend on your rental income , but this is definitely a major advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With this article , we do n't mean to say that real estate investing is an all-happy , problem-free way of making money . What we want to show you is why you should consider to buy an investment property rather than invest your money in stocks .

@@44409600 @4409600/ <h> Save Your Rental Income For These 3 Things <p> Owning property is not as simple as we might perceive it to be . When we think of buying property and renting it , we automatically conclude that it 's easy , not time consuming and does n't need sophisticated management . But what about rental income that flows into property investors accounts ? What you earn from renting your property is your income . How you use that income can be the defining factor of whether you succeed at being a real estate investor or not . <h> 1 . Maintenance Costs <p> If you are investing in a real estate property and you are already planning on renting it , you might as well accept the fact that repairs and maintenance are unavoidable expenses . The costs of repairs are of course dependable on the property you own . For example , a newly renovated house will need fewer repairs than an old house that has some flaws , in it that need to be addressed every now and then . <p> Contacting a local contractor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your property is the right thing to do for future budget planning in that particular area . If the contractor estimates the costs of repairs for a property you own at $4,000 per year on average . You should be able to take that into account as you calculate your rental income for the year ; how much of that income you can spend and how much of it you will need to put aside for expenses like repairs , mortgages and other reserve expenses . <h> 2 . Tenant Screenings <p> When planning on renting your property on a long term period as a steady and easy source of income , - it is highly advisable to conduct tenant screenings . These screenings will allow you as a property owner to know what kind of tenants you are dealing with and if you can trust them with your property or not . There are two negative aspects that might take a serious hit at your rental income savings if the tenants are not abiding by your rules or causing damage to your property . <p> First , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the owner to pay hefty amounts of money for repairs , so it is always a better option to conduct interviews with potential tenants , know more about them and most importantly charge them with a security deposit in case of any potential damages . Secondly , some tenants are just hard to deal with because of their inability to adhere to the rules or contracts made that you are forced to evict them . This will create some unnecessary expenses for the owner which might include legal fees to evict , difficulties finding a replacement in a shorter amount of time and potential fees for agencies that act as third parties between owners and tenants . Tenant screenings and interviewing strangers is a daunting task for anyone , but it is a necessary one if you are to limit the risks on your rental income and how much of it you save for yourself . <h> 3 . Unrented Property <p> This is a possibility all investors and owners might have to consider however scary that thought of not being able to get rental income might be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or owner because it helps in future planning . <p> Let 's look at it this way , an owner is renting his property for 9 months of the year , but there are 3 months that are considered off-season . That- makes it hard for him to find someone to rent his property during that time period . The owner must have thought about that potential risk during the 9 months where he accumulated rental income , he should 've put some money aside for a contingency as severe as this one . The owner still owns the property even though its not rented or not generating income , the expenses are still there . Taxes , mortgages and maybe even repairs are still expenses he has to deal with at a time when no income is flowing through his accounts . <p> To be successful in managing your property , you need to be well prepared . In order to expand your real estate investments you need to be perfectly organized . As I mentioned before , it is not as simple as we might think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain a property owner 's lifestyle or to gratify their needs . It is a source of consistent cash flow that should be well planned and organized to help you expand your ventures , being prepared and to develop yourself on- the path of real estate success .

@@44409602 @4409602/ <h> Worst Home-Buying Mistakes and Best Tips for Homebuyers and Investors <p> I had coffee with a real estate agent , Dorothy , and I asked her all of my burning questions . I asked her about the biggest mistakes homebuyers and real estate investors make- and about her worst experiences with clients ( everyone loves gossip ) . I also- asked her for feedback on the some of the most- frequently asked questions we get . <p> Here are my questions , her answers , and some of my thoughts in return . <p> What is the biggest mistake you see with homebuyers ? <p> They waive the home inspection because they 're too anxious to get the property . <p> So , what are the consequences of not getting a home inspection ? Once the house is settled on , the seller does not have any obligations towards the buyer . If the buyer later discovers an issue with the home , they can not request any repairs from the seller . The buyer can only comment based on what they see , but a home inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been aware of beforehand . <p> What is the biggest mistake you see with investors buying investment properties ? <p> Another big mistake- investors and homebuyers make- is putting less than 20% down . Sometimes with investment properties , you have to put 30% down , depending on the bank . However , if you have a good credit score , the bank might consider letting you put down less . <p> Would you recommend going FHA to those that do n't have the 20% downpayment ? <p> I personally would not recommend the FHA loan because you are still paying the PMI even after the 20% down payment has been reached , unless you refinance or get rid of the FHA loan . Also , the closing and selling process sometimes take too long . The home has to be appraised and pass the HUD Home Inspection which includes some tough standards and can sometimes jeopardize the buyer obtaining the property . Now , they have gotten more lenient about the appraisal but keep in mind , the seller and real estate agent prefer a conventional loan over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when using FHA to finance a property : 1 ) be very patient 2 ) get rid of the PMIs as soon as possible because that can significantly reduce monthly costs . <p> I think the 80/10/10 mortgage ( also referred to as Piggyback Mortgages ) is the way to go . The 80% is the first loan , 10% is the buyer 's money , and the remaining 10% is the second mortgage . The interest rate on the second mortgage is higher but you are avoiding paying PMIs . <p> I would also recommend ARM ( adjustable rate mortgage ) if the buyer wants to live in the property for more than seven years . If they 're planning on staying less than seven years , I do n't think it 's worth it and they should stick with the fixed rate . <p> The adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) means getting a lower interest for the first couple of years and then going back to a fixed rate it will increase if interest rates have stayed the same or increased . If interest rates have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stay the same or decrease . For example , if the loan is a 5-year ARM loan , the buyer 's monthly payments will be lower the first 5 years ( pro ! ) but then the rates are adjusted and unknown afterwards ( con ! ) . <p> If it 's not a renter 's market , you might be forced to break-even . But right now , ( in the D.C. metropolitan area ) rents are very high it 's a landlord 's market . <p> What 's one way someone can increase cash-flow if they are breaking even or barely making a profit ? <p> Have the renters pay the first $50-$100 for the repairs . That is what I do with my rental properties ; they pay a portion for the damages and it 's in the contract . It not only increases cash flow but definitely gives them an incentive to be more careful with the property . <p> What do you require from your client before helping them ? <p> They have to be pre-approved from the bank before beginning to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so important to get pre-approved because otherwise you will be getting your hopes up . <p> Tell me some of your worst experiences with clients . <p> Horror Story #1 <p> Something a lot of people were doing when the market was up was paying above the asking price . I had two clients looking for houses the when the market was very strong . They made offers on two or three houses but were not getting them . My client said he wanted to offer $5,000 above the asking price in hopes of getting the property . I explained to my client that history repeats itself and said " this feels- like 80 's , the market is up right now but will crash " so I advised against it . Unfortunately , the couple decided to get another agent and sure enough , the market crashed , and they ended up paying $10,000 above the asking price , per their agent 's advice . They even called me and I unfortunately was n't able to much of help to them . <p> Horror Story #2 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the priciest areas in Northern Virginia , and it was listed at a relatively low price . When my clients and I went to view the property , I stood on the porch and I saw the electric grid . I told them my gut did n't feel right and this electric grid could cause a lot of hassle , which explained the listing price . <p> Consequently , they also decided to buy the from another agent , who was actually a relative of theirs . The builder did not tell them there was going to be an easement . Sure enough , the electric grid crashed and it was an absolute mess for the buyers . <p> An easement is when someone has the legal right to use a property even though the title and land belong to the owner . Easements are usually given to power companies , which was the case with this horror story . <p> What do you think the real estate vs. stocks debate ? <p> I think at least with real estate , you have rental income tax deductions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can touch and see your investment . With the stock market , you ca n't regain your investment , there 's no time to recover . A lot of investors decided to diversify their investments by getting into real estate after the market crash . I personally lost all of my bank stocks whereas I still have my rental properties after the market crash and recession . <p> What do you think of foreclosures , short-sales , and renting out to section-8 tenants ? <p> If you can buy a foreclosure or short sale property , you absolutely should because they are a great opportunity . I bought my personal home at an auction for $300,000 and my home is now valued at above $2 million . I 'm very lucky and blessed , but I put a lot of work into my house and should I sell it , - the profit will be very significant. - <p> With section-8 tenants , you have to remember that the government does not always pay the full rent amount . So even if there 's a guaranteed check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full amount every time . That is very harmful to the investor because they usually have to do a fair amount of - rental renovations and would have to come up with that money on their own and not from their rental income . <p> How can people find off-market properties ? <p> What I do , if one of my clients says they 're interested in off-market real estate , is write a letter to the owner , letting them know that there 's an interest . It has n't worked yet but that is one way . <p> What do you say to people who do n't want to use agents ? <p> I think people are better off using real estate agents . Especially when selling , you 're able to show off the property more , you can better negotiate the rates , and the house sells a lot faster . When buying , you 're exposed to more houses and better connected with listing agents . Websites are not always updated on time . <p> Also , if you are self-employed , - you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set up a SEP ( Simplified Employee Pension ) plan and the rental income that is received is tax deductible . If you withdraw money from the fund before 59.5 , you pay a 10% penalty and you must claim the income on your taxes . <p> What I Learned <p> After talking to Dorothy , I realized that " following the book " in real estate can definitely pay off . Although there are different ways to buy homes or investment properties unconventionally , you have- to consider everything that comes with the territory , like the extra costs and regulations. - There are definitely creative ways to save money and invest in real estate , but it 's important to have a solid plan to deal with those extra responsibilities , as well as having a money cushion . <p> It 's also important to do things the right way the first time . For example , getting a pre-approval letter , a home inspection , and having a golden credit score really do matter . Keeping your- cool in hot markets , like by not offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip. - <p> An agent is like a parent .

Regardless of the specific reason for becoming a real estate investor , the overall goal is one : To become rich . In order to help you in your journey towards making more and more money through investment properties , we show you here how to get rich in real estate . <p> For those wondering how to get rich in real estate ( and that 's what everyone investing in income properties should be thinking about all the time ) , here are a few strategies to grow your income and assets through investment properties : <h> 1 . Fix and Flip <p> The first answer to the question how to get rich in real estate is for those who are not looking forward to- becoming landlords by renting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , it is for those more dynamic individuals interested in- short-term investments and who like to buy a property , fix it , and then flip it " i.e. , resell it for a price higher than the price they purchased it for . The trick is to identify a property which requires only minimal " and cheap " fixes to maximize its value . <p> After you manage to sell your first- fix-and-flip income property , with the profit you can buy a new better ( more expensive ) property which will bring you an even higher profit after you resell it . Then , with the profit from the second property , you buy a third one . In other words , you enter into a cycle of fixing and flipping which should generate you more and more money over time . Once you 've made enough profit , you can even start buying two fix-and-flip properties at the same time . Or you can use some of the money to buy a rental property that you will rent out to tenants .

If you are not this dynamic type of person and would like to- buy rental properties that you keep for at least a few years , then you should always aim for such properties that generate enough cash flow to pay off their own monthly mortgage payments . <p> Ideally , they will bring you even more than the amount of the loan repayment so that you can quickly save up some- money for a down payment on another income property . With the second property , you again aim at positive cash flow . With the positive cash flows from your now two rental properties , you will need less time to save up for a third income property .

@@44409609 @4409609/ <h> Why Renting Your Property Below Market Value Isnt a Great Idea <p> Renting your property in a certain range will dictate two things : tenant attention and your potential profits . If you rent the property higher than the market value , you will receive more profits per tenant but you will also impede the interest of prospective tenants , which could result in high vacancy rates . On the other end , if you set the rent too low , you will receive lower profits and will also deter tenants , since they will assume something is wrong with your property . There is a middle ground price to set when renting your property , to get an idea of this happy medium , click here . <p> But what if you deliberately lower the rent of your property below market value ? Say , as a favor to a person you know , such as a family relative or friend ? Sure , you will be pleasing that person , but in the long run , this satisfaction will be at the expense of your investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the best idea ? Essentially , by being a landlord , you are qualified for certain tax breaks , but when you rent a property for lower than its market value , you do not receive these tax benefits . <p> To further elaborate , we first need to differentiate between a personal residence , vacation home , and rental property . <p> Personal Residence " A home that is rented for less than 14 days during the taxable year by the owner or owner 's family members . <p> Vacation Home " A property that is rented during the taxable year but it is also used by the owner for more than 14 days or 10% of the number of days during the year in which the property is rented at a fair value . <p> Rental Property " A rental property is a property that is rented out for more than 14 days or 10% of the number of days during the taxable year that the property is rented at a fair value . <p> Now that we have clearly defined the various kinds of properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Residence : You can claim mortgage interest ( if it is under $1 million ) and mortgage points you have bought . You can also subtract equity debt interest of $100,000 or less . All other expenses are not deductible . <p> Vacation Home : Expenses are allocated between rental and personal use as long as rental expenses have been documented . You can deduct mortgage interest on one vacation home , but if you have multiple , you would not be able to as you would with your personal residence . <p> Side note : For a complete month-on-month breakdown of expenses , check out Mashvisor . <p> So , why would renting your property below market value disqualify you from tax breaks ? The reason is that the IRS does not recognize such properties as rental properties . Instead , the IRS classifies them as personal residences . As previously mentioned , a personal residence is a property rented by the owner or the owner 's family for less than 14 days or 10% of the number of days in the year . Also , renting your property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a family member or not , would still be considered a personal residence , not a rental property . <p> All this aside , this does not mean that renting your property below market value is illegal . It is totally legal , but , as we mentioned , you lose beneficial tax breaks if you do so . The choice is yours , but be aware of the implications on your tax returns . <h> Seek the help of a professional appraiser <p> Have a licensed appraiser examine your property . The appraiser will conduct a physical inspection of the property mainly by analyzing its condition , its construction , and any material issues that need to be addressed . The appraiser will also conduct a comparative market analysis to some extent , comparing the physical aspects of your property to others on the market . <h> Compute the property 's rental yield <p> Rental yield is a percentage of the annual income of a property divided by its cost multiplied by 100% . This is its net formula : ( annual rent " annual costs / purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental yield , you can find out how much income you will receive by renting your property . You can also compare your property 's rental yield to that of others to get a better understanding of the market 's value . Mashvisor allows you to calculate the rental yield of a property . <p> To sum up , renting your property below fair market value to a relative or nonrelative will make you miss out on certain tax breaks . But , as we already mentioned , this does not make it illegal , but it can be costly in the short-term and long-run . Also , if you do decide to rent at a lower value , you can still claim mortgage interest ( if the property is a second property ) and property taxes . None of this means you can not be renting your property to a relative . If you do decide to rent out to a relative at fair rental value , try to have this mentioned in the lease to ensure no tax complications . Keep a record of rent you receive , as you would with any other tenant .

" or " what do I need to know ? " Real estate investing can sound like rocket science to beginners or to those who have never even thought about real estate . What a lot of people do n't know is ordinary people who invest in real estate just once can be very successful and benefit from their investment their entire lives . Investing does not require a degree or a lot of prior knowledge , and the- resources- today make investing very feasible . Let 's examine what is actually required for one to invest . <p> 1. - Understand Cash Flow <p> You do n't  have to be- a math expert but understanding positive cash flow is the core of the calculations that you will come across . Positive cash flow means income is more than expenses and that should be made priority when investing . To figure this , you 'll have to be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property maintenance , vacancies , insurance , HOA fees , property tax , mortgage , etc . <p> There are many other figures to- be aware of . If someone proposes investing in a property with a 3% cash on cash return , an investor should know to walk away from such a deal . Differentiating good deals from bad ones takes time and practice , but it 's good to know what are the acceptable averages for cap rate , cash on cash return , price to rent ratio , etc . <p> A lot of investors know how to create excel sheets and calculate these figures for themselves but do n't be frightened not every investor does this . Since spreadsheets are becoming outdated , you can use- investment property calculators- which generate these figures automatically saving a lot of time and confusion . <p> An investor does n't have to know the ins and outs before investing but know when is the right time to buy or sell . When buying or selling , know what to expect based on the market conditions . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recession and market crash . Knowing market behavior and such patterns does not only act as risk management , but is also the best way to learn about- real estate investing . <p> Understanding the dynamics of an area is also- important , like- knowing which areas are in high demand . This means inquiring about neighborhood amenities , job market , transportation , home prices , rental rates , etc . <p> With any investment , comes risk . With real estate , it 's usually economy related . Not much that can be done about that but if the cards are played right , an investor can maintain income during an economical crisis . <p> Other risks include getting bad tenants or being unable to pay mortgage payment and having to foreclosure . Fortunately , these risks are a lot more manageable . <p> Networking is absolutely key for real estate investors , especially for beginners . You will need a network of different team members to gain new opportunities , assistance , and knowledge . Learning from the experienced is the best way to learn after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to make different decisions , ranging from banking to renovating . It 's a lot easier if you already have a team to consult . <p> Know how to properly communicate when screening and managing tenants . Since legal compliance is a big part of being a landlord , know how to be firm with tenants when necessary . Having proper communication skills is also important when it comes to negotiating closing costs or hiring labor . <p> Management can go under this point , as well . A lot has to be managed as an investor . The property has to be maintained , tenants have to be accommodated , payments have to be tracked , etc . If an investor does not want take all of this on , they will need to hire assistance which also has to be properly managed . <p> Real estate investing- is not just buying properties , renting , and selling . It does require understanding- consumer behavior and demands . If you 're trying to appeal to a certain demographic , such as college students , know what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide it . What kind of amenities are such tenants going to look for ? Are they going to be able to pay rent ? If you 're renting out a single-family home to a family , they 're going to take schools and crime rate into consideration . Off-campus students , however , are going to look at public transportation and proximity to universities and amenities . <p> 5. - Patience and Persistence <p> Real estate requires investors to continue learning about the market trends and about their own investment through observing . Of course real estate is not a get-rich-quick scheme so patience is required .

Passive income , as many imagine , through real estate is when you make income without any work . This alluring concept is definitely one many would like to pursue , especially as retirement moves closer . We hate to tell you , though , purely passive ' income is a pipedream . It still requires some kind of work . But fear not , dapper investor , passive income still decreases the load of work you must perform . <p> Two common ways of earning passive income are through real estate investment ( as already mentioned ) and stock market investment . The main differences between the two are that it 's easier to buy stocks but they require more extensive research and that it 's harder to purchase real estate but it normally produces much higher cash on cash returns ( which you can calculate using Mashvisor ) .

Now , to make such an ordinary yet lucrative investment passive , hire a property manager . The property manager will check up on the property regularly , collect rent , and deal with tenants . The obvious con for the investor is that the property manager will be paid from the rental income , usually between 8-12 percent of it . Another possible con of using traditional investments as passive income deals with entering the purchase . You will have to pay a considerable amount on the down payment as you would expect ( this is n't the case for other kinds of investments , as you will see later in the blog ) .

Do n't do it alone . Brainstorming with partners can provide you a different perspective and plan , as well as their experience .

A property management company will take care of the rent collection , damage investigation and repair , and management once purchased . This is also a good way to build equity on the property .

Real estate crowdfunding is the middle ground of active and passive real estate investment . It is active in the sense that the investors decide on the property they invest in , rather than having a company dictate the property . But other than that , it is passive in many respects .

What kind of data do you have available ? <p> In this article we look at some of the most commonly used and most useful methods on how to value an investment property to guide you through the process of deciding whether you should buy an income property or not . <h> Income Approach/Capitalization Rate <p> If you are planning to keep a rental property for a while in order to make money out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should choose the income approach when you decide how to value an investment property . This method relies on calculating the capitalization rate , or cap rate , for the property , which measures the rate of return of an income property regardless of the method of financing . In a sense , this is a quite simplified approach as in the real world you will most likely need to pay interest on your mortgage which the cap rate does not take into account . <p> So , how to calculate the cap rate ? <p> Cap Rate = NOI/Purchasing Price <p> NOI stands for net operating income , and it equals the annual rental income ( monthly rent x 12 ) minus annual operating costs . So , let 's say that the property you are contemplating is being sold for $200,000 , and you expect to be able to rent it out for $1,400 per month , while you estimate your annual operating costs at $4,000 . <p> Cap Rate = ( 12 x $1,400 $4,000 ) /$200,000 = 6.4% <p> Should you buy this income property ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among experts on what 's a good cap rate , most tend to say 8%-12% . <h> Cash on Cash Return <p> Let 's face it . Most investors need to take a loan in order to finance the purchase of an income property , so let 's look at a more real-world example . When you wonder how to value an investment property , you can also use the cash on cash return you could expect . One benefit of this approach is that it allows you to factor in the loan that you will need to take . Let 's look at an example with a mortgage . <p> And what does this number tell us ? Generally , you want the GRM to be lower because it means you are making more compared to your initial investment . One thing you could do with the GRM is compare it to similar properties in your area . Another common rule of thumb you can use is that income properties with GRM below 10 or close it are likely to generate neutral or positive cash flow , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively , if the GRM is above 15 , the cash flow is likely to be negative , so you should stay away from such investments . <h> Capital Asset Pricing Model/Return on Investment <p> If you aim for an even more realistic approach when you decide how to value an investment property , you need to consider the risk and opportunity cost associated with this investment . So , we could use the capital asset pricing model ( CAPM ) , which requires the calculation of the return on investment ( ROI ) . The return is the annual income from rent . <p> ROI = Annual Rental Income/Total Cash Investment <p> Annual Rental Income = 12 x $1,400 = $16,800 <p> If we assume we paid in cash for the rental property and needed $5,000 for rehab costs : <p> Total Cash Investment = $200,000 + $5,000 = $205,000 <p> ROI = $16,800/$205,000 = 8.2% <p> So what do we do with this number ? We compare it . If the ROI for your investment property is less than the expected return on a risk-free or guaranteed investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There is no point risking your money by investing it in real estate . <h> Property Appreciation <p> In our discussion of how to value an investment property , all methods mentioned so far lack one significant feature of real estate properties " that they generally tend to appreciate in value over time . If you plan to sell your income property at some point , you might want to consider how much its value will increase in the coming years . However , there is no way to predict this appreciation . Any number you come up with will be speculation . Thus , it is better not to rely on property appreciation only . <p> These are the five most popular approaches to the dilemma of how to value an investment property .

Well , then owning a rental property and- becoming a landlord- is probably- not- the best option for you . Nonetheless , if you are looking for good gains in the medium to long run , you should definitely consider buying a rental property . Although making money with rental properties might be more complicated as well as time- and effort-consuming than other types of investments , it is also safer " generally , you ca n't just lose everything because of a stock market crash , for example . <p> So , if you are considering investing in real estate , you should first learn what becoming a landlord is actually like . The basics are : a landlord is a real estate owner who rents his/her property to another person . However , do n't be mistaken " the landlord is not a person who just collects his/her money at the end of the month . Becoming a landlord is a business as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to think and plan carefully to make money as a landlord . So , now comes the question " how to become a landlord ? <h> 1 . Buy A Rental Property <p> If you are not already owning a rental property , the first step would naturally be- buying a rental property . There are many issues which you need to consider when choosing among rental properties : the location , the kind of property , the average rent in the neighborhood you are thinking about , the mortgage , property taxes , etc . After all , the property that you buy will be the main determinant of how much you will make as a landlord . With regards to the location , ideally you want to buy a rental property close to where you live . This will help you save on transportation costs and allow you to show the property to potential tenants , check on the property periodically , and take care of some of the needed repairs . With respect to the kind of property , if you are- becoming a landlord- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , you are buying a property to make money out of it , not your ideal home for yourself and your family . <h> 2 . Figure Out The Money <p> Next , - do the math . Before you even buy a rental property , make sure that there is money to be earned in your local market . Calculate the- capitalization rate . The cap rate measures the rate of return on an investment property based on the expected annual rental income divided by the purchasing price . To calculate this , you need to obtain a more or less accurate estimate of the rent you will be able to collect from your future investment property . Mashvisor offers data on rents throughout the US and offers an interactive investment analysis that automatically calculates cap rate . <p> The landlord income that you receive in the form of rent will supplement the monthly mortgage payments ; it could even match or exceed what you pay the bank . But do n't forget to include other expenses " which can add up to a lot " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , and these can be much higher than what you pay for your primary home . <p> Landlord insurance is also higher because of the higher associated risks when you have renters living in a property . Maintenance costs can vary significantly based on whether you choose to do repairs on your own ( which can be very time-consuming ) or to hire a professional . Good news is that you might be eligible for some- tax benefits- on costs associated with owning and managing your rental property : depreciation , insurance , mortgage interest , property repair , travel expenses , and others . <h> 3 . Know The Laws <p> Learn the- landlord-tenant law . First , there are- federal laws- related to habitability and anti-discrimination that you need to be familiar with . As a landlord , you can not discriminate against tenants based on race , color , national origin , religion , sex , disability , familial status , children , etc . In addition , - most states have further landlord-tenant legal provisions . These can regard a variety of issues such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice you need to give the tenants before you want them to leave , etc. <h> 4 . Pick Good Tenants <p> Once you have bought an investment property and are on your way to- becoming a landlord , you have to- screen potential tenants . You should do a background and credit check on potential renters " it is worth the time . Although a credit score should not be the sole reason you accept or reject a tenant , it is a useful screening tool . Take the time to check references , particularly from employers and past landlord . You should also conduct an interview with the potential tenants to make sure you are comfortable communicating with them . Throughout do n't forget that it is illegal to discriminate against tenants based on the criteria listed above . <h> 5 . Write A Lease <p> Customize the lease . There are standards lease forms available online that you can use as a template . However , you need to change the agreement in a way that matches your situation and preferences . Be specific . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ? Should dogs be leashed in the common areas ? <h> 6 . Maintain The Property <p> Inspect your rental property regularly . That 's why it is important to choose a location that is convenient for you . To avoid problems and misunderstandings with the tenants , explicitly state how often you want to perform inspection of the property in the lease documents . Three months is usually a reasonable period which allows for keeping an eye on the property without disturbing the tenants too much . Remember to document the move-in condition of your rental property by taking pictures in order to establish a baseline . If you find any problems during an inspection , it is a good idea to issue a notice and set another inspection in a week or two . <h> 7 . Stay Organized <p> Do proper- accounting and bookkeeping . Start from day one , do n't postpone this work for later as you will get lost . You have to keep accurate records of all income and expenses and be able to provide documentary evidence . You will need these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare financial statements , and to provide evidence if you are subject to an IRS audit . <h> 8 . Decide If You Need Property Management <p> Consider whether it is worth hiring- a property manager . A property manager comes at a price , but he/she will save you a lot of time and effort . Usually a property manager can market your rental property , select tenants , maintain the property , create budgets , and collect the rent . If you opt for hiring a property manager , identify his/her responsibilities clearly . Whether you decide to go for a property manager or do these tasks on your own depends on your financial situation , other commitments , and personal and professional skills . <p> Before you jump into becoming a landlord , make sure to know what becoming a landlord is all about . While it can be a way to make money , it is not about getting rich quick . Learn your responsibilities and proper laws first . After all , becoming a landlord is opening a business like any other , so it should be considered and tackled carefully .

Buy a really cheap property , fix it up , sell it , and make a killer profit on it , right ? Slow down ! As you might have imagined when clicking on this blog , there 's a lot more to buying foreclosures than those three ambiguous steps . Here 's how to buy a foreclosure as an investment property with some pointers you may not have considered . <p> Before learning how to buy a foreclosure , let 's know the basics first . A foreclosure property is when a borrower ( homeowner ) is unable to make loan payments and the lender ( bank ) then has to make up for the loss by reselling the property to another buyer or repossessing the property . The borrower is given a grace period , called pre-foreclosure , to make payments or try to sell the property during this time . That 's when investors look for pre-foreclosure properties or Notices of Default ( NOD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction is held at the end of the pre-foreclosure period in which a third party buyer can purchase the property or the bank can repossess it at the auction . These sales are known as Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ) or Notice of Foreclosure Sale ( NFS ) . Typically , if the owner ca n't redeem the loans , then an auction will be held outside the courthouse . If no one meets the minimum bid , then the bank repossesses the house and hires an agent to list it and sell it , and it becomes a Real Estate Owned property ( REO ) . <p> When looking for foreclosure properties , know if the property is still owned by the borrower or by the lender , and if a NOD has been issued . If the property is still borrower-owned , the investor should contact the owner . If the property is bank-owned , then you 'll know if you should be aware of auction requirements or if you should deal directly with the listing agent . <h> Buying The Property <h> 1 . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep the following in mind when looking : <p> If there are a lot of foreclosure properties , that 's not necessarily a positive thing . If one neighborhood has a lot of foreclosures , be cautious . That means people in the area are unable to make their payments . Does that mean there are no job opportunities in the area ? Finding an area with a lot of foreclosure properties is countereffective you 'll have no problem buying them but you wo n't be able to sell them . <p> Stay open to overpriced foreclosure properties . They might sit longer on the market but that means banks could jump on your offer . <p> Use your contacts to find opportunities . You might be acquainted with lenders or homeowners who can recommend potential properties . <p> If a property looks good online and meets your criteria , go check it out in person and get an inspection . <h> 2 . Getting in touch with brokers <p> You also want to get in touch with a broker who works directly with banks and foreclosure homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calling them . Show them you mean business by immediately going to a lender after talking to them . Also ask them about future listings that will be coming up . <p> Most banks have one listing agent for a foreclosure property- try to work directly with these people . <h> 3 . Getting approved for a loan <p> A preapproval letter will indicate how much can be borrowed based on credit score and income . Getting a preapproval letter should actually be the first thing you do because once a deal is found , there may not be enough time to go back and sort things out with the bank . Good deals go quickly so having an approval letter ready will prevent you from missing out . <p> Cash payments are even better for foreclosures , if feasible . Besides the fact that many auctions wo n't accept anything besides cash-offers , banks do not like to acquire foreclosure properties and are more likely to quickly accept cash paymenys. <h> 4 . Paying for the property <p> Although foreclosure homes are typically below market price , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't forget to calculate repair and renovation costs . Remember you 're buying a property as-is.However , this does n't mean you should expect the bank to take renovation costs into consideration when selling the house . <p> If homes are selling quickly in that area , the best strategy is to bid your highest offer initially . <p> This all does n't mean you should n't look for or wo n't find great deals . You should try to find homes that are below market value to renovate them to bring them back up and beyond market value . Just know , buying really cheap properties might get you into an overwhelming amount of work that requires experience . <h> Creating An Investment Property <h> 1 . Making renovations <p> Renovations should be made quickly and efficiently . The the longer they take , the pricier they get . Make sure to know typical renovations that come with a foreclosure . Have an inspector and contractor look at the property before buying it to see if there are major deal-breakers . <p> Get to know subcontractors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find landscapers and other professionals and design ideas . <p> It 's important that the home sticks out from all other homes . It should be cleaned , renovated , and updated . <h> 2 .

Investors should n't worry if their renovations have allowed the property 's value to be above average , but they should be patient in allowing people to get comfortable with the property . <p> Knowing how to buy a foreclosure requires patience and more importantly , contacts the more people you know , the more likely you 're able to find struggling homeowners , foreclosures to be listed , and people that have experience with such investments who could help .

Then , you need to know the current real estate market trends in order to be able to make a reasonable decision . After the collapse in 2008 , the housing market has been on the rise in the last couple of years . Generally , these positive trends are expected to continue in 2016 and beyond . But let 's look at some specific real estate market trends at the moment . <h> 1. - Secondary Markets Are the New Hot Thing . <p> One of the most significant current real estate market trends is that as 24-hour cities like New York and San Francisco are getting way too overcrowded and largely unaffordable , real estate investing will move to new 18-hour cities such as Memphis , San Diego , San Antonio , Austin , Nashville , and Portland . While these cities already have the urban appeal of trendy restaurants and clubs , they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staying connected , and more affordable house prices . These characteristics make them attractive to both young families looking to buy their first home and real estate investors looking for profit . <p> If you are interested in following this new real estate market trend and are considering the option of buying a real estate property in a secondary market , Mashvisor can provide you with valuable analytics for hundreds and hundreds of locations throughout the US. <h> 2. - There Will Be Migration to the Suburbs . <p> Although millennials ( aged 18-34 years ) have long been portrayed as people obsessed with urban living , recent data show that most of them actually desire a single family home in a location with good schools for their kids . On average , millennials are starting families later than previous generations , but many of them are about to have children in the upcoming couple of years . In 2015 80% of millennials wanted to own a home , an increase from 65% in 2011 and from 78% in 2014 . Thus , another of the major real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs by this particular group of future house owners . Naturally , these will not be the suburbs of yesterday as these regions will need to develop in order to adapt to the needs of this new generation of home buyers . <h> 3. - First Time Home Buyers Dominate the Market . <p> Despite reviving in the housing market and relatively low interest rates in the last few years , the real estate market has been and will continue to be dominated by first time home buyers . One reason for that real estate market trend is the growing interest of millennials in buying their own home as they come of age . In 2015 , they already accounted for a third of all real estate sales , and this proportion is expected to rise in 2016 . Another reason is that distressed sales are very low after the recovery from the recession . Even though baby boomers are starting to look to downsize their homes as they approach retirement , these transactions are not enough to surpass the first time buyers . <h> 4. - Affordability Remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate market trends which is expected to last throughout 2016 is affordability of available homes . While affordability or rather the lack of such has been an issue for awhile , addressing this problem is turning into a must now . In 2015 about 3% of the real estate market was unaffordable to the average Amerian wage earner . An increase in the interest rate , a further rise in home prices , or a slow growth in wages could drive the share of unaffordable markets up to as much as 25% . The nature of the real estate market makes it just too profitable to build large , luxurious units , but the reality is that home buyers can not afford buying and then taking care of such homes . Thus , the real estate market will need to shift towards smaller , truly sustainable , green building in order to satisfy the demand . <h> 5. - Housing Prices Will Increase by 3% . <p> Real estate market experts expect home prices to go up by 3% in 2016 on average across the nation . This moderate forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well beyond the 6% increase in 2015. <h> 6. - The Interest Rate Is on the Rise . <p> The Fed is expected to increase the interest rate in 2016 , which will definitely have some impact on all in the real estate market " those buying , those selling , and those renting . As the Fed strives to keep inflation in check , interest rates are set to go up , thus raising the cost of credit for those seeking to buy a home . The good news is that the rise in long-term mortgage rates is expected to be only gradual this year , keeping mortgage rates at levels well beyond those prior to the recession . While 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged a bit below 4% for most of 2015 , they are forecast to average 4.4% in 2016 . This real estate market trend will affect first time home buyers the most . However , such a relatively small increase should not be a reason to panic and is expected to discourage only a small proportion of potential home purchasers . <h> 7. - Rents Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than inflation . The reason is simple : rental vacancy rates are at their lowest in the past 30 years . Although the construction of multifamily homes is continuing , it does not suffice to satisfy the high demand . High rents are causing trouble to millennials and others looking to buy their own homes . On the one hand , expensive rents are pushing people to seek to buy a home . On the other , spending so much money on rent makes it very hard to save up enough for a down payment .
