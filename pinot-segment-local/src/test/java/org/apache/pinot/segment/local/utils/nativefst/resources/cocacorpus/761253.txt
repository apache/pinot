Lighting consumes about 20% of the electric energy in buildings ; it is imperative to address the value light brings us while also addressing energy issues . Light is a commodity we take for granted to be able to see : lighting is a tool used to create needed visual environments for people to live , work , play , learn , shop , communicate and do business in . Light is an especially essential element in that most personal of spacesour own homes . <h> Lighting Quality and Advocacy <p> The IALD has joined with other lighting organizations around the world to urge governments to adopt energy policies that recognize the importance of the proper application of lighting and its impact on human well-being and commerce . Energy efficiency and lighting quality should go hand-in-hand when shaping effective energy policy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , there are variations that take into account cultural differences and social customs . In recent years the IALD has worked with the Society of Light and Lighting ( SLL ) and the Institution of Lighting Professionals ( ILP ) in the United Kingdom , the American Lighting Association ( ALA ) and the Illuminating Engineering Society ( IES ) in the United States , and other organizations around the world to publish advocacy papers on lighting quality . This effort continues , with major updates scheduled for 2015 and 2016 . <p> We acknowledge the importance and value of energy-efficient lighting , and believe it should be achieved in a manner that does not compromise lighting 's primary intentto serve human needs in a world in which most information is gathered through the eye . <p> The struggle for lighting quality is often portrayed as an unsuccessful search for a single numeric metric that can be used as a standard . Lighting quality , however , is dependent on multiple factors . These include : <h> Light + Vision <p> Lighting exists to enable us to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we see . The more visible tasks are , the more efficiently , accurately and safely we perform them . For this reason , selection of light levels is critical to health , safety , and welfare . Energy policies should ensure that light levels meet accepted IES standards . <h> Light + Comfort <p> Good lighting provides sufficient light levels without glare , which can be irritating or even impair vision . Just as older people need more light to see clearly , they are also more sensitive to glare , making vision and glare critical issues for America 's aging population . Energy policies should incorporate visual comfort as a requirement to promote lighting choices that do not trade off efficiency for glare . <h> Light + Modeling <p> Light and shadow are tools that lighting designers use to make faces , objects and spaces more visible or more attractive . Energy policies should ensure choice of lighting that promotes effective communication , commerce and safety using modeling . <h> Light + Composition <p> Within spaces , patterns of light and the appearance of lighting equipment itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wayfinding while emphasizing points of interest such as artwork . Light patterning can articulate architecture and reinforce mood and atmosphere . <p> Energy policies should ensure choice of lighting that enable users and owners to effectively interact with other people , building spaces and the neighborhood . <h> Light + Color <p> Visible white light is comprised of colors ; the spectral composition of a light source , whether it is " cool " or " neutral " or " warm " in color appearance , can affect how we perceive the colors of faces , objects and surfaces . Energy policies should promote light sources with good color rendering ability and choice of color appearance . <h> Where Do Lighting Quality Standards Originate ? <p> While " Lighting Quality " is by definition a subjective term dependent on individual experience of the lighted space , documents prepared in different countries incorporate universal principles along with cultural norms .

@@10865466 @4065466/ <h> USDOE Report : The Impact of Color Shift Reliability <p> Although LED lighting products are less prone than other lighting technologies to shifts in color , their long lifetimes which can exceed 50,000 hours can make even gradual color changes relevant over the long run . An industry working group , the LED Systems Reliability Consortium ( LSRC ) formed by the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) and the Next Generation Lighting Industry Alliance has issued a new report that focuses on how and why color shifts in LED lighting products , and how those shifts impact reliability . <p> Entitled LED Luminaire Reliability : Impact of Color Shift , the report does n't  define limits for specific applications ; rather , by increasing our knowledge it allows the industry to manage the negative impact of color shifts . In so doing , it complements a series of previous LSRC reports , LED Luminaire Lifetime : Recommendations for Testing and Reporting , which focused mainly on lumen depreciation and catastrophic failure . Chromaticity shift in LED packages is very complex , with different underlying mechanisms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift can progress in a fairly predictable pattern that depends on junction temperature , and the rate is also affected by ambient temperature , optical flux density , presence of moisture for phosphor particles , and neighboring binder material . In addition to the chromaticity shift behavior from the LED packages , optical materials in the lamps and luminaires tend to yellow or discolor due to oxidation effects , leading to chromaticity shifts in the yellow direction . <p> Further work is needed in understanding , projecting , and communicating LED chromaticity shift . An Illuminating Engineering Society TM-31 working group is developing a standard for projecting long-term chromaticity maintenance of LED packages . Ideally , a chromaticity shift model can be developed for different package types , to determine the time to a specific magnitude of shift , which can then be inserted in a system-reliability model to predict the behavior of an LED luminaire or lamp . <p> DOEs GATEWAY program has reported on color shift . And with the help of DOE funding , RTI International has been investigating the topic by analyzing color shift data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALiPER Report 20.5 : Chromaticity Shift Modes of LED PAR38 Lamps Operated in Steady-State Conditions ) , and luminaires from accelerated stress testing . Models are currently being developed , but more research is needed to understand the different color shift mechanisms in the different luminaire subsystems and to develop accelerated testing methods and predictive models to further improve the manufacturers ability to bring color-stable lighting products to the customer . <p> The LSRCs ultimate goal is to develop an approach to lifetime projection that takes into account catastrophic failure , lumen depreciation , and color shift all together . When improved predictive models are developed , manufacturers and consumers will be able to better understand the tradeoffs and make informed decisions regarding LED lighting performance requirements and product capabilities @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883

@@10865508 @4065508/ <p> IALD members have first-hand experience with the importance of energy codes . But energy codes vary both within and among countries , regions , provinces , states , and other localities around the world . <p> As part of our ongoing exploration of the codes you might need to know , we talked with Marty Salzberg , IALD , an IALD member for the past 29 years . Marty represents the IALD on the ASHRAE/IES 90.1 code-writing committee . The ASHRAE/IES 90.1 standard is relevant in many locales in the United States . She is intimately involved in the development of energy codes , which continue to be of great importance , even with the rapid growth solid state lighting ( SSL ) applications ( see previous interview with Glenn Heinmiller , FIALD ) . Here , Marty shares her insight on how these codes come to be , as well as her perspective on the future relationship between codes and lighting design . <p> Q : Given that energy lighting codes are of significant importance to IALD members , what are your thoughts about their future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly turn complex . There are actually two national model codes : I work mainly on the standard produced by the American Society of Heating , Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) , in partnership with the IES ( Illuminating Engineering Society ) . As a member of the IALD Energy and Sustainability Committee , I also help work on the International Energy Conservation Code ( IECC ) , the other major energy code in the United States . <p> ASHRAE/IES has just finished the 2016 version of the energy standard , and information from the ASHRAE/IES 90.1 2016 standard is included in proposals for the 2018 version of the IECC . These two codes are developed by different methods , but the IALD and other organizations are working to make them more similar . <p> Part of what makes this process complex is that states in the USA are free to adopt 1 ) ASHRAE/IES 90.1 ; 2 ) the IECC ; 3 ) a self-developed energy code ; 4 ) or no statewide code at all . For example , Californias Title 24 , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an example of a state-developed code . California was the first state to develop its own energy code , but other states , such as Washington , are beginning to move in a similar direction . Designers with projects all over the country need to check which code is in use in each locale . <p> Q. Are both the IECC and ASHRAE/IES 90.1 Federal codes ? <p> Salzberg : No . The US Department of Energy recognizes both as valid energy compliance programs . They are developed as model codes , then adopted by various jurisdictions . These are not Federal laws , although there are ( badly enforced ) laws saying that adoption of energy codes is linked to some federal funding . <p> Q. Do most states adopt one of the codes ? <p> Salzberg : Its a mixed bag at this moment . Only 10 states have adopted ASHRAE/IES 90.1-2013 or IECC2015. 33 states are using earlier versions of one or the other , and 13 states are either using a code older than the 2007/2009 codes , or have no statewide energy code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 20082010 recession and recovery , and those effects have lingered . <p> New York just adopted IECC 2015 as the state code ; New York City has made further modifications to IECC 2015 to increase stringency and make IECC and ASHRAE/IES more comparable . But there is one point where they are very different : the IECC states that a project in an existing space must comply if it changes more than 50% of the luminaires , while ASHRAE/IES 90.1 requires compliance upon changing 10% of the connected lighting load . New York City modified both to 20% . New York City also added requirements for dwelling unit energy efficiency to the ASHRAE/IES 90.1 compliance path , making it the same as the IECC . <p> Q. How are these model codes evolving ? <p> Salzberg : ASHRAE 90.1 2013 and IECC 2015 had multiple technologies in them , and did not focus on solid state lighting . The mathematical models then in use were based on CFL , linear fluorescent , CMH , halogen , and incandescent lighting . Development on that code cycle started in 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle ( 2016/2018 ) is based on using solid-state lighting technology for many of the fixtures in the mathematical models that are used as a basis for lighting power density ( LPD ) allowances . The lighting power allowances will be reduced in upcoming codes because solid state lighting is more efficient than the legacy light sources . Its a challenge because color tuning is becoming more important , and that technology currently requires more watts than fixed color temperature luminaires . So , in general , we are seeing the same sort of increased stringency applied to solid-state lighting as we saw previously with legacy technologies . <p> Q. If you were to begin designing the lighting for a new 40-story office building , would you be designating the use of anything other than LED lighting ? <p> Salzberg : Probably not , but it would depend on the client and the budget . LEDs have been shown to be cost effective for most applications , but the client still has to " wrap their head around " the fact that LED technology is very different from legacy light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most new construction with new light fixtures will be using LED light sources where the solid state lighting component is an integral part of the fixture and lamp replacement becomes a thing of the past . <p> While it is a fact that solid-state lighting is rapidly becoming the new standard , replacing legacy technologies , all installations change as they age . With legacy sources , there was always a problem getting the correct replacement lamps installed when the original lamps burned out , or retaining critical focus of a fixture when it was re-lamped . With theoretically longer life solid-state sources that may not " burn out , " the concerns will include color shift with age , lumen depreciation , and availability of replacement components that match the original . New technologies bring new sets of concerns . It will be interesting to see how all LED installations look in 5 years . <p> For more information on the IALDs public policy initiatives , send an email to John Martin , IALD Public Policy consultant .

Important draft addenda to the lighting portions of 90.1 are about to be issued for public comment , possibly as early as 4 September . In advance of the release , this article reviews what ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 is , how IALD is involved , and the importance of Standard 90.1 to the lighting design community . <p> WHAT IS ANSI/ASHRAE/IES STANDARD 90.1 AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT ? In the US , energy codes are developed by private organizations and individual states are free to adopt the energy codes they prefer or to create their own . ANSI/ASHRAE/IES 90.1 is one of two energy codes developed on a national basis ; the other is the code family sponsored by the ICC ( International Code Council ) . Standard 90.1 sets out in detail the minimum energy-efficiency requirements for design and construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing buildings and their systems . The 90.1 standard is developed and maintained by a committee constituted by ASHRAE , which includes a lighting subcommittee . The ASHRAE/IES 90.1 standard is developed and maintained according to strict American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) protocols . The ANSI process requires public review and comments , which means that lighting designers can influence the outcome of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 through their review comments . <p> Marty Salzberg , IALD , Senior Associate at Cline Bettridge Bernstein Lighting , currently serves as IALDs representative on the full 90.1 committee and as one of two IALD representatives on the lighting subcommittee . <p> " Standard 90.1 is the standard that must be used for LEED projects , " Salzberg has noted . " Most projects have to comply with an energy code these days , so it is clear that 90.1 can have a major influence on our work . " Salzberg says the IALDs presence and goal within the committee is to assure that the energy code allows for good design . <p> COMING SOON : PROPOSED CHANGES TO LIGHTING PROVISIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90.1 are scheduled to be released in early September for a 45-day comment period . IALD members can help shape the final version of the addenda through their comments . <p> " The addenda coming out for review will incorporate LED technologies into the models used as the basis for the lighting power allowances , for both interior and exterior applications , " Salzberg said . These changes will reduce lighting power allowances for interior lighting by an average of 17% and exterior allowances by approximately 30% . " Previously , when new technologies were introduced , such as CMH lamps or electronic ballasts , the efficiency of the old and new technologies were blended in each fixture model .

@@10865536 @4065536/ <p> An informative new report from the U.S. Department of Energys GATEWAY program documents the experiences of Aurora Lighting Design , Inc. , in Grayslake , IL , when it installed an OLED lighting system during office renovations in 2014 , becoming the first office test site for the use of OLEDs in general lighting . <p> Aurora selected Trilia OLED lighting system Acuity Brands , an IALD LIRC member , whose shallow profile works well with the companys low-ceiling office . According to Aurora staff , the Trilia system offering comfortable ambient light with warm color ( 3000K ) and very good color rendering ( CRI = 89 ) delivers much higher-quality lighting than the system it replaced , which consisted of recessed medium-base downlights with nominal 20W PAR38/830 LED lamps . The exposed OLED panels deliver a soft , minimal-shadow light that makes faces and expressions visible and increases room brightness by reaching vertical surfaces . When the OLED surface luminance is kept below 3000 cd/m2 , this is achieved with no increase in glare . <p> Auroras staff enjoys working under the OLED system , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The systems dimmability allows for a reduction in output and potential visual discomfort when lower illuminances are preferred . The system is used in a dimmed state most of the time , since daylight is the primary light source . <p> One of the challenges of the Aurora installation was that the drivers were too large to fit above the gypboard ceiling . All 11 of them were remote-mounted in an adjacent space , which necessitated pulling large numbers of wires through a shallow joist space to multiple mounting points . At the time of manufacture , there were no dedicated OLED drivers on the market , so Acuity equipped the OLED lighting system with LED drivers which lowered system efficacy , because they could n't be tuned to the precise needs of the OLEDs . While the OLED system dims smoothly with a 0-10V dimmer , dimming introduces flicker although the flicker frequency is fairly high ( 261 Hz ) , and staff have noticed no personal health consequences . <p> Auroras OLED installation gives an idea of the potential performance of OLED panels , but it represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology is maturing , and problems such as shorting defects are already being solved with new panel architectures . OLED panel flicker is a function of the driver , just as it is for LEDs . Acuity is already converting its OLED product line to a programmable driver with current ranges appropriate for the OLEDs , with improved dimming performance and much higher light-modulation frequency to eliminate flicker complaints . <p> Compared to LED lighting , OLED lighting is still in its infancy , but because of its unique advantages , the architectural market is taking notice . If OLED panels continue to get better and cheaper , lighting designers and specifiers will have an impressive new tool to use . @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883@@10865537 @4065537/ @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883

@@10865554 @4065554/ <h> USDOE Report : Tunable Lighting in a Senior-Care Center <p> USDOE <p> The U.S. Department of Energys GATEWAY program worked with the Sacramento ( California ) Municipal Utility District ( SMUD ) to conduct a pilot installation of tunable-white LED systems at the ACC Care Center , a senior-care facility in Sacramento . SMUD and ACCs goals for the project included learning more about how tunable-white lighting impacts the sleep patterns , nighttime safety , and other behaviors of the residents , and exploring ways to better equip the staff to provide excellent care by improving the quality of lighting . The findings are detailed in a new report . <p> When the LED system was being specified , there werent many tunable-spectrum luminaires available that would be suitable for replacing the incumbent fluorescent systems . Several different tunable-white LED systems were chosen and installed in a corridor , two resident rooms , the nurse station , the common family room , and the administrators office . The incumbent fluorescent systems were evaluated in August 2015 and the trial LED systems in December 2015 . <p> With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bathrooms did not meet current industry standards , but with the LED system they exceeded IES recommendations for people over the age of 65 . Color consistency for the tunable LED luminaires used in the corridors , nurse station , family room , and administrators office was very good between luminaires and over the dimming range . Based on the reduced power , the tunable LED luminaires in the corridors yielded 45% energy savings compared to the fluorescent system , but factoring in the automatic dimming increased those savings to 68% . <p> By combining spectral tuning and dimming in the residents rooms , adjacent corridor , and nurse station , light was used that was likely to suppress the production of melatonin from morning to midday , and that was less likely to suppress melatonin production in the evening and at night .

Although many factors may have affected these observations , the health benefits may have been attributable , at least in part , to the lighting changes , and add to the energy and lighting-quality benefits . <p> Among the lessons learned from the project were that contractors are n't  yet familiar with tunable systems and controls , that finding the proper balance of automatic versus manual tuning of the lighting spectrum and intensity is challenging , and that educating residents and staff is essential when implementing tunable lighting solutions in senior-care facilities . <p> Despite the small size of the pilot study , the ACC Care Center plans to incorporate many of the lighting solutions and strategies as best practices for future renovations and expansion .

@@10865592 @4065592/ <h> A Wealth of Resources on Color-Tunable Luminaires <p> By James Brodrick , U.S. Department of Energy <p> The emergence of LEDs has made color-tunable luminaires much more practical than they 've been up till now , resulting in a growing buzz about potential benefits ranging from improved health and wellbeing , to increased productivity , to enhanced mood or alertness , to higher occupant satisfaction . To help stakeholders understand the potential tradeoffs , limitations , and issues associated with this emerging product category , the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) has expanded its online resources related to color-tunable luminaires . The web section now offers guidance on specifying , controlling , and testing LED color-tunable products , as well as useful information on the three basic types of those products ( dim-to-warm , white-tunable , and full-color-tunable ) , including the applications they 're used for and the major issues that are associated with them . <p> Specifying LED color-tunable luminaires is dependent on being able to make accurate comparisons between products . However , reporting performance values for color-tunable products is much more complicated than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of possibilities makes it more challenging to measure and communicate performance , and there are no standardized test procedures to follow . DOEs web section outlines the type of information that specifiers need to know but often wo n't find on cut sheets , and suggests the kinds of data manufacturers should consider providing for the minimum , mid-range , and maximum CCT settings , in the absence of industry guidelines . It also lists issues that have been recently encountered when ordering color-tunable lighting systems . <p> Controlling color-tunable luminaires can be challenging for specifiers , because different manufacturers use different approaches . Some manufacturers provide proprietary control devices that often rely on an existing protocol with a customized user interface/hardware , and others relying on controls using standardized or open protocols , often from third-party manufacturers , which provide a greater range of options but may also lead to compatibility issues . DOEs web section explains how controls for color-tunable luminaires work , discusses the most common protocols and applications for wired and wireless control , and takes a look at dimming curves and why they 're so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lists the major issues specifiers and manufacturers should consider when specifying or offering control systems for color-changing luminaires . <p> In addition , DOE has just released an addendum to CALiPER Report 23 : Photometric Testing of White-Tunable LED Luminaires , which was released last August . The new addendum examines the effect of the number of measurement points across the tuning range on the measured values for key product characteristics . The new analysis compares values derived from an 11-point test procedure , to values derived from three , five , or six measurement points . Stay tuned for additional related reports in the CALiPER 23 series . @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883

@@10865605 @4065605/ <h> A CLOSE LOOK AT LED MR16s <p> USDOE <p> By James Brodrick , U.S. Department of Energy <p> The U.S. Department of Energys CALiPER program has released a new report on the photoelectric performance of LED MR16 lamps , which present unique driver design challenges and tradeoffs because of their small size and the fact that pin-based MR16s operate at 12V and thus require a transformer . A follow-up to a previous CALiPER report on the photometric performance of the same sample of 27 lamps , the new study focuses on performance variation for a given lamp model , based on the system to which its connected , as well as whether characterization using laboratory power supplies instead of commercial transformers can result in misleading flicker and power quality performance characterization . <p> Five different test scenarios were used , with substantial variation found in the performance of the LED MR16s both within a given scenario and across multiple scenarios . One difference from previous testing was that none of the LED MR16s , regardless of the scenario , had dimming curves that were similar to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each lamp model with an electronic transformer selected from the lamps compatibility list if available and an electronic low-voltage dimmer ) , lamps with manufacturer-provided compatibility recommendations performed best when operated with compatible transformers and/or dimmers . It was also found that , although transformer compatibility was paramount , the choice of dimmer could still have an effect on performance . <p> In Scenario Two ( operation of each lamp model with an electronic transformer and a typical incandescent dimmer with which the transformer was listed as compatible ) , few of the lamps performed adequately , and many showed highly erratic dimming behavior . <p> Scenario Three ( operation of each lamp model with a typical magnetic transformer and magnetic low-voltage dimmer that were considered inherently compatible with one another ) demonstrated the relative predictably of magnetic transformer-based systems , which eliminate the compatibility concerns of one electronic component from the system but draw higher system power . This greater compatibility , however , is not without tradeoffs , such as lower system efficacy and possibly more dead travel and higher minimum dimming levels . <p> The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a laboratory power supply delivering root-mean-square 12V AC ) and Five ( operation of each lamp model using a laboratory power supply delivering 12V DC ) was to help understand the relevance of basic photometric testing of low-voltage products . Due to equipment limitations and normalization procedures , only a limited set of metrics could be compared , but the results show that although laboratory lamp power-quality measurements are unlikely to represent their performance once installed in a lighting system , flicker measurements with an AC power supply may be informative ( testing with a DC power supply does n't  allow for evaluation of either metric ) . @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883

The dramatic lighting sets off the Gothic architecture , and is visible from many parts of the city . <p> " " This dynamic and original design delights the eye as it celebrates the architecture of the tower , " " another judged praised of the project . <p> The Dom Square is where the memories of the past are recalled ; the gable wall where the west end of the Dom Church once stood is highlighted , and a visual connection to the arch at the base of the tower is made with light . <p> A light sequence is programmed in time with the Dom Tower 's clock .

The play of light accelerates , while memories , represented as bursts of light , appear to ascend the tower .

Mounting devices had to be custom made for each location , as no drilling was allowed into the stonework and no sources allowed to be viewed from below .

@@10865626 @4065626/ <h> Energy Policy <h> ENERGY CODES : GLOBAL ISSUES 2014 <h> BACKGROUND <p> Energy codes are useful tools in helping to reduce energy consumption in the built environment . At the same time , energy codes may be counterproductive if they focus on reducing energy use at the expense of occupant comfort and productivity , or if they limit design options unnecessarily . The International Association of Lighting Designers ( IALD ) recommends that energy codes address certain key points : <h> SIMPLICITY AND CLARITY <p> Across the globe , a common approach to making energy codes more stringent is to make them longer and more complex by layering new provisions on top of existing codes . It is questionable whether this approach works . The IALD recommends that energy code authors always : <p> Include " simplicity and clarity " as editorial goals for every code in order to enhance compliance usability and enforceability ; <h> COMMON PURPOSE , COMMON LANGUAGE <p> The IALD recommends that energy code authors look at existing codes and strive to adopt common terminology and approaches whenever feasible . Such commonality will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading to increased compliance . In addition , code authors may save themselves both frustration and unnecessary effort by adopting and re-using key provisions from other codes , rather than seeking to invent new ways to address similar problems . <h> CONTROLS , COMMISSIONING , AND OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR <p> Controls can be extremely helpful in managing energy usethey must be designed , installed and operated properly in order to be effective . Commissioning helps ensure that control systems operate as designed , and re-commissioning helps ensure that control systems continue to operate as designed . Building occupants are part of the energy-management team for every building ; they must be educated and encouraged to make use of the systems provided to them . <p> The IALD supports building commissioning and post-occupancy re-commissioning efforts ; <p> Requirements for lighting controls should focus on increasing the likelihood that occupants will use and maintain control systems appropriately ; <p> We support extensive use of occupancy sensors and daylight responsive controls along with other control techniques that will reduce lighting energy use without reducing lighting quality and annoying building occupants . <h> DAYLIGHTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code requirements that require daylighting of buildings to reduce energy use and improve indoor environmental quality . The IALD also supports code requirements that improve daylighting possibilities , including building envelope characteristics such as window/wall ratios . <p> Daylight should be the primary source of light for buildings whenever feasible and practical ; <p> Daylight optimization generally requires integration of electric lighting controls and daylighting controls into a single system , as well as an integrated approach to building and interior design in general . <h> INTEGRATED DESIGN PROCESS AND PERFORMANCE PATH COMPLIANCE <p> The IALD supports code provisions that allow design teams to take into account the unique aspects of each building project and encourage design teams to work together . Improved energy performance in buildings can only be achieved by considering tradeoffs among building systems in order to find optimal balance points . " Performance Path " options in energy codes promote an integrated design process and a likely overall reduction in building energy use compared to " prescriptive path " options . <p> We support increased use of performance path approaches , possibly including mandatory use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance path approaches , the IALD recommends that government agencies and others devote significant resources to improving building modeling and information software ; <p> Performance based methods should accommodate atypical building designs , and should not discourage innovative energy saving designs . They should properly measure and give full credit for all energy saving techniques used . <h> OUTCOME-BASED CODES AND POST-OCCUPANCY POLICIES <p> Even if buildings are designed , constructed , and commissioned properly , they will not achieve predicted energy savings if they are poorly operated and maintained . Significant building energy savings can be realized if buildings are operated effectively over time to maintain initial design efficiencies . We support the development of post-occupancy energy use mechanisms , whether in energy codes ( known as Outcome-Based Codes ) or in policies applied to buildings after construction is complete . We acknowledge that there are significant procedural and legal issues with this approach that will have to be resolved ( e.g. , are inefficiencies due to poor design or inappropriate occupant behavior ? ) , but we believe that this could be the most effective way of regulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , outcome-based approaches carry the promise of supporting the steady reduction of prescriptive requirements in codes of the future . <h> TECHNOLOGY AND CODES <p> The increasing availability and dependability of solid-state lighting ( LEDs ) is leading to fundamental changes in lighting . Among other issues , use of LED lighting often eliminates existing lighting power density ( LPD ) requirements as an " upper boundary " on lighting power in a given space . As we embrace solid-state technology , energy codes must support : <p> Use of the best technology to solve given lighting problems , even if that technology is not LED-based ; that is , solid-state lighting is not a complete solution to all lighting energy issues ; <p> Where LPDs are required , they must be based on use of readily available technology and developed through a transparent , public , and technically defensible process ; <p> Energy codes are the most effective when they require use of the best available cost-effective technology , not when they require use of unproven technologies ; <p> No single technology can be a complete solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a complete solution for all lighting problems . <h> SYSTEMS APPROACHES IN ENERGY CODES <p> Across the globe , energy experts are recognizing the limits of device-based standards and requirements , and beginning to think in terms of systems . The challenge for energy codes is that the term " systems approach , " as it applies to buildings , is still poorly defined and not well understood . Such approaches offer the prospect of much greater efficiencies than have been achievable in the past , hence the need for rapid and careful research and development to make systems concepts operational and useful in the context of actual buildings , from design through operation . The IALD supports : <p> Research and development to clarify and make operational the meaning and value of " systems approaches " in designing and operating buildings ; <p> Development of commonly understood terminology relating to building systems ; <p> Energy code requirements that help bring design teams together to minimize energy use and maximize energy efficiency ; <p> Energy code requirements that reflect readily available and commonly used technological support for systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new code methods that will reduce building energy use without reducing lighting quality . Codes should never prevent good design , nor should they be the cause of poor design . New requirements should be based on sound data on building and human performance , and what is possible with known technologies . Proposed requirements should be tested using modeling and pilot studies before they are adopted . The goal of net-zero energy for buildings is achievable ; we will reach that goal by working cooperatively with the best of existing technology to help improve human comfort , health and productivity . @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883

Multi-layered techniques ranging from ambient lighting to accent , wash and feature lighting provide stores with ample choices to differentiate their brand , and highlight spaces or merchandise as needed . Sergio Padula , Technical Director at iGuzzini Middle East says : " From small shops to large commercial spaces , light is a powerful marketing element : it suggests , guides and prepares to purchase , converting stimulations into active behaviours . <p> " Lighting of a shop must enable both a general and detailed vision of the displayed goods , thus ensuring a faithful reproduction of chromatic ranges for the observer . Lighting for shops and commercial spaces aims not just to make the goods on sale appear at their best , enhancing their qualities , but also to create an environment in which shoppers can easily make choices and recognise the value of the brands on display . " <p> However , with the evolving market dynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighting philosophy , moving from just " illuminating spaces " to " how people see them . " Currently most lighting contractors are delivering an effective balance of the two components , where vibrancy of colours is not compromised and goes hand in hand with mood enhancement . Roger Sexton , VP Specifier Service at Xicato believes that the ability to create well-designed and sustainable space starts with an understanding of how people see and respond to light . <p> " Once we understand the nature of the desired light , we apply innovation and technology to design the right quality of light and then package it into modules that enable effective and efficient luminaires . We believe that with better light , shoppers will buy more , diners will enjoy their food more and guests will be happier and feel more comfortable . " <p> Xicato is a leading developer of superior light quality from LED modules and has set an entirely new aesthetic standard for LED lighting in professional and domestic settings . <p> Tejas Doshi , Co-Founder &amp; Chief Design Officer , Light &amp; Beyond agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reintroduce darkness into retail stores so customers feel comfortable and the staff is more aware . " Lighting is all about a feel good factor and not a looking good factor . Even the simplest of right lighting can create magic . " Light &amp; Beyond are leading lighting consultants with a portfolio of strategic projects across the globe including the UAE . <p> LED versus halogen <p> New LED technology has played an important role in the transformative shift in lighting design and philosophy , as well as the need for energy efficiency . Leading lighting brands such as Xicato have a range of LEDs covering a wide spectrum of colour rendering needs , while being energy efficient and " tunable , " thus equipped to replace the customary halogens in the retail space . <p> Mohammad Darwish , Technical manager at Tridonic Middle East FZE , says : " A few years back , manufacture of different colours of LEDs and maintaining their colours was a challenge . Today , though , using state of the art phosphors with the highest quantum efficiency is the norm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as excellent colour renderings with high efficacy are easily achievable . Because of this , LEDs are much better than halogen lamps , especially when it comes to power consumption and nominal lifetime hours . " <p> Tridonic , a 60 year old leading innovation driver on the lighting market and pioneer of the digital lighting control is now focusing its attention increasingly on LEDs as the technology of the future . <p> Padula from iGuzzini also believes colour LEDs are here to stay . " By now LEDs have reached a very high level of colour renderings on the various spectrums , and are able to fully replace halogen lamps . The new technologies , such as GaN on GaN ( Gallium Nitride on Gallium Nitride ) which has recently been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics , have optical transparency and high thermal and electrical conductivity , enabling a very robust , simple LED design that delivers maximum light output and performance can easily demonstrate this . " <p> Xicato , who has taken massive strides in the field of developing LEDs with a huge gamut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best in class natural colour rendering of halogen . Additional benefits of LEDs lie in cost of ownership such as energy efficiency and longevity , adds Roger Sexton from Xicato . <p> Some industry experts however have mixed reviews on the purported CRI ( Colour Rendering Index ; a scale from 0 to 100 that describes the degree of reality that the light source makes an object appear to the human eye ) of new colour LEDs . " Honestly its still difficult to beat halogen in terms of colour . LEDs are reaching there but are still not quite there yet . Also it has become difficult for us as lighting designers and consultants because every LED manufacturer has its own shade of 3000k , 4000k , 5500 k &amp; 6500 k , making it difficult for us to mix and match fixtures to achieve our concept , " says Doshi from Light &amp; Beyond . <p> Disadvantages of LEDs <p> While colour LED technology and usage is ramping up rapidly , some disadvantages and challenges still remain . In many applications , LEDs are being seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quick to point out that while the initial price is a disadvantage , this is dwarfed by the cost of ownership savings . <p> Padula from iGuzzini agrees that LEDs might appear expensive at the outset but the high initial cost of an LED-based system is offset by lower energy consumption and lower maintenance costs . " When comparing the lifespan of different technologies , we can see that halogen lamps will switch off first , then halide lamps followed by fluorescent lamps . LED lamps will be the last to switch off , gradually and not suddenly . Maintenance costs can be reduced or even eliminated with LEDs and their specifically designed power supplies . To evaluate the cost effectiveness of a LED solution with respect to a traditional solution , we must consider the efficiency of the entire system , and not of the lamp only : LED optical systems generally have a higher output than standard systems because they reduce the causes that generate efficiency losses , " Padula adds . <p> Mohammad Darwish from Tridonic points out some more complicated and technical disadvantages of LEDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general can be a bit tricky . Optimising the performance of LED lamps largely depends on the engineering behind the fixture , particularly its thermal management . Incorrectly managing the heat being generated by the diodes can cause deterioration of the LED chip itself . Overdriving the LED chip will result to overheating of the entire fixture , which causes failure . <p> " Over time and upon exposure to extreme temperature , the LEDs can shift colours and , eventually , not be able to achieve the CRI that they have been designed to achieve . This can eventually become a disadvantage , especially when you are using them for the purpose of retail and presentation . <p> Lastly , Darwish adds that LED lighting manufacturing still is n't regulated by any set standards , leading to a lot of new players with new " innovations " being present in the market who meet only the minimum energy efficiency requirements , and sometimes , even less than that of CFLs . However , despite the pitfalls , Darwish feels that " in terms of cost efficiency , ecolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LEDs are still the way to go , " adding that it " is foreseen that eventually even in fuel-rich countries , LEDs will be the norm when it comes to lighting requirements . " <p> Lighting trends &amp; future <p> The biggest trend indicated by industry experts is Smart Lighting , the natural fallout of the sustainability drive . " Smart lighting is the most important trend in lighting today i.e. adding connectivity and awareness to LED modules to maximise the retail experience and further minimise running costs , " says Xicatos Sexton . <p> Speaking about trends , Padula from iGuzzini highlights an increase in applications of dynamic light , not necessarily RGB but also the tunable white . Doshi from Light &amp; Beyond believes tunable LED lighting that can even simulate sunlight is a new trend to watch out for . He also feels OLED technology will provide a fresh twist to store and merchandise lighting . " OLED gives lots of flexibility and it is becoming cheaper day by day . OLED can be integrated in furniture and since its bendable we might see uniquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of interactive and dynamic lighting installations for window displays , " he adds . <p> LEDs are being touted as the technology of the future for the trail-blazing innovations in the field . The opportunity for LED fixtures to be used in merchandising has grown substantially with the development of white LEDs . Plus with various options for colour and CRI depending on the application , retailers can select a 4100K with a high CRI for best accentuating diamonds and jewellery , or 2900K LEDs and HICRI for leather and dark tone products . Powerful , flexible and easy to install , the excellent colour saturation of the new range of LEDs will make them perfect and long-staying partners for retail environments . <p> Neha Kaul - Grid Magazine , UAE . <p> The best lighting designs always spring from a well rooted concept or idea and have a defined narrative <h> Light Middle East Conference : 2014 <p> Light Middle East Conference hears how Expo 2020 can act as catalyst for bringing new lighting ideas to the world <p> The Middle East is one of the most light-polluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Dubai Expo 2020 acting as a catalyst for change , the region could show the world how to bring smart lighting to life , an industry expert has said today . <p> Tejas Doshi , co-founder &amp; chief design officer of Light &amp; Beyond , said with the help of lighting designers in every phase of construction projects , the Middle East can become a leader in embracing innovative lighting solutions that are better for the environment and improve everyday quality of life . <p> " With its mega tall structures , and never-ending skylines , the Middle East is one of the most light-polluted places in the world , " said Joshi .

@@10865651 @4065651/ <h> US DOE Report : Equating Color-Rendering Values and Perception <p> " Color Rendering " , DOE , USDOE <p> By Jim Brodrick , U.S. Department of Energy <p> Lighting designers have to choose sources that render the color of objects in accordance with peoples preferences , and to make intelligent tradeoffs between color quality and other attributes . But color preference varies from person to person and is affected by many things , such as age , culture , and application . IES TM-30-15 makes it relatively easy to quantify objective characteristics such as average color fidelity and average change in color saturation , using TM-30s Fidelity Index ( Rf ) and Gamut Index ( Rg ) , and also provides important measures that extend beyond average fidelity and average gamut area to provide information about specific hues . But it has n't  been clear how well this suite of measures corresponds to the preferences of end users in real-world applications . <p> A new study published in the journal Lighting Research and Technology and coauthored by several members of DOEs solid-state lighting team provides initial evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizing subjective visual perceptions . In turn , this opens doors for engineering and specifying light-source spectra with different color-rendering characteristics than are commonly available today . The researchers conducted an experiment to determine how subjective impressions of color quality depend upon the shifts the light source causes in the color appearance of objects . Each of 28 participants of varied age and gender evaluated 26 different lighting conditions in a room filled with objects that were selected to cover a range of hue , saturation , and lightness with illuminance ( 20 fc ) and chromaticity ( 3500 K , on the blackbody locus ) kept constant for all lighting conditions . <p> By itself , average fidelity especially CRI was found to be a weak predictor of human perception . Nine of the 12 most-liked products had a CRI = 73 , indicating that the common practice of using CRI = 80 as a cutoff point may exclude many preferred light sources . The findings also suggest that gamut shape ( the specific changes in color appearance across different hues ) is more important than average gamut area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In particular , a distinct preference for the increased saturation of reds was observed , which is the opposite of what occurs with most energy-efficient lighting on the market today . What 's more , CRI disproportionately penalizes increases in red saturation , due to underlying fundamentals of the calculation , which may have been a deterrent to the development of more-preferred sources in the past . <p> Its important to note that TM-30 is only a tool and is not a solution in and of itself . To be of maximum help when choosing a light source , it should be used in combination with other information e.g. , chromaticity , intensity , distribution , efficacy , and cost . But as this new research shows , better tools can aid in the development of new light sources that effectively balance all aspects of lighting quality and better fit the needs of a given application . @qwx157732 @qwx157730 @qwx157733 @qwx157787 @qwx157767 @qwx157870 @qwx157872 @qwx157883
