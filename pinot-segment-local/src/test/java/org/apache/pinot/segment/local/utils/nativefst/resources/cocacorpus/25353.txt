Courts sometimes refer to this starting point as the " accrual " of the " cause of action " ; its the moment at which the plaintiff has a basis to sue .

@@20558196 @558196/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Nevada Criminal Statutes of Limitations <p> How much time does the prosecution have to charge you in the Silver State ? <p> In the criminal justice system , statutes of limitations set the amount of time the government has to prosecute people . If the government does n't  file charges within the designated time period , the defendant can hold up the statute of limitations as a complete defense . <h> Setting Limits <p> Criminal statutes of limitations are designed to protect would-be defendants . Among the rationales are that its harder to defend oneself when a lot of time has passed and that its not fair to punish someone for behavior that happened a long time ago . <p> Limitation periods are usually longer for felonies than for misdemeanors . In many states , some crimesmost notably , murderdont have statutes of limitations . In other words , the government can charge someone with the offense no matter how long ago it allegedly happened . <h> Keeping Time <p> The limitations period typically starts to " run " the moment the alleged crime is complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , the prosecution would have three years from the date the defendant attacked the victim . <p> Determining the starting point for the limitations period can be trickier for crimes that span days , weeks , or longer . But the same general rule tends to applythat is , that the clock starts ticking once the crime has actually ended . Courts have held , for example , that a conspiracy ends for statute-of-limitations purposes at the point that the last " overt act " was committed . <p> The passing of a statute of limitations generally means that the potential defendant is in the clear . But some events " toll " or pausestatutes of limitations , giving the prosecution more time . For example , if the statute of limitations for a crime is five years and the suspect goes into hiding for a yearduring which the statute is tolledthe prosecution may well have six years from the date of the crime to prosecute . <h> Getting Help <p> Statutes of limitations can get knotty . Sometimes there 's a general limitations period for a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific period for a crime within that set . Or the statute of limitations could expire for one crime but leave the defendant open to prosecution for anotheror for prosecution in an entirely different jurisdiction . Not only that , but other timing issues can come into play in criminal casesfor instance , the right to a speedy trial . <p> Make sure to consult an experienced criminal defense attorney if you want to know about any timing issues that apply to your situation , including how to raise the statute-of-limitations defense . <h> Statutes of Limitations in Nevada <p> Below you 'll find statutes of limitations for several crimes in Nevada .

@@20558197 @558197/ <h> Can I Get Rid of Tax Debt in Bankruptcy ? <p> You 're looking at a tax bill wondering if you can get rid of it in bankruptcy . Well , can you ? In most cases , the answer is no . Tax debt is generally considered a " nondischargeable debt , " meaning that it does n't  go away in bankruptcy . While exceptions do exist , wiping out taxes is tough because you must first meet complicated criteria . <h> Bankruptcy Types <p> You might be able to discharge your tax debt , or at least make it more manageable , depending on the type of bankruptcy you file . Here are the two most common types of bankruptcy : <p> Chapter 7 . Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy quickly gets rid of all of your dischargeable debtssuch as unsecured credit card bills , personal loans , and medical billswithout requiring you to complete a lengthy repayment plan . To qualify for Chapter 7 , your income must fall below a certain threshold set by your state . <p> Chapter 13 . Chapter 13 helps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year payment plan . Any remaining dischargeable debt is wiped out once you successfully make all payments . <p> While exceptions do exist , wiping out taxes is tough because you must first meet complicated criteria . <h> Getting Rid of Income Taxes in Chapter 7 <p> Discharging your income tax debt in Chapter 7 does n't  happen every day , but it is possible . For example , one way to win the tax-discharge lottery is to meet the following criteria : <p> You must have filed your tax return on time . <p> Your tax return must be accurate . If the taxing agency finds an error after the fact , you will be disqualified from seeking a discharge . <p> You must time the bankruptcy correctly . For example , you must wait to file for bankruptcy more than three years after your taxes were originally due . <p> Bankruptcy and tax law are complex areas . Its a good idea to explore your tax options with a knowledgeable attorney ( and possibly an accountant ) as soon as possible . <h> Paying Off Your Income Taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tax debt by filing for Chapter 7 , get used to the idea that you 're stuck paying your entire tax bill ( unless you do an offer in compromise asking for a reduction ) . While Chapter 13 can help , its power is limited to easing the sticker shock of a large monthly payment . <p> For example , if you cant negotiate a payment plan with the taxing agency or if you 've already messed up your existing payment plan , you have another option . By filing for Chapter 13 , you can force the taxing agency to accept payments . The catch is that you 're required to pay the entire amount you owe over either a three or five year payment plan , depending on your other debts , your income , and the amount of property you 're keeping . So while there is a chance your monthly payment will be reasonable , it could still be higher than what you can afford , especially if you have a particularly large tax bill .

When the entire home is a shambles or if all the bathrooms are damaged and not functional , the determination is more obvious .

@@20558200 @558200/ <h> Death during the Commission of a Felony <p> The felony murder rule elevates killings that occur during the commission of a felony to murders . Several limitations apply to this old and arguably unnecessary theory . <p> " A death that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of any felony constitutes murder " is the classic definition of the felony murder doctrine . This doctrine has been roundly criticized and narrowed by commentators and legislators , yet it still exists in some form or other in nearly all states . Modern statutes make it first-degree murder when the death occurs during very serious , specified felonies , such as rape , robbery , burglary , and arson . Deaths occurring during the commission of all other felonies become second-degree murder . <h> Unintentional Death <p> The rule applies whether the felon kills intentionally , recklessly , or even accidentally ; and even when the death was unforeseeable . For example , a robber whose gun discharges by mistake , killing a bystander , can be charged with felony murder . And , a killing by a codefendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two robbers kills a victim , then is himself killed the surviving partner can be charged with felony murder . <p> As these examples illustrate , a perpetrator can end-up charged with murder in the most attenuated circumstances . The problem here is that normally , first-degree murder requires that the prosecutor prove that the defendant intended the death and had a state of mind called " malice . " Broadly speaking , malice is evidence of a " depraved heart , " or an evil state of mind . Prosecutors get around the malice requirement by arguing that the intention that propelled the underlying felony constituted " implied malice . " <h> The Rationale Behind the Felony Murder Rule <p> Several theories attempt to justify the felony murder rule , though they find little support in legal scholarship . The most common one is to claim that the felony murder rule deters crime.This theory argues that if would-be felons realized that theyll face murder charges if an accidental death happens during the offense , these folks will re-think their crime plans ( or at least commit their offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  support this argument ( how does one deter an unintended act ? ) . And , no empirical data supports this argument . <h> Limits on the Rule : All Felonies ? <p> As noted earlier , modern laws differentiate between inherently dangerous , serious felonies , and all others . First-degree murder applies to deaths occurring in the former group , second-degree to those in the latter . <p> Some courts identify " inherently dangerous " crimes by analyzing them in the abstract , and asking whether by their very nature , there 's a substantial likelihood that a killing will result . Other courts examine the facts of the individual cases before them , and decide on a case-by-case basis whether , given the circumstances and the defendants conduct , the death should be considered first- or second-degree murder . <h> Limits on the Rule : No Bootstrapping <p> Courts in many states will not allow prosecutors to charge felony murder when the underlying felony is part of , or depends on , the killing . For example , imagine a husband who discovers his wife in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normally , the husband would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter ( an intentional killing done in the heat of passion ) , a felony . But because a death occurred during the commission of a felony ( the manslaughter ) , might the prosecutor now charge murder ? If that were allowed , the crime of voluntary manslaughter would disappear , which is not a result that the legislature or the courts intended . <h> Limits on the Rule : When Must the Death Occur ? <p> The felony murder rule typically has a time and distance limit . The time period generally begins when the accuseds actions have progressed at least to the point where he could be charged with an attempt at the crime , and it lasts until the perpetrator has reached a place of apparent safety . So , for example , someone killed while the criminal makes his getaway would expose the criminal to the felony murder rule . Importantly , the time component is marked by when the killing occurs , not when death occurs . For example , felony murder could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident but lingers for ten days , long after the crime is over , before succumbing to her injuries . Her assailant could be charged with felony murder . <h> Limits on the Rule : When Non-Felons Kill <p> Targets of assaults , robberies , and other crimes very often fight back , sometimes with weapons and with resulting homicides . What role should the felony murder rule play when , for example , a victim shoots back and kills one of multiple assailants , or accidentally kills a bystander ? May surviving assailants be charged under the felony murder rule for these deaths ? <p> These deaths certainly occurred during the commission of a felony but they did not occur in furtherance of it , which is the limiting consideration that many courts will apply to scenarios like this . Courts that adopt this approach will apply it to a killing committed by a policeman or a bystander , too , and will not allow a charge of felony murder . But notice that this limit applies only to non-felons . When an accomplice of the defendant does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant , who becomes responsible for the agents acts . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> My partner died when our meth lab blew up .

@@20558202 @558202/ <h> When Can an Attorney Withdraw in the Middle of a Case ? <p> You have the right to fire your attorney in the middle of your case , but the attorney ca n't simply quit without a good reason . <p> When an attorney withdraws in the middle of a client 's case , that withdrawal is usually categorized as either " mandatory " or " voluntary . " In this article , we 'll explain the difference between these two processes , along with some examples of each . Keep in mind that with either type of withdrawal , the attorney usually needs to ask for and obtain the court 's permission before ending representation of one of the parties in a civil lawsuit in the middle of the case . <h> An Attorney 's Mandatory Withdrawal <p> If the circumstances require that the attorney withdraw from representation , the withdrawal is considered mandatory . Situations that could give rise to an attorney 's mandatory withdrawal from a case include : <p> the attorney is not competent to continue the representation <p> the attorney becomes a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney discovers that the client is using his services to advance a criminal enterprise <p> the client is insisting on pursuit of a frivolous position in the case <p> the attorney has a conflict of interest or can not otherwise continue representation without violating the rules of professional conduct , and <h> An Attorney 's Voluntary Withdrawal <p> Where the circumstances permit , but do not require , the attorney to cease representation , the withdrawal is considered voluntary.The circumstances under which an attorney may withdraw mid-case include : <p> the client is refusing to pay the attorney for his or her services in violation of their fee agreement <p> the client is refusing to follow the attorney 's advice <p> the client is engaged in fraudulent conduct , and <p> there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that prevents the attorney from effectively representing the client in the case . <p> Even where withdrawal is mandatory , an attorney must first seek and obtain the court 's permission before ending representation in the middle of a case . And , in most situations where the withdrawal request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable amount of time to find new counsel . <h> Getting the Court 's Permission to Withdraw <p> Even where withdrawal is mandatory , an attorney must first seek and obtain the court 's permission before ending representation in the middle of a case . <p> While a court will usually be sympathetic to the plight of an attorney faced with circumstances requiring or permitting withdrawal , permission to immediately withdraw may not be granted if : <p> the facts giving rise to the withdrawal request are in dispute , or <p> withdrawal would materially prejudice the client 's ability to litigate the case . <p> In such circumstances , the court might hold an evidentiary hearing on the disputed factual issues before making a ruling on the attorney 's withdrawal request . And , in most situations where the withdrawal request is granted , the court will give the client a reasonable amount of time to find new counsel . <p> Once an attorney has received court permission to withdraw from the representation , the attorney must return all of the client 's property in his or her possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees or retainers . The attorney must cooperate with the client 's new counsel and must hand the client 's complete file over as directed . <p> An attorney who has withdrawn from representation has a continuing professional obligation to maintain the confidentiality of all matters within the attorney-client relationship , so for example the attorney can not become a witness for the client 's opponent in the case on matters falling within the scope of the attorney-client privilege . This obligation arises from the rules of professional responsibility that govern the duties of attorneys to current and former clients , and a violation of these rules can result in disciplinary action against the attorney , up to and including disbarment.

If you do n't have a will and are reading this , make one now . Knowing more about wills can help you start the process . <h> Formal Wills <p> In every state , you can make a will by typing out your wishes and signing the document yourself , along with two witnesses . There are very few other requirements to make your will valid you just need to be of sound mind and ( in most states ) at least 18 years old . Other than that , no official language or legalese is necessary . Just state your wishes clearly . You can use your formal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardians for children , and forgive debts . <h> Handwritten Wills <p> About half of the states recognize handwritten wills , also called holographic wills . A holographic will must be in your own handwriting , and it does n't  have to be witnessed . Although this might sound easier , holographic wills can cause problems after you die because the court will have to decipher and verify your handwriting . This can cause hassles for your family . Also , if you want to make a will of any significant length or complexity , it will be much easier to make a formal will on a computer , using software , or with a lawyers help . <p> That said , if you are in a pickle and need a will fast , by all means write your wishes down in a handwritten will . In many cases , a handwritten will is better than no will at all . However , if you have the means and opportunity , make a formal typed will it will result in a more robust , precise , and easily probated document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few states and under very limited circumstances . They usually require a present of fear of death and they can be used only to distribute personal property . Oral wills are unusual and uncertain . If you are planning to make a will , do not plan to make an oral will on your death bed . Instead , take some time to make a formal will . <h> Joint and Mutual Wills <p> A joint will distributes the property of two or more people , usually a married couple . Joint wills determine what will happen to the couples property after one spouse dies , and also what will happen to the property after the second spouse dies . lthough it may seem convenient to a couple to make just one will , joint wills can cause problems for the surviving spouse because it ties up property and restricts what he or she can do with it , forever . For example , if a couple makes a joint will and the husband dies in his forties , the wife may live another 40 or more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will made earlier in her life . Joint wills are best used ( if at all ) by couples who have children in common and who want to ensure that property will go to those kids ( instead of a subsequent spouse or child ) . But there are better ways to do this , like using childrens trusts . <p> Instead of making a joint will , consider making mutual wills ( also called reciprocal or mirror wills ) . Mutual wills are two separate wills that are close mirrors of each other . They allow couples to " leave everything to each other " and any number of other similar wishes , but because each person has his or her own will , he or she is free to change it as needed after the first spouse dies . <h> Conditional and Contingent Wills <p> Conditional wills only go into effect when a certain act or condition happens . This means something other than the person who wrote the will 's death . This could be a future event not closely related to writing the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brewster 's Millions , " Richard Pryor only inherited after spending millions to learn how to appreciate money . This is an extreme example , but strange conditions have been know to apply . You need a lawyer to draft this type of will . <p> If you 're in a pinch or have very simple wishes , a statutory will can work well for you . However , these wills are not very flexible and you may not be able to tailor them to your needs . <h> Statutory Wills <p> A statutory will is one that contains standard terms provided by state law . These state laws were created to allow people to make their own standard will that will be easily recognized and probated . Statutory forms can normally made without a lawyer by using the states fill in the blank forms . A few states have mandatory provisions considered part of the statutory will . In these states , the standard terms are implied , even if they were n't explicitly written in the will . <p> If you 're in a pinch or have very simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , these wills are not very flexible and you may not be able to tailor them to your needs . <h> Codicils <p> A codicil is an amendment to an existing will . You can use a codicil to add , delete , or change the terms of your will . Codicils are best for simple and few changes . The more changes you want to make -- or the more complicated your changes -- the more you should consider making an entirely new will , rather than relying on a codicil . <p> A codicil must be witnessed and signed just like the original will . <h> A Lawyer Can Help <p> While you can make your will yourself using good self-help products , if you have a complicated situation , if you want to impose controls on property after your death , or if you just want to have a professional take into account your individual circumstances , see an estate planning lawyer .

@@20558207 @558207/ <h> What is the Florida Statute of Limitations for Medical Malpractice Lawsuits ? <p> Compliance with Florida 's filing deadline for medical malpractice cases could mean the difference between getting fair compensation for a medical error , and walking away with nothing . <p> If you are thinking about making a medical malpractice claim against a healthcare provider in Florida , just as in every other state , it 's crucial to understand the statute of limitations and how it applies to your case . <p> First , a little background : A potential plaintiffs right to file a lawsuit in civil court is subject to the statute of limitations , which sets a time limit ( expressed in years ) on the ability to have the court consider a civil case . These time limits vary depending on the type of case being brought . Like a number of other states , Florida has a specific statute of limitations that applies to medical malpractice lawsuits , and you can read the full text of this law at Florida Statutes section 95.11(4) ( b ) . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical malpractice lawsuit must be filed : <p> within two years of the time the malpractice allegedly occurred , or <p> within two years of when the malpractice is discovered ( " or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence " ) . <p> So , once you learn that you 've been injured by a health care providers carelessness in Florida ( or once the situation is such that you should have learned about it ) , the clock starts ticking on a two-year deadline to get your lawsuit filed in court . <p> Finally , section 95.11(4) ( b ) sets an over-arching four-year deadline for most medical malpractice lawsuits , meaning that regardless of when the underlying malpractice was discovered , if it occurred more than four years before the lawsuit was filed , the case is barred under the statute of limitations . <p> There are a few exceptions that will pause ( or " toll , " in legalese ) the running of the statute of limitations " clock " for a Florida medical malpractice case . These include cases where fraud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from discovering the healthcare provider 's wrongdoing . <p> It 's important to note that complying with the statute of limitations only means getting the lawsuit started . You might still be receiving medical treatment in connection with the alleged malpractice , and you might not have taken significant steps to build your case ( although you 'll need to have made a " reasonable investigation " into the merits of the case to comply with Florida law ; more on this requirement later ) . <p> At this point you 're probably wondering what happens if you miss the filing deadline set by the statute of limitations . In most situations , you lose your right to file a lawsuit over the alleged malpractice . That can result in some pretty harsh consequences , especially for patients who have suffered significant harm as a result of a medical mistake . <p> There are a few exceptions that will pause ( or " toll , " in legalese ) the running of the statute of limitations " clock " for a Florida medical malpractice case .

You might not need to if you are " judgment-proof , " which means that creditors could n't collect from you even if they tried every legal way to do so .

@@20558213 @558213/ <h> Some Pointers about the Assumption of Risk Doctrine in New York <p> A plaintiff must always prove the existence of and connection between 1 ) a defendants liability or responsibility for a negligent action or condition and 2 ) the plaintiffs resultant damages ( injuries resulting from said negligence ) in any negligence case . The Assumption of Risk Doctrine is typically asserted by the defendant to minimize or else wholly negate the plaintiffs claim that the defendant is liable for the plaintiffs injuries . Essentially , the doctrine serves to evaluate the level of the duty of care owed to the plaintiff by the defendant . This defense , at its core , asserts that the plaintiff knew of a dangerous condition or some act of negligence on the part of the defendant and , nevertheless , voluntarily exposed himself to that condition . The Assumption of Risk Doctrine therefore affects the liability portion of the two-pronged argument . <p> If the defendant asserts that you assumed the risk of your injuries ( and it is likely that they will ) , then , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on your case : <p> The court will reject the defendants argument , and liability will continue to be determined by a jury according to comparative negligence . <p> The court will uphold the argument , and you will be entirely barred from recovery because the defendants liability would be reduced to zero . <p> The court will partially uphold the argument , and your recovery will then be limited by whatever level of comparative negligence is assigned to both you and the defendant . <p> It is important to understand that Assumption of Risk and Comparative Negligence are two different factors that both affect the liability prong of your case . If the defendant successfully proves that you totally assumed the risk of injuries , then it means that the defendant never owed a duty of care to you and is not liable for your injuries . If , on the other hand , the defense fails to prove that you assumed the risk of injuries , then liability would be apportioned based on whatever level of negligence you and the defendant both contributed in bringing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not likely make the distinction , the Assumption of Risk Doctrine can be categorized into three distinct categories : Primary , Express , and Implied Assumption of Risk . Unfortunately , there is a high degree of confusion and uncertainty about what types of situations and actions fit into which category . The result is a highly individualized determination of each case wherein the court considers the merits of the doctrine as a defense in light of the actions and characteristics of each plaintiff . As you will see , the courts in New York have generally upheld the application of the doctrine to cases involving athletic activities . <p> Primary Assumption of Risk <p> The most clear-cut of the three categories is Primary Assumption of Risk . This doctrine will most likely apply to you and completely bar you from any recovery if you are , among other things : an athlete who broke your foot playing your sport or a veterinarian who was bitten severely by a dog you were treating . In Primary Assumption of Risk , the court assumes that you fully comprehend the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to any reasonable individual . If you are an athlete in a contact sport , for example , your experience and knowledge of the game should have alerted you to the risk of being injured while playing . As a veterinarian , it stands to reason that you might at one time or another be bitten or scratched by a distressed animal . <p> In these types of situations , the court has recognized that the activity would be fundamentally altered if the risks involved were eliminated . Primary Assumption of Risk is therefore used to protect these activities from being diluted by frivolous litigation . If every football player who sustained an injury could sue their coach or the stadium or the person who tackled them , then football would no longer be the violent , rough and tumble , breathless , cringe-worthy game that we Americans know and love . If veterinarians could sue the owner of any pet who bit or scratched them while being given a shot or having a broken bone set , then we can imagine that the level of care provided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing their pets to the vet as often as they should . This idea is perfectly captured in the official legal terminology used to describe the Assumption of Risk Doctrine Volenti Non Fit Injuria translates from Latin to mean " to a willing person , injury is not done . " <p> The point of the doctrine of Primary Assumption of Risk is ultimately to protect those activities in which the risk of bodily injury or harm is integral to the fundamental nature of the activity . Again , if the court upholds the primary assumption of risk doctrine in your case , you will be completely barred from any recovery , regardless of the damages you sustained , because the defendant did not owe you a duty of care . <p> Primary Assumption of Risk also comes into play when a plaintiff engages in exceedingly reckless behavior that goes beyond the normal scope of behavior associated with that activity . For example , if you are dancing on top of the bar at your local club and you decide to give crowd-surfing a try , the club is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a club and you slipped on the stairs because someone spilled a drink , then primary assumption of risk would most likely not apply to your case . <p> Express Agreements <p> In line with the doctrine of Primary Assumption of Risk , the courts also recognize Express Agreements as a valid element in an assumption of risk defense . These are written contracts or liability releases and waivers on which you sign your name and explicitly agree to release the defendant from any obligation of care to you . These documents typically bear the familiar language in very small print regarding " risk of serious injury and/or death . " Examples would include many health club membership policies , lift tickets at a ski resort , or a kayak rental agreement . <p> The validity of express agreements varies from state to state . In New York , for example , the New York General Obligations Law ( GOL ) 5-326 generally regards any release and waiver agreement as void and against public policy if the owner or operator of a facility receives a fee for recreational use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary in the courts . For example , a health clubs waiver may not be legally effective in asserting an assumption of risk defense , but an instructional clubswaiver may be considered valid because the latter involves non-recreational use of the facility . Again , the courts understandings of the validity of express agreements varies from state to state . If you signed a liability release or waiver and sustained an injury at that facility , you should consult an attorney in your state to determine whether you will have standing to sue . <p> There are several other grounds on which an express agreement can be invalidated by the courts . One common assertion that a plaintiff could make is that he did not understand the terms of the agreement . That point is only valid if the court agrees that a " reasonable person " could not have understood the terms . A second limitation of waivers is that they must validly apply to the specific misconduct of the defendant . For example , a kayak rental agreement can not absolve the rental company from the duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , if you decide to go skydiving and your instructor lands awkwardly , causing you to twist your ankle , then the liability waiver you signed before getting in the plane would most likely serve to uphold the primary assumption of risk defense and bar you completely from recovering any damages . <p> Secondary or Implied Assumption of Risk <p> If an express agreement is deemed invalid by the court or if one simply does n't  exist , a defendant can still assert that the plaintiff assumed the risk of his injuries via the doctrine of Secondary or Implied Assumption of Risk . Implied assumption applies to the majority of cases , where the plaintiffs consent to assume risk is implied from the conduct of the plaintiff under the circumstances , in other words , when a plaintiff voluntarily enters into a relationship with the defendant in which the defendants misconduct or the risk of injury is apparent . Examples would be spectators at sporting events or standing in the pit at a music festival or concert . If you 're at a baseball game , there is a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise , if you 're standing in a crowd at a music festival , you understand the inherent risk of injury if the crowd surges and you get knocked down . These are cases in which the risks of injury can not be eliminated by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the defendant . <p> The implied assumption of risk doctrine is not necessarily a complete bar to the recovery of damages , nor does its rejection render the defendant fully liable for whatever damages the plaintiff sustained . The assumption of risk doctrine must always be considered within the framework of comparative negligence , which delineates the amount of negligence demonstrated by the plaintiff and defendant , respectively . <p> Proving an Assumption of Risk Defense <p> Generally , there are two key factors that the defense must prove in asserting its theory that the plaintiff assumed the risk of his injuries , without which the doctrine will not apply . These conditions are subjective and will be tailored to fit the particular situation and plaintiff in each case . <p> First , the plaintiff must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comprehend and appreciate the danger posed by whatever condition or activity he encountered . Three factors contribute to a plaintiffs ability to comprehend the risks associated with an activity or condition : <p> Age : You must be of sufficient mental capacity to appreciate the dangers presented . Minors can assume the risk of their activities , as long as they demonstrably have the capacity to understand the existence and consequences of those risks ; however , an eight year-olds ability to understand the risks associated with his actions will necessarily be different from an adults ability to understand those risks , and the courts will take these differences into consideration . <p> Lack of Information : Warnings , safety briefings , signs , and liability waivers can all be considered appropriate provision of information regarding the risks involved in an activity or venture . <p> Experience : A person who sustained an injury because he was n't wearing a mouth guard during his first practice may not have assumed the risk of his injuries if his coach did not inform him that mouth guards are a necessary piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , would presumably know the risks associated with not wearing a mouth guard and would have assumed those risks in deciding to practice without one . <p> Relatedly , if you failed to exercise ordinary care to discover the danger in a situation or activity , it does not mean that you assumed the risk of your injuries . It only means that your own negligence contributed to the injuries you sustained . <p> The second element that the defendant must prove in claiming an assumption of risk defense is that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of his injuries in taking part in the activity or situation . A plaintiff with no other course of action has not consented to assume the risk of injuries or harm that comes about as the result of a dangerous or defective condition . For example , if you are forced to walk up and down an icy set of stairs to enter and exit your apartment building because there is only one entrance to the building , then if you fall on the stairs and break your arm you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injuries . <p> The Assumption of Risk Doctrine is also inapplicable in state Workers Compensation and Federal Employers Liability cases because , presumably , workers and employees who sustained an injury due to dangerous or hazardous working conditions were compelled to work in those conditions and did not have a choice in the matter . This Doctrine of Inherent Compulsion theory can be proved by the plaintiff if he can demonstrate a direct order by a superior to participate in the dangerous situation or activity and a subsequent impulsion to comply with the direction caused by economic necessity or another compelling circumstance . <p> Case Law Example <p> To put everything together , consider the example of a child who is injured while at school . Generally , schools owe a duty of care to their students equivalent to that of a parent of ordinary caution only when the students are engaged in compulsory activities such as gym class . When students are , on the other hand , engaged in voluntary activities after school sports programs , for example schools have a much reduced duty of ordinary reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who was injured at school , schools are generally only considered liable for those injuries that foreseeably could have been caused by a lack of supervision of the child during particular activities or situations . <p> In early 2009 , the New York Supreme Court ruled in Trupia v. Lake George Cent . School District that the Primary Assumption of Risk Doctrine is not a valid defense in situations of " horseplay " and " frolic . " The case involved a young student who slid down a bannister in the hallway during a break in his summer school program . He fell off the bannister and sustained a skull fracture and a brain injury . Critics of the decision asked why the jury should not be allowed to determine whether or not the child primarily assumed the risk of his injuries by engaging in exceedingly reckless behavior . The Court held that the Primary Assumption of Risk Doctrine should only be used to encourage participation in sports and other recreational activities in which risks can not be eliminated without fundamentally altering the nature of the activity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Primary Assumption of Risk would leave schools with little to no incentive to adequately supervise their young students who normally and predictably act impulsively without regard to negative consequences . The Court recognized that just because a student engages in reckless and potentially stupid behavior does not mean that he assumed the risk of his injuries and absolved the school faculty of the duty of care owed to him . This decision has since effectively limited the use of the Assumption of Risk Doctrine as a defense primarily to cases in which plaintiffs sustained injuries as a result of recreational athletic activities . <p> The Trupia case reflects the subtle difference between considering a plaintiff totally negligent in causing his injuries and saying that a plaintiff primarily assumed the risk of his injuries . In this case , the student may not have had sufficient knowledge or mental capacity to fully comprehend and assume the risk of his behavior ; however , it did not then mean that the school was wholly or even partially negligent in supervising him . It was left up to the jury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case , and the jury was free to assign anywhere between whole and partial liability to either party . <p> If you were injured the first thing you should do is seek all the necessary and appropriate medical attention needed to help you achieve a full recovery .

It means much more , though . To make sure crime does n't pay at all , practically every state has some sort of law for taking the profits of crime out of the defendant 's pocket , often making sure it never reaches his pocket to begin with . These are usually called " Son of Sam " laws , and they 're designed to make sure defendants ca n't cash- in- on their crime's- fame or notoriety . <h> Some History <p> In the late 1970s , David Berkowitz went on a killing spree in New York City. - In a year , he killed seven and wounded several others , mostly women .

Some state laws- generally define- " profit from crime . " For example , a law may state it 's " any property obtained through or income generated from the commission of a crime .

In some states , only the criminal defendant is covered . In other states , members of his family are covered , too . They may be related by blood or- by " affinity " or kinship , such as a spouse or father-in-law . The idea is to make sure a family member does n't get the money and hold it for the defendant . <p> Payment . Most states require the person paying the defendant - the book publisher , movie producer , etc. - to pay the money directly to a court or special state agency , like the state 's Crime Victims Assistance agency . The money is held in a special account for the crime 's victims . <p> Getting the money to the victims . In most states , once money is deposited , the court or the state agency in charge of the money will notifies victims the money is available . In other states , the person or company paying the defendant- must notify victims. - Either- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legal notices " in local newspapers where the crime was committed . It 's also possible the names of specific victims may be found in the court records- connected to- the case , and those victims may get personal notification , such as- by mail . <p> Once notified , victims usually have to file a civil ( or " non-criminal " ) lawsuit to claim any portion of the money . There 's a time limit or " statute of limitations . " This time limit varies from state to state , but it 's usually three or five years from the date notifications were sent or published . In some states , victims may be contacted directly by the court or state agency holding the funds and given instructions on how to file a claim for money from the fund . <p> Excess money .

@@20558234 @558234/ <h> Ignorance of the Law May Be an Excuse <p> Most people are familiar with the legal principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse . This age-old rule prevents individuals from avoiding prosecution by claiming that they did not know their conduct was illegal . In most casessuch as murder , theft , assault , and arsonit is obvious why defendants should not be able to claim ignorance as a defense . But ignorance can , under certain limited circumstances , provide a viable defense to a criminal charge . <p> Let 's look at those circumstances more closely . <h> The Need for Public Notice <p> State and federal governments can not pass secret criminal laws and then prosecute an unwary offender . ( This only happens in totalitarian regimes and in the novels of Franz Kafka . ) Criminal laws must be enacted through a public process in the state or federal legislatures , and those laws must be published in accessible places such as official volumes containing the penal code , or on a government website . <p> Sometimes the law criminalizes behavior that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be okay to park along the shoulder of a particular highway , but in some stretches , the highway department posts " No Parking " signs to alert drivers that here , no parking is allowed . These signs give fair warning ; without them , drivers can not be expected to know the rule , and would have a good defense if they are ticketed . <p> Because our government has long-established procedures for making laws known , insufficient public notice is rarely an available defense . However , where defendants are charged with violating a brand new law that criminalizes behavior that is perfectly lawful in other places , those individuals may be able to assert their ignorance as a defense . The availability of the defense , however , will turn not only on a defendants lack of knowledge and the governments lack of notice , but also on the particular wording of the criminal law in issue . <h> Specific Intent Crimes <p> Criminal statutes often require a defendant to have a particular state of mind . Some crimes , such as statutory rape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the offender thought . Other crimes require a defendant to have acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others . For example , a reckless state of mind might be required for a charge of involuntary manslaughter . Where , however , criminal laws require that a defendant must have acted " willfully " when violating the law , a defendant unaware of the legal prohibition may be able to claim ignorance as a defense to the charge . <p> For example , consider a law that requires a business owner to file a certain tax form related to the business . The law says that willfully failing to do so is an offense . In this situation , the owners ignorance of the filing requirement might well be a good defense . In fact , it would be the prosecutors burden to prove willfulness in demonstrating that the owner purposefully avoided filing the tax form . <p> Sometimes , however , " willfulness " relates only to the defendants state of mind during the commission of the actas the case may be with crimes like witness tampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the applicable criminal law . ( For example , a defendant might have no idea that contacting and conversing with an adverse witness can be a criminal act ; but that is no excuse if the prosecution can show that the conversations affected the witness . ) Your attorney will be able to advise you on whether a willfulness requirement in the charge in your case might allow for a defense of ignorance . <p> Do n't  Stay in the Dark on Purpose <p> Keep in mind that you can not purposefully avoid learning applicable criminal laws and then take advantage of your ignorance as a defense . If a prosecutor can demonstrate that you " consciously avoided " knowledge of relevant criminal provisions , a judge at trial would instruct the jury that it should treat you as if you were fully aware of the legal consequences of your conduct . For example , if you opened a restaurant and a health inspector gave you a booklet containing the states new health laws for food service providerswhich you never bothered to readyou would not likely be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booklet during a subsequent prosecution . <p> In any criminal matter , defense counsel should be able to advise you early on whether the defense of ignorance of the law will be available .

It may , however , be something your lawyer can highlight as a favorable ( mitigating ) factor at sentencing , should the case get that far .

This right comes from the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . <p> During various Congressional debates about immigration reform , there has been talk about eliminating or changing this right . In 2010 , for example , some senators publicly announced their opinions that the Fourteenth Amendment needs to be amended .

@@20558243 @558243/ <h> The Process of Buying or Selling a Small Business <p> Understand the process for negotiating and buying or selling an incorporated small business . <p> Generally , the purchase or sale of an incorporated small business will be in the form of either : <p> an asset purchase , where the buyer purchases some or all of the seller 's assets . This transaction is often favored by buyers because you get the assets , like equipment and inventory , without taking on the seller 's debts and liabilities . <p> a stock purchase , where the buyer purchases all or most of the seller 's stock and " steps into the shoes " of the seller .

This usually involves an extensive review of the seller 's finances and assets so the buyer can make its own determination regarding value . How much due diligence the buyer does will depend in part on whether it 's a stock or an asset sale . More due diligence is required in a stock purchase since in addition to assets , the buyer is also taking on the seller 's debts and liabilities . <p> The parties should discuss and determine other matters at this time , including : <p> if shareholder or board of directors ' approval is required <p> whether any government or other third-party documents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title documents ) <p> if any contracts require third-party approval before the buyer can take them over ( like leases or loan agreements ) . <p> Other issues may come up at this stage like whether any key employees of the seller will be retained by the buyer and , if so , how that will be handled . <p> Parties often enter into a letter of intent during this time to show that they are serious about the deal . It helps make sure that you do n't waste time and money performing due diligence and negotiating a formal agreement . These letters are nonbinding in the sense that you usually ca n't force one party to buy or sell based upon a letter of intent . Nevertheless , you can make parts of the letter enforceable and it 's usually a good idea to do so .

These occur if at least 50% of the total interest in partnership capital and profits is sold or exchanged within a 12-month period , including a sale or exchange to another partner . Such terminations are merely technical because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not dissolved . The partnership technically ends for tax purposes , but a new partnership for tax purposes immediately begins . This new partnership automatically takes over all the old partnerships assets and liabilities which are immediately distributed to the partners in the old partnership .

However , a technical termination of a partnership can result in loss of favorable real estate depreciation and tax accounting methods .

The appellant has the burden of persuading the appellate court that the trial court committed an- error. - Standards of review are the principles used by the appellate court to review the- trial court 's judgment . <h> Sufficiency of the Evidence <p> The appellate court reviews the trial court 's judgment to determine whether the evidence in the record is strong enough- to support the judgment . If the trial court 's judgment was in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appellate court looks at- whether- the evidence , if believed , would convince the average person- that the plaintiff proved his/her case by a preponderance of the evidence . On appeal , the reviewing court does not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility ( believability ) of witnesses .

The appellate court has the duty to weigh the evidence and determine whether the findings of the trial court were so against the weight of the evidence as to require a reversal and a retrial .

Generally , - a judge's- division of marital debt will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is- a clear showing- that the judge acted way out of line. - <h> Plain Error <p> The plain error standard of review permits the appellate court to review errors that were not objected to at trial if such errors are extremely unjust or unfair. - Plain error is limited to error that is evident , obvious , and clear . To establish plain error based- on wrongly allowed- evidence , there must be apparent prejudice to the criminal defendant .

@@20558262 @558262/ <h> What is " Informed Consent " in a Medical Malpractice Case <p> Updated by David Goguen , J.D. , University of San Francisco School of Law <p> Patients have a legal right to be advised of key risks associated with a proposed medical procedure , and a doctor 's failure to adequately inform the patient can form the basis of a medical malpractice case . <p> Before performing any kind of planned medical procedure or going forward with a course of treatment , a doctor is legally obligated to obtain the patient 's " informed consent " to what will be done . Failure to obtain this consent can lead to a viable medical malpractice claim if the patient ends up suffering harm in connection with the underlying treatment . Read on for an explanation of what constitutes " informed consent " and key legal issues that relate to it . <p> Without the benefit of all essential information related to a medical procedure , especially the risks , a patient ca n't make an educated decision about whether to go forward with the proposed treatment . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent " is actually a process in which , ideally , both the doctor and patient take an active role . It 's the doctor 's responsibility to provide all essential information to the patient regarding a proposed procedure or treatment , including : <p> a description of the procedure or treatment <p> the purpose of the procedure or treatment , including desired outcome <p> an explanation of the key risks and potential complications involved <p> an explanation of any alternative treatments or procedures ( and the risks and complications of those alternatives ) , and <p> the likelihood of the procedure 's success . <p> The patient should be given the opportunity to ask the doctor follow-up questions , and adequate time to consider the discussion and make a reasoned decision . <p> The logic behind the requirement of informed consent goes something like this : Without the benefit of all essential information related to a medical procedure , especially the risks , a patient ca n't make an educated decision about whether to go forward with the proposed treatment . <p> It should also be noted that having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean your doctor ( or the hospital ) ca n't be liable for malpractice ( more on this later ) . <p> Different states assess informed consent differently when it comes to the risks that must be disclosed and discussed .

Your doctor ca n't do more than what you 've consented to . Certainly , a surgeon may take reasonable actions during surgery when something unexpected happens and the patient 's health is at risk . But , absent a medical necessity or emergency , your doctor ca n't presume you would have agreed to a different or additional treatment . <h> When Informed Consent Is n't Necessary <p> Informed consent may not be necessary : <p> in emergency situations , especially when the patient is unconscious and treatment is medically necessary in order to save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as reflex testing or listening to the patient 's heartbeat with a stethoscope . <h> Lack of Informed Consent Can Amount to Malpractice <p> Proving your doctor did n't comply with " informed consent " requirements is n't enough to win a medical malpractice lawsuit . There must be a connection between the lack of informed consent and your injury . <p> For example , you might need to prove that : <p> with the right information , you would n't have consented to the medical treatment that ended up harming you , or <p> that the harm you suffered was n't disclosed as a known risk of the procedure , even though most doctors would have discussed that particular risk as part of the informed consent process .

@@20558266 @558266/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Evidence and the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree <p> The Fourth Amendment to the- US Constitution protects you against unreasonable searches and seizures . Generally , this means that the police or other law enforcement agents ca n't search your property and take your things simply because they do n't like you or just because they feel like it . They must have a good reason before they can search your home or office and seize things , such as contraband or evidence of a crime . When the Fourth Amendment is violated , any evidence that can be traced to the illegal search or seizure is fruit of the poisonous tree and ca n't be used against you . <h> Excluding or " Suppressing " Evidence <p> The tool used to enforce the Fourth Amendment 's protections is called the " exclusionary rule . Generally , unless one of the warrant exceptions applies , the police and other government agents need a search warrant before they can search your home , office , luggage , or even your pockets . A search that 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is considered an unreasonable search . And , under the exclusionary rule , any evidence that 's obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment - that is , through an illegal or unreasonable search , seizure or even an arrest - ca n't be used as evidence against you to convict you of a crime . The evidence is " excluded " or " suppressed . " <p> For example , say police officers get a search warrant that authorizes them to search your backyard for growing marijuana plants . They do n't find any plants in your yard . However , during the search , an officer enters your basement and finds bundles of packaged marijuana and seizes them . You 're then arrested and charged with possession of illegal drugs . Under the exclusionary rule , unless the prosecution can convince the judge at trial that the officer was justified in entering the basement , the marijuana will be excluded from evidence and ca n't be used against you because the search and seizure was illegal- - the police were authorized to search only your backyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poisonous tree " doctrine goes hand-in-hand with the exclusionary rule . In fact , it takes the protection given by the exclusionary rule one step further . Under this doctrine , the state ca n't use evidence at trial against you if it was discovered through other evidence that was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment . The " poisonous tree " is evidence first seized or discovered through the initial violation of the Fourth Amendment- - an illegal search , seizure , or arrest . The " fruit " is any evidence that 's uncovered later because of information or evidence obtained from that illegal search , seizure or arrest . <p> Both the exclusionary rule and the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine are designed to curb or deter misconduct by police and other government agents . They work on the assumption that the police will do their best to make sure that they do n't violate the Fourth Amendment if they know that they ca n't benefit from any evidence found or uncovered as result of an illegal search or seizure . <h> Fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to understand how the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine works is to look at some examples . There 's really no limit to the scenarios in which the doctrine may apply , but consider : <p> Example 1 : A police officer stops a car for speeding . The driver has n't been drinking or using any type of drugs , and she 's given the officer no reason to believe that she 's driving while drunk or impaired . The officer asks for consent to search the trunk of the car , but the driver refuses to let him . The officer then orders her out of the car and he searches the inside of the car and the trunk . He finds marijuana in the trunk , and he arrests the driver for drug possession . <p> The officer then goes to a magistrate and gets a warrant for the driver 's home because he believes she 's selling marijuana . The magistrate gives him the warrant because he thinks the officer has enough evidence that the driver is committing a crime and that her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and finds more marijuana along with other illegal narcotics and illegal firearms . The driver is then charged with a gun-related crime on top of the drug possession charge . <p> Under the exclusionary rule , the marijuana found in the car ca n't be used against the driver because the search of the car was illegal . All the other evidence found in the driver 's home ca n't be used against her because it 's fruit of the poisonous tree- - it was discovered through evidence found through an illegal search . <p> Example 2 : The police arrest someone who 's suspected of committing an armed bank robbery . The police begin questioning or " interrogating " the suspect , and they make him aware of his Miranda rights , including his right to have an attorney present during the questioning . The suspect immediately tells the police that he wants an attorney , but the police continue the interrogation . After a few hours , the suspect confesses to the crime and tells them that the money stolen from the bank is hidden in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and along with the money , they find dozens of pieces of stolen goods and a large quantity of cocaine . The suspect is then charged with theft and drug trafficking on top of the armed robbery charge . <p> Under the exclusionary rule , the suspect 's confession to armed robbery ca n't be used because it was obtained though an illegal interrogation . The money from the bank , as well as the other stolen goods and cocaine found in his home , ca n't be used against him either because they 're all fruits of the illegal interrogation , that is , the poisonous tree . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> How exactly do I go about having evidence suppressed if I think it was obtained illegally ? <p> A judge refused to suppress evidence that my court-appointed attorney argued was fruit of the poisonous tree .

@@20558268 @558268/ <h> Why Make a Trust <p> There are many types of trusts , each with their own goals and purposes . Some trusts are irrevocable and require you to give up control of your assets during your lifetime . Other trusts are revocable , and allow you to keep control the assets and make changes to the trust at any time . <p> All trusts name a trustee who manages the trust and the assets you place into it . The trustee of a revocable trust is usually the person making the trust , and the trust also names a successor trustee to take over when the trustee dies or can no longer mange his or her own affairs . <h> Trusts Avoid Probate <p> Many people use trusts to avoid probate . Both irrevocable and revocable trusts bypass the probate process . Probate is the court process that transfers ownership of your assets to your beneficiaries after you die .

Also , most states allow smaller estates to skip much of the probate process . So before you make a trust to avoid probate , you might want to learn more about whether your estate would be subject to probate and whether other probate avoidance devices might make sense for your situation . <h> Trusts Are Private <p> If you do not want information about your estate to be available to the public when you die , you can use a trust to keep it private . <p> If privacy is a concern to you , trusts are a good estate planning option . Probate processes are available to the public so information about property that goes through probate is also available to the public . In contrast , trust property stays private because it never goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your estate to be available to the public when you die , you use a trust to keep it private . Only your trustee ( and possibly the trusts beneficiaries ) will get information about trust property . <h> Trusts Control Inheritances <p> Trusts can also serve the purpose of keeping control of your assets even after your death . If you pass your assets to your beneficiaries through a will , they receive the assets when you die . If you use a trust instead , you can set it up so that beneficiaries receive their inheritance over time , when they reach a certain age , or when they meet certain conditions . The trustee you name in the trust controls and manages the property until he or she distributes it to the beneficiary . These types of trust like special needs trusts , minors trusts , and spendthrift trusts are useful to people who want to give their property to beneficiaries who can not ( yet ) manage it themselves . <h> Trusts Help During Periods of Incapacity <p> In a living trust , you can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you become incapacitated . This can be a great comfort to those who anticipate being i 'll or who are reaching the end of life . The successor trustee will have the duty to manage the property for you , in your best interest .

Contracts that have to be in writing include : <p> Contracts for the sale of land or for any interest in land <p> Contracts when one party is agreeing to become personally responsible for another party 's debt <p> Contracts that can not be performed within one year <p> Contracts for the sale of goods are also covered by the statute of frauds .

After mixing the chemicals , the drug is made into a powdery substance or a rock-like crystal , hence the name . Meth can be smoked , snorted , and injected . Meth also goes by the names " ice , " " speed , " " crank , " and " glass . " <p> Making meth is a dangerous process . The chemicals are quite volatile , and when mixed they create fumes that permeate everything they touch , including walls , furniture , clothing , and plumbing . The residue remains long after the product ( and the criminals ) have departed , and its clean-up is long and arduous . Many landowners , discovering to their dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip the cleaning and simply tear-down the structures . They take this drastic step because even a thorough cleaning may not rid the structure of the taint , and because state disclosure laws relating to renting and selling property force sellers or landlords to disclose the buildings meth-lab history . After disclosure , the landlords and sellers of cleaned-up labs often find that they have unmarketable properties on their hands . Its faster and more economical to start with a vacant lot or a new structure . <h> The Crime of Using Methamphetamine <p> Possessing meth , let alone using it , is a crime in every state and in the federal system . The prosecutor need only convince the judge or jury , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the defendant knew that the substance he possessed and/or used was meth .

For instance , in a federal prosecution , the prosecutor must convince the jury that the defendant knew ( or had reasonable grounds to conclude ) that the items possessed would be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defendants charged with possession or use sometimes defend themselves by arguing that they had a valid prescription . This is a difficult defense to present , because it requires the defendant to produce an actual prescription from a medical doctor , as well as pharmacy records . <h> The Crime of Possession for Sale <p> Possessing meth for sale is a more serious crime that possession for personal use . Accordingly , it carries greater punishments ( see below ) . Prosecutors base their cases on the amount of meth the defendant possessed ( measured by weight ) .

@@20558272 @558272/ <h> Client 's Bill of Rights When Dealing With Lawyers <p> Lawyers are the experts on legal matters , but certain limits apply with respect to their behavior to you , the client . <p> Clients put a great deal of faith in their lawyers . As with doctors , clients come to attorneys for serious problemsproblems that they can not solve on their own , thus putting them in a potentially vulnerable position . What rights do you have when engaging the services of attorneys ? <p> Attorneys are licensed by their states bar association and are obligated to follow their states rules of professional conduct . All states have long codes of professional conduct ( for example , see Hawaiis Rules of Professional Conduct ) . Some states also have more consumer-friendly lists of " rights " for clients , like New Yorks Statement of Clients Rights . <p> One of the most common complaints clients have is that their lawyers do not regularly or thoroughly communicate with them to provide news and updates on the state of their legal matter . <p> As a client , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney must uphold under these Model Rules : <p> 1 . Courteous and respectful treatment . You are entitled to be treated with courtesy and respect by your attorney and all personnel in the attorney 's office . The lawyer can not simply go off and handle your case as he or she sees fit , but must consult with you about how to best accomplish your objectives . <p> 2 . Full fee disclosure . You are entitled to be fully informed as to the attorney 's fees , so that you 're not surprised upon receiving your bill . Every lawyer handles fee arrangements differently . Many do not charge for an initial consultation , while others charge for it ( if it 's a flat fee , expect anywhere from $50 to $250 ) . Some may charge a flat fee for handling the entire case , if it 's a routine legal matter , such as a simple will , an uncontested divorce , or a marriage-based green card application . Some attorneys may charge hourly fees , the amount of which can vary depending upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Some charge what are called " contingent fees , " which means the attorney will get a percentage of any recovery the client receives ( and nothing if the client 's case is lost , except for expenses such as court filing fees , costs of deposing ( interviewing ) witnesses , and so on ) . Some attorneys require large up-front retainer deposits , while others do not . Your attorney is obligated charge reasonable fees and to clearly communicate the fee structure with you before commencing representation . <p> 3 . Competence . You are entitled to competent representation by the attorney.Competency requires both intelligence and experience on the part of the attorney . There are ethical rules that prohibit an attorney from taking a case that is frivolous ( lacks merit ) or is intended to harass another person . Attorneys should also refrain from taking a case in a complex area of law about which they know very little . An attorney can not lie to you and claim to be an expert in a complex personal taxation issue , when in fact he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Confidentiality . You are entitled to complete confidentiality of any matter when you are a client of an attorney . The attorney-client privilege means that generally the attorney ( and all personnel in the attorney 's office ) ca n't reveal confidential information the client conveys to the attorney in the course of representation or when seeking representation . <p> 5 . Representation free from conflicts of interest . You are entitled to the attorneys loyalty . The attorney ca n't represent you if that representation conflicts with the attorney 's representation of other clients . For example , if you want to sue your neighbor , but an attorney also represents your neighbors business , the attorney can not simultaneously represent you in your lawsuit . Professional responsibility rules prohibit simultaneous representation of clients with directly conflicting interests . <p> 6 . Regular updates and prompt attention . You are entitled to regular updates on the status of the legal matter . The attorney should promptly respond to your questions and phone calls . Indeed , one of the most common complaints clients have is that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide news and updates on the state of their legal matter . <p> 7 . Holding and accounting of client funds . You are entitled to an accounting of all funds held by the attorney , including your retainer , if any . The attorney must keep client money and escrow funds in a separate attorney trust account , and ca n't use the funds without your property . The attorney is obligated to promptly return any money or property to you if the attorney is dismissed from the case or if the case ends . <p> 8 . Accountability for misconduct . You have the right to file a complaint with the state bar association for alleged attorney misconduct . Do n't expect immediate action , however . According to a 2010 ABA study , the average time between a client filing a complaint and the state bar association filing formal charges is between three months ( in North Dakota ) and 638 days ( in Virginia ) . <p> Your lawyer has not only studied these rules , but had to pass a separate portion of the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , in certain circumstances , have to remind your lawyer about the rules , or proactively inquire about issues such as a potential conflict of interest .

@@20558278 @558278/ <h> Impeaching a Witness <p> Litigants can challenge the credibility of opposing witnesses -- even their own witnesses " in a number of ways , including by showing the judge or jury that the witness made inconsistent statements in the past . <p> When someone testifies under oath in a hearing , trial , or deposition , the other side will typically challenge the witness through cross-examination . The oppositions tools include not only the ability to probe the witnesss actual ability to observe certain incidents , or the precision of the witnesss memory . The opponent might also challenge the essential credibility of the witness that is , the chances that the witness is likely to be telling the truth , aside from what those facts may be . Going after a witness like this is called " impeaching " a witness , and its a direct attack on the character of the person testifying , attempting to show the judge or jury , " No matter what this person says , she does n't  deserve to be believed . " <p> Lawyers impeach witnesses by using one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained below . <h> Impeaching a Witness Through Prior Inconsistent Statements <p> Confronting a witness with that persons own statements that are at odds with the persons testimony is a very common way to impeach the witness . But the opposition ca n't just introduce the statement without giving the witness a chance to explain . The court may require that the lawyer disclose the statement to the witness during the witnesss trial testimony , including the circumstances under which it was made , and give the witness a chance to admit or deny it . <p> For example , suppose a witness to a fight testifies in court that the victim threw the first punch . At a bar after the fight , however , the bystander described the scene to several listeners , telling them that the defendant initiated the scuffle . The prosecutor , of course , will want the jury to disregard this witnesss testimony in court , which ( if believed ) , would give the defendant a self-defense argument . So the prosecutor will want to impeach the witness , and will do so by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After giving the witness a chance to explain them , the prosecutor will call the bar patrons to testify , and will argue to the jury that because he has described the incident in inconsistent ways , the bystander just ca n't be believed . <p> Impeachment Statements Themselves Are n't  Necessarily True or Proven <p> Its important to understand that when a lawyer successfully impeaches a witness , that impeachment material does n't  thereby become true or proved . For example , using the " prior inconsistent statement " method explained above , suppose a bystander to an auto accident testifies for the defense that the defendants car was traveling a mere 25 miles per hour . In his statement to the police , however , he stated it was traveling at 50 mph . By bringing up the statement in the police report , the plaintiffs lawyer has called the witnesss credibility into serious question , but he has not proved that the defendant was driving 40 miles per hour . <h> Impeaching a Witness By Showing Bias or Personal Interest <p> A traditional and common sense way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is biased against one of the parties , or has a personal interest in the outcome of the case . The relationship between the parties may be good or bad . For example , imagine a witness who is a business partner with the defendant , who stands to lose money if the defendant loses the case . The plaintiff may introduce evidence of the business dealings between the two people , and show how the outcome of the case will directly affect the witness . For this reason , the lawyer will argue , the witnesss testimony ought not to be believed . <h> Impeaching a Witness with Character or Reputation Evidence <p> Witnesses who take the stand implicitly tell the jury , " I 'm a truthful person , you can believe me . " Opponents can challenge this assertion by introducing evidence to the contrary , calling witnesses who will testify that the persons reputation for truthfulness is woefully lacking . In most states , such evidence is limited to showing the witnesss lack of veracity , not his bad moral character . In other words , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impeached on this fact alone . If he s a lying adulterer , however , his reputation for lying could come into evidence . <h> Impeaching a Witness Who Has a Criminal Conviction <p> People who have previously broken the law may have such disrespect for the rule of law that they will not respect the oath they take before testifying so goes the rationale that underpins the ability of the opposition to challenge that persons credibility by pointing to a past criminal conviction . This ground for impeachment is subject to state rules and , above all , the discretion of the trial judge . Most misdemeanor convictions are deemed too minor to count ; and even when the conviction is for a felony , the court will consider its nature and age . For example , someone with multiple and recent convictions for perjury may well have a passing commitment to the truth ( and those convictions will be admitted to challenge the witness 's credibility ) . But someone who has a single , old conviction for assault may nonetheless be extremely honest ( albeit hot-tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a lawyer wants to impeach a witness during a trial before a jury , rules of court will often require that the lawyer tell the judge and opposing counsel in advance , alerting them to the statement that the lawyer intends to use . That preview is necessary because the judge has the power to disallow the impeachment if the judge thinks that its prejudicial impact on the jury will outweigh its value in calling the credibility of the witness into question . For example , imagine a defense witness in an auto accident case , whom the plaintiff learns has lied on a U.S. citizenship application . Even if the plaintiff can prove that the statement on the application is false , its unlikely that the judge will allow this incident of untruthfulness to be shared with the jury . Though it might affect their view of the witnesss credibility , its far more likely to prejudice them against the witness , all because of a statement that has nothing to do with what happened at the accident scene . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> If I take the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my 5-year old conviction for tax evasion ? <p> If the witness against me is impeached with prior inconsistent statements , how can we get these statements into evidence ( and not just as impeachment material ) ? <p> My wife is going to testify in my defense .

Identity , under the common law , has a much broader definition than " likeness " does in the Statute . For instance , imitating someones voice is not a violation of the statute , but it may violate the common law right . See Waits v. Frito-Lay , 978 F.2d 1093 , 1098-1100 ( 9th Cir. 1992 ) . A picture of a distinctly-decorated race car can be a common-law violation , even if the driver himself is not visible . Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco , 498 F.2d 821 , 827 ( 9th Cir. 1974 ) . A robot can constitute a common-law violation , even if not sufficiently detailed to violate the statute . White v. Samsung , 971 F.2d 1395 , 1397-99 ( 9th Cir. 1992 ) . <p> VIOLATION OF COMMON LAW RIGHT OF PUBLICITY <p> Violation of Common Law Right of Publicity is not explicitly limited , as opposed to the statutory violation , to merely commercial use of " identity " .

Punitive damages " may " also be awarded under the statute ; California law limits punitive damages to cases of " oppression , fraud , or malice . " Cal . Civ .

Courts may also take into account " injury to peace , happiness , and feelings , " as well as " injury to goodwill , professional standing , and future publicity value . " See , Waits v.

@@20558283 @558283/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Role of the Expert <p> Whether you have hired an attorney or choose to represent yourself , experts can play a vital role if you are involved in litigation . From the initial tasks of investigating , verifying , and organizing facts to testifying at trial on your behalf , experts can make or break your case . Therefore , it is extremely important that you do your homework and hire a qualified expert that you trust to handle your case . <h> Q : How does an expert help you or your attorney prepare your case ? <p> A consulting expert can be used to investigate the facts of a case ; to research the technical , scientific , or medical issues involved ; and to help a client and his or her attorney gain a better understanding of how best to present a successful case . A consulting expert is retained to educate the attorney and the client on issues relating to the expert 's area of expertise as those issues relate to the case at hand . Communications between an attorney and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attorney is free to discuss trial strategy issues with a consulting expert . This is particularly true in cases involving such issues as medical malpractice , toxic torts , and environmental wrongdoing , in which applicable law relies heavily on scientific , medical , or technical determinations to establish wrongdoing . A consulting expert may later testify at trial , in which case he or she would be referred to as an expert witness . <h> Q : How does an expert help you or your attorney in the courtroom ? <p> In the courtroom , an expert can assist the attorney and the client by testifying on behalf of the client . In that role , the expert would assist the court and the jury to understand the medical , scientific , and technical issues as these relate to the client 's case . The expert 's credentials can strengthen a client 's case in the eyes of a jury . <p> The expert can also help spot the weaknesses in the scientific , medical , or technical credentials or testimony of an opposing party 's expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cross-examination of the opposing party 's witnesses . <h> Q : When do you need an expert ? <p> Under the Federal Rules of Evidence , an expert is appropriate when scientific , technical , or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact at issue in a case . A client and his attorney would ordinarily seek the assistance of an expert where a key issue in the case depends on understanding evidence that is not within the common knowledge of the judge and jury . For example , experts are often used in cases dealing with medical malpractice , toxic torts , racial or gender discrimination , and environmental pollution because these cases call for the introduction of evidence that is grounded in obscure terminology , specialized knowledge , and mathematical or scientific analyses not ordinarily within the common knowledge of the court and jury hearing the case . The increasing role of computers and electronic information systems in everyday transactions forms a good example of the need for experts because although both court and jury may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither is likely to have a common-sense understanding of how electronic information is stored , retrieved , destroyed , or reconstructed . <h> Q : Do you still need an expert if you plan to settle the case ? <p> Even a client intends to settle litigation before it reaches trial , the client and his or her attorney will often benefit from consulting an expert so as to gain a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the client 's case . For example , a consulting expert may perform an accident reconstruction analysis , to help the attorney determine whether and to what extent negligence can be established . These early pretrial investigations can be invaluable in assisting the client and the attorney arrive at a fair approximation of the worth of a case . <h> Q : How do you go about finding an expert ? <p> Finding an expert is not hard . Finding a credible expert with the proper credentials is a different matter . Bar journals ' advertising sections often include ads from persons holding themselves out as experts in exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in successful litigation for both plaintiffs and defendants alike . An attorney interested in hiring a credible expert witness whose credentials will withstand the scrutiny of opposing counsel would do well to look in the halls of academia , in the lists of contributors to major peer-reviewed professional journals , and in the lists of persons who receive awards and recognition from their professional peers . Professional associations , such as medical or scientific societies can provide information about persons considered experts in their field . <p> One good place to start is Martindale-Hubbell 's Experts &amp; Services . From there , you can access information about more than 50,000 experts and professionals by searching within categories and/or with specific search terms . This will help you narrow down the list to find the expert most suited to handle your case . <h> Q : What types of qualifications should you look for ? <p> Whether an expert will consult only or will testify at trial , the qualifications remain the same . The expert needs to have specialized education , knowledge , skills , experience , and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be directly applicable to the issues in the case . <p> The educational credentials are established through the expert 's college degrees as well as the reputation of the institution that awarded the degrees .

Switching attorneys presents a similar problem . If you are thinking about leaving your old lawyer for a new oneand there are several reasons you might choose to do soone question you 're likely to ask yourself is , " What happens to the files that my existing attorney is holding for me ? " <p> Particularly if you 're switching attorneys in the middle of a dispute , court case , or other ongoing legal matter , you want your new attorney to have access to these important documents . <p> If you are in the midst of a heated legal dispute , and concerned about getting your matter transferred to a new attorney quickly , the last thing you need is a squabble with your old lawyer over your file . <h> Ex-Attorney 's Obligation to Return Your Files <p> Upon request , an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case files .

Here , for example , is the relevant California rule : <p> A member whose employment has terminated shall : ( 1 ) Subject to any protective order or non-disclosure agreement , promptly release to the client , at the request of the client , all the client papers and property . " Client papers and property " includes correspondence , pleadings , deposition transcripts , exhibits , physical evidence , expert 's reports , and other items reasonably necessary to the client 's representation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 2 ) Promptly refund any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned . This provision is not applicable to a true retainer fee which is paid solely for the purpose of ensuring the availability of the member for the matter . <h> Practical Aspects of Getting Your Files Back From Your Attorney <p> You can ask your lawyer to send the files directly to you or your new attorney , in which case the safest way to make the request is in writing , via letter or email . Alternatively , you can pick up a copy of your file in person ( but contact the office first , so that it has time to locate and review the contents of your file and make a copy for you ) . <p> Or , once you 've hired a new lawyer , he or she can assist in getting your file .

This is a valid and necessary step ; the attorney will need create a duplicate set that he or she retains for record-keeping reasons . You may , however , have to pay shipping expenses . <p> In addition , realize that the attorney does not have a legal right to hold files hostage because you owe him or her money . ( Any bill collection issues will need to be separately addressed between the two of you . ) If the attorney fails to turn over your documents in a timely manner , you can file a complaint with the local bar association or state disciplinary committee . <h> " Factual Files " Versus " Work Product " <p> As a client , you 're absolutely entitled to factual work product concerning your case , such as deposition testimony , correspondence , and court filings . These materials are crucial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , if you are in the midst of litigation but trial has not yet occurred , you will want all discovery , motions filed , and documents produced by the other side . <p> However , laws vary from state to state as to whether clients are entitled to more opinion-oriented documents ( such as attorney notes and legal theories ) within the attorney 's files . Some states , such as California , have ruled that the client is not entitled to " absolute work product . " These would include documents that reflect the attorney 's impressions , opinions , and legal theories , as well as legal research . <p> Other jurisdictions , such as Washington , DC , say that the client must receive the entire file , including attorney notes , opinions , and strategy information .

If you are in the midst of a heated legal dispute , and concerned about getting your matter transferred to a new attorney quickly , the last thing you need is a squabble with your old lawyer over your file . <p> Be respectful of the attorney and professional in your communications ; emphasize that the disagreement and decision are not personal . <p> To the extent that you have unpaid legal bills , consider paying those quickly in order to eliminate any possibility that your lawyer may be intentionally slow in transferring the files . You may feel that your old lawyer does n't deserve any more money .

For example , if you have a credit card , you signed a contract when applying for that card . The contract may have said that the credit card issuer could change the interest rate at its discretion . By signing the initial contract , you have already given the credit card issuer the right to make future changes . <p> Or , for example , a sales contract with a vendor might state that all changes have to be agreed to , in writing , by the parties that signed the initial contract . In that case , you can not call the vendor , ask for price reduction , get verbal approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing . <p> If the contract does n't address the issue of changes , you will need to talk to the other parties to the contract , make sure that they agree to the changes , then , to be on the safe side , add a rider ( additional section ) to the contract that addresses the changes . This rider should be signed by each party to the original contract . <p> There may be instances where all parties to a contract are unable to come to agreement on changes . If that happens , you 'll have to either live with the original signed agreement , walk away from the contact ( if it has not been signed ) , or calculate how much it will cost to break the contract and decide whether it is worth the cost . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> If you do not understand the language in a contract , need to better understand the obligations of a contract or need help negotiating a contract , an attorney will be able to assist you . <p> Among the questions to consider asking your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to this one ? <p> Are there sections of the contract that you 'd suggest I change ? <p> Are there sections of the contract that are biased against me ? <p> What are the potential ramifications if we ca n't modify this contract ?

@@25933682 @5933682/ <p> Divorce is a painful process on many levels . If asked to prioritize , most people whove been through it would probably say that the emotional toll is the worst aspect . But its a good bet that the financial impact comes in a close second ; attorney 's fees is one of the primary elements of this costly runner-up . <p> A joint bank account is all-too-often a familys only practical source for payment of emergency expenses . But now you 're on the verge of divorce proceedings , and you 've found a lawyer , who needs a retainer of several thousand dollars . <p> If you decide to dip into the joint account for attorneys fees , it would be wise to withdraw no more than half the money in the account . There are a number of reasons for taking this approach . A " community property " statelike Californianormally presumes that half the money in the account is yours , and half is your spouses . And in other states , which use an " equitable distribution " ( fundamental fairness ) philosophy of dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouses is a common outcome . By taking only half , you 're pretty much conforming to a standard distribution practice in divorce cases . <p> Another reason to only withdraw half the funds in the account is that removing more could put you in a negative light . It might cause your spouses attorneyand possibly even the judgeto be suspicious of any other actions you may take during the course of the divorce . So withdrawing half would seem to be a safe bet in terms of meeting your immediate needs , while also establishing your good faith . <p> Taking money out of a joint account becomes a bit trickier once you 've started divorce proceedings . Some states incorporate what 's known as Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders ( ATROs ) in the divorce papers you file with the court . The purpose of the order is to stop divorcing spouses from making any major changes to marital assets . This step is the result of a history of spouses doing things such as cancelling insurance policies , changing beneficiaries , and selling off assets . Note that in some states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ATROs . Youd need to consult with your attorney to see if this is the case where you live , and also to determine how much of the joint account you can use for fees . <p> Even if your state does n't  employ the use of ATROs , many times attorneys will directly petition the court to freeze assetsor at least significantly limit either partys ability to touch themunless there 's a mutual agreement or a court order . <p> In light of the possible restrictions you may face after you start your case , if you 're going to take funds out of a joint account to pay attorneys fees , consider doing it before you file your court papers . <h> You May Be Able to Withdraw Fundsbut Should You ? <p> There is a downside to removing funds from a joint account , and it relates primarily to situations where you 've opted to do it without telling your spouse . This has nothing to do with the legality of what you 've done , but has everything to do with the emotional impact . Even in situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse may view your action as a betrayal . And this can set the tone for the entire divorce , leading to an overall mistrust and even retaliation . You would n't be the first person to come home and learn that suddenly some of your most prized possessions are sitting in a storage locker rented by your spouse . And now you have to pay your lawyer to argue with your spouse 's attorney about getting them back . <p> The moral here is that , if at all possible , try to discuss with your spouse exactly how your joint funds will be used . After all , he or she may need access to the money to pay legal fees , too . As with any aspect of divorce , the more you can work out between yourselves , the better for all concerned .

Others , however , choose to hire a real estate broker or agent . <p> A " real estate broker " is someone who , for a commission or fee , is employed by home owner to negotiate the sale , purchase , lease or exchange of real property to a third party .

Being prepared for this first meeting will get your case off to as smooth and efficient a start as possible , and it could also save you money -- your lawyer will take less time to get up to speed on your claim . <p> Some lawyers like to have their potential clients fill out a questionnaire before the first face-to-face meeting . If that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and write down any unrequested information that you think is pertinent to your case . If the lawyer asks you to send the completed questionnaire to the office before the meeting , be sure to also send along copies of any documents that may be requested . <p> Even if a lawyer does n't ask for them beforehand , it 's still a good idea to bring copies of all documents relevant to your case to your first meeting . <p> Written documentation of the accident , your injuries , your medical treatment , and your damages is especially important in a personal injury case .

If other lawyers or staff may do some of the work , can you meet them ? <h> Money Matters <p> Feel free to ask for specifics in terms of how the lawyer will charge for his or her services , including : <p> Would a contingency fee be possible ? If so , what is the percentage ?

Still , you should ask the question . If the lawyers representation of prior or existing clients would limit the attorneys ability to represent you , there is likely a conflict . For example , if you want to sue a hospital that the potential lawyer regularly represents , there would be a conflict . A conflict might also arise if the attorney you are interviewing has already been hired by a co-defendant in your case .

The quick answer is that you have a legal right to live in your home until the lender completes all foreclosure procedures and sells the home . The process will likely take at least six monthsif not longerwith the exact time depending on state law , the type of foreclosure proceeding your lender chooses , and how fast your bank moves through the bankruptcy process . <p> You might be able to stay in the home even longer if your state allows for a redemption perioda period when the foreclosed homeowner can buy back , or " redeem , " the homeor if your local court must ratify ( approve ) the foreclosure sale before you 're required to leave .

After you fall delinquent on the loan , federal law requires the lender to wait for 120 days ( approximately four months ) before starting foreclosure proceedings . Once the period elapses , the lender can begin the judicial foreclosure process , or , if your state allows for it , initiate a nonjudicial foreclosure . <p> At some point , the time you can stay in the house will end . The new owner can not simply throw you and your belongings out , however , but must take steps to remove you using the eviction process . <p> here 's how the two types of foreclosure work . <p> Judicial foreclosure . Judicial foreclosure begins when the lender files a lawsuit in court and serves you with a copy of the summons and complaint ( or petition ) . If you do not respond to the lawsuit , the lender will automatically win the case ( known as winning by default ) , and the court will approve the foreclosure . If you want to fight to keep your house , you can respond to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lender must first obtain a court order before selling the home at a foreclosure sale . <p> Nonjudicial foreclosure . If the bank decides to use the nonjudicial foreclosure process , the lender will not have to file a lawsuit with the court . Instead , the lender must follow the steps laid out in the state statutes , which usually include mailing or publishing a notice of default to the defaulting owner , among other things . After completing all of the state-specific requirements , the lender can sell the property at a foreclosure auction . ( Learn more about the different types of foreclosure in What 's the Difference Between Judicial and Nonjudicial Foreclosures ? ) <p> The process the lender will use will depend primarily on state law , though it could depend on other factors as well , such as title ( ownership ) issues or the ability to get a deficiency judgment against you for the difference between the sale price and the amount you owe . Either way , you can continue to live in the home during the entire process . <h> The Foreclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the property title ( ownership ) transfers to someone else . In a foreclosure , title transfers when the foreclosure sale takes place , so , in most cases , that is when your legal right to live in the home will terminate . However , depending on your state laws , you might get extra time to stay in the home . For example , if your state requires ratification ( confirmation ) of the sale by the court , or allows the homeowner to stay in the home through a redemption period ( a period wherein you can buy back the house ) , you wont have to move immediately . <h> What is a Redemption Period ? <p> In some states , you 're allowed to buy back your house after the foreclosure salebut you must do so relatively quickly .

" To redeem a home , the foreclosed homeowner must either reimburse the new purchaser for the amount paid at the sale or repay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreclosed homeowner does n't redeem the property , the person or entity that bought the home remains the new owner after the redemption period expires . <p> The length of the redemption period varies from state to state .

North Dakota law , similarly , allows the homeowner to live in the home during the redemption period , which is usually 60 days . Not all states allow the homeowner to live in the home payment-free until the redemption period expires , however . To find out about the laws of your state , contact a local attorney . <h> After the Foreclosure : Eviction <p> At some point , the time you can stay in the house will end .

The contract to paint your portrait is terminated by impossibility of performance . <h> Breaking a Contract Due to Fraud , Mistake , or Misrepresentation <p> You may be able to break a contract if the other party does something improper , such as commit fraud or make a misrepresentation regarding a matter that 's material to the contract . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same mistake in making the contract . Breaking a contract for these reasons is called rescission . <p> For example , imagine that a person agrees to sell you her computer for $1,000 . You take the computer , but realize that it does not turn on ; the seller tried to give you a broken machine . You can rescind the contract , on the basis of fraud and misrepresentation . <p> Similarly , imagine that someone agrees to sell you her ticket to a major concert . But unbeknownst to both of you , the concert has been cancelled because the performer passed away . Again , the contract can be rescinded based upon mutual mistake . <p> Another important category of voidable contracts involves minors . Sometimes a person can get out of a contract because the law says he or she is not of age to make one in the first place . Say your 13-year-old child signs a contract to buy a used car . The contract is not valid , because minors ( usually under 18 years old ) are not old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that your mom is elderly and lost the capacity to understand her surroundings . A contract she makes to buy a vacation property can be rescinded , because she was not mentally able to understand its terms . <h> Ending Performance on a Contract That Has Been Breached <p> If the other side materially breaches your contract , you do not have to do your part . A breach happens if one side : <p> refuses to do his or her part <p> does something he or she was not supposed to , or <p> blocks you from doing what you are supposed to . <p> Not all breaches of contract end up in court . A breach has to be serious , or " material , " to be legally significant . <p> You can sue someone who makes a material breach of your contract . A material breach goes to the heart of the contract . For example , imagine that you hire a violinist to perform at a concert . She shows up , but plays the accordion . You have to refund the ticket prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You would probably get a judgment against the violinist for the amount of money needed to put you in the same financial position as if the violinist had not breached the contract . <p> An immaterial ( sometimes called " partial ) breach of contract is one that does not go to the heart of the contract . Say you hire someone to inspect your heating system once a month . The contract says it should be inspected on the first Monday of the month . But the contractor comes on the first day of the month instead . In all likelihood this is not a breach , unless for some reason the inspections really had to be done on the first Monday , such as to comply with the terms of a court order . <h> Ending a Contract by Prior Agreement <p> Contracts can also be ended by prior agreement . The contract may say it can be ended by either party giving written notice to the other party . The contract would contain a provision about how it can be terminated and that , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If drafting a contract , be sure to be specific about such matters , because interpreting unclear language could lead to a lawsuit . You probably can not read every contract you come across , but for the most important ones , such as employment , living arrangements , and medical treatment , it 's best to have an attorney review it before signing . <p> Sometimes , . . . contracts need to be broken . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> An orchard agreed to sell me a ton of Granny Smith apples .

USERRA covers employees who serve in the U.S. uniformed services , including the Army , Navy , Marine Corps , Air Force , Coast Guard , Reserves , National Guard , the Commission Corps of the Public Health Service , and any other category designated by the President during a war or national crisis .

If the employee served for 181 days or more , you can not fire the employee without cause for one year . If the employee served between 31 and 180 days , you may not fire the employee without cause for 180 days .

Alan Kopit , legal editor of lawyers.com , shares some tips on how to stop older family members from getting scammed . <p> Fraud comes in many forms - unscrupulous charitable solicitations , telemarketers trying to sell you something , and get-rich-quick schemes being pushed over the internet . How often has someone walked up to you on the street and given you $1,000 ? The answer is no doubt never , yet people are scammed everyday by people who intrude on their privacy in perhaps more subtle ways with promises of easy money . Seniors and their families need to pay particular attention to scams aimed at the elderly . <p> For example , one of the more prevalent scams today is the lottery scam . News stories have reported that seniors ( the primary target of the scam ) have lost thousands of dollars to lottery scams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is disabled with no means of financial support except her disability check , received a letter saying that she had won a European lottery and needed to send money to cover the taxes and processing fees . Of course , the senior had never even purchased a European lottery ticket ! Nevertheless , after receiving the letter , the senior sent the lottery the requested amount , about $3,500 . Naturally , the big lottery payoff never arrived , and the victim will never be able to recover the money . <h> Seniors are the most likely targets <p> Targeting seniors is not a new phenomenon . For decades , con artists have used the telephone , the mail and gone door-to-door to scam seniors out of their hard earned savings . Today , technology has brought about new forms of solicitation . <p> Seniors are particularly vulnerable for several reasons : <p> First , they have time . Generally senior citizens , especially if they are retired , have time on their hands . They read advertisements , they check out unsolicited e-mails , and they review direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply ignore them . <p> Second , they are often lonely . When someone calls or a senior receives an e-mail , the feeling of loneliness will often be relieved by the fact that a seemingly sympathetic ear is on the other end of the line or is corresponding by e-mail . Often scam artists will talk for hours before securing a senior 's confidence ( the " con " in con artist ) and trust . <p> Finally , they tend to be trusting and compassionate . According to the AARP , Americans 65 and older receive more telephone and mail solicitations than any other age group . <h> Tips on how to protect your family from scams <p> Remember the #1 rule of consumer law : if it sounds too good to be true , it usually is . If you are scammed , your chances of getting any of your money back are slim . Accordingly , the only real way to protect yourself is to not get defrauded in the first place . Family can play a role in this process . Here are some tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you see a lifestyle change that 's out of the ordinary , you need to ask why and what 's happening here . For example , if all of a sudden your outgoing grandparent becomes withdrawn and stops going to church or social functions , that 's a sign something may be wrong . They 're usually embarrassed or afraid to tell their family they have a problem , and this is very common . Their biggest fear is losing their independence . So they hesitate telling anyone they 've been victimized because they do not want you to think they 're incapable or vulnerable . They withdraw , rather than participate , and will not discuss the problem openly . <p> Review their financial statements . If your parent or grandparent decides to give you financial power of attorney , they 're permitting you to utilize their bank accounts and pay for bills , monitor their credit card expenses , and other financial matters . An elderly person can request that the bank send duplicate statements to the family member who 's looking after their finances . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their financial statements on a regular basis , and look for any suspicious or unusual activities on their accounts . <p> Get it in writing . There are times when your elder family member may want to donate money to charity , or use their savings towards an investment . You need to be vigilant and find out what the charity or investment opportunity is , and get the information in writing . Take the time to review the fine print and see if it 's legitimate . Always ask for written information from the source . Remember any legitimate business or charity knows that it 's appropriate to ask for written information . Family members can help check out unfamiliar companies with your local consumer protection agency , Better Business Bureau , or State Attorney General 's Office . <p> If you are a victim , act quickly . Contact your bank and close accounts that you think may be accessible by the fraudulent parties . File a police report with local authorities and be sure to get yourself a copy for your records . You may later be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to verify the crime . Contact the major credit bureaus and file a fraud alert with each of them . Fraud alerts can help prevent fraudulent parties from opening more accounts in your name . <h> Does the law give me any protection ? <p> You do have legal rights that provide some protection , but the circumstances are limited . There are different laws that protect your legal rights depending on the type of fraud that has occurred . For example , the Electronics Fund Transaction Act provides consumers protection for transactions involving ATM and debit cards . You have 60 days from the date your bank account statement is sent to report in writing any money withdrawals from your account without your permission . If your ATM or debit card is lost or stolen , report it immediately because the amount you can be held responsible for depends on how quickly you report the loss : <p> If you report the loss or theft within two business days of discovery , your losses are limited to $50 . <p> If you report the loss or theft after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unauthorized electronic fund transfer appears on your statement , you could lose up to $500 of what the thief withdraws . <p> If you wait more than 60 days to report the loss or theft , you could lose all the money that was taken from your account after the end of the 60 days . <p> Note : VISA and MasterCard voluntarily have agreed to limit consumers ' liability for unauthorized use of their debit cards in most instances to $50 per card , no matter how much time has elapsed since the discovery of the loss or theft of the card . <p> In addition , if the fraud involves checks and other " paper transactions , there may be some protection . Although no federal law limits your losses if someone uses forged checks or other types of paper transactions , state laws may protect you . Most states hold the bank responsible for losses from such transactions . But again , act quickly , because some rights expire after a certain amount of time .

The law generally allows employers to look into your past before hiring you . However , you must give your consent before an employer can gather certain kinds of information . And the law limits how employers may use the results of a background check . <h> What Is a Background Check ? <p> When an employer runs a background check , it looks at your history to make sure there are no signs of trouble .

Use Unbundled Legal Services <p> In many states , you can hire a lawyer who will handle part , but not all , of your divorce . For example , you can hire a lawyer to write a memorandum of law for you , or to draft a settlement agreement . This type of lawyer stands in sharp contrast to a traditional divorce lawyer , who handles a case from beginning to end at a much greater cost . To find out if unbundled legal services are available in your state , contact your states bar association . <h> 2 . If you hire a traditional divorce lawyer , limit your use of the attorney . <p> It 's important for you to understand how your attorney plans to charge you in your divorce .

If you ask your attorney to do this work for you , every phone call and email will come at a cost . <h> 3 . Consider a Do-It-Yourself Divorce <p> If you and your spouse are still on good terms and you 're able to sit down together and work through thorny issues regarding your finances and your children ( if you have any ) , you might be able to handle the divorce without involving lawyers . Contact your local courthouse or law library and ask if they have the papers that self-represented parties ( meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also inquire about how to get your case scheduled on a judges calendar when you 're done with the formal paperwork . <p> After you 've had a little bit of time to absorb the fact that you 're getting divorced , sit down and make a list of your priorities . What 's important to you ? What 's not ? This will help you whether you negotiate , use a collaborative lawyer , or work the case out some other way . <h> 4 . Use Collaborative Lawyers <p> If you and your spouse get along relatively well but have some disagreements about major issues , collaborative law might be a good solution . Collaborative law is a relatively new method to divorce . You and your spouse will start by signing a collaborative law agreement in which you agree that you will both behave respectfully , will provide full disclosure of all facts , and agree to use " allied professionals " for the problematic areas of the divorce .

Negotiate <p> Sometimes when spouses are overly-emotional about their divorce , they become contentious and may even refuse to negotiate or insist on litigating issues when they know the judge is almost certainly going to rule against them . This has the effect of causing the divorce to drag on and cost everyone unnecessary time and money . Be open to negotiating with your spouse and your spouses lawyer . No one wins 100% of a divorce case : There has to be give-and-take between spouses . Keep an open mind and be willing to surrender on some issues in order to get other , more important things back . <h> 6 .

Narrow the Issues <p> When you look at your list of priorities , think about what issues you and your spouse can resolve amicably . Try to settle those issues with your spouse . Its a waste of your time and money to go to court and ask a judge to make a decision on an issue you and your spouse mostly agree about anyway . If there are issues that you absolutely know you cant agree on , be prepared to take those to court . The point is to narrow down the disputes to only the most insoluble dilemmas . <h> 8 . Keep Meticulous Records <p> Its a fact of life : facts and documents are often misplaced , through no ones fault .

After all , you 're hurt , your medical bills are piling up , and you may be unable to work for an extended period of time . Unfortunately , this is an all-too-common scenario for injured workers . In a recent survey , we found that 27% of workers ' comp claims were initially denied . <p> The good news , however , is that you have the right to appeal the decision . In this article , we explain the appeals process and provide tips on how to challenge your workers comp denial . <h> Contact the Insurance Company <p> The insurance company for your employer will typically make the initial decision on your workers compensation claim . If you receive a denial , your first step should be to contact the insurance company to find out why your claim was denied . Sometimes a claim is denied because the paperwork wasnt filled out correctly or an important document was missing . The insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes and reconsider your claim . <p> Other claims are denied because the insurance company believes you have not met the eligibility requirements for receiving benefits . For example , the insurance company may deny your claim because your injury happened away from the workplace or during non-working hours . Or , the insurance company may believe that you had a preexisting condition that was the real cause of your injuries ( such as a prior sports injury ) . ( Read our article on common reasons for workers ' comp denials for other justifications the insurance company may use to deny you benefits . ) <p> Whatever the case , you can usually ask the insurance company to reconsider its decision . This can be worthwhile if you have additional facts or documents for the insurance company to consider ( for example , medical records showing that your sports injury required minimal treatment ) . <p> Percentage of Denied Workers ' Comp ClaimsMore than a quarter of workers ' comp claims were initially denied . <h> File the Appeal <p> If you ca n't work things out with the insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim or appeal . The notice of denial from the insurance company will usually lay out the procedures you must follow to file an appeal . It 's important to keep in mind that there are strict deadlines for appealing workers comp denials , which vary from state to state . In many states , workers have one or more years to appeal a workers comp claim denial . For example , in California , a worker has one year to file if the insurance company ignored or denied the claim , and five years to file if the insurance company paid any benefits on the claim . However , in other states , the timeline may be as short as a few weeks or months . For example , in Ohio , a worker has only 14 days to appeal after receiving a claim denial . <p> Its also important to file your appeal according to the procedures of your state . For example , in some states , your appeal may be as simple as sending a letter to your states workers compensation agency . In other states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach certain documents , or send multiple copies of your appeal . If you fail to follow the rules , you may be denied benefits , even if you would have otherwise been entitled to them . ( For more information on the appeal procedures in your state , see State-Specific Information for Workers Compensation . ) <h> Mediation <p> In many states , you may have the option ( or may be required ) to participate in mediation before your hearing takes place . For instance , Pennsylvania and North Carolina both require you to go to mediation before you attend a formal hearing . <p> At mediation , you and the insurance company will each get a chance to present your cases to a mediatora neutral third party who tries to help you resolve the dispute . This usually happens through informal conversations in a conference room . Unlike a hearing , a mediation does not require formal arguments or follow procedural rules .

A lawyer can help you figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement offers from the insurance company . <p> If you and the insurance company come to an agreement at mediation , you will not need to continue with your appeal . The agreement will be formalized in writing and likely reviewed by a workers comp judge . If you can not agree to a settlement , however , you will continue on to the next step . <h> Formal Hearing <p> In most states , the next step is a workers compensation hearing . Although a workers comp hearing is less formal than a trial , it does have some similarities . For example , the parties make legal arguments , present evidence , and elicit testimony from witnesses . There are also certain procedural rules that must be followed , and a workers comp judge ( or other official ) will preside over the hearing . <p> Although you have the right to represent yourself at the hearing , its highly recommended that you have an attorney at this stage . <p> To succeed at the hearing , you will need to convince the workers comp judge that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend on your particular case and the reason for the denial . For example , if your appeal was denied because the insurance company believes you were not seriously injured , you should present reports from your doctors showing the severity of your injuries .

A qualified workers comp attorney will be able to craft persuasive legal arguments , present relevant evidence , follow procedural rules , and present your case in the best light possible . You 'll also be on equal footing with the insurance company , as it will likely have an attorney as well . <h> Board Appeals <p> If you 're unsuccessful at your hearing , many states allow you to file a second administrative appeal . The workers compensation appeals board , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this appeal . In most cases , this is not an opportunity to present your evidence for a second time . Instead , this is your chance to explain why the original hearing officers decision was wrong , based on the evidence presented at the hearing . <h> Court Appeals <p> If you do n't  win your second appeal , the final step in most states is to appeal through the state court system . Essentially , you will need to file a lawsuit against the insurance company or the state workers compensation board ( depending on your states procedures ) . In many states , your case will proceed in court like any other lawsuit and will eventually be decided by a judge or a jury . During the process , you will have to follow all of the rules of procedure and evidence in your state , which can be quite complicated . If you have n't already , you should consult with a lawyer before filing an appeal through state court .

I have n't been able to work since , and I have n't heard back yet on my claim . Im worried about how I 'm going to pay my bills . How long will it take for my claim to get accepted or denied ? <h> Answer <p> In most states , the timeline for a response to your workers compensation claim is around two to three weeks . For example , in Maine , the insurance company must accept or deny a claim within 14 days . In Pennsylvania and Arizona , the insurance company has 21 days to accept or deny a claim .

For example , in Illinois , a worker will hear back within 28 days of filing a workers compensation claim . <p> In many states , if you do n't  receive a response within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim has been accepted . For example , in California , any claim that is n't rejected within 90 days is presumed to be accepted . In Florida , a claim is deemed accepted if it is n't rejected within 120 days . <p> The insurance company can still rebut this presumption with evidence that you are not entitled to benefits . However , it may only present evidence that was n't available at the time of its investigation . For example , suppose the insurance company argues that you should be denied benefits because you filed your claim late . This wont rebut the presumption , because the insurance company would have known that you filed your claim late from the very beginning . Because it failed to deny the claim within the required time limit , your claim will probably be accepted . 
@@25933716 @5933716/ <p> In either scheme , there are a number of factors that affect property division , depending on the laws of the state that has jurisdiction over the divorce . If you 're involved in a divorce , it 's critical that you understand the laws in your state or consult with an experienced divorce attorney . <h> Community Property States <p> Community property is all property that 's jointly owned by a married couple or property that was acquired during marriage , through either spouse 's labor , efforts , or skill . <p> Separate property is property that 's owned separately by one spouse . Separate property is n't usually divided in a divorce ; Absent some unusual circumstances , like commingling ( see below ) , it 's awarded to the owner spouse . <p> Separate property includes : <p> property that was acquired before the marriage , for example , a savings account that you opened and funded before you were married or a car that you purchased and paid off before the marriage <p> property that was inherited or was a gift to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage <p> businesses owned prior to the marriage ( but if both spouses added to the value of the business during the marriage , through work or investments , there may be a community value to a separate business as well ) <p> either spouse 's pension proceeds that vested prior to marriage <p> personal gifts acquired by either spouse or given to one spouse by the other ( depending on state law ) , and <p> property or income acquired after the date of separation or the date of the divorce ( depending on state law ) . <p> Despite these fairly universal rules , there are always exceptions . For example , personal gifts are assumed to be the property of the spouse who received the gift , unless a spouse can show that the item was never intended to be a gift . For example , if one spouse purchases and gives the other a very expensive necklace during the marriage , but the couple treats it as a jointly-owned investment rather than part of the recipient spouse 's personal wardrobe , the necklace might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was treated as an investment rather than a gift includes the following : <p> having the necklace appraised <p> keeping the necklace in a safe or in a safe-deposit box at a bank , and <p> a history of the couple purchasing fine jewelry ( including the necklace ) as part of a bigger collection . <p> To avoid confusion , you should document the circumstances under which all valuables are acquired at any point in time , including after a separation and up to the date that the divorce is final . Even though some states , including California , use the date of separation as the cut-off date for determining if certain property is community or separate , it 's always best to have a record . Memories fade , and during a divorce , spouses tend to " forget " about oral agreements they may have made in better times . <h> Commingling <p> Sometimes , separate property can become community property through commingling , which is when separate property is mixed together with community property in such a way that you ca n't tell the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits an inheritance ( separate property ) into a joint bank account the couple uses to deposit their paychecks , cover monthly expenses , and buy community property . <h> Dividing Property <p> The basic principle in community property states is that both spouses should receive an equal share of the community property and debts . Although each spouse is entitled to half of the assets , the form may differ . For example , there 's no way for you to literally split your home in half . You may be required to sell your home and split the proceeds , or the spouse that wishes to stay in the home may have to buy out the other . <p> What this means is that when couples ca n't agree on how to divide their property , a judge will look at the entire marital estate , determine the total net value of the community assets ( usually based on appraisal reports and other evidence submitted by the spouses ) and order that each spouse receive the same value of property and/or liquid assets ( cash , bank accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of example , one spouse receives the new family minivan ( valued at $30,000 ) , and the other spouse receives the 2010 Subaru , valued at $15,000 .

Even though the physical property was n't divided or sold , both spouses in this example received an equal value ( $30,000 each or a 50/50 split ) of assets . <p> Divorcing spouses and judges can get creative with property division to ensure that each spouse receives an equal amount . Sometimes , however , there may be a legitimate reason to create an unequal split , including where one spouse owes some amount of reimbursement for unauthorized post-separation purchases or wasting marital assets . <h> Equitable Distribution States <p> All of the non-community property states follow the common law model , also called equitable distribution . With equitable distribution , assets are n't necessarily divided evenly . Instead , a court will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable ( fair ) to both spouses . <p> In deciding what 's equitable , courts will commonly consider the following factors : <p> the length of the marriage <p> both spouses ' work histories , individual earning capacities , and job prospects <p> The exact method of property division can be complicated and will depend on your state 's laws and the facts of your case . You should consult with a local family law attorney before entering into any complex property settlement agreements . <h> Taking A Property Inventory <p> Regardless of your state 's laws , it 's always important to keep good records and document everything . As soon as possible , send your attorney a list of all assets and any supporting documentation regarding ownership and values , including copies of title documents , written agreements , and current appraisals . <p> It 's very important that you make a complete list of all property . Many lawyers have property checklists designed to jog your memory regarding property .

If your spouse discovers that you left something out of your property disclosures or the divorce settlement , your spouse can ask the court for help . In some states , including California , courts can punish spouses who fail to disclose assets by awarding 50%-100% of the value of any hidden assets to the innocent spouse , depending on the nature and circumstances of the failure to disclose ( mistaken failure versus intentional fraud ) . <h> Valuing Assets <p> When you and your spouse ca n't agree on the value of a particular piece of property , it may be necessary to have a professional appraisersuch as a real estate brokerput a value on the property for you .

They found 1,889 instances where the test results were so far out of the normal range they indicated an immediate danger to the patient 's health or the potential for damage over time ( such as a high cholesterol level ) . The researchers then looked for documentation to show that the patients were informed of these significant results . They found that in at least 135 cases , no notification was given . <h> No News is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no news is n't necessarily good news . It 's dangerous to assume that all of your medical test results were normal simply because you did n't hear anything about them from your doctor . As the study indicates , patients often fail to receive needed follow-up care because serious medical test results are lost or overlooked . Lost test results leading to a missed diagnosis or a delay in treatment can be life-threatening for patients and may be actionable as- malpractice against doctors . <h> Record-Keeping Procedures for Doctors <p> The authors of the study recommend that doctors follow five routine procedures to keep patients informed about test results : <p> Route results to the responsible doctor <p> Have the responsible doctor sign off on the results <p> Inform patients of all results , normal and abnormal <p> Document that patients were informed <p> Tell patients to call the office if they fail to receive their test results within a certain time period <p> Safeguard your health by following up on medical test results with your doctor .

And when a collision occurs , police often show up at the scene to conduct an investigation . A natural starting point for police investigating an accident is to talk to the motorists . As one of the drivers , should you answer police questions ? And if you agree to talk to police , how much should you say ? Unfortunately , there 's no one-size-fits-all answer . But there are some factors to be mindful of when deciding how to handle your situation . <h> What 's Required ? <p> The law does n't  require drivers to answer all an officers questions .

An officer also has the right to insist that you ( and any passengers ) exit the vehicle . <p> But when it comes to responding to an officers questions , its generally up to you . The wisdom of talking to police depends on the situation . <h> When to Talk to Police and When to Keep Your Mouth Shut ? <p> First things first : Regardless of whether you decide to answer questions about the accident , you should always be polite to police . Being hostile or rude is n't going to help your plight .

@@25933724 @5933724/ <p> Thanks to television crime shows , almost everyone is familiar with the Miranda warnings ( i.e. the requirement of law enforcement to inform an arrestee of the right to remain silent , the right to an attorney , that if you give up these rights anything you say can be used against you , etc . ) . Unlike television , however , it is not always clear whether or not you are under arrest when speaking with law enforcement . Perhaps the police are only questioning you . Maybe you are being interviewed as a witness rather than a suspect . At what point exactly must law enforcement read you the Miranda rights ? In Commonwealth v. Ingram , 814 A.2d 264 ( Pa . Super . Ct . 2002 ) , the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that Miranda warnings are required whenever a suspect is subject to a " custodial interrogation , " meaning , whenever a person has " been deprived of his or her freedom of action in any significant way . " Specifically , the Superior Court found : <p> Miranda warnings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Custodial interrogation has been defined as " questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his or her freedom of action in any significant way . " Interrogation occurs where the police should know that their words or actions are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect . <p> I 'd . at 270-71 . The term Miranda , of course , refer to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) where the high Court upheld the fifth amendments constitutional privilege against self-incrimination finding that : <p> the prosecution may not use statements , whether exculpatory or inculpatory , stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination . . Prior to any questioning , the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent , that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him , and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the Miranda decision , the Supreme Court has broadened the scope of this Constitutional protection , noting that a conversation with law enforcement is a custodial interrogation warranting a reading of the Miranda rights whenever " a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave . " Thompson v. Keohane , 516 U.S. 99 , 112 ( 1995 ) . <p> As a general matter , when the state obtains evidence in violation of a suspects constitutional rights , that evidence must be excluded from trial . See Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 ( 1961 ) . Therefore , any statements made by a suspect during a custodial interrogation are subject to suppression if law enforcement has failed to first advise the suspect of their Constitutional rights . In other words , an incriminating statement or confession can be thrown out and not be used against in Court if it was obtained in a custodial interrogation without a reading of the Miranda rights . <p> What happens , however , when a person makes two incriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second afterward a Miranda warning . For example , the police interrogate a suspect without first mirandizing him . During that interrogation the suspect admits to a crime . He is then handcuffed and read his Miranda rights and asked to sign a written statement memorializing the contents of the prior confession . If the first statement was made during a custodial interrogation , then that statement is subject to suppression for the failure of law enforcement to protect his or her constitutional rights . You might be surprised to learn that the second statement could possibly be thrown out as well , even though the Miranda warning had been read . In Com . v. Spotts , 3491 A.2d 132 , 134 ( Pa . Super . Ct.1985 ) the Pennsylvania Superior Court found that the entire contents of a second interrogation could be suppressed as an exploitation of the first tainted statement . Indeed , the Court noted : <p> where an accused makes two inculpatory statements , the first without , and the second with , Miranda warnings , the Commonwealth must establish that the second statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Commonwealth must establish that the second statement was obtained in circumstances sufficiently distinguishable from the circumstances in which the first statement was obtained to purge it of the first statements taint . To determine whether the second statement was purged of the first statements taint , all of the circumstances in which the two statements were made must be examined . If that examination discloses that the Commonwealth has not sustained its burden of establishing that there was no taint , the second statement , as well as the first , must be suppressed . <p> I 'd . at 134. 1The underlying purpose of suppressing a second statement as the fruit of a prior illegal interrogation was explored in Com . v. Marabel , 283 A.2d 285 , 294 ( Pa. 1971 ) where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found such second statements to be involuntary psychological effects of the earlier unlawfully obtained admission or confession . In suppressing the second statement , the Court illustrated the adverse effect that the illegally obtained statement can have upon the accused and his constitutional protection from self incrimination : <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bag by confessing , no matter what the inducement , he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed . He can never get the cat back in the bag . The secret is out for good .

Bayer , 331 U.S. 532 , 540 ( 1947 ) . <p> To determine whether or not a second interrogation is " sufficiently distinguishable " from the circumstances of the first unlawful interrogation , Pennsylvania Courts have measured the time between the two interrogations and found that shorter intervals of time can not adequately overcome the taint of the first illegal interrogation . For example , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in Com . v. Ware , 265 A.2d 790 ( Pa. 1970 ) that a short time lapse between the illegally obtained oral admission of defendant charged with manslaughter , aggravated robbery , and conspiracy and the subsequent written confession ( prior to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taint of the illegal custodial interrogation . In Ware the Commonwealth argued that the accused gave his incriminating oral statement one and one-half hours before the written confession was begun , during which time the accused was given the required warnings and was allowed to see his mother . Those facts , the Commonwealth argued , show that the written confession was not tainted by the prior illegal questioning and confession , and hence the written confession was properly admitted . The Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed , finding the Commonwealths argument to be without merit due to the short time lapse between the unlawful custodial interrogation and the second related statement ( i.e. only one and a half hours had lapsed ) . <p> In Com . v. Brooks , 364 A.2d 652 ( Pa. 1976 ) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a confession by the defendant made less than three hours after the initial illegal arrest following a homicide was the fruit of initial illegality and should have been suppressed , notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was in the meantime confronted with the objective reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confession from initial illegality so as to permit its introduction into evidence . The Supreme Court disagreed and suppressed the second statement finding the difference in time between the illegal arrest and the subsequent statement was less than three hours . <p> In Com . v. Flowers , 369 A.2d 362 ( Pa . Super . Ct . 1976 ) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that an incriminating statement followed within two hours of a defendants illegal arrest ; therefore it could not be maintained that there was any intervening act of free will of the defendant , who was warned of his constitutional right to remain silent by a trooper who testified that the defendant understood all of his rights . The Court found there was no attenuation of primary taint resulting from the illegal arrest and that the statement should have been suppressed . The difference in time between the illegal arrest and the subsequent statement was only two hours . <p> InCom. v. Farley , 364 A.2d 299 ( Pa. 1976 ) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a defendants oral and written admissions came shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the police station , the defendant did not have contact with anyone during his detention but was subjected to continuous police control and interrogation , there were no intervening events between the defendants illegal arrest and his subsequent confessions .

@@25933738 @5933738/ <h> Will My Personal Injury Case Go to Arbitration ? <p> Arbitration is a unique ( and some might say plaintiff-unfriendly ) process , so it 's important to understand what to expect . <p> Let 's look at how arbitration works in the context of a personal injury claim , the kinds of cases that might go to arbitration , and why plaintiffs almost always want to avoid committing to binding arbitration . <h> How Arbitration Works <p> Arbitration is a binding , essentially unappealable , procedure in which a claim is presented to either a single arbitrator or a board of three arbitrators . The rules of arbitration are usually fairly flexible . In general , some pre-hearing investigation ( i.e. , discovery ) is allowed , and there will usually be actual testimony by the parties and witnesses at the arbitration hearing . But the loser of an arbitration has very limited rights on appeal . The loser generally has to prove that the arbitration result was arbitrary and capricious .

There are a few key differences . Mediation is a voluntary , non-binding , procedure in which the parties to a lawsuit or claim meet with a mediator to try to resolve the claim . The mediator can be either a private professional or a judge or magistrate appointed by a court . Mediation is a very informal procedure . The lawyers for the parties will customarily prepare written mediation summaries for the mediator to read , and will make brief presentations at the mediation . There is no testimony at the mediation , although the mediator will generally welcome the parties to make brief statements themselves . After the opening presentations , the parties will go to separate rooms , and the mediator will then conduct " shuttle diplomacy , " going back and forth between the rooms to try to get the parties to settle the case . If the mediation succeeds , then the case is settled , and it is over . If the mediation fails , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose the prospect of getting your case in front of a jury , and you lose all the leverage that comes with that prospect . <h> What Kinds of Cases Go to Arbitration ? <p> The answer here is , " Not many , " and that 's usually a good thing for personal injury claimants . If you 're making a medical malpractice claim against Kaiser Permanente 's system of health care providers in California , you 'll likely need to go through the arbitration process ( it 's part of the fine print in your contract ) . <p> The other kind of injury-related claim that usually goes to arbitration is one that is specific to certain car accident cases , where the injured person files a claim under the underinsured motorist ( UIM ) or uninsured motorist ( UM ) provision in his or her own car insurance policy , and a dispute arises .

That 's all true , so why avoid the process ? <p> The number one reason is because , at arbitration , you lose the prospect of getting your case in front of a jury , and you lose all the leverage that comes with that prospect . Arbitrators are logical . They decide cases based on the law and the evidence . Insurers like that . But juries are emotional . While they usually decide cases based on the law and the evidence , that is not always the case . They can be inflamed , aggravated , and/or angered because of the defendants conduct .

The courts are in charge of interpreting and applying the laws to settle legal disputes <p> Aside from these and the other Articles , the other major components of the Constitution are the Amendments . The first 10 Amendments , known as the Bill of Rights , contain specific freedoms and rights of all US citizens , as well as limitations on how the federal and state governments may lessen those rights and protections .

Before a creditor takes money out of your bank account or sells your property to repay the obligation , a creditor must file a lawsuit against you and prove that you owe the debt .

A secured lender can repossess your car if you fall behind on your payment , and , in some states , your mortgage lender can avoid a lawsuit by initiating a nonjudicial foreclosure if you fail to stay current . <h> Determining Whether Youre Judgment Proof <p> In some cases , its easy to determine whether you are judgment proof , such as when you do n't  have anything of value that a creditor could take from you .

@@25933747 @5933747/ <h> Understanding Real Estate Liens <p> Whether by the homeowner 's choice or the actions of a disgruntled creditor or contractor , there are a number of ways that the owner 's title to the property can be " clouded " by the existence of liens meant to secure payment . <p> If you are a property owner , you want to own your property " free and clear " of anyone elses claims . That is , you do not want anyone else to be able to have a legal claim to a portion of your apartment , house , or parcel of land . <p> After all , if others can lay claim to the property , your resale value diminishes . Not only will buyers pay you less , since you can not sell them a property with " clean " title , but you might have trouble finding any buyers at all . After all , a buyer is unlikely to engage in an expensive real estate purchase if concerned that other claimants might come out of the woodwork . <p> As a property owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate liens that could cloud the title to your property . A lien is a claim against property made by someone in order to secure payment of a debt . The lien essentially makes the property collateral against monies or services owed to the other person or entity . <p> Collateral is an asset that has been pledged by the recipient of a loan as security on the value of the loan . If the recipient of the loan is unable to repay the loan , the lender will look to the collateral as a source for payment on the debt . <h> Types of Real Estate Liens <p> There are two main types of real estate liens : voluntary liens and involuntary liens . <p> Voluntary liens are created by a contract between the creditor and the debtor . The most common type is a mortgage , which is essentially a bank loan that is secured by the property itself . Banks give homebuyers sums of money in exchange for a promise to pay back that sum , with additional interest and costs , over a certain period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by IRS The number of tax liens filed by the IRS has decreased from years 2011 through 2014 . <p> The bank , of course , retains ultimate legal ownership of the property until the loan is paid off . Voluntary liens like mortgages are easily found and quantified ; after all , you are most likely the person who agreed to its terms . At some point , you as the homeowner agreed to the terms of the mortgage and you ( theoretically ) have a plan for when you will pay it off and gain ownership of the property outright . <p> Involuntary liens tend to be peskier , because they were n't created by the homeowner . Many of them are either tax liens or construction liens . <p> Tax liens are imposed by the federal , state , or local government based upon back property taxes that are due and owing against a particular parcel . Not only can these seriously impact your credit report , but until they 're paid off , they hamper your ability to sell the property . <p> Construction liens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an example , imagine that you hire a contractor to re-landscape your backyard .

These subcontractors and suppliers are not in contract with you as the owner , meaning that they can not sue you for breach of contract . However , they can file a lien on your property in the office of the county clerk . Typically , this would cause a dispute between you and your general contractor , and you would try to force the contractor to pay off the lien .

Both require court approval before they can be imposed on the homeowner . <h> Perfected and Unperfected Liens <p> Liens may be " perfected " or " unperfected . " Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors . Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien . The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection . Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor , some further step must be taken , like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office . <h> Selling Property That 's Encumbered by a Lien <p> If you are planning on selling property that has a lien on it , it is unlikely that the sale will close unless the debt is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to allow for a transfer of clear title . <h> Checking for Existing Liens When Purchasing Property <p> When purchasing real estate , it is important to make sure there is no lien on the property that will keep you from securing a clear title to the property . Generally , a bank or other mortgage lender will not provide mortgage financing until all liens on the property have been removed . A title search will usually indicate whether or not a lien exists and whether the seller is the legally recognized property owner . It should also indicate the exact legal description of the property , as well as providing details regarding a lien or other encumbrances against the title . <p> You can conduct your own search at the county clerk 's office in the property 's county . Some county clerks have websites that allow for title searches on the Internet , but these tmay not provide complete records . Therefore , you may want to hire an attorney or an abstract company to conduct the title search for you . <h> Transferring Property Without Removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed before title to property can be sold or transferred . But the lien will need to be cleared up if the buyer needs financing or wants clear title . If property is transferred without the lien being paid off , it remains on the property . Thus , in transfers between relatives , the new owner may be willing to take title to property that already has liens encumbering it . <h> Property Lien Disputes <p> If you have a property lien dispute , contact an experienced real estate attorney to help you resolve the dispute .

However , because the income limitations on eligibility for this credit have not been adjusted since 1983 , relatively few disabled people can qualify for it . <p> One of the smartest tax planning steps you can take is to take advantage of all the tax credits available to you . <h> Age &amp; Disability Requirements <p> There are certain requirements you must meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to be under 65 years old at the end of the tax year . You 're considered to be age 65 on the day before your 65th birthday .

This condition must : ( 1 ) be expected to result in death , ( 2 ) have lasted for at least 12 continuous months , or ( 3 ) be expected to last for at least 12 continuous months future months . <p> Substantial gainful activities are tasks or duties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do to care for yourself , like bathing or getting dressed . It also does n't include things you do for free , like engaging in hobbies , attending school or social programs , or going to clubs . Even if you do n't formally retire , you can still qualify for the credit if you stopped working because of your disability or handicap . <p> For the first year you claim the credit , a doctor has to certify that you were permanently and totally disabled on the date you retired . You do n't  need to file this certification with your tax return , just keep it with your records . IRS Schedule R , Credit for the Elderly or Disabled , has a certification statement your doctor can sign . You only need to obtain this certification once . <h> Disability Income <p> You must have taxable disability income to qualify for the disability credit . This is income paid under a former employers accident , health , or pension plan . This income is taxed the same as the wages you earned while working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not related to your disabilityfor example , withdrawals you make from your employers 401(k) plan . <h> Income Limitations <p> The disability tax credit is intended for people with very modest incomes . Thus , even if you satisfy the other requirements , you cant claim the credit if your income exceeds a specific threshold . This threshold is based upon your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) or your non-taxable benefits , like Social Security and pension payments . Your AGI is your total income minus certain adjustments for items like moving expenses , health insurance payments by the self-employed , student loan interest , IRA contributions , and alimony . It is the amount you report on line 38 of your Form 1040 , or line 22 of Form 1040A . <p> The income limitations for taking the credit based on tax filing status are as follows : <p> For a single person , head of household , or a qualifying widow : AGI of $17,500 or more , or non-taxable benefits of $5,000 or more <p> For married people filing jointly , where both spouses satisfy certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-taxable benefits of $7,500 or more <p> For married people filing jointly , and only one spouse satisfies certain other requirements : AGI of $20,000 or more , or non-taxable benefits of $5,000 or more <p> For married people filing separately : AGI of $12,500 or more , or non-taxable benefits of $3,750 or more . <p> These income limitations have not been adjusted for inflation since 1983 . They are now so low they make it impossible for most disabled people to qualify for the disabled tax credit . <h> Figuring Your Credit <p> Figuring out the amount of your credit is a multi-step process that can get complicated .

If you file Form 1040 , check box con Form 1040 , line 54 , and enter " CFE " on the line next to that box . <p> Unfortunately , the amount of the disability tax credit is quite modest . For example , a single individual with $11,400 in disability income would qualify for a $121 credit . <p> Generally , the amount of credit is limited to the amount of the taxes you owe . Thus , you get no credit at all if you owe no taxes for the year . Moreover , if your credit is more than the taxes you owe for the year , you ca n't claim a refund for the difference .

The answer is : an overwhelming majority of civil cases that settle well before reaching the trial stage of a lawsuit , nationwide . Whether we 're talking about a divorce , a car accident lawsuit , or a contract dispute , the parties in a civil case often choose to settle their case rather than leave their respective fates in the hands of an unpredictable jury .

For example , if a new employee requests Sundays off to observe her Sabbath , but no other employees want to work on Sunday , and you allow more senior employees to take the most desirable work schedules , you might not have to accommodate the new employees request .

@@25933759 @5933759/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Courts ' Authority to Order Alimony <p> Courts are able to hear and decide legal actions only when they have authority over the particular type of lawsuit or legal matter , which is called " subject matter " jurisdiction . For example , a divorce court ca n't decide suits involving speeding tickets because they lack subject matter jurisdiction . <p> Just as important , however , is the requirement that a court have authority over the parties in the lawsuit , which is called " personal " or " in personam " jurisdiction . Personal jurisdiction in divorce actions , and especially when alimony or support issues are involved , differs from personal jurisdiction in other types of legal matters . And , if you 're involved in a divorce where alimony is being asked for , you need to know when a court can order alimony . <h> Personal Jurisdiction <p> In most civil lawsuits , as opposed to criminal cases , a court 's personal jurisdiction is usually based upon where the defendant lives . For example , if you 're from Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the other driver lives , you ca n't sue the other driver in an Ohio court . That is because the other driver does not have enough contacts or ties with Ohio to justify forcing him to defend a lawsuit in another state . <p> In divorce actions , however , the rules for personal jurisdiction are a bit different : a court can have jurisdiction over a divorce based upon the contacts that the plaintiff-spouse has with the state and regardless of the defendant-spouse 's contacts . For example , if you were married in Ohio and later moved to Tennessee where you now permanently live , but your spouse later moved to Nevada , you could file a divorce action in Tennessee . <p> However , the personal jurisdiction rules change a bit again when alimony is being requested in a divorce action . <h> Personal Jurisdiction and Alimony <p> In order for a court to have authority to order alimony or spousal support , the court must have in personam jurisdiction over the defendant-spouse , just as with all other civil lawsuits . <p> In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " minimum contacts " with the state where the divorce action was filed . The idea here is fairness : a defendant-spouse should n't have to go through the inconvenience and expense of having to defend an alimony action in a state where he or she has no contacts or ties and does not enjoy any of the benefits or protections of the laws and the courts of that state . <p> The reason for the difference in rules between the divorce itself and alimony is based on the fact that alimony involves money , and an order to pay money can be enforced by a personal judgment . Under these circumstances , the law requires that a court have personal jurisdiction or power over a defendant . <p> For example , if your ex-spouse is ordered to pay you alimony and he or she refuses to do so , you can file a lawsuit against your ex-spouse and get a judgment against him or her for the amount of past due alimony ( " arrearage " ) . <p> What are " sufficient minimum contacts ? " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant-spouse 's contacts with a state will permit a divorce court to order him or her to pay alimony . However , courts usually will find sufficient contacts when : <p> The parties were married in and lived in the state before the divorce and alimony actions were filed and the plaintiff-spouse remained in that state <p> The defendant-spouse is served with notice of the alimony action while he or she is in the state , even if only for a brief visit <p> The defendant spouse owns real estate in the state <h> Jurisdiction to Enforce Alimony <p> In general , if the parties no longer live in the same state , establishing a court 's power to enforce an alimony order can be questionable or difficult . However , a court in the recipient spouse 's state will enforce an alimony order when : <p> The payor-spouse has been ordered to pay a lump sum of money as alimony and has not done so , or <p> The payor-spouse has not made alimony installment payments as ordered by a court , such as monthly payments , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife left me , moved to another state , and then filed for divorce .

@@25933760 @5933760/ <h> Should My Divorce Lawyer Send a Settlement Letter to My Spouse ? <p> If you have a divorce attorney , but your spouse does n't , it might be more difficult to settle your case . <h> How Can My Lawyer Settle With My Unrepresented Spouse ? <p> Your lawyer can work on a settlement directly with your spouse and resolve your divorce on your behalf . But your attorney must be careful when dealing with an unrepresented spouseknown as a " pro se " litigantbecause a court will have to carefully review any settlement you reach to ensure its not one-sided . A judge wo n't enforce an agreement if it only favors you or if it gives you an unfair advantage over your spouseespecially if your spouse did n't have an attorney to review it . <p> Getting a fair settlement avoids the additional stress and money involved in going to court and asking a judge to decide your case . <p> Before sending a settlement letter , your lawyer should know : <p> you and your spouses financial situations , including your incomes , expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of your divorce , in " preliminary financial disclosures " <p> You should tell your attorney what you 're seeking from a settlement .

Whether you get what you want depends on your spouse , your demands ( they should be reasonable ) , and your attorneys skill at negotiating . <p> Resolving your case quickly and smoothly will help your children adjust to their new situation since you wo n't spend monthsor even yearsbattling it out in court . <h> Why Is It Helpful to Settle Your Case ? <p> Getting a fair settlement avoids the additional stress and money involved in going to court and asking a judge to decide your case . Settling will also allow you to resolve your divorce much faster than if you went to trial . For example , according to the results of a Lawyers.com survey of readers , divorcing couples in California who went to trial waited an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples who settled their cases . In Florida , divorcing couples that went to trial waited an average of 5 more months , and in New Jersey , it took our readers an average of 21 months to complete divorces that went to trial , compared to 6 months for cases that settled . Your lawyer will explain the pros and cons of settling versus going to trial , but in the end the choice is yours . <p> An agreement also takes the decision-making out of the judges hands and allows you to control your future by creating your own custody , child support , alimony , and visitation arrangements . Resolving your case quickly and smoothly will help your children adjust to their new situation since you wo n't spend monthsor even yearsbattling it out in court . <h> Who Makes the First Settlement Offer When a Spouse Is Pro Se ? <p> Many attorneys agree that it does n't  make a difference who sends the first settlement offer when one spouse is unrepresented . As long as the offer is reasonable , attorneys canand sometimes shouldget the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait for a pro se spouse to make an offer , which might never come . <h> What Are the Problems With Pro Se Spouses ? <p> There are some common issues that arise when dealing with pro se spouses , including : <p> they do n't  respond to letters <p> they make unreasonable counteroffers <p> they do n't  understand the legal aspects of the settlement offer <p> they think their spouseand their spouses lawyerare trying to con them <p> they just want to end the marriage , and get a settlement immediately <p> they call their spouses lawyer too often <p> they stall to make their spouse pay more money <p> they ask their spouses lawyer to complete work for them , which is n't allowed <p> there 's nobody to calm them down if they 're too emotional , and <p> they think their spouses lawyer can give them legal advice . <p> Your lawyer may suggest that your pro se spouse hire an attorney . This way , the negotiation process can move more smoothly , and a court will be less likely to consider claims that your attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement unenforceable . <h> Can Spouses Settle Their Own Cases ? <p> Yes . Many cases are resolved when the spouses speak directly to each other and reach an agreement . Divorcing spouses are often more satisfied when they 've been able to resolve their own case . If this happens in your divorce , and your spouse is pro se , your lawyer can draft the official divorce settlement , which should contain all of the terms that you and your spouse agreed on . <h> How Can You Get a Settlement When Both Spouses Have Lawyers ? <p> Getting an agreement is sometimes easier when both spouses have attorneys , as long as they 're both committed to settling the case and are n't  asking for outrageous things , such as millions of dollars in alimony from a spouse who makes $200,000 a year . <p> There are two theories about who should make the first settlement offer when both spouses have attorneys . One theory is that , " He who moves first loses . " This statement means you want the other lawyer to make the first offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption that if you make the first offer , you must be eager to resolve your case , and you might take a lot less than you 're entitled to in order to settle it . <p> The other theory is that it does n't  matter who makes the first offer as long as the lines of communication are open . Regardless of who sends over the first proposal , most divorces end up settling without a trial . The old saying that many divorce cases are " settled on the courthouse steps " is often true , and many couples resolve their issues just before they are called to court . <h> What Should Your Lawyer Ask For in a Settlement Letter ? <p> Your lawyer knows to ask for everything you want , such as : <p> your specific terms for legal and physical custody <p> any visitation that you specify <p> a specific amount of alimony and child support <p> your proposal for what to do with the family home , and <p> your proposals for any other items , such as cars , personal property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negotiations begin by asking for more than what you think you can get . With a settlement , you 'll end up getting less than what you asked for , so in the first round , most attorneys ask for everything . This is called " negotiating from strength . " You 'll never get more than what you ask for , so asking for as much as possible often prevents you from walking away with too little . <p> Lawyers also know not to negotiate against themselves . If your attorney makes an offer , and your spouses lawyer says , " Not acceptable , send me another offer , " experienced attorneys wont accept that challenge , but will wait until they hear a counteroffer.

An arraignment is a proceeding before the court where the charges are formally read to him . He may also enter a plea to the charges at this proceeding . A plea is the defendant 's answer to the charges . <h> Charging the Defendant <p> There are a couple of ways that a defendant can be charged with committing a crime . One way is by indictment . An indictment is a formal charging instrument by a grand jury . The grand jury hears evidence from the prosecutor and decides if there 's probable cause that the defendant committed the crime . <p> Another way to charge the defendant is by an information . An information is a formal charging instrument directly from the prosecutor . The type of alleged crime will usually determine whether an indictment or an information is needed to charge the defendant . For example , a serious crime such as murder will usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defendant of Charges <p> Once an indictment or information is created , the defendant needs to be formally informed of the criminal charges against him . At the arraignment , a copy of the indictment or information is given to the defendant and read to him in court . The formal reading of the charging instrument is commonly waived by the defendant as a matter of convenience . <p> The main purpose of the notification requirement is to make sure that the defendant is fully aware of the criminal charges before he enters a plea . As long as he 's aware of the charges , any small mistakes in notifying the defendant at the arraignment will be excused . <h> Pleading at the Arraignment <p> The defendant will be asked by the court to enter a plea to the indictment or information . Common pleas by the defendant include guilty , not guilty and no contest . If the defendant refuses to enter a plea , the court will enter a not guilty plea for him . <p> In order for the court to accept the plea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plea must also be knowingly and intelligently entered into by the defendant . If the defendant pleads guilty , the court must determine that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats . <h> Right to a Lawyer at the Arraignment <p> The defendant has the right to have a lawyer at the arraignment if he 's charged with a crime that may lead to prison . The lawyer will be able to help explain the charges and the consequences of any pleas that the defendant may enter . The defendant can also waive his right to a lawyer if he chooses to do so . <p> If the defendant ca n't afford a lawyer , the court will appoint one for him if requested . However , if the charged crime is petty and ca n't lead to prison , the defendant does n't have the right to an appointed lawyer . <h> Presence of Defendant at the Arraignment <p> The defendant is generally required to be present at an arraignment . However , a court may allow a defendant to waive his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence is permitted only with the consent of the court . <p> Many courts will allow the use of video teleconferencing to arraign the defendant . The defendant must consent before it can be used . However , some courts do n't allow a guilty plea to be entered by videoconference . They require the defendant 's presence in front of the court at the arraignment . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Do I have to enter a plea at the arraignment or can I ask the court for more time and enter a plea later ? <p> If the charges against me were incorrectly written at the arraignment , will I be able to have reversed any later convictions against me ?

Fearing they might lose their dream house or the favorable annual percentage rate , potential homeowners just sign the documents oblivious of the hidden perils in such documents . Let us analyze some of the provisions potential home owners in such transactions should take a closer look at . <p> A. HOME MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS <p> Possibly , there are TWO critical terms , prospective home buyers MUST understand in a home mortgage note . Their home mortgage note is often a 10-page document with lots of fine prints . The TWO points are : <p> 1 . Pre-Payment Penalty <p> This provision is the fee or rather penalty for paying off your mortgage early . The rationale is you deprive the lender of interest over the life of the loan if you pay the mortgage off early . The pre-payment penalty range varies anywhere between 1% to 3% of your whole mortgage . This translates into at least $4,000 more on a $400,000 mortgage . <p> If you look at the loan documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is ESPECIALLY important if you were not told about such penalty , in advance . <p> 2 . Adjustment of Adjustable Rate Mortgages <p> The first word of caution is to avoid adjustable rate mortgages and instead take advantage of fixed-rate mortgages . <p> If you are still pursuing ARM , then you should be mindful of how much your loan adjusts when it becomes adjustable . The most common adjustable rate mortgages start adjusting after five years or so . This means if you do not know how much your loan adjusts , you could find your loan rising so that you can not afford it . This information could be found , often , on the second page of your mortgage note . The adjustment rate or " margin rate " should be between 2.5% 3% . If yours is higher , then you should have your attorney negotiate the deal or advise you on what you should do . This is important to note , even a 1% difference could translate into thousands of dollars over life of your home mortgage . <p> B. CLOSING DOCUMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing 100 pages or so of documents at a real estate closing . Here are SOME of those provisions : <p> Comparing Closing Statement with Good Faith Estimate : You should be given a closing statement at least 24 hours before closing . You should compare the closing statement with Good Faith Estimate . In particular , look for any fees including mortgage origination fees , appraisal fees , credit report fees . If the numbers with what you have on the Good Faith Estimate do not match , respectfully yet adamantly insist the numbers reflect the ones given to you on the Good Faith Estimate . <p> Removing " Hold Harmless Agreement " Clause : Hold Harmless Agreement clause absolves lending company , closing agent and lending officer of any liability for defects such as mold or Chinese drywall .

You see it everyday , at work or at school , for example . You see it in divorce sometimes , too . <p> In states where divorces are based one spouse 's fault , a spouse on the receiving end of the divorce papers might be able to raise one of the several defenses to a fault-grounds divorce . <h> Common Defenses in Fault-Based Divorces <p> The defenses available to you vary from state to state . Here are some of the most common . <h> Collusion <p> Collusion is an agreement between spouses for one of them to commit , or at least appear to have committed , an act that qualifies as grounds for a fault-based divorce so that the other spouse can get a divorce . Why make such an agreement ? In many states , getting a divorce based on grounds is quicker than a no-fault divorce . And , in a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be able to use collusion as a defense if , before the divorce is final , you change your mind about the divorce . <h> Condonation <p> Condonation is the forgiveness or acceptance by one spouse of the other spouse 's wrongful behavior that otherwise could be used as grounds for a divorce . <p> An example of condonation is a husband who does n't object to his wife 's adultery . If the husband sues his wife for divorce , claiming she has committed adultery , the wife may argue as a defense that her husband condoned her behavior . <p> Proving Condonation is n't easy . The defending spouse needs to prove the other spouse : <p> Knew about the defending spouse 's wrongful behavior <p> Forgave the defending spouse <p> Did n't deny the defending spouse sexual relations <h> Connivance <p> Connivance is when one spouse sets up or consents to a situation involving the other spouse who commits a wrongdoing , and that wrongdoing is grounds for a fault-based divorce . <p> An example is when one spouse gives the other spouse permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case the other spouse is n't considered to be at fault so a fault-based divorce wo n't be granted . <p> Connivance is used almost only in divorce actions based upon adultery . Connivance is different from collusion because , even though both spouses agree to the wrongdoing , the spouses have n't agreed in advance that a divorce is their goal . <h> Reconciliation <p> Reconciliation is a defense related to condonation . Like condonation , the reconciliation defense involves forgiveness on the part of the spouse that filed for divorce . The term often is used loosely to describe any forgiveness with resumption of the marriage relationship . <p> Reconciliation may include actions that happened before the divorce was filed , but more often it involves conduct that happened after the divorce was filed and before it became final . It simply means the spouses " kissed and made up . " <h> Recrimination <p> Recrimination is when the spouse who is being accused of misconduct claims the spouse who filed for divorce is guilty of wrongdoing , and that wrongdoing is grounds for a fault-based divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the recrimination defense . <p> In some states , recrimination is a defense only where one spouse accuses the other of adultery and the spouse who is being accused wants to prove that the accusing spouse committed adultery too . In most states , any misconduct by the spouse filing for divorce that qualifies as for grounds for a divorce can be used by the other spouse to put a stop to the divorce proceedings . <h> Motives for Defending a Divorce <p> Why would a spouse choose to defend against a divorce , knowing that , at least as far as other spouse is concerned , the marriage is over ? It 's a personal decision , and only the defending spouse knows the true reason . But , sometimes it 's pure ego - the spouse does n't want to lose . Sometimes , a spouse simply does n't want the marriage end , and raising a defense can stop the divorce , giving the spouse time to " make things right again . " <p> More likely than not , however , a spouse may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's because , in many instances , the spouse who is not at fault usually gets more when it comes to the property division or alimony or spousal support , for example . <h> Downside of Defending <p> Even when a defense is available , it may not be a good idea to raise it . In the first place , fault-based divorces usually are much more expensive than no-fault divorces , and raising a defense usually makes the divorce even more expensive and more time consuming . Without witnesses or other concrete proof , the divorce may turn into a " he said - she said " battle . <p> Also , the odds are , you wo n't " stop " the divorce . The courts are not in the business of forcing people to stay married when it 's obvious that one or both spouses do n't want to be married anymore . <h> Know &amp; Weigh Your Options <p> These and other defenses may or may not be available in your state , and even if a defense is available , there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some states , connivance can be used only when adultery is the grounds for divorce . <p> In any divorce , it 's probably best to talk to your attorney about whether it 's worth the time , money and effort to defend against a divorce action , or if it 's better to work at ending the marriage in a calm and fair fashion . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> What defenses to a fault-based divorce are available in my state ? <p> I filed for a no-fault divorce , and my spouse then filed for a fault-grounds divorce , claiming spousal abuse .

You get to- keep some property when you file for bankruptcy , including a certain amount of equity in your car and home .

You might try to repay a family loan or something else you feel morally obligated to do . This requires no court approval . The bankruptcy laws make it clear the reaffirmation rules do n't bar voluntary repayment . <p> It 's important to talk with your- attorney and understand why reaffirmation is needed in your case .

" Material " is generally shorthand for " relevant " ; its often used to refer to evidence that , if disclosed , could affect the outcome of a case . <h> Exculpatory Evidence <p> The Constitution does , however , require that the prosecution disclose to the defense exculpatory evidence within its possession or control . " Exculpatory " generally means evidence that tends to contradict the defendants supposed guilt or that supports lesser punishment . The evidence does n't  have to strongly indicate innocence in the way that an alibi , for example , would . Its generally enough that the evidence provides significant aid to the defendants case . So , information that affects the credibility of a critical prosecution witnesslike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for testimonyis among the kinds of evidence prosecutors have disclose . ( Giglio v. United States , 405 U.S. 150 ( 1972 ) . ) <p> Defense attorneys routinely submit requests for discovery , and they make sure to ask for the above evidence , which often goes by " Brady material . " The government violates the law by not turning over this kind evidence , even if the failure to disclose was n't intentional or was beyond the prosecutions control . <p> Brady v. Maryland <p> Brady v. Maryland was a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case . In it the Court held that its a violation of due process for the prosecution to suppress evidence that the defense has requested and that is : <p> material either to guilt or punishment and <p> favorable to the accused . <p> In that case , Brady and Boblit had been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death .

Maryland , 373 U.S. 83 ( 1963 ) . ) <h> Brady Violations <p> If the defense learns about a Brady violation after the defendant has been convicted , the defendant is typically owed a new trial if the nondisclosure was material . According to the U.S. Supreme Court , the missing evidence is to be considered as a whole rather than piece by piece , but its material only if there 's a " reasonable probability that , had the evidence been disclosed to the defense , the result of the proceeding would have been different .

Courts will find Brady violations in other circumstances too , as when the defense has made a very general request for exculpatory material or has n't  made any request .

In most cases , this is n't a problem , but sometimes the couple has separated and the plaintiff spouse ca n't locate the defendant . This article will explain your options when you cant find your spouse to serve the divorce papers . <h> Ways to Serve Your Spouse <p> Even if you 've already filed your divorce petition , you ca n't begin your case until your spouse is notified of the proceedings . There are a number of ways you can satisfy your states notice requirement . <p> The most common type of service is " personal service , " which means your spouse receives the initial divorce paperwork ( the divorce petition and a summons to appear in court ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spouse . In many jurisdictions , a sheriff or other government official will deliver these documents to defendants . In other locations , you can hire a private process server to serve your spouse . The person who serves your spouse then completes an affidavit confirming that service has been made ; you must file this affidavit with the court to prove your spouse has been notified of the proceedings . <p> Some state courts allow " substitute service , " where you ( or another authorized person ) leave a copy of the divorce paperwork at a location the court presumes your spouse will receive it , such as a home or work address . Some courts will also allow you to serve a defendant by sending the notice and summons by certified , registered , or regular mail . Check with a local attorney or your county court clerks office to see what types of substitute service are allowed in your jurisdiction . <h> Service by Publication <p> When you 've made numerous efforts to find your spouse without success , you should ask a judge for permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attorney will submit a request to the court , usually detailing the steps you 've taken to try to locate your spouse . If the judge believes you 've been diligent in your efforts to find your spouse , the court will issue an Order for Notice by Publication . <p> Your next step is to publish a notice of your divorce lawsuit in a court-approved publication , typically a local newspaper . Your local court clerks office can point you in the right direction , and some clerks office will even publish the notice on your behalf if you complete a form and pay a nominal fee . Normally , the notice must run in the paper a certain number of times ( usually three to four times ) over a certain number of weeks . Your spouse will then be given a certain period of time to file a response to the petition ( usually 30-60 days ) . After the waiting period , your case will begin even if your spouse has failed to respond . <h> Attempt to Locate Your Spouse <p> It 's usually in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can be cheaper and faster to do so . Also , a judge will expect you to make a diligent effort to locate your spouse before you ask for the courts help . You should , at a minimum , check the phone listings for the last known city your spouse lived in ( you can use whitepages.com to quickly and freely search for phone numbers ) . You should also check to see whether your spouse is at his or her last known address . If you know where your spouse works , you can attempt service there , or find out from the last employer where your spouse may be working now . <p> Your attorney may also be able to help you locate your spouse . Attorneys often have ways of tracking down individuals using their name , date of birth , social security number , or other identifying information . Your attorney will also likely have working relationships with private investigators and process servers who have experience serving spouses that do n't  want to be found .

In fact , during the first century A.D. , Christian monks provided shelters for inmates whose freedom the monks had purchased from the Crown . Over the centuries , religious groups operated facilities for social outcasts . Eventually , pre-release expanded to alleviate overcrowding due to harsh sentences for petty crimes . Residents were rewarded for good behavior , the precursor for explicit rehabilitation . <p> In the United States , the notion of transitional re-entry centers did not catch on with lawmakersonly the Quakers maintained post-release centers .

When that happens , whether the time spent at the halfway house will count towards the prisoners incomplete sentence is a matter of state law . <h> How Effective Are Halfway Houses ? <p> The federal government and the states have spent billions of dollars on halfway houses , assuming that they would cost less and cut down on recidivism .

The order usually comes out within a few weeks of the hearing , but it could take longer . For example , in California , the order should be issued within 30 to 90 days after the hearing . If you disagree with the order , you may file an appeal . The order should say the date by which your appeal is due . For more information , see How to Appeal a Workers ' Compensation Denial .

A deposition is a legal tool used to obtain testimony from you , or someone else involved in your workers comp case ( such as your treating doctor ) .

However , if you have an occupational disease or repetitive motion injury ( such as carpal tunnel ) , this line of questioning may take more time . <p> You will also be asked about your course of medical treatment and any physical limitations that you still have . For example , the lawyer may ask whether you received emergency treatment , what doctors you have treated with , whether you have any work restrictions , and what hobbies or other activities you are unable to participate in . <p> Although it may not be obvious , the lawyer will likely also ask questions to undermine your case .

If you have additional questions about divorce depositions after reading this article , you should consult a local family law attorney . <h> How A Third-Party Witness Gets Involved in a Divorce <p> For example , in a custody battle , nannies and babysitters are likely to have plenty of information about each spouses parenting abilities and involvement in the childrens lives . <p> Divorcing spouses and their attorneys can get information from third-party witnesses in a number of ways . <p> Attorneys may reach out and speak with a witness directly .

A witness can choose whether or not to speak to an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , but not the other . <p> Another way a witness may get involved in a divorce case is by signing an " affidavit , " which is a written document that contains sworn testimony and is signed before a notary public . An affidavit typically includes statements about issues relevant to the court case . When a witness has limited information , an affidavit may provide all the information needed from that person . <p> When a witness has a lot of information , or very important information relevant to the divorce , one or both attorneys may want to depose that witness . For example , in a custody battle , nannies and babysitters are likely to have plenty of information about each spouses parenting abilities and involvement in the childrens lives .

The attorney may also serve a " subpoena duces tecum , " which requires the witness to bring requested documents to a deposition . <p> The subpoena will state the date , time , and location of the deposition : They usually take place in the deposing attorney 's office . A court reporter will be present to record everything the witness says , either by stenograph , audiotape , videotape , or some combination . Both spouses and their attorneys may be present .

Unless an attorney instructs a witness not to answer , witnesses must answer questions truthfullyeven about personal matters . <p> Depending on your jurisdiction , there may be limits to how long a deposition can last . For example , in a Georgia divorce , the deposition may take no longer than seven hours , unless the court grants an extension . <p> If you 've received a subpoena to testify at a deposition , it 's a good idea to speak to an attorney , who can best advise you how to prepare for the deposition . <h> General Deposition Advice <p> If you 've received a subpoena to testify at a deposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can best advise you how to prepare for the deposition .

If you 're questioned about illegal behavior , an attorney can advise you whether or not to answer , but you should never give a false answer . Since you 're under oath , knowingly giving a false answer may amount to perjury and subject you to penalties or sanctions , possibly including jail time . <p> Do n't  guess at questions if you do n't  know or ca n't remember the answer . It can be hard to take an answer back by claiming later that you werent sure . Answer questions verbally rather than nodding or shaking your head , or using " mm-hmm " responses that could be misinterpreted on a transcript .

If you work at will , your employer can fire you at any time and for any reason that is not illegal . ( Its illegal to fire even an at-will employee for discriminatory reasons or in retaliation for making a workplace complaint , for example . ) Similarly , you are also free to quit your job at any time and for any reason . <p> Just because you can leave without notice does n't  mean you should , however . If you want your employer to give you a strong reference and keep you in mind for future opportunities , you 'll want to leave on a good note . <h> Make Sure Youre an At-Will Employee <p> In all states except Montana , you are presumed to be an at-will employee unless you have an employment contract that states otherwise . ( In Montana , you are no longer an at-will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if your employer does n't  have one , the first six months of employment . ) <p> If you are an at-will employee , you are free to quit your job whenever you wish , for any reason , with or without giving notice . However , if you have an employment contract for something other than at-will employment , you must abide by the terms of that agreement . For example , if your employment agreement requires you to give at least one months notice before you quit , you are legally obligated to do so . <p> Not all employment contracts are written and signed . If you promised your employer in person that you would give notice before leaving , for example , you might be obligated to do so .

Giving at least two weeks ' notice allows your employer to begin the process of hiring your replacement before you leave and gives you the time to wrap up the projects you 've been working on . If you extend this courtesy , your current employer is more likely to provide a favorable recommendation when you apply for another job . <h> Respect Your Employer 's Property <p> Whether you are an at-will employee or an employee with an employment contract , always try to leave on good terms with your employer .

For example , avoid updating your resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be working . <p> Likewise , do n't take office supplies , business records , client information , or any other property belonging to your employer . Not only is this conduct unprofessional , taking your employers physical or intellectual property may also be illegal .

In fact , most states ' laws -- such as those of California , New Jersey , and Florida -- require sellers to make formal ( often written ) property disclosures covering major home components , systems , and conditions . Check out the law in your state . <h> Burdening Sellers or Protecting Buyers ? <p> If you 're a home seller , you may view disclosure as a burden . It typically involves filling out a lengthy form , and remembering little details about your property that you long ago learned to live with . <p> Yet disclosure actually serves to protect both sides of a home-purchase transaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home that the buyer is n't told about , the buyer could get angry and try to sue you after the closing . Lawyers who deal with residential real estate transactions widely report that the most common source of lawsuits is nondisclosure . <p> Your seller 's disclosure form could help you avoid a lawsuit , showing what you know about the home 's condition and putting the buyer on notice . If a buyer knows about a problem and goes ahead with the deal , you 're not liable for future problems . <p> Providing disclosures does n't mean you 're giving a buyer guarantees about your home . You must give truthful information about defects you know about or should have known about but were perhaps ignoring . <p> It can be good idea to have your home inspected prior to putting it on the market and then to make needed repairs ( and include in your disclosures the items you wo n't repair ) . This helps avoid surprises and thus negotiation problems once a buyer makes an offer on your house . It reassures buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in good condition . Making repairs may even mean you can up your listing price . <h> What 's in a Disclosure ? <p> Most states ' laws contain a laundry list of home components and conditions that a disclosure has to cover . Either the law itself or the state association of Realtors may provide language for this , or may create actual standardized disclosure forms . Your real estate lawyer , broker , or sales agent can give you the form , or you may be able to find it online . <p> Typical seller disclosure forms are set up as checklists , with space for writing in details on defects or issues . <p> You do n't have to disclose every little scratch on the floor or stain on the counter of the home you 're selling .

This lawsuit may be based either on the state law requiring disclosure or , particularly if the state has no such law , based on fraud . If you ca n't reach a settlement , you 'll be faced with all the expense and hassle of going to court . <p> If a court decides in favor of the buyer , you may be responsible for : <p> paying for repairs and other damages resulting from the undisclosed defect <p> paying for the buyer 's attorney fees and costs of the lawsuit <p> in rare situations , actually taking back the house ( the legal terminology for which is that the court invalidates or " rescinds " the sale ) , and/or

But what happens if I lose my case and do n't  get an award ? Will I still have to pay my lawyer ? <h> Answer : <p> Workers compensation lawyers typically work on a contingency fee basis . This means that , instead of being paid by the hour for their services , they take a percentage of any settlement or award recovered on the workers behalf . The maximum percentage a lawyer can charge varies from state to state , but its generally in the range of 10% to 30% . In California , for example , the maximum fee is usually between 10% to 15% . <p> This type of arrangement makes legal services accessible to injured workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a lawyer hundreds of dollars an hour . With a contingency fee , the worker gets the benefit of hiring a lawyer , without the financial pressures of paying for legal fees out of pocket .

Your lawyer will incur various costs during your case , such as fees for requesting your medical records ( typically between $0.25 to $1 per page ) , deposition transcript fees ( depending on the length and location , fees range between $150 and $400 or more ) , and fees for doctor testimony at a hearing ( this could be $1,000 to $2,000 even in simple cases ) . <p> Before you hire a lawyer , you should ask the lawyer how attorneys fees and cost will be handled .

The idea here is to make sure that criminal trials are fair ; that persons suspected of crimes do n't get convicted and sent to jail unjustly and unnecessarily . The right to legal counsel helps to protect the rights and freedoms of those with little or no understanding of the law . It 's one of the hallmarks of the US criminal justice system . <p> This right to counsel , however , can be waived or given up by someone suspected of or actually charged with committing a crime . As an added protection , however , to your basic right to legal counsel , your waiver has to be knowingly , intelligently and voluntarily made . <h> Fifth Amendment <p> The Fifth Amendment gives us many rights and protections , one of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal case , you ca n't be forced to be a witness against yourself . In the famous case of Miranda v. Arizona , the Supreme Court of the United States determined that this right to remain silent included the right to counsel .

For purposes of the Fifth Amendment , " in custody " means that a police officer or other law enforcement officially significantly restricts or limits your freedom or ability to move . For example , if an officer places someone in the back of his squad car and begins asking her questions about a crime that was committed in the area , it would reasonable for her to think that she 's not free to get out of the car . <p> If the police question or " interrogate " someone who 's in custody without first advising him of right to counsel ( as well as the other Miranda rights ) , then anything he says to the police ca n't be used against him later in court . Once you 've been told about your right to a lawyer and ask for one , the police must stop questioning you until your attorney is present . <h> Waiver <p> You may waive or give up your Fifth Amendment right to counsel , which let 's the police talk to you and interrogate you , and anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , has to be knowingly , intelligently and voluntarily made .

So , the police ca n't ask a suspect who ca n't read to sign a piece of paper they call a statement of facts , but in reality is waiver of his Miranda rights . Likewise , the police ca n't use ( or threaten to use ) physical violence against you or your family to get you to waive your rights . <p> If you exercise your right to counsel and , later , voluntarily start or initiate a conversation with the police , then you 've probably waived your right to counsel , and the police can use anything you say .

For example , if you assert your right to counsel at arraignment and the police later initiate an interrogation and you waive your right to counsel for that interrogation , that waiver is invalid and the police ca n't use anything you say . On the other hand , once you assert the right , you generally ca n't change your mind and decide to represent yourself at trial . <h> Waiver <p> Like the Fifth Amendment 's right to counsel , any waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel must be made knowingly , intelligently and voluntarily .

No doubt that kind of behavior is unsettling , but the bigger concern should be whether you can do anything about it . <h> Who Owns What in the Marriage ? <p> As a general rule , all property couples acquire during marriage is considered joint or marital property , which will be divided between spouses in a divorce . When distributing property , most states , including New Jersey , use an equitable distribution approach , based on what sort of division would be " fair under the circumstances .

@@25933800 @5933800/ <h> Jury Verdicts in Criminal Trials : Unanimous , or Not ? <p> A unanimous jury verdict is one way to insure that a defendant is n't convicted unless the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt . <p> Prosecutors who seek to convict a criminal defendant must convince jurors that they can conclude , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the defendant is guilty . One way to insure that this standard has been met is to require every member of the jury to reach this conclusion . Requiring unanimity in jury verdicts is the rule in federal courts ( Rule 31(a) , Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ) , and in every state but Oregon and Louisiana , where less than unanimous votes can support a conviction ( unanimity is required in Louisiana for death penalty cases , however ) . <p> The requirement for a unanimous verdict means more than having jurors decide that a crime was committed . They must substantially agree as to the principal factual elements underlying a specified offense , and they may disagree as to other , tangential pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft , the prosecutors case might include evidence as to what the defendant intended to do with the stolen loot . The jury need not agree that these intentions were planned ; its enough if they agree , among other things , that the defendant intended to permanently deprive the owner of the stolen item . <h> How Do Juries Demonstrate Their Unanimous Vote ? <p> In order for a verdict to be unanimous , all jurors must have reached a final decision , one that is clear and unambiguous . The trial court judge is responsible for making sure that a verdict satisfies this requirement , and often does so by " polling " each juror in open court . Often the stuff of dramatic movie and television scenes , the judge asks each juror , " Is this is your verdict ? " Its not unheard of for a juror to say , " No , " at which point the judge will usually send the jury back for more deliberations . <p> The requirement for a unanimous verdict means more than having jurors decide that a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal factual elements underlying a specified offense . <h> Can Defendants Waive Their Right to Unanimity ? <p> Defendants in federal court can not waive , or give up , their right to a unanimous verdict . But a few states will allow a defendant to waive this right , just as the defendant can waive other Constitutional rights , such as the Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to testify . The majority of states , however , do not allow a defendant to agree to a less than unanimous verdict . <h> Unanimity and the Problem of Complex and Compound Crimes <p> A defendants right to a unanimous jury verdict becomes quite complicated when the charged crime is known as a " complex-compound " crime . These crimes target large-scale criminal activity , requiring that a defendant have engaged in a pattern or series of specified , illegal acts . The acts that constitute the pattern , known as " predicate crimes , " are defined elsewhere in the criminal code . For example , when the government charges someone with racketeering under the Racketeering Influenced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized crime of all varieties ) , the prosecutor will try to prove various instances of bribery , theft , and so on . <p> In the course of a compound-complex prosecution , the government will introduce evidence of many instances of illegal behavior . In theory , all of these acts add up to the pattern of illegality that makes up the compound crime , and typically , the charged crime requires that the jury find that the defendant committed , say , at least three of the underlying crimes . But , before a defendant can be convicted of a compound-complex crime , must a jury unanimously agree upon exactly which acts the defendant committed ? Or is it sufficient if they each agree that the defendant committed the minimum number of these acts , without specifically agreeing on which ones ? <p> For example , suppose the prosecutor introduces evidence of five predicate crimes , A , B , C , D , and E. The compound statute requires a pattern of at least three predicate crimes . Suppose all jurors agree that the defendant committed A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied . But now , suppose that each juror votes " guilty " for three or more crimes , but no crime receives a unanimous vote . Because each juror was convinced that the defendant committed three of the underlying crimes , does this suffice for a unanimous verdict ? This result is known as a " patchwork " verdict . <p> When there 's a possibility of a patchwork verdict , most often when the government presents evidence of more than the required predicate acts , the court should instruct the jury that they must be unanimous as to each of the required minimum acts . The judge does this by giving them jury verdict forms for each charged predicate act . On the form , if the vote is unanimous , the foreperson writes " Guilty . " Otherwise the form remains blank or , in the event of a unanimous not guilty vote , the foreperson writes " Not Guilty .

@@25933806 @5933806/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Reasons to Receive a New Criminal Trial <p> If a defendant is found guilty at a criminal trial , one of the first things he 'll usually seek is a post-conviction remedy for relief from the conviction . There are various remedies- you- can seek by motioning the court . A motion is a request to the court that asks for a particular decision . <p> A- motion for a new trial is very common . This motion requests the court overturn the jury verdict or judge 's decision and order a new trial . There are a variety of reasons why a court may agree . <h> Newly Discovered Evidence <p> You can- seek a new trial based on newly discovered evidence . The court is very strict on what evidence types- support a motion for a new trial . The four criteria that must be met to base a new trial on newly discovered evidence are : <p> The evidence is newly discovered and not known to- you during- trial <p> The evidence must be material and not merely cumulative <p> Your- failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The evidence will probably- mean a different result at a new trial <p> If- you know about- evidence at the time of trial , you- ca n't claim- after trial- the evidence is newly discovered . Newly available evidence is n't the same thing as newly discovered evidence . If- you know- the substance of the evidence at trial , - you ca n't later claim- it 's newly discovered . <p> The evidence must be material to the main issues of the trial . If the evidence is merely cumulative of evidence that the defendant already has in his possession , it wo n't support a motion for a new trial . Also , evidence that just further impeaches a witness whose character has already been shown to be questionable does n't support a new trial . To impeach means to question the credibility or honesty of a witness . <p> If the defendant could have discovered the evidence using due diligence , it wo n't support a new trial . Courts expect defendants to make an effort and discover any evidence that 'll support their positions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial based on evidence that he could have easily found . <p> The last requirement is that the evidence will probably result in the defendant being found not guilty . The defendant is n't entitled to a new trial if the evidence would n't have made a difference . All four of these criteria must be met in order to base a new trial on newly discovered evidence . <h> In the Interest of Justice <p> The court may overturn any conviction and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires . This means that it would be an injustice if the court did n't grant a new trial . The court has broad discretion to decide when a new trial is required . Various reasons have been held by courts to support a new trial under the interest of justice standard . Some examples include : <p> Jury bias- <p> Jury misconduct- <p> Improper jury instructions <p> Insufficient evidence to support a conviction <p> Misconduct on the part of the prosecutor <p> The judge did n't excuse himself from the case even though there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually only granted in exceptional cases .

Understanding your options can help you make informed choices after a car accident . Read on to learn more . <p> Every car insurance policy requires the policyholder to notify the insurance company of any " occurrence " or " event " that might trigger coverage ( and lead to a claim being filed ) . <h> Reporting the Accident Vs . Filing a Claim <p> Perhaps the first thing to understand is that there 's a difference between reporting the accident to your car insurance company , and making a claim under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policyholder to notify the insurance company of any " occurrence " or " event " that might trigger coverage ( and lead to a claim being filed ) . In other words , if there 's any possibility that you or someone else could ask for payment from the insurance company over an incident , you have to notify the insurance company of that incident . Most policies contain language that says the accident must be reported " within a reasonable time , " which could mean within a day or two . <p> As opposed to reporting the accident , filing a claim means asking the insurance company to provide coverage to you based on the terms of your policy . Depending on your coverage , that could mean paying for your car repairs , and/or paying your medical bills . It could also mean that the other driver files a third-party claim with your insurer , asking the company to cover his or her own losses stemming from the accident . <p> When we talk about making a claim versus reporting the accident to the insurer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you report the incident , the insurance company will probably assign an adjuster to investigate what happened , whether or not you end up making an actual claim . That means the insurer will try to obtain the police report , will contact the other drivers insurance company , and will try to get witness statements regarding the accident . <h> Filing a Claim Does Not Mean All the Facts Are In <p> It 's important to note that filing an insurance claim is usually only the first step in the settlement process . At the time you file , you may still be receiving medical treatment for your injuries , and the extent of those injuries might not be fully understood -- for example , how much additional medical care will you require ? How much will that treatment cost ? Will your ability to return to work be affected ? All of these questions can be unanswered at the start of the claim process . The same goes for questions of fault for the underlying accident . <p> Remember also that filing an insurance claim is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident claim to court via a personal injury lawsuit is a much more formal process , and all civil lawsuits are subject to a statutory filing deadline set by a law called a statute of limitations . Get the details about the statute of limitations in accident cases . <h> First-Party Versus Third Party Car insurance Claims <p> A third-party car insurance claim is one that you file with someone elses insurance company . In the context of a car accident , that usually means the insurance company of the driver who was at fault for the crash . In contrast , a first-party car insurance claim is one that the insurance company receives from its own policyholder . An example of a typical first-party claim is one filed under the terms of your own personal injury protection ( PIP ) coverage , to get payment for medical bills stemming from car accident injuries . <p> But here again , fault determinations do n't have to be concluded in order for a first-party claim to be made . For example , let 's say the insurance companies have n't concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear who was at fault , but you make a vehicle damage claim under your own collision coverage anyway . If the other driver turns out to be at fault , your own insurance company will probably get back whatever it paid out for your vehicle damage via negotiations with the at-fault driver 's insurer , and they may even get back any deductible you had to pay too . ( The lesson here is that you can always make a first-party claim under your collision coverage , regardless of who was at fault for the accident . ) <h> If You Do n't  Report the Accident to Your Insurance Company <p> After a minor car accident , you may be hesitant to make a claim at all , thinking your premium will go up . But if you do n't  file a claim -- or at least report the accident to your insurer -- there could be consequences . <p> Perhaps most importantly , if you do n't report the accident to the insurer , and a month or so later you ( or the other driver ) try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can count on the insurer trying to deny coverage . Remember , an insurance policy is a contract , and if you do n't do what the contract requires you to do , then you 've violated or " breached " the contract , which could allow the insurance company to wiggle out of paying or defending a claim . <p> For example , let 's say you were in an accident . Both cars appear to have very little damage , and neither you nor the other driver feels any pain or discomfort . So , you agree not to bring your insurance companies into the matter . <p> But what if , a few weeks later , the other driver calls you and says he has thousands of dollars in vehicle damage , plus he 's having serious neck pain ? Or , what if your car incurred a lot more damage than you initially thought , or you start having significant pain yourself ? Since you did n't notify the insurance company of the accident , they could refuse to pay the other driver 's damages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the financial hook .

The process is long , and it 's draining on all fronts . Your financial , physical and emotional resources are taxed . While many cases do end with a settlement , others do go to trial . Know what to expect if your case reaches this stage . <p> A trial can be viewed as a battle , an engagement , and there are formal rules to follow . There are rules governing trial procedures , and rules and laws that apply to the substance of your case . These laws and rules vary by state , or even at the local court level ; a general overview of the trial process will help you to make it through until the court issues its judgment . <h> Selecting the Jury <p> Jury selection is the first major step before your trial starts in earnest .

They 're either asked to stay for further questioning , or they may be excused , depending on their answers . <p> Court rules govern the subject and scope of questioning potential jurors . Here , each party is looking for jurors who can be fair and impartial . In a personal injury or professional malpractice case , for example , common questions might include whether the juror has any connection to the subject of the case or either party . If you 're suing for medical malpractice , you might be asked if you or close family members are health care workers or work for a hospital . Based on voir dire , a juror is selected , or excused . <p> When all jury members are selected , the jury is seated and the judge usually gives them general directions about their duties while serving . <h> Getting Started with Opening Statements <p> Next , each party 's lawyer makes opening statements .

Each party 's lawyer will examine or question their witnesses , and the opposing party gets a turn to cross-examine them . There can be several rounds of questioning , and rebuttal witnesses . <p> Part of your lawyer 's trial strategy is deciding who to call as witnesses and the order in which to call them to the stand . Expenses , such as expert witness fees , and convenience to your witnesses can be factors in placement of witnesses . You do n't want an expert witness with high fees waiting around to testify while the meter is running . Such unneeded expenses can impact the amount you actually receive from any award in your case . <p> The list of possible witnesses in your case , besides you , may include : <p> People close to you who can testify about your condition and the impact of your injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident ; this category can include independent medical examiners ( IME ) <p> Records custodians for medical providers <p> Any other witness who may offer useful testimony for your case <h> Other Evidence <p> Besides witness testimony , your lawyer will likely offer evidence such as medical or police reports , bills , photographs and other documents to prove your damages or elements of your case . Tangible items can also be offered as evidence . While presenting evidence can take time , and your lawyer puts great effort into the smallest detail , it 's all important in proving your case to the jury . <h> Final Arguments and Jury Instructions <p> The evidence closes , and each side addresses the jury in final arguments . Here , your lawyer argues your side of the case before the jury . As with opening statements , the order for final arguments follows the law and rules in your state .

The jury votes on a foreman , who leads the jury through their work . Jury instructions and questions are reviewed , and discussion of the case begins .

So what 's the rule for an RV ? <p> To search someones home , police normally need to first get a search warrant . Vehicles , however , are treated differently . For a vehicle search to be legal , police only need to have probable cause that there 's incriminating evidence inside . This is often called the " automobile exception " to the warrant rule . ( To find out more , read our articles on home and vehicle searches . ) <p> How then does a motorhome fit in ? An RV is neither home nor carits right in the middle . So which rule applies ? <p> The U.S. Supreme Court answered this question in California v. Carney , 471 U.S. 386 ( 1985 ) .

Evictions are expensive and time consuming . Most landlords prefer to avoid them and work with good tenants who are having momentary trouble paying the rent . <h> Mortgage Payments <p> If you own a home and cant pay your mortgage , your lender might allow you to temporarily stop making payments or lower your payments through a forbearance agreement .

Until 2010 , the legal landscape was patchy , with some states requiring employers to give employees lactation breaks and others ignoring the problem . However , this all changed when the Affordable Care Act ( more commonly known as the ACA or Obamacare ) passed . Now , employers nationwide must provide lactation breaks for nursing mothers . ( For more on pregnancy-related work issues , see Laws Protecting Pregnant Employees . ) <h> Federal Law : The Affordable Care Act <p> Under the ACA , covered employers must provide lactation breaks to nursing mothers .

Employers with 50 or more employees must provide breaks regardless of hardship . <p> Employers may not take negative action against employees who exercise their rights under the ACA by requesting time or space to express breast milk . <h> Break Time <p> The ACA requires employers to provide new mothers with lactation breaks for up to one year after giving birth .

The space must be protected from view by other employees and members of the public . The law does n't  require employers to provide a designated lactation room used only for that purpose , although some larger employers choose to do so . Allowing an employee to use an empty office or conference room and putting up a " do not disturb " sign would usually suffice , as long as employees can not see into the room ; an employee might need a screen or shade to block a hallway window , for example . <h> Retaliation <p> Employers may not take negative action against employees who exercise their rights under the ACA by requesting time or space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliating against employees for complaining , whether internally or to a government agency , that their employer has violated the law . <h> State Lactation Laws <p> Some states have their own lactation accommodation laws , which may impose additional requirements .

It can also waive your right to challenge certain aspects of probate . Are you willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location of the probate proceeding or challenge the qualifications of the person seeking appointment as personal representative ? That is what notice you are waiving .

@@25933833 @5933833/ <h> Waving the Right to Counsel <p> Criminal charges that could result in jail time entitle the defendant to a free lawyer . The deck is stacked against defendants who choose to represent themselves . <p> Is it ever a good idea to waive your right to counsel in a criminal case and represent yourself ? Deciding to handle your case pro sea Latin phrase meaning " for yourself " is almost never the right call . You would n't perform surgery on yourself and probably do n't  even cut your own hair . Why , then , would persons untrained in the law act as their own lawyer in serious legal matters ? <p> Let 's look at how to waive the right to counsel and the reasons self-representation is normally a bad idea . <h> When You Might Want to Represent Yourself <p> In a handful of situations , self-representation might be an acceptable option . For example , in small cases with no possibility of incarceration ( such as minor traffic infractions ) , the fine involved if you lose might be less than the potential attorneys fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same plea bargain to all defendants in your situationsuch as a first offense DUIyou may not believe that having a lawyer is worth the expense . Even in these types of cases , however , an initial consultation with an attorney will help you make the right decision about whether you should have a lawyer at your side . <h> The Right to Counsel <p> In criminal matters , the right to an attorney is in both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution . The Fifth Amendment , as interpreted by the Supreme Court , gives individuals the right to have an attorney present whenever they are in custody and being interrogated by law enforcement . The Sixth Amendment provides individuals with the right to counsel during all critical stages of court proceedings . In practice , this means all persons charged with any crime for which incarceration is possible are entitled to an attorney from the very first court appearance . If you can not afford an attorney in situations where the right to counsel applies , you may request a court-appointed lawyer free of charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar with the Miranda warnings given by police when they arrest people or otherwise restrain their freedom of movement . Those warnings notify the subjects of their right to an attorney even if they can not afford one , the right to remain silent , and that their statements can be used against them in court . <p> In practice , after giving the Miranda warnings , law enforcement will often ask arrested individuals to waive their right to have an attorney present during questioning . Indeed , they might ask them to sign a document indicating they have been advised of their rights , understand them , and choose to waive them . The police do this so that they can interview persons in custody and later use their statements against them in court . <p> The consequences to defendants who waive their rights and voluntarily speak to law enforcement are almost never good . Even in trying to explain themselves , unrepresented defendants often make mistaken or confusing statements that could hurt their chances in court . Prosecutors do not have to introduce evidence of statements made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure a jury hears testimony from interviewing officers about all of the statements indicating defendants guilt . <p> If law enforcement questions you in custody without advising you of your rights and getting a waiver , your statements will very likely be inadmissible in the case against you . Also , by waiving your right to counsel during custodial interrogation , you are not waiving the right to have a lawyer in your court case . Further , you can always withdraw a waiver of the right to counsel at any time . <h> Waiving the Right to Counsel in Court Sixth Amendment <p> In a criminal matter , a judge must ensure that pro se defendants understand their constitutional right to an attorney and the potential consequences of acting without counsel . So when a defendant decides to proceed pro se in court , the judge will always ask many questions to make sure that the defendant appreciates the risks involved . If a judge fails to make a clear record of a defendants knowing and voluntary decision to waive the right to counsel , a later conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even when a judge decides initially that pro se representation is appropriate , if the judge believes that a pro se defendant needs help at any point in the proceedings , the court might appoint a lawyer , so-called " shadow counsel , " to sit with the defendant to give advice and be available to take over as the attorney of record in the middle of the case . Judges , however , can not provide legal advice to unrepresented parties during the court proceedings . They must remain neutral and can only advise a pro se defendant of the importance of having representation . <h> The Pitfalls of Self-Representation <p> If you choose to represent yourself , understand that the world you 're entering is complicated and often obtuse . Because legal proceedings are governed by complex sets of rules and laws , lawyers go through rigorous training and qualification . Attorneys must graduate from law school and pass a state bar exam before they are permitted to practice law . Listening to lawyers and judges discuss a point of law in a court can often sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitfalls of self-representation are legion . Even in a fairly simple case , such as an assault , legal concepts like " self-defense " or " adequate provocation " will likely be misunderstood by the non-lawyer . In addition , the pro se defendant will not know the rules of evidence and could lose the case simply because a crucial piece of evidence was not properly introduced or kept out . Further , your opponent , a prosecutor , will show no mercy in exploiting your ignorance in order to win the case . The dangers of self-representation are indeed too numerous to mention . <p> If you are considering acting as your own lawyer , you should at least consult with an attorney at the earliest stage of your case to discuss how self-representation might play out in light of the legal and factual issues involved . Lawyers are unlikely to ever advise you to act pro se , but they can at least help explain the particular dangers in your unique circumstances and guide you on how to navigate those hazards should you choose to proceed on your own .

A flight risk is a defendant who 's likely to leave the state or country to avoid prosecution . In the federal system , the Bail Reform Act of 1984- balances the presumption of innocence- with the need to make sure of a defendant 's presence at trial .

For example , conditions for a defendant considered a flight risk might include surrendering- his passport , wearing an electronic tether or hiring private security guards . <p> If the judge determines that no bail conditions will reasonably guarantee a defendant 's appearance and the safety of the community , the defendant will be denied bail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British nanny charged with murdering an infant was denied bail and considered a flight risk because she was a British citizen , had few local ties and there was strong evidence against her . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Will travel for work factor in to the flight risk determination ? <p> It always seems that rich defendants get bail with conditions simply because they can afford it .

Generally , parents hold a preferred position under the law , which means a court will presume that the parent is the most fit and proper person to raise the child . Occasionally , someone can challenge this presumption by submitting evidence that the parent has neglected , abused , abandoned , or otherwise failed to care for the child . But even if a court decides that one parent is unfit , a judge will usually defer to the other parents rights . <p> In limited circumstances , both parents can lose their rights and a third party can gain custody of a child . Specifically , a non-parent can seek and potentially obtain custody of a child in the following circumstances : <p> both parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the child <p> the custodial parent has died , and the surviving parent is unfit or unwilling to take custody of the child <p> the child has been living with a third-party individual for a long period of time , or <p> both parents have voluntarily relinquished their rights to the child . <p> Child custody laws vary widely across the states . For example , in Michigan , a non-parent ca n't file for custody if the childs parents were or are married . But in Arizona , Colorado , and Illinois , courts have adopted the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act , which allows third parties to ask for custody if the child is n't in the parents physical custody . Its important to understand your state 's laws if you 're a grandparent , relative , or other person seeking custody of a child who is not yours . It 's a good idea to consult with a local family law attorney before you file a custody action . <h> Who Can Seek Custody of a Child ? <p> In order to file a request for custody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to the ability to demonstrate a connection to or interest in a matter . For example , a long lost cousin who has no connection or involvement with a child probably does n't  have standing to seek custody of the child .

In some states , grandparents are entitled to limited visitation rights when their own childthe child 's parenthas died . But parents and grandparents are not on an equal playing field when it comes to custody . Even grandparents who share a strong bond with a grandchild as active participants in the child 's life ca n't necessarily overcome the parental presumption of custody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in cases where a child has resided with the grandparent for an extended period of time at the parents request . In those cases , a grandparent has assumed the psychological role of a parent and may have a strong custody claim based on that role . Once again , the rules governing grandparent rights to custody are as varied as the state legislatures that write them . In Texas , a grandparent ca n't obtain custody of a grandchild unless there are serious concerns about the childs welfare or unless the parents consent to a change in custody . And grandparents cant file custody suits in Texasthey can only intervene in the parents custody case . In New York , grandparents can only petition for custody if the childs biological parents voluntarily relinquish parental rights and make the child available for adoption . <h> Stepparents <p> With divorce rates on the rise , it 's common now to see stepparents fighting for custody of their stepchildren .

For example , in cases where a stepparent is the only mother or father a child has ever known , a court may allow a stepparent to pursue custody in the event the childs biological parent and stepparent divorce . However , the stepparent would still have to overcome the other biological parent 's claims . <h> Other Non-Parents <p> Generally speaking , in cases involving other non-parents , a parents rights must be terminated before a non-parent can step in and obtain custody . As in any custody case , the final decision will be based on a childs best interests . Some situations where a non-parent might receive custody include the following : <p> Aunts and uncles . A biological aunt or uncle might obtain custody if the childs natural parents were abusive or neglected the child , and the aunt or uncle had formed a strong emotional bond with the child . <p> Partners of deceased parents .

Continue reading to learn more . <p> After a divorce with children , either parent can ask the court to modify a child support order . Whether the court will actually grant your request is another matter . Child support laws vary by state , but most courts need a compelling reason to change an existing order . <h> You Must Prove a Substantial Change of Circumstances <p> When you ask for a modification of child support ( an increase or decrease ) , you must prove that after the original order was issued , a substantial change of circumstances occurred , which makes the amount you 're paying or receiving inappropriate . What courts consider " substantial " depends on state law and the facts of each case . However , any of the following may provide a basis for modification : <p> a change in the child 's medical needs <p> a paying parent 's illness or disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income , and <p> a change in the child 's residence , for example , if the child now resides with the paying parent . <p> . . . you must prove that after the original order was issued , a substantial change of circumstances occurred , which makes the amount you 're paying or receiving inappropriate . <h> Income Is a Factor <p> Since child support is based primarily on parental income , a change in either parent 's earnings may provide a good reason to modify support . For example , if you agreed to a certain amount of child support based on your 2013 income , but you 've since been demoted or laid off , you may be able to decrease your child support payments . And if the paying parent starts earning more than when the support order was first issued , a court might modify the support amount to reflect the additional income . <p> But the amount of lost or increased income must be significant .

Some state courts limit how often parents can request changes to child support .

If you and your child 's other parent can reach a compromise , be sure to get the agreement in writing .

Although it sounds almost too good to be true , bankruptcy law gives you a way to rid yourself of a junior mortgageand still keep that house . Debtors do this by filing a " lien stripping " motion in bankruptcy court . Once granted , you stand to save thousands of dollars , because after you complete your repayment plan , the balance of the junior loan(s) will go away . <h> Secured and Unsecured Claims <p> A successful lien stripping motion works by transforming a junior mortgage from a debt that survives your bankruptcy , called a " secured debt , " into an " unsecured debt " a debt that gets discharged ( wiped out ) at the end of your bankruptcy . To understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of claims are paid in bankruptcy . <p> Unsecured creditors rarely get much at all .

" <h> Secured Mortgages Must Be Paid in Full <p> When you apply for a home loan , you agree to give the lender a " lien " or " security interest " in the property . The lien allows the lender to foreclose if you stop making payments . To keep your house , you must stay current both during and after your Chapter 13 case because you remain responsible for the outstanding mortgage balance until its paid .

Better yet , after you complete your repayment plan , any remaining balance gets wiped out ( discharged ) . Thats rightthe balance goes away . <h> Converting a Junior Lien From a Secured Debt to an Unsecured Debt Saves Money <p> Its easy to see why converting a secured junior mortgage to unsecured debt makes financial sense . If successful , a junior mortgage will go away with your other unsecured debts . Read on to find out how you can work this magic . <h> Requirements for Lien Stripping <p> Successful lien stripping in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves two essential components : You must prevail on a lien stripping motion , and you must finish your repayment plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior Mortgage Must Be Underwater <p> To strip a lien , you 'll file a motion in bankruptcy court , asking the judge to reach two conclusions regarding the value of your house : <p> The value of the house is less than what you owe ( it is " upside-down " or " underwater " ) , and <p> If you sold the home , there would be no money available to pay the junior mortgage ( by virtue of the market forces , the secured junior loan has become " wholly unsecured " ) . <p> If you 're successful , the judge will declare the junior loan " unsecured " and instruct the bankruptcy trusteethe person in charge of paying your creditorsto pay the junior mortgage as an unsecured debt instead of a secured debt . In other words , the junior mortgage holder will get paid , if at all , out of the pot of money available to all unsecured creditors in your bankruptcy . <p> Here are some examples of how it works . <p> Example 1 . You owe $115,000 on your first mortgage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value since you purchased it , and now its worth only $100,000 . Because your property is worth less than the first mortgage and there is no property value left to cover any part of the second mortgage , the second is considered unsecured and can be stripped off in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy . <p> Example 2 . You owe $145,000 on your first mortgage , $30,000 on a second mortgage and $15,000 on a third mortgage . The property is valued at $125,000 . You can avoid both your second and third mortgages in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy . <p> Example 3 . You owe $100,000 on your first mortgage , $20,000 on your second mortgage and $10,000 on your third mortgage . Your property is now worth $115,000 . The value of the property will cover your first mortgage and at least a part of your second mortgage . The third mortgage , however , is completely unsecured . You can strip off the third mortgage in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy . <h> You Must Finish Your Repayment Plan <p> The second requirement for a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . If you miss your payments while the plan is in force , the court will dismiss your case and the lien will stay in force , attached to the property until you repay the loan . You 'll receive credit for the amount paid on your account during your bankruptcy , but nothing more . <h> You Ca n't Strip Liens in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy <p> If you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and want to keep your house , you must repay all loans secured by the house , even if one of the loans is underwater . Until recently , some bankruptcy jurisdictions took a different view . However , in 2015 , the United States Supreme Court decided Bank of America v. Caulkett , holding that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filer cant strip off the lien of a junior mortgage holder on property that is the debtors principal residence . The Court based its decision , at least in part , on a prior case that prohibits a bankruptcy filer from altering the terms of a mortgage loan on residential real property . <p> The Caulkett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases , you can still strip the liens from junior mortgages <p> Avoiding a junior lien requires that you present expert testimony at an evidentiary hearing about the value of your house .

So , claims that a driver did n't know the speed limit , or did n't know that he or she was speeding because of a defective speedometer , will not stop a conviction for speeding . <p> In some states , " legal justification " defenses are available in speeding prosecutions . For example , where a driver is speeding because someone is holding a gun to the driver 's head , the speeding is not a voluntary act , and so the driver ca n't be convicted of speeding . <p> However , in some states , courts have rejected the " legal justification " defense in speeding cases . So , in such a state , for example , the fact that a driver exceeds the speed limit in order to pass the traffic in the right lane and make way for a police cruiser that was on an emergency run wo n't bar a conviction for speeding . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you understand the speeding laws in your area and the possible defenses that can be raised . <h> Legal Justification <p> " Legal justification " defenses generally available when the driver is charged with speeding include : ( 1 ) when a driver 's speeding was caused by the actions of the police or other law enforcement officers , ( 2 ) self-defense and the defense of others , ( 3 ) coercion , ( 4 ) necessity and ( 5 ) entrapment . <p> For example , a motorist 's claim that he exceeded the speed limit to get away from a police car that was being driven in a wild and erratic manner , causing him to fear a physical confrontation with the officer-driver , can be sufficient to avoid a conviction for speeding . <p> Speeding in response to an emergency that was caused by the actions of someone or something other than the police can be a valid defense to a speeding charge . <p> A motorist can raise this " sudden emergency doctrine " only when the alleged emergency made it impossible to comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency could have been avoided by the driver slowing his or her vehicle , there is no excuse or justification for the speeding . <p> Examples : <p> When a driver accelerates quickly and exceeds the speed limit as the only way to avoid a rear-end collision with a car that suddenly slows down in front of him , the excessive speed might be justifiable . <p> However , in the same situation , the speeding will not be justified if it can be shown that the driver could have avoided the collision by slowing his car . <h> Identity of the Driver <p> There can be no conviction for speeding when the prosecution does n't prove that the defendant was in fact the driver of the speeding vehicle . The identity of the defendant as the driver was established in instances such as : <p> The defendant was shown to have been in physical control of a speeding vehicle shortly before the police arrived at the scene , and <p> The defendant made a statement to the arresting officer that he had driven his truck into the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found sitting in the passenger seat <p> On the other hand , the driver 's identity was not established in instances such as : <p> Where the only connection between the defendant and the vehicle was the fact that the defendant was discovered driving the vehicle 90 minutes after it was involved in an accident <p> The defendant denied driving the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense and there was no evidence to establish that the defendant was driving at that time <p> Identity can be proved through direct evidence , such as an eyewitness who saw the defendant driving , or through circumstantial evidence , such as where soon after a witness saw skid marks on the highway and dust in the air , the police found the defendant alone in a vehicle that was lying on its top with its doors and windows closed . <p> Some state laws contain presumptions with respect to drivers and vehicles . For instance , under some state laws , it is presumed ( meaning accepted or assumed ) that the owner of a vehicle was its operator at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ownership of a vehicle does not justify a presumption that the owner was the driver at the time of the violation . <p> Again , it is critical that you understand the speeding laws in your state and whether any presumptions apply when you are planning a defense to a charge of speeding . <h> Identity of the Vehicle and " Selective Enforcement " <p> Another defense that might be used in a speeding case is the identity of the speeding vehicle . <p> This issue of identity comes into play most often when the case is based on radar device evidence , and more than one vehicle might have been in the zone where the radar gun or laser device was pointed . In such a case , the prosecution must introduce evidence to prove that the defendant 's vehicle was the vehicle found to have been speeding . <p> In addition , while an officer 's reason for stopping a particular motorist normally is not considered in speeding cases , it will be looked at under certain circumstances . Selective enforcement on the basis of race or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can show , for instance , that he or she was stopped by the police because he or she was African-American . <h> Jurisdiction of Law Enforcement <p> The lack of jurisdiction or authority of a particular police force or department to enforce the speed laws in the place where the defendant was stopped is an affirmative defense . In most states , the defendant has the burden of proof to establish an affirmative defense . So , in such a state , the driver will have to produce evidence that the police officer did n't have the legal authority to stop the driver for speeding . <p> In many states , there is an exception for " hot pursuit , " that is , when a defendant speeds in one jurisdiction , a suburb or town , for example , and a police officer from that suburb follows the car outside of the officer 's jurisdiction into the next suburb to stop or apprehend the driver .

A disgruntled employee returns to his workplace and opens fire . Two coworkers get into a heated fight that turns violent . A worker is sexually assaulted by another employee while working late . An employee attacks a customer while performing maintenance in the customers home . <p> Headlines like these give any worker cause for worry about what dangers might be lurking at the office or work site . But who is responsible for the consequences of workplace violence ? Do employers have a duty to keep their employees safe ? <h> Employers Duty to Prevent Workplace Violence <p> While there 's no federal law on workplace violence prevention specifically , the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ( OSH Act ) requires employers to provide a workplace that is free from dangerous conditions or hazards that are likely to cause serious injury or death . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include threats of workplace violence . <p> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , the agency that enforces federal health and safety laws , has the authority to issue fines when employers fail to protect employees from physical violence . However , the OSH Act does not give employees the right to sue their employers for injuries sustained by workplace violence . <p> Employees typically can not sue their employers for negligence or other civil actions in court . Instead , they must go through workers compensation . <h> Workers Compensation <p> Although employers have a duty to protect their employees from workplace violence , employees typically can not sue their employers for negligence or other civil actions in court . Instead , they must go through workers compensation . <p> While there are many benefits available through workers comp , payments are generally more limited than what a plaintiff can recover in court . To start , payments for wage loss and permanent disabilities are capped by law . And , workers comp does not provide compensation for " pain and suffering " the mental anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the injuries . In many civil lawsuits , pain and suffering makes up the majority of a jury award . ( However , a worker can still receive compensation for mental anguish through workers comp if the worker develops a psychiatric condition , such as post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , as a result of the violent incident . ) <p> State laws differ on whether there are any exceptions that would allow an employee to sue an employer in court for injuries caused by workplace violence . In many states , as long as the incident happened while the employee was on-duty or performing a work-related task , it is subject to workers comp . However , in some states , including California , the violent incident must also arise of out the employment in order to be subject to workers comp . For example , if the dispute was over a personal matter between two coworkers , the victim may be able to file a lawsuit against the employer in court . <p> The employee can always file a lawsuit against the third party who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always a viable option : Coworkers or third parties are often " judgment proof , " meaning that they have no assets or income to pay off a judgment even if the employee were to win his or her case . <h> Civil Lawsuits <p> Employers have a general duty to act with reasonable care to prevent violence at the workplace . This means that when hiring , employing , and terminating workers , they must take care to minimize the risk of workplace violence . If employers fail to meet this minimal standard , they can be sued in court for a tort called " negligence . " To bring a successful negligence claim , the plaintiff must show that the employer knewor should have knownof the threat of violence and failed to take steps to prevent it . <p> These lawsuits are generally brought by members of the public who were harmed by the workplace violence . For example , suppose an employee of a cable TV provider assaults a customer during a visit to her home . If it turns out that the employee had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this or failed to conduct any sort of pre-employment screening , the customer may be able to sue the employer . <p> As described above , employees typically can not file lawsuits for negligence against their employers . However , most states have exceptions for intentional acts by the employer . For example , if the owner of the company committed the violence , the employee could typically sue in court . In some states , the employee could also sue if the company acted recklessly in allowing the violence to occurfor example , by continuing to employ someone who has been violent towards others . <h> Employment Discrimination &amp; Harassment <p> Special rules apply when an employee is subject to violent behavior as a result of discrimination or harassment based on a characteristic protected by federal or state law , such as race , gender , religion , age , or disability . Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , and similar state laws , employers must take certain steps to protect employees from being harassed based on these protected characteristics . Employees may sue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . For more information , see our article on harassment during employment . <h> What to Do if You Suspect Workplace Violence <p> If you 're subjected to violent behavior at the workplace , or you believe that a coworker or third party poses a threat of violence , you should notify your employer right away . Whenever possible , put your notice in writing or follow up your conversation with your employer in writing . That way , you 'll have a record that your employer was aware of the danger . <p> You should also contact a lawyer who is experienced in employment law and workers compensation law . An attorney can help you determine whether the case should be filed in court or through the workers comp system .

Parents can reach their own agreements to change pick-up or drop-off times when things come up , but its still helpful to have a working schedule . Your order can also allow for a maximum wait period .

@@25933859 @5933859/ <p> It often happens that a client will come into my office right after their spouse has died . The question arises as to whether or not probating the deceased spouses will and opening an estate is required , worthwhile , or necessary . <p> The classic attorneys answer " it depends " comes into play here . Often , there will be assets in the deceased spouses name alone . In Bethlehem and other former steel towns , for example , there are asbestos-related lawsuits in which the decedent was a party . In this case , it is almost always necessary to open an estate for the decedent , as checks will be coming in the mail made payable to the decedent ; the spouse can not simply cash these checks even if the surviving spouse had a Power of Attorney , as the POA " dies " along with the decedent . Questions also arise as to the characterization of the money : is this money for bodily injury ( exempt from federal income tax ) or for lost wages ( taxable as income ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> RESIDENCE : Another typical question is the deed to the house . If the couple was married , it is presumed ( in Pennsylvania ) that the property was held as " Tenants by the Entireties " , meaning that title vests solely in the surviving spouse upon the death of the first spouse . This does not , however , mean that the deed or tax bills will automatically be changed at the courthouse : in fact , nothing will happen . This can prove to be troublesome when the surviving spouse desires to sell the house , perhaps years later . The surviving spouse must prove the death of the first spouse and Death Certificates are frequently lost . This is not fatal to the sale of the house , because Death Certificates can be obtained from the Commonwealth , but it will often delay the sale until the new Death Certificates can be ordered and received . <p> BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS : It is much cleaner if these accounts are clearly in the name of the surviving spouse .

The decedent may have been the spouse responsible for investments . The asset mix in the portfolio prior to his death may not be suitable for the surviving spouses financial needs . <p> REVISION OF SURVIVORS WILL : Although not required , it is again cleaner to have an up-to-date will and other estate planning documents ( trusts , powers of attorney , healthcare powers o attorney , etc . ) .

But that does n't  mean that your creditors wont receive payment . In fact , if money is available , creditors stand at the front of the line and get paid first . An heirsuch as a spouse , child , or friend entitled to inherit from youwill receive whatever is left after your assets are used to satisfy your obligations , if anything . In this article , you 'll learn about the payment of debt after death . <p> If your spouse or another heir wishes to continue to live in your home or retain the property , they will have to arrange with the creditor to pay the mortgage debt . <h> Are Your Friends and Family Responsible for Your Debt ? <p> Even though your heirs are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , exceptions to this general rule exist . For example : <p> a cosigner must pay any debt that person was obligated to pay beforehand , and <p> your spouse must pay for any debt incurred during marriage while you lived in a community property state . <p> The laws of your state might create additional responsibilities , too . For instance , in some states , a spouse remains legally responsible for your medical or nursing home bills ( sometimes referred to as the " doctrine of necessities " ) . <h> What Is a Probate Estate ? <p> If you own property when you die , your spouse or other authorized person might open up a legal proceeding with the local probate courtthe government entity that oversees the collection and distribution of any property that you own at the time of your death . All of your assets make up what 's known as the " probate estate . " <h> What Are the Differences Between Probate and Non-Probate Assets ? <p> Property that passes into your probate estate at the time of your death is a probate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a will , but might include property that you did n't  make arrangements for , such as miscellaneous personal property ( anything that you own other than real estate ) . <p> A non-probate asset automatically passes to your designated beneficiary ( the person you indicate should receive the property ) and isnt subject to creditor claims . Examples of non-probate assets include : <p> life insurance policies <p> retirement accounts with a named beneficiary <p> joint and survivorship bank accounts , and <p> real estate that automatically transfers to another person upon death ( for instance , if you own the property with another person as joint tenants ) . <p> However , keep in mind that non-probate assets will still be subject to the claims of secured creditors who have liens ( the right to take the property if you do n't  pay the loan ) on that particular property . For instance , you 'll have to pay off an outstanding mortgage before you can keep a house , or an automobile loan if you want to keep a car ( more below ) . <h> Funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for paying your funeral expenses . However , its common for a spouse or other loved one to pay for this cost before opening your probate estate because some probate courts require proof of funeral and burial bill payment before starting probate . <h> Secured and Unsecured Debt <p> Even though your heirs might not be personally liable to your creditors , the reality is that theyll likely have to pay debts with your remaining assets before benefiting from your bequest . Creditor payment rights differ depending on whether the debt is secured or unsecured . <h> Secured Debt <p> A lender does n't  want to lose money , so its common for the lender to require " collateral , " such as a house or vehicle , to guarantee payment of the loan . If you voluntarily enter into the deal , you 'll give the bank a " lien " on the home or car that will " secure " the debt . If you do n't  make your payment , the lien will allow the lender to foreclose on or repossess the property . But that 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some cases , your creditor can place a lien on your property without your permission , such as when you owe taxes .

If your spouse or another heir wishes to continue to live in your home or retain the property , they will have to arrange with the creditor to pay that debt . If your spouse or heir does not repay the secured debt , then the creditor can foreclose on the real property , repossess the vehicle , or take action to take back any other collateral for the debt . <h> Unsecured Debt <p> Unlike secured debts , you do n't  have to give the property you purchased back if you do n't  make the payment . Examples of unsecured debt include : <p> credit cards <p> leases ( such as an automobile or apartment lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other installment loans that are not collateralized . <p> Creditors of unsecured debt can collect against your estate from available probate assets , and a priority ranking system outlined in the law determines the payment of the creditor claims . For example , the estate will likely pay an outstanding spousal support obligation before a credit card bill . If there is n't enough money to fully pay all debts , creditors with the same priority receive an equal payment percentage ( a pro rata share ) . Creditors too low in the ranking system to receive anything must live with it and will have no further recourse for the unpaid balance . <h> Exceptions : Debts Discharged Upon Death <p> If your unsecured debt is canceled or discharged upon your deathwhich can happen in limited circumstancesthe creditor might not be able to make a claim against your estate .

The agreement should permit inspection of the property before closing , and terms may be renegotiated depending upon the outcome of that inspection . <h> What You Should Know About Inspections <p> A licensed inspector can provide a visual appraisal of the property to determine if there are any current or potential defects that have been overlooked . The inspector is looking for the same types of defects that a seller should disclose , but all too often is n't aware of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the title to a property can change hands , a title company or your real estate lawyer must conduct a title search , researching public records for any issues that might prevent a smooth transfer of the deed .

@@25933870 @5933870/ <h> Incomplete Crimes : Conspiracy , Attempt &amp; Solicitation <p> The criminal law punishes attempts , agreements to commit crimes , and requests that other people break the law . <p> Updated March 28 , 2016 <p> When we think of criminal acts , most of the time we assume that the actors intentions have been carried outthe store was robbed , the check was forged . But some crimes consist of actions that fall short of the final act of commission . These crimesattempts , conspiracy , and solicitationare known as incomplete , or " inchoate " crimes . <p> Incomplete crimes fall somewhere in the middle of the " commit a crime " process , which consists of six steps : <p> The actor gets the idea for the crime ( killing the victim ) . <p> The actor evaluates the idea , deciding whether to proceed . <p> The actor decides to go forward with the idea . <p> The actor prepares for the crime , by obtaining necessary weapons , for example . <p> We do n't  punish people for the first , second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea and a decision alone ; and we clearly we punish them for the sixth . But activity that happens in the stages in the middle , numbers four and five , is also punishable as an incomplete crime . <h> Attempts <p> An attempted crime is one that was n't finished , which failed to achieve completion for one of two reasons : <p> The defendant did everything she set out to do , but failed . For example , she decides to shoot the victim , buys the gun , follows the victim , shoots , but misses . This is known as a " complete attempt , " or <p> The defendant does some of the acts needed to finish the crime , but is prevented from succeeding or decides to quit . For instance , the defendant takes the steps noted above but changes her mind at the last minute , or is prevented from continuing by the intervention of a police officer . This is known as an " incomplete " attempt . <h> Can one " attempt " to do every crime ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain crimesthose that require " specific intent . " Specific intent describes the defendants state of mind , which is to achieve the result that the criminal statute prohibits . Specific intent crimes differ from general intent crimes , which require only the intent to complete the physical act . For example : <p> Murder is a specific intent crime because it requires the prosecutor to show that the defendant intended the victim to die . <p> Battery is a general intent crime , because it requires only that the prosecution prove that the defendant intentionally hit the victim , not that he wanted to cause specific injury or harm . <p> Its not easy to tell the difference between specific and general intent crimes . One way is to look at the statute of the crime itself : Does the definition include a requirement that the actor intends the result ? Under this test , its clear why " receiving stolen property " is a specific intent crime , because its definition includes receiving the property knowing that it is stolen . <h> What must the defendant do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concrete , substantial step towards furthering their intent to break the law before they will be guilty of an attempt . This is an act of perpetration ( Step Four , above ) , not mere preparation ( Step Three ) . So , for example , purchasing the weapon , without more , wont expose the actor to attempted murder , but aiming it towards the victim and firing will . <h> How are attempts punished ? <p> Interestingly , the crime of attempt was n't even a crime until the late 18th century ( before that , " a miss was as good as a mile " ) . After that , attempts were classified as misdemeanors , but today , almost all attempts to commit a felony are themselves felonies . Attempts to commit specific felonies are often punished at half the maximum allowed for the target crime ; if the target is a capital crime or carries life in prison , the attempt will be punished for a specific term of years . <p> Defendants who successfully complete a crime have also , in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyve committed an attempt and the resulting crime . They can be charged with both , and the jury can be given both verdicts to choose from , but defendants can not be convicted of both . In legal lingo , the attempt " merges " with the concluded crime . <h> Conspiracy <p> The crime of conspiracy is another incomplete , or inchoate , crime . Its an agreement , explicit or implied , among two or more people , to commit a criminal act . But its a very controversial crime , because its definition is so vague . Courts have struggled for years to differentiate mere ideas from agreements to break the law ; there 's a real risk that people will be punished for what they say , not for what they do . Indeed , historically conspiracy laws have been used to suppress controversial activity , such as strikes and dissent against public policies . <h> Is a mere agreement sufficient for a conspiracy to be formed ? <p> Historically , the state did not have to prove that the defendants did any act to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement to intervene prematurely , before anything dangerous had happened , and to target what turned out to be banter . Accordingly , modern laws require one step , however trivial , be taken by the actors toward furtherance of their goal . This is known as an " overt act , " and it need not be an attempt to further the conspiracy . For example , making a phone call pursuant to the agreement , or even attending a lawful meeting , may suffice . A single overt act taken by one member of the group suffices to prosecute every member , even members who join the conspiracy after the act has taken place . <h> How do prosecutors prove an agreement ? <p> The essence of a conspiracy is a mutual agreement to commit an illegal act or series of such acts . Every member of the group need not agree to every detail of the arrangement , nor must every member agree to commit each element of the offense . Its enough if each member agrees to commit or facilitate some of the acts that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with circumstantial evidence , from which juries can draw broad inferences as to a mutual plan . One way of identifying a conspiracy is to ask whether the resulting crime appeared to be " choreographed . " For example , imagine a car driven by Tom , in which Dick and Harry are passengers . Tom stops the car , Dick and Harry get out , leave the doors open , accost and rob the victim , jump back in the car , and Tom drives off . A jury could validly conclude that the robbery was planned by all three , who could be prosecuted for conspiracy to rob and robbery itself . <h> What is the punishment for conspiracy ? <p> Unlike the crime of attempt , conspiracy does not merge into the completed target act . As shown just above , all three defendants face two charges each : conspiracy and robbery . <p> In a typical state statute , the punishment for conspiracy will parallel the punishment for the target crime , so that conspiring to commit a misdemeanor will be a misdemeanor ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though punished less severely than the target felony itself ) . <h> What are the defenses to conspiracy ? <p> Defendants have offered several defenses to conspiracy charges , depending on the circumstances and the laws of their states . Here are a few of the common ones . <p> Abandoning the plan . Sometimes defendants change their minds and abandon the criminal plan short of accomplishing it . But a change of heart will not defeat a conspiracy conviction , because the crime is complete once the agreement is formed or , in some states , once an overt act has taken place . But if a conspirator withdraws from the plan ( imagine that Dick gets out of the car but runs away ) , that person at least avoids liability for the completed crime . <p> Conspiring to commit a crime that requires the agreement of two people . Some crimes , such as adultery and bigamy , by definition require the willing cooperation of at least two people . Put another way , one person alone can not commit these crimes , which also include dueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts will not allow convictions for conspiring to commit them , but some will disallow a conspiracy conviction only when the target offense has in fact been accomplished or attempted . Interestingly , this rule disappears in some situations when more than two persons are involved in the conspiracy the conspiracy and the target offense convictions are each allowed to stand . <p> Impossibility . Finally , defendants sometimes raise the issue of factual or legal impossibility as a defense to conspiracy . For example , are Jane and Carol guilty of conspiring to murder someone if the intended victim is already dead ? Or , are they guilty of conspiring to steal trade secrets that turn out not to be trade secrets at all , or of conspiring to receive stolen property that is n't really stolen ? Most courts will not recognize these " impossibilities " as a defense to conspiracy . <h> Solicitation <p> Solicitation is another incomplete crime , consisting of inviting , requesting , commanding , hiring , or encouraging another person to commit a crime . Traditionally , one could solicit only felonies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must the defendant intend when soliciting a crime ? <p> The prosecution will need to prove to the jury that the defendant intended the other person to do just what the defendant suggested . For example , a joking suggestion to harm someone , which is taken seriously by the listener , wo n't rise to the crime of solicitation if the defendant can convince the jury that the words were meant in jest . <h> What must the defendant do to justify a conviction for solicitation ? <p> The defendant must invite , request , and so on , but the actual target crime need not be committed , or even attempted , for the accusation of solicitation to stick . For example , if Able asks Bob to rob Victor , but Bob refuses , Able has still solicited Bob . However , if the request is never communicated , the crime may be attempted solicitation , as when Mary writes to Kay , asking Kay to perform an illegal act , but Kay never receives the letter : Here , Mary may be guilty only of attempted solicitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Solicitation is perhaps the most incomplete of the three crimes discussed in this article . If the listener agrees to do the act , the two have formed a conspiracy ; and if the act is accomplished or simply attempted , they become principals ( responsible for the crime itself or the attempt ) . So , on the time-line of criminal thinking and behavior , its at the far end , where merely asking someone to do a criminal act , without regard to that persons response , is criminal behavior . In a sense , a solicitation is an attempted conspiracy .

When the bankruptcy trustee sells assets in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case , or when a bankruptcy filer makes payments through a Chapter 13 repayment plan , a pool of money becomes available to pay creditors , and they can request payment by filing a " claim .

If all of the filers debts would be discharged ( wiped out ) , and no money would be returned , the filer wont have standing . <p> The debtor in Chapter 13 bankruptcy . By contrast , the filer will almost always have standing to object to a claim in a Chapter 13 case , because the debtors future earnings fund the Chapter 13 plan .

You , on the other hand , would have standing only if the dispute would lower your creditors claims enough to return some part of the $1,000 to you . <p> Example 2 . Suppose instead that you filed a Chapter 13 case and your plan proposes to pay your creditors 10% of their claims . If a creditor claims that you owe $10,000 when you only owe $2,000 , you can object .

Knowing what to expect will help you plan your strategy and maximize your chance of achieving your debt settlement goal . In this article , you 'll learn about tried-and-true negotiation techniques , the tax ramifications of credit card settlement , and why you might want to file for bankruptcy instead . <p> People who regularly negotiate assume that you 'll start with a low number and gradually increase your offernot start with the highest number you can tolerate . <h> Who Owns the Debt : The Credit Card Company or a Debt Collector ? <p> When you 're behind on a payment , your credit card company will likely attempt to collect from you for up to six months . If you do n't  bring your debt current within that time , you can expect the original credit card company to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional debt collector for a discount . Its important to appreciate the importance of who owns the debt because the original creditor and the debt collector negotiate in different ways . What you 'll be able to achieve often depends on whether you 're dealing with the original creditor or a company who 's bought the account . Here are examples of what you might expect to happen at each of these two stages of the process . <p> The credit card company still owns the debt . You 'll likely be asked to provide proof of your income and assets before the company will consider a reduction of any kind , and if you have assets or a job , do n't  expect to get a break . Also , you should realize that any information you provide will likely be used to collect the debtto your disadvantageat a later date . Specifically , if the creditor gets a money judgment , it will already have the information it needs to take money out of your bank account ( bank levy ) or paycheck ( garnishment ) . ( To better understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Debt Collection and Delinquent Debt Lawsuit : What to Expect When a Creditor Sues You . ) <p> A collection agency has bought the debt . After the original creditor charges off your account , you 'll remain responsible for the full value of the debt , but instead of paying the balance to the original creditor , you 'll pay the collection agency . A collection agency is more likely to settle your debt for less than what you owe because it bought your debt at a discount . The negotiation tips that follow tend to work best with a debt collector . <h> Choosing Your Settlement Number <p> First , you 'll decide how much you 're willing to pay to settle your debt . You 'll want to choose the highest amount that you can tolerate so that you feel comfortable walking away from the negotiation if it does n't  go as planned . If you skip this step , you 'll run the risk of getting caught up in the process and paying more than you might intend to pay . For instance , if you owe $10,000 , and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle the debt , $6,000 will be your highest settlement number . <h> Negotiating the Debt : Starting Low <p> People who regularly negotiate assume that you 'll start with a low number and gradually increase your offernot start with the highest number you can tolerate . Therefore , do n't  expect your opponent to be satisfied settling for your initial number . You 'll want to start by offering a lower settlement amount than what you 're willing to pay . For instance , suppose you owe $10,000 and your settlement tolerance ( the most you 'll pay ) is $6,000 . But you do n't  want to pay more than you must and hope that the creditor will settle for $3,000 . To give yourself the negotiating room you 'll need to work up to $3,000 , youd probably want to start low by offering $1,000 . <h> Refusing to Bid Against Yourself <p> " Bidding against yourself " happens when you raise your offer without waiting for the other side to respond with a counter offer ( their suggested settlement number ) . Your opponent might try to badger you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three thousand dollars is unreasonable . You 're going to have to come up with more money . Give me another number . " The best approach is to decline the request and ask the other side to counter instead . Asking someone to bid against their offer is one of the easiest ways to measure another persons negotiating skills and to raise the opening bid without making a counter offer . Although you can count on it happening , you wo n't want to fall for it . <h> " Respecting the Process " so You " Do n't  Leave Money on the Table " <p> Do n't  be surprised if you must call your creditor multiple times before reaching an agreement . You and the creditor will be more inclined to settle after exchanging multiple offers and exploring whether there 's an opportunity for a better deal . As often said in the negotiation world , a good negotiation requires you to be patient and " respect the process " so that you " do n't  leave money on the table " ( settle for an inferior deal ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sum Offer <p> Debt collection agencies typically expect employees to meet monthly quotas , so your chance of a lower settlement increases toward the end of the month . Also , a collector will be more interested if you offer to pay the entire settlement amount in one lump sum payment . A larger amount of money now is more enticing than a payment plan over time . <h> Getting the Settlement Terms in Writing <p> Once you reach an agreement , you 'll want to get the terms of your settlement in writing before paying the settlement amount . The letter should state the amount the creditor will accept in satisfaction of your obligation and the date you must pay the funds . If you skip this step , you 'll have a hard time proving the existence of the agreement . <h> Tax Consequences of Cancelled Debt <p> Under federal law , creditors must report canceled debt to the IRS , so if you successfully negotiate down your debt balance , you 'll receive a 1099-C for the forgiven amount at the end of the year . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit card company forgives enough debt , you might find yourself facing a significant tax billand it is n't easy to get rid of tax debt . In most cases , you 'll have to pay it . <h> When Bankruptcy Is a Better Option <p> If you owe enough credit card debt , bankruptcy can have a distinct advantage over negotiating down your debt . Why ? Because you wont pay taxes on credit card debt that 's wiped out in bankruptcy . If you 're not sure whether you should settle your overdue account or file for bankruptcy , you 'll want to consult with a professional . A bankruptcy attorney can assess your financial situation and determine whether you 'd benefit from a Chapter 7 bankruptcy , a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , or debt negotiation . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Would I be better off negotiating down my debt or filing for bankruptcy ?

This article will explain how to effectively and efficiently manage your attorneys fees during your divorce . <h> Understanding How Your Attorney Charges <p> First , have a conversation with your attorney about " billing , " which refers to how and what an attorney charges .

The retainer is the amount you have to pay up front to hire the attorney . Some firms have an " evergreen retainer , " which you have to replenish after it falls below a certain amount .

Provide your attorney requested information in a timely manner so he or she does n't  have to request it from you multiple times . <p> Do n't  use your time with your attorney as a counseling session .

Instead of focusing on how much you can extract from your spouse , concentrate on what you will need to cover your minimum expenses through the transition . Reasonable expectations are key to reaching a fast and inexpensive divorce settlement . <p> If you have children , do n't  treat custodial arrangements as a referendum on your parenting skills .

However , when you go into court , you need to keep something in mind : the judge is probably going to be older and more conservative than you are . While you do n't  think the little diamond in your nose is a big deal , he might . Judges have to make very important decisions about peoples lives based on very limited information .

Under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) , employees are entitled to earn overtime unless they fit into an exception .

For example , in California , you are entitled to overtime pay when you work more than eight hours in a single day , even if you do n't  work more than 40 hours in the week . <h> Q : When must overtime be paid ? <p> A:If you work overtime , you must typically be paid for it on the regular payday for the pay period in which you worked the overtime .

As long as you are covered by the federal FLSA and/or your state 's wage and hour law , you are entitled to overtime , unless an exception applies to you . The FLSA applies to employers in every state who engage in " interstate commerce . " Courts have interpreted this term very broadly , so all but the smallest and most local employers are covered . And , even these employers may be covered by their state 's overtime law . <p> If your employer is covered by the FLSA , you are entitled to overtime when you work more than 40 hours in a week unless you are an exempt employeethat is , unless you fit into an exception .

If you believe your employer has n't paid you overtime you are owed , consider contacting your state 's Department of Labor . <h> Q : Can my employer dock my salary based on hours worked ? <p> A:If you are a nonexempt employeethat is , you do n't  fit into a specific exemption under the FLSAyour employer must pay you only for the hours you work .

Receiving the same pay each week regardless of your hours or productivity is part of what makes you an exempt salaried employee , who does not have to be paid overtime . If your employer docks your pay when your work hours or productivity fluctuate , it may not claim that you are an exempt employee ( and therefore might owe you a substantial sum in unpaid overtime ) . <p> However , there are a few exceptions to this rule . If you are an exempt employee , your employer may legally pay you less than your full weekly salary in : <p> your first week of work ( if not a complete week ) <p> your last week of work ( if not a complete week ) <p> any week in which you took FMLA leave ( if not made whole by accrued vacation or sick time offered by your employer ) <p> any week in which you took an entire work day off for personal reasons other than sickness or disability ( if not covered by accrued vacation or PTO offered by your employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work day off for sickness or disability and you either were not yet eligible for or had exceeded your sick time under your company 's policy , and <p> any week in which you served an unpaid disciplinary suspension for breaking workplace rules , as long as your employer has a written policy about such suspensions that applies to all employees . <p> Your employer can also deduct the following amounts : <p> a penalty imposed in good faith for a major safety violation , and <p> any amounts you received in fees for jury duty , witness testimony , or temporary military leave . <h> Q : Someone who was hired after me is making more money than I am . Is n't that illegal ? <p> A:Probably not . An employer is free to pay employees according to their skills , experience , prior salary , or any other factor the employer deems relevant .

If a pay differential is based on a protected characteristicsuch as race , religion , or sexthat is illegal . For example , it would be illegal for an employer to pay Caucasian employees more than Latino employees for the same work . <h> Q : I was promised a raise three months ago , but I have n't gotten it yet . What should I do ? <p> A:Remind your manager of the promise and ask when you can expect your raise . In general , employees have no legal entitlement to raises . For example , your employer need not give annual raises based on the cost of living . This most likely means your employer is n't obligated to make good on its promise . <p> If you relied on your manager 's promise to your detriment , you might have a legally enforceable contract for a raise . For example , let 's say you received a job offer at another company for a higher salary . In response , your manager promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to stay . You turned down the other job offer but never received the raise . In a situation like this , most states would allow you to enforce your manager 's promise in court . <h> Q : If I sue for unpaid wages under the FLSA , what might I get ? <p> A:Damages available under the FLSA include back pay ( the wages you should have been paid ) , attorneys fees and court costs , and " liquidated damages " in an amount equal to your entire back pay award . ( For more information , see Liquidated Damages and Punitive Damages Under the FLSA . ) You can ask for wages going back two years before you file your lawsuit , or three years if your employer willfully violated the law . <h> Q : If my state 's minimum wage is different than the federal minimum wage , which do I get ? <p> A:Employees are entitled to the highest minimum wage that applies to them , whether federal , state , or local . Some counties and cities have their own minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal or state rate . <h> Q : I 've been fired . When should I receive my final paycheck ? <p> A:State law determines when final paychecks are due . Some states , such as California , require employers to pay you right away if you are fired . Other states allow employers to wait a few days or until the next scheduled payday ; for example , the deadline is 72 hours in New Hampshire and the next regularly scheduled payday in New York . In some states , the time limits are different if you quit or were laid off . To find out your states rules , see our final paycheck chart . <h> Q : My compensation is primarily based on commissions , and layoffs are coming . Will I receive my commissions ? <p> A:Believe it or not , the federal FLSA does n't give employees the right to be paid commissions . As long as you are paid at least the minimum wage for all hours you worked and receive overtime payment due to you , failing to pay you commissions does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you have no rights . If you have a contract with your employer that covers commissions , your employer must obey the contract 's terms . For example , if your contract says you will be paid all commissions upon termination , you are entitled to receive them . Or , if your contract says you will be paid all commissions earned during a quarter within one month after the quarter ends , you are entitled to payment on that schedule . <p> Some states protect your right to collect commissions , regardless of whether you have an employment contract promising them . In some states , such as California , employees are entitled to be paid for commissions they have earned just like any other compensation . Whether you have " earned " a commission may depend on your employer 's policies .

However , if an employer chooses to offer a break , it must be paid if it lasts for 20 minutes or less . Longer breaks need not be paid . However , employees are entitled to be paid for all time spent working , which includes time designated as a " break " if they have to work through it . So if you eat your lunch while working or during a work meeting , you must be paid for that time . <p> Some states have laws requiring employers to provide employees with unpaid meal breaks if their shifts last a certain number of hours . And a small number of states , including California , require employers to give employees short paid rest breaks , usually of about ten to 15 minutes . In some states , you can receive a monetary penalty if your employer fails to give you the required breaks . Contact your state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breaks . <h> Q : Should I be paid for the time I travel for work ? <p> A:It depends on when you travel and how long you are gone . Employees are not entitled to be paid for regular commuting time . However , if you travel for work , your employer might have to pay you for it . If your job requires travel during the work day ( for example , because you drive to customer locations to repair computer equipment ) , you should be paid for all of that time . <p> If you travel out of town on business , the rules depend on how long you are gone : <p> For same-day travel , you are generally entitled to be paid for all of your time , including travel time , less your commute to and from the transit hub ( from your home to the airport or train station , for example ) . <p> For a longer trip , you are entitled to be paid for all time you spend actually working and all travel time that takes place during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered " work time " for which I can be paid ? <p> A:Any activity an employee performs that benefits the employer is usually counted as work time .

Generally , this comes down to a claim that the parent would have chosen to abort the fetus if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect , or ; did n't fail to inform the parent of the risks involved with giving birth to a child with a serious defect . <h> Damages <p> Damages in wrongful birth cases usually are limited to medical costs and expenses associated with caring for a child with a serious medical condition or birth defect . However , in some states , like Illinois , parents may recover extra damages for the emotional stress involved with raising and caring for such a child . <h> Not an Easy Suit <p> A wrongful birth lawsuit is usually a complicated legal matter . That 's because of all the things a parent must prove to win the case . Often , expert witnesses , like other physicians , are needed to prove that the parent 's doctor was negligent . For example , they 're often needed to show that another competent and reasonable physician in the same or similar circumstances would have done something differently in the parent 's case , such as ordered a certain genetic test . <h> Do n't Be Confused <p> Some states , like New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongful life . They 're very similar to wrongful birth actions , but the main difference is that the child , not the parent , sues the doctor . Sometimes , a parent sues on behalf of the child , and sometimes the child sues the parent , too . <p> The main idea behind these cases is that the doctor 's negligence in failing to diagnose or discuss with the parent the risks of a serious birth defect led the parent not to terminate the pregnancy . As a result , the child asks for damages to compensate him for having to live with a serious birth defect or medical condition . <p> Also , many states allow parents to sue for wrongful pregnancy . This is where a healthy child is born , but the pregnancy was unwanted and unexpected . It usually involves a doctor 's negligence in performing a medical operation to prevent pregnancies , such as a vasectomy . Again , the regular rules for medical malpractice apply to these cases . <p> As for damages , parents typically may recover the costs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering caused by the medical procedure . Sometimes the parents may also recover damages for the medical expenses and pain and suffering connected to the pregnancy and birth , and the mother 's lost wages caused by the pregnancy . Though rare , it 's possible for parents to get damages for the costs of rearing or raising the child until he reaches the age of majority , usually 18 years old . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Can I sue for wrongful birth in our state ?

Depending on your finances , you might consider hiring a private lawyer with DUI experience . ( Another option , again depending on your finances , might be court-appointed counsel ; representing yourself is possible but often risky . ) <p> If you do decide to retain a private DUI lawyer , here 's some information that might help you decide whom to go with . <h> Do n't  Waste Any Time <p> After being arrested for a DUI , you should talk to an attorney right away , even if your first court date is a ways off . Defendants often need to act quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an attorney can tell you what to do in the short term . <p> For example , an attorney might advise that you immediately get into substance abuse treatment or start going to Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) meetings . And there 's typically a deadline ( usually 10 days or shorter ) for challenging or postponing the suspension of your license by the Department of Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) ( or equivalent state agency ) . A DUI attorney should be able to tell you how long you have and what you need to do to challenge the suspension . <h> Choosing the Right Attorney <p> There are lots of attorneys who handle DUI cases , so the process of picking the right one can be overwhelming . Below are some suggestions that might help you with your search . <h> Free Consultations <p> DUI attorneys usually offer prospective clients a free initial consultation . ( You do n't  have to hire a lawyer you consult with . ) Take advantage of this opportunity to meet the attorney face to face and get your questions answered . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperworkincluding citations and notices related to court dates , license suspensions , and DMV hearingsand a list of questions . <h> Questions to Ask <p> There 's no precise formula for evaluating DUI attorneys , but asking certain types of questions can help you make a decision . <p> Practice areas . You should ask how much of the attorneys practice is devoted to DUI law . Lots of attorneys handle DUI cases , but some work exclusively or almost exclusively on DUI cases . Attorneys who focus on DUI defense might be more likely to be up to speed on recent changes in DUI law . They also often have a good understanding of DUI trial defenses and plea bargaining options . However , a lawyer who has handled more DUIs than another is n't automatically the better option . The quality of the lawyers workoften indicated by reputationis another significant factor . <p> Lots of attorneys handle DUI cases , but some work exclusively or almost exclusively on DUI cases . <p> Experience . How long the lawyer has being doing DUI defense is another important consideration . The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surefire indicator of how good the attorney is , but experience is valuable . You 'll want to ask how much trial experience the attorney has ; some attorneys regularly do DUI cases but rarely go to trial . Trial record aside , repeated exposure to various kinds of cases can help a lawyer anticipate the possible outcomes you face . This kind of knowledge can be helpful in advising you on your options . Is a plea bargain a good idea ? Is going to trial worth it ? Is there any chance the prosecution will drop or the judge will dismiss the charge ? <p> Local knowledge . You might want to ask about the attorneys familiarity with the relevant court and DMV office . An attorney who regularly represents clients in a certain area will likely have personal relationships with prosecutors and judges and know their tendencies . The lawyer could , for example , know whether the prosecuting office always offers the same kind of plea deal for your kind of case . And practices of courts and DMV offices often differ by location . Attorneys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't  . <p> Fees . Having a clear idea of the amount you 're paying and what the fee covers is important . First , you 'll want to find out whether the attorney would charge you an hourly rate or a flat fee . With an hourly rate , the attorney bills you for the actual time spent working on your case . However , its more common for DUI attorneys to use flat fees . For instance , an attorney might charge $3,500 to handle your case start to finish . But you should ask what the flat fee covers . Oftentimes , an attorney will charge a flat fee that covers all work up until trial . If you decide to take your case to trial , there will be an additional trial fee . You should ask if the attorney anticipates any other additional costs such as investigations or expert witnesses . ( Having to pay an additional amount to go to trial or for expenses might cost you more but these costs are often integral to quality representation . ) <p> Scope of representation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee covers the attorney representing you in DMV proceedings . The DMV process is administrative ; it has to do with your license being suspended and is separate from your criminal case . Its often good to have the same attorney represent you in both the criminal and administrative casesthat way , you 're more likely to have consistent strategies . Some lawyers include DMV representation in their flat fees , while others charge an additional fee . <p> Wholl be handling your case . If you 're considering hiring a law firm with multiple attorneys , its a good idea to ask wholl be working on your case and coming to court with you . Clients sometimes feel they 've been misled when they think they 're hiring one attorneythe attorney they originally talk toand someone else from the firm shows up to court . A related but arguably separate issue is how many clients the lawyer or law firm has . Make sure to feel comfortable that you 'll get the time and attention you 're expecting .

Depending on your needs , it may have some benefits . In order to know whether buying a co-op is a good idea , you 'll need to understand those differences . <h> Co-ops Are Different <p> When you buy a co-op , what you 're really purchasing are shares in the corporation rather than actual property .

@@25933894 @5933894/ <h> Meeting Your Lawyer for an Initial Consultation <p> What to expect and how to plan for your first meeting with the attorney who will be handling your case or dispute . <p> An initial meeting with your attorney is important , not just for exchanging information about your case , but also for building rapport and trust . Commonly , you will first have a short phone call with the lawyer , who will then ask to meet you in person . <p> If you are n't yet certain you plan to use this lawyer , be sure to ask about whether he or she charges for this initial consultation . Some lawyers do free first consultations , others may charge several hundred dollars . <p> The more prepared you are . . . the easier this process will be , and the more you will impress the lawyer . <h> What Should I Bring ? <p> Here are some suggestions for what to bring to your meeting with your attorney . <p> A pen and pad of paper or the electronic equivalent ! In the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write down notes on any issues or questions that arise . <p> A list of questions . Clients often have a million questions and concerns before a meeting , one or more of which they then forget to ask when sitting face to face with their attorney . Write these questions down ahead of time , to make sure you get every query answered while you 're sitting there . <p> A check for the initial consultation fee , if your attorney charges one . This should be discussed ahead of the meeting . Nothing gets a lawyer-client relationship off on the wrong foot faster than forgetting to make your first payment . Presenting that fee immediatelyshows that you 're taking the relationship seriously . <p> Any documents relevant to your case . If , for example , you are negotiating a lease and want the lawyer to review it , you should obviously bring a copy of the draft lease . If possible , make multiple copies of each document you give to your lawyer , so that you can take a set back home . ( Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies , but you 'll likely be charged at premium rates for those . ) <h> How Should I Act During the Meeting With the Lawyer ? <p> Treat your first meeting as a business consultation . While you are trying to develop a friendly rapport with your lawyer , you also want him or her to see you as a serious client with serious needs . <p> Be prompt . Lawyers value their time , since they generally bill by the hour . Showing up ten minutes late could throw off the rest of the lawyer 's schedule for the day . <p> Dress professionally . This does not necessarily mean you need to wear a suit , but you should wear the type of attire you would wear to any formal business meeting . This shows the attorney that you are a professional , and are taking your case seriously . <p> Let the lawyer do the talking , initially . You 'll have all sorts of information you 'll want to relate , but the lawyer will be better able to focus on the background facts he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with completed questionnaires ( if the lawyer sent you any ahead of time ) , documents , diagrams , and your own questions , the easier this process will be , and the more you will impress the lawyer . <p> Be honest . Remember that , even if you do not end up hiring the lawyer , everything you tell him or her during your meeting is generally subject to the attorney-client privilege . ( The biggest exception to this , not surprisingly , is if you tell your lawyer that you are going to commit a crime , which information the lawyer may be duty-bound to convey to law-enforcement authorities . ) In most cases , honesty is in your best interest . Lawyers seldom see cases that are cut and dried , with one party completely the " good guy . " It 's much better for the lawyer to know any bad news up front than to be surprised later with revelations you failed to share . ( In fact , the lawyer 's fee contract may mention that the fees will go up if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understanding of the Attorney 's Fee Structure and Related Costs <p> As part of your initial meeting with your attorney , it 's important to understand the anticipated cost of the representation and how this will be calculated . <p> Different lawyers bill their clients differently . Some charge by the hour ; some charge by the project , on a flat-fee or contingency basis . In the case of lawyers who charge hourly , some start out by charging a retainer , which is an initial up-front fee that they then bill against at an hourly rate until it runs out ( at which point the assumption is usually that you 'll be ready to pay more ) . <p> If the lawyer is willing to take your case , you should ask what he or she charges . Also ask when , exactly , you will be charged : quarterly , monthly , up-front , or at the conclusion of the project ? <p> You may be presented with a contract called a retainer agreement or a legal services agreement . This typically spells out the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fees that you will pay . The document is ordinarily a few pages long . The lawyer should explain it to you . Read and understand the document before you sign it . <h> Clarify What Will Happen After the Meeting <p> Be clear on what will happen next , and then be sure to follow through on whatever you 're asked to do by your new attorney . The attorney will need cooperation from your end . <p> Commonly , a lawyer will ask you to send additional documents or information pertaining to your case so that he or she can review it in detail . If it 's not clearly spelled out in your representation agreement , ask the lawyer how he or she would prefer to communicate with you ( email , telephone , or some other method ) , and then keep in contact regularly . <p> The lawyer may give you advice on how to proceed . This could be especially important when time is short . For example , if your business has been sued and you need to file a response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on the matter right away . By the end of your meeting , you should leave with a clear understanding of what you 've accomplished and what 's ahead . <p> Remember , you are under no obligation to hire a particular attorney merely because you had an initial meeting . Much like getting a second medical opinion before a surgery , it is common to seek advice from two or more lawyers before committing .

@@25933897 @5933897/ <h> Challenging a Will May Leave You with Nothing <p> Mounting a will challenge comes with serious risks , including the risk of spending a lot of time and money for a result of total disinheritance . <p> With a lawyer 's help , you can challenge the will of a deceased person , but the result may be uncertain , and you could end up with nothing at all . <h> You Must Have a Basis for Challenge <p> To challenge a will you must show that there is either something wrong with the will or that there was something wrong about the conditions under which the will was made . For example , you can challenge a will by claiming that : <p> the will does not meet formal requirements , such as the requirement for the signatures of two witnesses <p> the will maker did not have the legal capacity to make a will , or <p> the will maker made the will under suspect conditions , like fraud , mistake , or improper influence . <h> Flaw in Document Requirements <p> A formal will document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity , see below ) and by two adults who will not receive anything under the will . For most formal wills , those are the only requirements to make a will document valid . In fact , valid will can be very simple , and most wills are lengthy only to set out its terms , not to make it valid . <p> In some states , if the will maker writes the entire will in his or her own handwriting , no witnesses are required . These are called " holographic " wills . However , they are usually not a good idea unless your circumstances keep you from being able to make a formal , witnessed will . <h> Lack of Capacity <p> A valid will requires that the will maker possessed " testamentary capacity , " at the time the will was made . Sometimes this is known as " being of sound mind , " and it generally means that the will maker must know what he or she is doing by making a will . That is , he or she must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means to leave it to someone else through a will . Capacity also requires that the will maker meet the age requirements set by the state . This age is usually 18 , but some states allow younger people to make wills if they are married or in the military . <p> When challenging a will on the basis that the decedent did not understand the nature and extent of his or her property or who the property would go to without a will , you may be required to provide medical evidence showing mental impairment . <h> Undue Influence <p> A challenge of undue influence involves showing that the decedent did not make the will of free choice , but rather under the improper influence of another person . For example , if a lone sibling cares for an unwell parent , and the parents will gives that sibling a greater portion of the estate than other siblings , the other siblings may challenge the will saying that the caregiver sibling pressured the parent to change the will . <h> Fraud or Mistake <p> A will can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can show that pages have been inserted into the will after the decedent signed it or that the decedent 's signature was forged . <p> Mistake is also grounds for a challenge . For example , if a mothers will says that the majority of her estate should go to " John R. Smith " ( the name of her nephew ) , when her sons name is " John B. Smith " , her son could challenge the will on the basis that his mother simply made a typing error . <h> Challenges Are Handled in Probate Court <p> You challenge a will by filing a petition in the state probate court that has control over the will makers estate . The type of petition , the basis for the challenge , and the likely results depend on the state law where the court is located . Each state 's law has its own procedures for a will challenge for example , the deadline for filing your challenge and whom you must notify about your challenge and these rules can vary widely by state , and even by county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a will , a no-contest clause should n't be a deterrent to your challenge . <h> Risks of Challenging a Will <p> If the will you want to challenge contains a " no-contest " clause , you may risk losing any inheritance that the will provides to you . Many wills contain a no-contest clause which usually says something that boils down to " anyone who challenges this will without a good reason will lose any gifts he or she would otherwise receive through the will . " No-contest clauses are meant to discourage will challenges by beneficiaries who are disgruntled by how little the will leaves to them . <p> In reality , however , good faith challenges are rarely thwarted by a no-contest clause . So if you have a good reason to challenge a will such as those outlined above -- a no-contest clause should n't be a deterrent to your challenge . Also , the likelihood of a court upholding a no-contest clause varies greatly by state . So just because a will has a no-contest clause does n't  mean it will be enforced by the court who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging a will is the time and money that it will cost to mount the challenge .

All states have laws that protect children from being accidentally left out of an estate plan . Adopted children have this right in connection with their adoptive parents , but not their birth parents . For example , if a child is adopted in May , but the adoptive parent dies in July without updating his or her will to include the newly adopted child , that child will still receive a portion of the deceased parents estate .

" As long as there is no explicit intent to the contrary , an adopted child will usually be included in that group . <p> As adopted children gain and lose inheritance rights through adoption , parents also gain and lose related rights . For example , when a child is adopted , the adoptive parent gains the right to receive a share of an estate of a child who dies intestate , and the birth parent loses this right . The same gain and loss of intestacy rights applies to siblings as well : for the purposes of intestacy , an adopted child is connected to the siblings in his adoptive family , but not his biological siblings . <h> Step-Parent and Second Parent Adoptions <p> Step-parent and second parent adoptions work differently .

Jonas retains his parent-child relationship with his birth father , so he can still inherit from his birth father if his birth father does not leave a will . <p> This type of adoption requires the consent of the birth parents , and all parents have to work together on behalf of the child .

@@25933900 @5933900/ <p> There is a basic understanding that the person in back is always to blame for a rear-end accident . The general rule is that every vehicle must leave enough space between its self and the vehicle in front of them to allow time to slow , stop , or swerve if necessary . Logically a rear-end collision should never occur , if all vehicles are adequately spaced apart . However , there are situations in which the vehicle in front will be determined the cause of a rear-end collision . How can this be ? Well , these exceptions to the general rule do prove just as logical . <p> 1 . Vehicle in Front is Traveling in Reverse <p> If the vehicle in front is actually traveling in reverse , and collides with another , the back vehicle will not be found at fault . Clearly the vehicle traveling in reverse is assuming a heightened standard of care to avoid such a collision . Driving in reverse , even if permitted by law , will be presumed to have been preformed negligently ( with very little room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Three Vehicles , Two Impacts <p> Often rear-end collisions involve more than one vehicle . Perhaps the vehicle in the back rear-ends a vehicle and it is pushed into a third vehicle in front . Or , where one driver attempts to stop prior to hitting the vehicle in front of him , and is rear-ended as a result of his sudden stop . The most important factor in these cases in determining liability is the number of impacts felt by the front vehicle . If the driver states that he/she felt two or more impacts , it likely means it was rear-ended by the vehicle behind them , and then that vehicle was subsequently rear-ended by the vehicle behind it . So who is responsible ? <p> The two rear vehicles should both be responsible and share liability .

Sudden Activity <p> If a condition arises where a vehicle is forced to suddenly slam on their breaks , resulting in the vehicle behind it colliding into its rear , the vehicle in back is still responsible for the accident . Remember , the general rule is every vehicle must leave enough space between its self and the vehicle in front of them to allow time to slow , stop , or swerve , for whatever reason . However , if a vehicle suddenly appears in front of a vehicle traveling straight , the rear vehicle may not be to blame .

It makes no difference how you earn your winnings--whether at a casino , gambling website , church raffle , or your friendly neighborhood poker game . <p> It also makes no difference where you win : whether at a casino or other gambling establishment in the United States ( including those on Indian reservations ) , in a foreign country such as Mexico or Aruba , on a cruise ship , Mississippi river boat , or at an online casino hosted outside the U.S. <p> Gambling winnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair market value of any prizes or " comps " you receive as well . <p> If , like the vast majority of people , you 're a casual recreational gambler , you 're supposed to report all your gambling winnings on your tax return every year . <h> All Your Winnings Must Be Listed On Your Tax Return <p> If , like the vast majority of people , you 're a casual recreational gambler , you 're supposed to report all your gambling winnings on your tax return every year . You report the amount as " other income " on the first page of IRS Form 1040 . You may not subtract your losses from your winnings and you only report the amount left over , if any . You 're supposed to report every penny you win , even if your losses exceeded your winnings for the year . <h> You Can Deduct Gambling Losses Up to the Amount of Your Winnings <p> Although you must list all your winnings on your tax return , you do n't necessarily have to pay tax on the full amount . You are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Schedule A of your tax return . If you lost as much as , or more than , you won during the year , your losses will offset your winnings .

What about the remaining $2,000 of unclaimed losses ? It simply disappears . You ca n't use it to offset your gambling gains in other years . <p> However , you get no deduction for your losses at all if you do n't  itemize your deductions . Only about one/third of all taxpayers itemize . You should only itemize if all your personal deductions , including gambling losses , exceed your standard deduction for the year . <h> Some Gambling Winnings Must Be Reported to the IRS By the House <p> Casinos , race tracks , state lotteries , bingo halls and other gambling establishments located in the United States are required to tell the IRS if you win more than a specified dollar amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRS .

Instead of starting your business from scratch , you get goods , services , and a business name that the general public already recognizes and buys . But , for a variety of reasons , sometimes an entrepreneur wants out of the franchise business . <p> If the term of your franchise agreement is about to expire , then you really do n't have a problem : just let it expire , do n't exercise an option to renew , and your relationship with the franchisor will come to an end . But , what if you want out of the agreement early ? Basically , your only option is to assign or transfer your franchise to someone else .

It 's when someone else ( the assignee ) takes over your rights and responsibilities under the franchise agreement . Essentially , the assignee steps into your shoes as to the agreement . You can still run a business , but not that franchise . For example , say you bought a restaurant franchise .

These conditions , of course , are generally for the benefit of the franchisor , and they can vary significantly depending on the type of franchise and the individual franchisor .

And same-sex marriages are recognized by U.S. immigration law , so long as they took place in the United States or in a country where same-sex marriage is legally allowed . <p> You also need to prove that the marriage is bona fide . That means that you truly intend to establish a life together , and are not submitting the application as a mere sham to get a green card . <p> Another important part of the application process is proving that the foreign-born person is not " inadmissible " to the United States due to past commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or various other grounds . <p> Inadmissibility can be a major problem for couples who are low income . U.S. immigration law does not allow someone to immigrate who is considered likely to become a " public charge .

An unlawful stay of between 180 and 365 days will , if and when the person leaves the U.S. for a visa interview at the U.S. consulate in his or her home country , create a three-year bar on returning to the United States .

But what if you say to a large audience that someone should use their " Second Amendment rights " toward a political opponent ?

The Supreme Court has said it does n't  matter if the people making the threat do n't  actually plan to carry it out , because barring true threats protects the victims from the fear of violence as well as the actual violence . So intimidating actions like burning a cross can be true threats if they 're meant to make particular individuals or groups of people fear for their lives . ( Virginia v.

Let 's start with the basics . The party who brings the suit to court is called the plaintiff .

( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <p> Accepting a settlement offer in your Florida workers compensation case is a big decision . Before signing a settlement agreement , you should consider what you will be getting and what you will be giving up . <h> When Should I Settle My Workers Compensation Claim ? <p> In Florida , you can settle your workers compensation claim at any time if you have hired a lawyer .

However , you ( or your attorney ) will typically start the process by giving the insurance company a settlement demand .

This negotiation process can continue until you agree on a settlement amount . <p> If your claim is disputed , Florida law requires that you mediate your claim .

If so , you might be considering filing a lawsuit for legal malpractice . Suing your lawyer for malpractice can be a helpful way to get compensation for your losses . However , these cases can be very difficult to win . To find out whether you have a case , and how to bring one , read on below . <h> Common Claims Against Lawyers <p> Lawsuits against lawyers usually fall under three categories : negligence , breach of contract , and breach of fiduciary duty . <p> Negligence . Negligence is the most common grounds for a malpractice lawsuit . It happens when your attorney fails to use the skill and care normally expected of a competent attorney . For example , you might have grounds for a negligence suit if your lawyer missed an important deadline , failed to prepare for trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contract.Breach of contract occurs when a lawyer violates a specific term of the lawyers agreement with a client . For example , if your contract says that your lawyer will create a corporation for you by a certain date , the lawyer must stick to that agreement . <p> Breach of fiduciary duty . Lawyers owe certain fiduciary duties to their clients , such as the duty of loyalty and duty of confidentiality . Your lawyer must act in your best interests and must keep your communications confidential . For example , you might have a breach of fiduciary duty case if your lawyer lies to you , steals money from your client account , tells opposing counsel something you said in confidence , or represents another client whose interests oppose yours . <h> Challenges of Proving a Legal Malpractice Case <p> Most legal malpractice cases are based on negligence .

You must show that your lawyer failed to act with the knowledge , skill , and care of other qualified attorneys practicing under similar circumstances ( called the " standard of care " ) . Often times , lawyers must make strategic decisions or judgment calls , which do n't  always turn out for the best . However , its not malpractice unless your lawyer fell below the standard of care . <p> The third element is perhaps the most difficult to prove .

If you 're not happy with your lawyer , you can : <p> Switch lawyers . If you have n't suffered much damage yet , you may want to consider simply hiring a new lawyer . You 're free to switch lawyers at any time , except in rare cases . ( For example , a judge might not let you switch lawyers on the eve of trial because it would cause unreasonably delays . ) <p> Report the lawyer to your states disciplinary board .

A neutral third party presides over the arbitration , receives evidence from both sides , and makes a decision about what fees are owed . <p> If none of these options would help your situation , you should consult with a lawyer about whether you have a legal malpractice case . ( For more information , see our Legal Malpractice FAQ . ) <h> Hiring a Legal Malpractice Lawyer <p> Lawyers often take legal malpractice cases on a contingency fee basiswhich means they take a percentage of your award or settlement rather than charge you by the hour .

Consumers should also request a written copy of the shops repair warranty , which will specify what is warrantied and for how long . <p> When work is complete on a vehicle , the customer should request a final written detailed bill . The bill will specify such things as what work was done , what labor was performed and what parts were replaced . <h> Try to Quell the Dispute <p> Just because an issue has arisen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to immediately file a lawsuit .

" <p> It is important that the customer contact the body shop as soon as possible . Depending on the seriousness of the issue and the willingness of the shop , the body shop may be able to settle the dispute promptly . However , if it can not be resolved at this point , consumers should take the issue to the next level . <p> " If the shop is a referral shop for the insurer , then the shop has a lot at stake if they have made the insurers customer unhappy , " Castleman says .

You may also be able to use state-sponsored mediation and arbitration services to inexpensively resolve the issue . <h> Take Them to Court <p> If other tactics do n't  work , consumers should consider taking their complaint to court . In which court to file the case depends on the jurisdiction and the amount of damages being sought .

@@25933935 @5933935/ <p> This might come as a massive shock , but lawyers often tell lies not only to their own clients but also to the opposing lawyer and sometimes even the judge . By doing this , these lawyers churn their own clients money and also cause their clients adversary to spend more money on attorneys fees . Both clients lose money due to missed days from work . Lastly , the courts valuable time and other resources ( money for clerks and court officers salaries ) are wasted . Basically , nothing good is accomplished by these lawyers who lie and play games while engaging in difficult litigated lawsuits such as contested divorces , Family Court cases , and the area known as commercial litigation. Unfortunately for you the client , you must try to look for this quality right away in your own lawyer and not bury your head and allow your feelings about your adversary consume you . If you stick in your head in the sand ( so to speak ) , you are giving your lawyer a blank check to rip you off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the area of divorce casesand Family Court practice , also known as domestic relations law or matrimonial law. Take my word that there is nothing matrimonial about getting divorced or going to Family Court . This area of law is about as Anti-marriage and tumultuous as it gets . No lawyer can say that he/she comes across an example of egregious lawyer-lying every single day , but recently I came across an excellent example of this : <p> My client is the father of three ( 3 ) children , one of whom is already emancipated . In NY , your child becomes emancipated when he/she turns 21 OR if any of a short list of events takes place before your childs 21st birthday . I will emancipation at the bottom of this article . Remember that in NY , a non-custodial parent will not see his/her child support obligations terminate automatically upon a child becoming emancipated . For parents who are making payments directly to NYS Child Support Enforcement , if you want to end your payments , you must be ready to file the proper paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child lives right after he/she turns 21 or if any of the emancipation-triggering events takes place . It is true that a non-custodial parent can get an Order terminating a child support obligation in Supreme Court ( where your divorce case was filed ) , but I highly recommend filing your Petition in the appropriate Family Court . I have seen that the general public does not have a complete understanding of how effective Family Court can be . In comparison to NYS Supreme Court , the Family Courts are generally faster in scheduling your case for Court , along with being a most cost-effective Court to navigate and more favorable towards pro se parties . If a Motion of any kind is filed in Family Court , generally the judge will issue a Decision faster than if that same Motion was filed in Supreme Court . <p> My client waited until his middle daughter turned 22 before filing to terminate his child support payments for her . For his middle child , I filed his paperwork by Order to Show Cause ( which is the term that refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis ) because I was hopeful that the Court would immediately reduce his child support obligation for his middle daughter upon the filing of the Motion , meaning even before our first date in Court . It was worth a shot and my client agreed . The judge did not grant that relief , which is a type of injunctive relief , but at least the judge assigned a very quick return date for the 1st court appearance . You can see from pp. 1-2 that I filed the Order to Show Cause on Sept. 10 , 2014 and the Court assigned the date of Sept. 26 for our first court appearance . <p> To the amazement of my client and I , his ex-wife hired a lawyer who said that she intended to oppose this very basic and common-sense application . It is true that in some divorce settlements , the non-custodial parent will agree to provide financial support for the child(ren) past the age of 21 and the reasoning is that the parents want the child(ren) to be provided for until a four ( 4 ) year college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stipulation of Settlement in NY , can be in written form or placed on the record in Court but however it is done , it is a valid contract and each of its terms are enforceable if the other party is in breach . Since my client and his ex-wife never agreed to raise the age of 21 for emancipation ( for any of their children ) when they got divorced , he was fully entitled to file this Petition when his middle child turned 21 . Instead , he waited until their oldest child turned 22 and he did the same thing for their middle child . <p> We have an extremely permissive legal system in New York . This means that whatever ridiculous court filing a lawyer wants to make ( a meritless appeal , a Motion that is a waste of time , a request for discovery that is irrelevant to the merits of the case , etc. ) , the judge is virtually guaranteed to allow it to take place . If you are in federal court and your lawyer is engaging in gamesmanship , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at your lawyer . In my Family Court case , the ex-wifes lawyer filed a Motion alleging that the case law is clear on this issue and wrote that when child support has been ordered for more than one child , the emancipation of the oldest child does not automatically reduce the amount of support owed under an order of support for multiple children and that lawyer went on to cite 2 cases . <p> When this lawyer made this argument at our Sept. 26 court appearance , the judge himself said that he was not aware of this case law . When I looked up these 2 cases , I saw that neither of them supported the opposing lawyers argument . But the more forcefully that a lawyer goes about defending a certain point of view , even if the lawyer is making no sense at all , if that lawyers client is gullible or even worse , consumed by hatred and a desire for revenge against the opponent , the client will not see what his/her lawyer is doing and this will continue to waste time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-5 of the attached documents . <p> This lawyer lost and he lost badly . I am not posting this article to beat my own drum because I would much rather have resolved this case on Sept. 26 or on the next court date . Instead , the judge , in his Decision that granted my clients application , ordered that we all appear on Dec. 3 ( pp. 6-8 ) and on that day , the judge issued a Temporary Modification of an Order of Child Support that lowered my clients child support obligation from the high $900s by several hundred dollars . In all divorce and Family Court cases , there are Temporary Orders that are issued pertaining to child support as well as maintenance a/k/a spousal support a/k/a alimony ( all 3 terms mean the same thing ) and other issues . These Temporary Orders are almost always an excellent predictor of how the judge will rule on those issues , if the case goes to trial . I have seen this happen again and again . <p> For arguments sake , let 's say that once this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child support obligation ( for their youngest child who is still unemancipated ) is $675.00 bi-weekly , which means for each 2 weeks . If the judge issues this ruling on Feb. 15 , the new ( modified ) child support obligation will be retroactive to the date that I filed the Order to Show Cause for my client ( the week of Sept. 10 , 2014 ) . All the filings of Motions and Petitions seeking child support and/or maintenance in divorce and Family Court cases are retroactive to the same week that the Motion/Petition was filed . Since my client continued to have the amount of $900+ garnished from his paycheck by his employer all the way to our Dec. 3 court date , he is entitled to a credit for all the weeks that the old child support amount was garnished from his paycheck . <p> The ex-wifes lawyer is so stubborn ( and the ex-wife herself is so blinded by everything ) that we are still going back to Court . It is obvious that the judge wants this case to be over , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a lawyer who is manipulating his/her client . This is just not how judges normally act in the United States . This is why I always enjoy appearing before a pro-active and vocal judge , especially in a Family Court or divorce case . <p> This is a clear-cut victory for my client but then again , this issue should never have been litigated in the first place . Here are the grounds for emancipation:your child turns 21 years or , prior to turning 21 , A ) your child gets married , even if your child becomes divorced or the marriage is annulled or voided or if the marriage is voidable and your child still has not turned 21 yet ; B ) your child enlists in the armed forces but the emancipation lasts for only so long as your child is in the armed forces ( and has not turned 21 yet ) ; C ) your child begins working full-time , keeping in mind that once he/she stops working full-time , your under-21 child once again becomes unemancipated ; D ) your child moves away permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , boarding school , or college is not considered a change in permanent residence sufficient to constitute emancipation. <p> Regarding item D , if your child establishes a permanent residence but then moves back with the custodial parent ( all before turning 21 ) , then you , being the non-custodial parent , should get those child support payments ready . Of course there are nuances and what-ifs to the above conditions precedent , but the list above should give you a general idea . <p> Lastly , if an under-21 child who once lived in NY moves out of state with the custodial parent to a state such as Georgia where the law states that child support has to be provided only to the age of 18 , the non-custodial parent must continue making child support payments until that child becomes emancipated as per the laws of NY and not of the new state where the child lives .

Other arrangements are possible , however , such as an open listing , in which you agree to pay a commission to whichever agent brings in a buyer , or an exclusive agency listing , in which you agree that your agent is the only agent authorized to sell your house , but that you will pay a commission only if the agent brings in the buyer ( not , for example , if you do ) . <p> Duration of listing .

In the answer , the defendant will usually set out any defenses he or she plans to raise in response to the plaintiff 's claims . For example , if the defendant wishes to argue that the plaintiff 's suit is barred by the statute of limitations ( meaning the suit was n't filed within the time period allowed by law ) the answer will state that argument . <p> If the defendant does n't file an answer under the deadline set by the court 's procedural rules , the court will usually enter a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff . This means the plaintiff wins automatically , without having to prove the defendant did anything wrong . But the defendant can also come before the court and ask that the default judgment be " set aside " so that the lawsuit can proceed on its merits . <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit will proceed to trial , usually to be held before ( and to be decided by ) a jury , but sometimes before a single judge ( this is called a " bench trial " ) <h> Discovery <p> After a lawsuit is filed , both parties can use the discovery process to gather information about the case . A variety of tools they can be used to investigate the facts and the other side 's position , including : <p> Interrogatories ( written questions that must be answered under oath , sent from one party to another ) . <p> Deposition ( an in-person , out-of-court session where a party or a witness answers questions , also under oath , and the entire proceedings are recorded in a transcript ) . <p> Requests for Production ( usually this involves the parties asking for and exchanging documents that are relevant to the dispute ) . <h> Motions <p> While discovery is going on ( and after it has concluded ) , the parties will typically go before the judge and ask for different kinds of help ( ordering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial witness , for example ) and different kinds of relief , including motions for summary judgment , which can basically put an end to the lawsuit . <h> Trial <p> If the plaintiff and defendant ca n't reach a settlement , the lawsuit will proceed to trial , usually to be held before ( and to be decided by ) a jury , but sometimes before a single judge ( this is called a " bench trial " ) . <p> The basic process goes like this : <p> Jury selection takes place . <p> Each party offers an opening statement , explaining their side of the case . <p> Each side presents their evidence , and calls witnesses to testify . The plaintiff goes first . Each side also has the opportunity to question witnesses called by the other side ( this is called " cross-examination " ) . <p> Once all the testimony and evidence has been offered , each side will make a closing argument . <p> In a jury trial , the judge gives instructions to the jury regarding the applicable law and the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an effort to reach a verdict .

It also spells out what relief , if any , the plaintiff is given ( usually that means a specific dollar amount ) . <h> Small Claims Courts <p> Besides the standard civil lawsuit discussed above , in every state , there is the option of having certain disputes resolved in small claims court .

The defendant 's answer to a criminal charge is called a plea . The plea will help determine which direction the criminal process will go . <p> The defendant usually enters a plea at the arraignment .

But anyone looking to hire a lawyer needs to recognize that the practice of law is a business . In most jurisdictions and with most kinds of cases , a lawyer in private practice is going to charge what the market will bear , with the expectation of earning a profit . The economic impact of having a lawyer represent you starts with a basic understanding of the financial side of legal services . <h> How Lawyers Charge <p> There are a variety of different methods through which a lawyer might charge for legal services , and usually the type of case dictates the type of fee agreement .

" And the unsurprising answer is that it depends on many of the factors discussed in the next section , with a particular emphasis on geographic area ( rural area versus big city ) and the lawyers experience and expertise . <p> Hourly rates may vary anywhere from $150 an hour on the low end to $1,000 or more for high profile firms in major metropolitan areas .

In certain instances , the retainer may translate into a fixed fee paid on a periodic basis ( for example , monthly or annually ) to represent a client on routine matters . As an example , a corporation may pay a monthly retainer to a lawyer to attend board meetings and to provide advice on day-to-day legal issues that come up . The lawyer might prepare a written memorandum offering an opinion on a business issue that has legal implications , and the corporation would take that opinion under advisement in its business dealings . <p> A retainer may also take the form of a flat fee to represent a client on a specific matter , regardless of how much time or effort is involved in the representation .

Contingency fees are usually , but not always , calculated as a percentage of the recovery , and the standard percentage ( at least in personal injury and medical malpractice cases , where contingency fees are the most common ) is 33 percent . But keep in mind that the fee agreement may allow for a higher percentage for cases that go to trial ( i.e. 40 percent or 45 percent ) . This is called a " sliding scale " contingency fee agreement . <p> Finally , it 's important for any contingency fee agreement to spell out how costs will be treated -- specifically , whether the client will pay those expenses , and if so , when ?

Sometimes , an injury has stabilized , and the worker no longer wants to deal with the insurance company . Other times , the worker decides that taking a disputed case to trial is too risky and accepts a lump sum instead . ( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <p> Accepting a settlement offer in your Virginia workers compensation case is an important decision . Before signing a settlement agreement , you should consider what you will be getting and what you will be giving up . <h> When Should I Settle My Workers Compensation Claim ? <p> Unlike some states , you can settle your Virginia workers comp claim before you are fully healed from your injury . However , most workers wait to settle until their medical conditions are stable and not expected to improve any further . This is called maximum medical improvement ( MMI ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may worsen or you may need further medical treatment that is n't accounted for in your settlement . <h> How Are Settlements Paid ? <p> In many cases , settlements are paid in a single lump sum . However , some settlements are paid in installments over time ( called structured settlements ) . Typically , structured settlements are used in catastrophic claims or when a worker needs long-term care . They give the worker steady income through scheduled payments ( for example , on a weekly , monthly , or annual basis ) . Many structured settlements also include an up-front payment for unpaid medical bills and other expenses . ( For more information , see our article on the different types of workers compensation settlements . ) <h> What Rights Am I Giving Up ? <p> Most workers compensation settlements require you to give up all claims against your employer arising out of your work injury , including the right to any additional medical treatment , temporary disability benefits , permanent disability benefits , and vocational rehabilitation services . <p> Unlike some states , Virginia does not allow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement can not require you to give up " any and all " workers compensation claims .

For example , a limited settlement might settle your disability and vocational rehabilitation claims , but allow you to continue receiving medical benefits if you need treatment in the future . However , most insurance companies would rather close a workers compensation claim for good and end their obligation to pay benefits . <p> Once you and the insurance company have agreed on a settlement , the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission must approve it . <h> How Much Should I Settle For ? <p> Because every workers compensation claim is different , there is no simple formula to valuing a claim . Due to the complexity of Virginia workers compensation law , most workers hire a lawyer to help them evaluate settlement offers and negotiate with the insurance company . <p> When evaluating a settlement offer , you should consider several factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent disability benefits <p> any temporary disability payments that the insurance company failed to pay <p> the potential cost of your future medical bills <p> any unpaid medical bills to date , and <p> any penalties that the insurance company owes you for failing to pay your benefits on time . <p> You should also consider the weaknesses in your claim , if it is being disputed . When you take a case to trial , there is always a chance that you will lose . If there is a major dispute about your entitlement to benefits , and it is unlikely that you will win your case at trial , you may want to accept a lower settlement instead . Walking away with something is better than nothing . <h> Who Starts Settlement Negotiations ? <p> Because you are the one with the claim , you ( or your attorney ) will typically start the process by giving the insurance company a settlement demand .

The Commission will notify you if it decides to hold a hearing to review the settlement . <p> The settlement documents will set out the terms of your agreement and specify how the money will be distributed . Attorneys fees , unpaid medical bills , and unpaid child support payments might be subtracted from your settlement , for example .

However , they 're urging the Court to take a different route to that result .

Tax rates for ordinary income are 10 , 15 , 25 , 28 , 33 or 35 percent of taxable income . Capital gain usually is taxed at lower rates . No exemption is allowed to a taxpayer , such as an elderly parent , who can be claimed by another taxpayer , such as their adult child who is caring for the parent . <h> Gross Income <p> Gross income includes income from any source , whether in money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy favorable tax treatment .

Older persons nearing retirement who experience illness , injury or disability often receive payments of various types based on their physical condition .

If they do n't  , then they should . Performance appraisal is a highly effective way to nip potential problems in the bud , give employees the tools and information they need to succeed , and lay the groundwork for discipline and , if necessary , termination if the employment relationship just does n't  work out . <p> Despite these many benefits , some companies do n't  evaluate employee performance regularly . Of course , some of this is due to lack of time , other priorities , or sheer procrastination . But some employers avoid performance reviews because they fear it can lead to liability .

There are a few legal traps to watch out for , however . By avoiding these pitfalls , you can avoid creating unnecessary liability concerns : <p> Do n't  undo at-will employment . Most employees in the United States work at will , which means you can fire them at any time , for any reason that is not illegal ( discrimination is an example of an illegal reason to fire ) . If you make promises of job security , or state that employees wont be fired without good cause , however , you can undermine your right to fire at will . For example , if you say in a performance review that an employee " can look forward to a long future with us , " you may have undercut your ability to fire that employee later for poor performance or for financial reasons . Most employers do n't  fire without a reason , but reserving your right to fire at will means you wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jury . <p> Be consistent and fair . Discrimination claims start when employers treat employees in the same situation differently . Use the same standards and procedures to review everyones performance and conduct . If course , different jobs have different criteria . But your managers should not be quicker to discipline Latino employees , downgrade only women for being assertive and forceful in the workplace , or hold employees with disabilities to higher standards . <p> Avoid retaliation . Employers may not take any action against an employee because that employee has complained of harassment , safety violations , wage and hour issues , or other potential legal violations . If you downgrade an employees performance for complaining for example , by stating that the employee " is not a team player " you can create legal problems .

Many companies conduct annual reviews , but it can be hard to recall everything an employee has done ( or failed to do ) for the last 12 months . Instead of relying on your memory , keep tabs on performance throughout the year . Use a log or computer file to note important events , like especially high-quality work or missed deadlines . This will help you make sure your annual review fairly captures the full years work . <p> Step in when needed . Employees can only improve if they know there 's a problem . If you see an employee faltering , do n't  just make a note of it for a review that 's months away . Sit down with the employee and talk over the problem . If your company has a coaching process , use it . Give employees every opportunity to improve , in real time . <p> Involve employees in the process .

And , take your performance evaluation meeting with the employee seriously : If you got something wrong or forgot an important accomplishment , amend your review . By including employees in the evaluation , you 'll help them feel more ownership of the process . <p> Document everything . If you later have to rely on your performance assessments to demonstrate why you disciplined or fired an employee , contemporaneous documentation will be your best legal friend . Your log or appraisal , written at the time the problems surfaced , will help your company prove that the problems were real , the employee knew about them , and your company did n't  manufacture them after the fact to try to cover up an illegal termination .

@@25933955 @5933955/ <h> Well , Recuse Me ! When a Judge Should n't Hear a Case <p> You 're entitled to have an impartial judge preside over your case , but how do you know when the circumstances make recusal or disqualification of the judge a legal possibility ? <p> One of the key principles of the American judicial system is that the judge who presides over a case must be fair and impartial . In the vast majority of cases , the issue of the judge 's fairness and impartiality never comes up . There are instances , however , when one of the parties in a civil case has reason to believe that the judge can not be fair and impartial . Sometimes the judge recognizes his or her own inability to maintain partial . In those situations , the judge will either recuse himself or the litigant will move to have the judge disqualified from presiding over the case . Let 's look at some of the circumstances that may lead to a judge 's recusal or disqualification . <p> Bias or prejudice typically means the judge has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from treating the party or attorney in a fair and impartial manner . <p> Bias or Prejudice Concerning a Party or Attorney . If a judge is biased or prejudiced for or against a party or attorney , he can not be fair and impartial in deciding the case . A party or attorney who believes such bias or prejudice exists must prove it with admissible evidence , and can not base this belief on mere suspicion . <p> It 's not enough to establish bias or prejudice simply by showing that a judge has ruled against the party or attorney in a prior case . Rather , bias or prejudice typically means the judge has acted or spoken in a way that prevents him or her from treating the party or attorney in a fair and impartial manner . <p> Judge 's Personal Knowledge of Disputed Facts . Even a judge who is not serving as the finder of fact ( i.e. , when the case is to be decided by a jury ) can not be fair and impartial if he or she has personal knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pleadings and motions made by the parties ) may be influenced by that knowledge . This is especially true when the facts known by the judge are either not part of the factual record of the case , or conflict with the evidence presented in court . <p> Judge 's Relationship to a Party or Attorney . A judge 's fairness and impartiality may be compromised when he or she has had a business or professional relationship with a party or attorney . In cases where the judge was a party 's business partner or attorney , as well as in cases where the judge was a member of a law firm representing a party , the potential for bias or prejudice is almost always too great to permit the judge to preside over the case . <p> Judge 's or Judge 's Family Member 's Economic Interest in the Case . Sometimes a judge or one of his or her immediate family members will have an economic interest in the subject matter of the case , one that could be significantly impacted by the outcome of the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority interest in a corporate party that is being sued for alleged violation of antitrust laws . In such a circumstance , the judge would have conflicted loyalties and would have a difficult time remaining fair and impartial in his/her rulings . <p> Procedure for Recusal . When any of the above circumstances are present , the judge may either raise the issue of recusal him/herself or entertain a motion by one of the parties . A judge who determines it is necessary to recuse him/herself will advise the parties and attorneys of the grounds for that determination , and will ask the court administrator to reassign the case to a different judge . If the matter is brought to the judge 's attention through a party 's motion seeking disqualification , in most jurisdictions the judge will initially decide the motion him/herself ; if the motion is denied , the losing party will typically be permitted to have the motion reheard by the court 's Chief Judge . <p> Finally , it 's important to note that recusal and disqualification of judges is a sensitive subject , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out the fundamental role of his or her position -- the fair and impartial resolution of judicial proceedings . So , the decision to file a motion seeing disqualification should be made only after careful consideration .

@@25933957 @5933957/ <h> What Types of Divorces Typically go to Trial ? <p> Learn which types of divorce cases most often end up in a courtroom battle . <h> What Types of Divorces Typically Go To Trial ? <p> More than 90 percent of divorce cases settle prior to trialeither by one spouse offering a settlement that the other accepts , or at mediation . Sometimes , however , the spouses simply cant come to an agreement on an issue like child custody , child support , property division , or alimony , and they need the court to decide these issues for them . This article will explain what types of divorce cases couples try before a judge or jury . <h> When Theres a Major Disagreement on Custody <p> One type of case that often ends up in trial involves a major disagreement on custody or visitation . When there 's a dispute over a day or two of monthly visitation , parents can usually resolve it through negotiation and mediation . However , if one parent believes the other parent is unfit to have any visitation at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A parent who plays a role in the childrens lives is unlikely to simply give up sole custody to the other parent and will fight to maintain parental rights . <p> Another type of case that 's difficult to resolve before trial is when both parents want to be a child 's primary custodian . Often , one parent has clearly been the childs primary custodian during the course of the marriage , and the couple agrees to continue that arrangement . Sometimes , however , parents believe themselves to be better suited than their spouses to have the children the majority of the time , and if neither parent budges , they may find themselves in court . <p> Other times parents will agree on a general custodial or visitation schedule , but need a judge ( or jury , in a small number of states ) to decide which parent has the final say on major decisions like religion , education , medical treatment , or extracurricular activities . For example , having the final say on education can be very important when it makes the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending school much closer to one parents residence than the others . <h> When Theres a Major Disagreement on Finances <p> Many couples find themselves divorcing due in large part to disagreement on finances , so its no surprise that they 're unable to agree how to divide their assets and debts during the divorce case . <p> In " community property " states like California , courts presume that spouses equally own all assets and debts accumulated or earned during marriage . Even when spouses equally split their marital assets , however , there can still be disputes . The couple may disagree on whether certain property was obtained during the marriage or prior to the marriage . They may disagree on the value of a certain piece of property to be divided , like a piece of property that they do n't  intend to sell . Both spouses may wish to keep a particular asset , such as a vacation home , or a recreational vehicle . Even if the spouses agree to split everything 50/50 , they may still want a trial to determine some of these issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather " equitable division " states . In equitable division states , the court must divide the marital estate " equitably " or fairly , but not necessarily equally . For example , a spouse who earned the majority of the income during the marriage may feel entitled to 60% or more of the marital estate , or a spouse may want to be compensated for the other spouses frivolous spending . Since what constitutes an equitable division is the subjective opinion of the judge or jury , spouses may decide to take their chances at trial to get the best financial deal . <p> Couples may also disagree about other financial issues , like alimony or child support that push them to a divorce trial . <p> If a spouse has outsized expectations coming into a case , it can be difficult to get to a more reasonable position and avoid a trial . <h> When One Spouse Takes an Unreasonable Position <p> While there are many good faith reasons why a spouse may take a case to trial , unfortunately , many spouses end up in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party would view their case . <p> If a spouse has outsized expectations coming into a case , it can be difficult to get to a more reasonable position and avoid a trial . For example , if the income that previously supported one household now must support two households , each spouse is likely to suffer a decrease in standard of living . A spouse who refuses to accept that basic point may go all the way to trial only to end up in the same , pre-divorce financial position , minus all the money wasted on attorney 's fees and court costs . <p> Its also possible that a spouses attorney gives an unreasonably rosy view of what to expect from the court , and then backs a client into an unsupportable position at trial . Its important to try to look at your case from both sides to understand what a judge or jury is likely to do at trial : failure to do so may leave you on the losing side of your divorce .

When a criminal record is expunged , for many purposes its as though the conviction never happened , and you are legally entitled to say " No " when asked if you have a record for an expunged conviction . For example , sealing your record can mean that you will not have to reveal the conviction to a potential employer or landlord . <p> Over the past 20 years , authorities have made more than a quarter of a billion arrests , the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates .

In other words , there is no general duty to be a " good Samaritan . " But the exceptions are surprisingly widespread . <p> A few states , for example , require witnesses at the scene of a violent crime to make reports to law enforcement when they can safely do so . Many states require all persons to report suspected child abuse . Further , depending on your job , you may , as an employee , have an obligation to report certain work-related suspicious activity to a government agency or the police . These duties are commonly called " mandatory reporting requirements . " <p> Mandatory reporting requirements are frequently accompanied by provisions that make failing to file a report a crime itself .

In some situations , depending on the specifics of state law , they may make a citizens arrest , but that is an option , not a requirement . The reason for not requiring intervention or reporting is to leave policing to the professionals and to avoid turning all citizens into informants . <p> For example , imagine taking a walk in the park on your day off . You see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He s being chased by an elderly woman . You are an expert in martial arts . You happen to be standing next to a lamp post with a police emergency phone . You could easily stop the thief or report him . But you do neither , and the robber gets away . Have you done anything wrong ? Putting moral questions aside , you have committed no crime by failing to intervene or make a report . Along the same lines , while you have likely seen many posters with the slogan " If you see something , say something , " all the police can do , in most cases , is ask the public to make reports and hope that they do . <h> Work-related Obligations to Report <p> When you are at work , you may be subject to state and federal laws that impose certain reporting obligations that do not apply to the general public .

To detect child pornography and abuse , many states require photo and video processors and computer technicians to report suspected cases . In some states , veterinarians have a duty to report instances of animal cruelty . <p> Each state , and the federal government , has its own definitions of who is a protected person , which events trigger a duty to report , and who is a mandatory reporter .

@@25933965 @5933965/ <h> Why Do Most Criminal Cases End With Plea Bargains ? <p> When the prosecutor 's case is weak , you may be tempted to go to trial and hope for an acquittal . But a guilty verdict gives the judge the ability to sentence you to the max . It might be smarter to bargain to a lesser charge in exchange for a promise to recommend a light sentence . <p> The vast majority of criminal cases never go trial . In fact , 90% or more of all criminal matters get resolved by guilty pleas pursuant to plea bargains , which are agreements between a defendant and the prosecutors office . Why does this happen in a judicial system that guarantees defendants the right to trial , presumes them innocent until proven guilty , and requires the government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt ? Despite these favorable rights and otherslike the right to remain silent and the requirement of a unanimous verdictdefendants overwhelmingly choose to give up the right to trial and accept a plea deal from the prosecutor . <p> Let 's look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidents Never Get Charged <p> When the police file a report describing what they believe is an instance of criminal conduct , the report goes to the prosecutors office , whose lawyers decide whether to bring charges , sometimes after additional investigation . Many times , the prosecutors decline to file charges for a variety of reasons , including the need for more investigation , the presence of tainted evidence , or the unreliability of witnesses . Prosecutors bring charges when they think there 's a good chance of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt , and if the evidence is very shaky , the case is a poor bet . Those cases are never filed . <h> Prosecutorial Discretion : Settling for Less with Weak Cases <p> Most of the time , prosecutors are confident that they have the necessary evidence to prove their case before they bring formal charges against a defendant . But some cases are stronger than others , and if a case is not rock-solid , a prosecutor may settle for a plea bargain to a lesser offense , or agree to recommend a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquittal or hung jury , or even a conviction and a light sentence . In addition , the prosecutor never knows what may happen at trial ; if defense counsel is particularly skilled , the chances of losing go up . <h> Overcharging the defendant : Raising the stakes to get a plea <p> If the prosecution believes that it has one or two strong charges against a defendant , it may bring several other charges in the case even though the proof of these other crimes is weaker . Prosecutors sometimes overcharge to increase their bargaining power in plea negotiations , even though it angers some judges , who see it as a bullying tactic . Prosecutors generally do not worry about losing on a few charges at trial as long as they convict the defendant of at least one of the crimes charged . However , additional charges present a real risk to a defendant . If a jury finds the defendant guilty of all charges , the sentence could be significantly higher . Prosecutors often use this possibility of a harsher penalty to their advantage in persuading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realities : Some Cases are Not Easily Defensible <p> Movie and TV crime dramas make every case seem like a puzzling " whodunit . " In reality , a very small number of cases would make a good television show . Thousands of daily thefts , frauds , and assaults are easily investigated and can be successfully prosecuted as charged . <p> Because modern pre-trial rules require the prosecutor to share evidence with the defendant before trial , defense counsel can normally make an early and accurate judgment about the likelihood of conviction . If a trial is likely to result in a guilty verdict , a defendant has a strong motive to look for a resolution that will minimize the penalties at sentencing . <p> While the ultimate sentence may be up to the judge , a promise from the prosecution to recommend a lower sentence or sentencing range and to dismiss other charges can be a powerful incentive for defendants to enter guilty pleas . In addition , sometimes judges reduce their sentencing calculations when defendants have accepted responsibility for the crime by pleading guilty . <p> Appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements require defendants to forfeit any right to appeal their convictions or sentences . However , defense counsel may be able to get the prosecutor to agree to allow a limited appeal on specific issues , such as the lawfulness of a search or the police interrogation of a defendant .

( For more information on criminal appeals , see Appealing a Criminal Sentence . ) <h> The Sentencing Risks of Going to Trial <p> When defendants choose to go to trialsometimes against the advice of counseland are convicted , the trial judge ( who will sentence them later ) will likely have heard detailed evidence of the crime and perhaps other uncharged criminal conduct .

Its possible that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . <p> Keep in mind that when a defendant is convicted at trial , the prosecution will not be limited when it comes to arguing for a stiff sentence . Unlike a plea bargain , which by its nature involves a promise to stick to an agreed-upon sentence recommendation , the prosecutor is free to recommend the highest sentence possible . <p> Finally , a defendants ability to plausibly ask for mercy at sentencing might be strained following a trial . Defendants who have plead guilty can express remorse , acceptance of responsibility , and a desire to save the court and the victims from a lengthy and perhaps emotional trial . None of these mitigating factors are available to a defendant who has chosen to go to trial . <h> Making the Decision to Plead Guilty <p> The decision to forfeit the right to trial and plead guilty is a serious one and can be made only after thorough consultation with your lawyer about the facts and the law in your case . The decision is so important that the judge , during a guilty plea hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights you are giving up by pleading guilty . <p> While every defendant has a right to go to trial , a defendant must consider the likelihood of conviction and weigh that against the benefits of being sentenced pursuant to a plea bargain with the government .

But lawyers , both private and public , have the training to get better case outcomes than pro se defendants . And paying for a lawyer can at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case can mean not having to pay fines , fees , and related costs such as hiked insurance rates . <p> Not only that , but some costs are difficult if not impossible to quantify . License suspensions or jail sentences can lead to lost income ( and how one person calculates the amount of income lost due to a DUI case might differ from how another would do the same ) . Plus , criminal convictions can create losses when it comes to endeavors like applying for jobs or renting property . <p> In calculating the total cost of a DUI case , we stuck with the quantifiable , such as the following factors : <h> DUI Cost for People Who Hired Private Lawyers <p> Among our readers , the total case cost was highest for those who hired private lawyers , though perhaps by not as much as you might expect . The total cost for readers in this group came out to $6,600 , including an average of $2,400 in attorneys fees and expenses . ( Note that attorneys fees and expenses can be significantly higher when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plea . ) <p> Costs of DUINon-attorney-fee costs were highest for those without a lawyer or public defender . Note that these costs were for all DUI defendants , regardless of outcome . <p> Costs other than attorney fees averaged $4,200 for those who hired private lawyers , including fines , DMV and traffic school fees , the cost of installing ignition interlock devices , and increased insurance rates . Most of these individual costs were similar across categories ( for example , on average , people without lawyers paid $1,300 in court-ordered fines , while people with private lawyers or public defenders paid $1,100 for such fines ) . But one type of cost varied significantly : insurance rate increases . For those who hired private lawyers , the average insurance increase was only $1,900 over three years . This was the lowest among the three groups ( more on this below ) . <h> DUI Cost for People Represented by Public Defenders <p> Our survey takers who used public defenders spent an average of $5,600 on their DUI cases . These folks actually reported spending an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the circumstances , people represented by appointed lawyers can be required to partially reimburse the government for the cost of representation ) . <p> Costs other than attorney fees averaged $4,800 for readers who used public defenders ; the average insurance increase was $2,500 over three years . <h> DUI Cost for People Without Lawyers <p> Our survey results showed an average overall cost of $5,800 for readers who did n't  hire lawyers ( slightly higher than the cost for readers with public defenders ) . While this average total is $800 less than using a private lawyer , going it alone is n't necessarily the cheapest option when you consider the repercussions . Remember that 100% of defendants without a lawyer who did n't have their charges dropped were convicted of DUI , and 0% pleaded to a lesser offense . <p> Also note that when you compare the total fines and expenses for defendants without representation ( $5,800 ) to the fines and expenses for those using a public defender ( $4,800 , not including attorney fees ) and using a private lawyer ( $4,200 , not including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered DUI-related costs . This difference can mostly be attributed to the higher insurance rates the unrepresented group paid on average ( $3,000 over three years ) . The increased insurance cost for people without lawyers might be at least partially due to the fact that more of them were convicted of some form of DUI . In addition , the unrepresented group paid slightly higher court-ordered fines ( an average of $1,300 compared to $1,100 ) . <p> Taking a closer look at costs , significantly more defendants without a lawyer had their charges dropped ( 26% of defendants ) , possibly because the cases against them were weaker . As a result , they did n't  have to go through the entire court process . Had more been forced to go to trial or reach a plea deal , the average overall cost per unrepresented defendant would have been much higher . <p> Be patient and keep all of your paperwork in a binder organized . Save , save , save money while you can before you go to court . <p> Bob , age 60 , Hummelstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really assured ? In the legal world , the definitive answer is no . But our survey showed that people facing DUI charges with private lawyers were twice as satisfied with the outcome as people without a lawyer , and three times as satisfied as those who used public defenders . ( For the reasons noted above , however , readers should be wary of interpreting the satisfaction rates as an indication that its better to go it alone than with the public defender . ) <p> Satisfaction With DUI ProcessSatisfaction with the DUI process was highest for those who hired private lawyers . <p> Indeed , 45% of people who hired lawyers were satisfied or very satisfied with the way their cases resolved . Not only that , but 62% of these people were either satisfied or very satisfied with their lawyers ; only 15% of public defender clients could say the same . So , people who hired private attorneys were more than four times as satisfied with their lawyer than those who hired PDs . <p> Among readers who did n't  have lawyers , only 26% reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the satisfaction rate was even lower for folks with public defenders : only 11% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their case outcomes . That more unrepresented people never faced charges or had them dropped may help explain this discrepancywhats a better outcome than , " The People have elected not to file charges " ? <p> The highest satisfaction rate being found among readers with private lawyers could be due to any number of factors . In our survey , for example , private attorneys appeared to have had more success pleading cases " down " to lesser offenses . But other circumstances could also be at play . It might be , for instance , that privately paid lawyers spent more time on their clients cases and were more available for consultation and questions . <h> Get Help <p> No two cases are identical , and no survey can cover every conceivably relevant issue . These are important points to keep in mind when reading about DUI-case outcomes and costs . It could be , for example , that public defenders tend to see more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that penalties tend to be more severe in one part of the country than another . <p> Remember that surveys indicate trendsthey wont determine your fate . Case facts , like whether anyone was hurt , contribute greatly to results . So do prosecutors policies and attitudes .

Under some circumstances , the short answer is " yes . " Eminent domain power allows the government to take private land for public use . Sometimes called the power of condemnation , or referred to as a " forced sale , " this is within the legal toolkit federal , state , local , and even quasi-governmental agencies and public utilities . <p> While each jurisdiction has its own laws and procedures regarding the taking of private property , many of the broad concepts are the same across the United States . <p> Legal Basis for Eminent Domain <p> The concept of eminent domain predates the United Statess founding .

Put another way , the government can not snatch land for free , or pay the owner only a nominal fee . <p> The governments taking must be for a " public use . " Most commonly , this means that the government wants to build a road , school , or other public facility on that particular private parcel of land , or a portion of it .

Generally , the process will begin with a notice of the governments interest in taking your property . This will sometimes be served on your personally ( by a process server ) , or sometimes mailed to you , depending on the relevant regulations . <p> The notice will usually inform you that the government intends to appoint an appraiser to determine the fair market value of your property . The appraisers determination will form the basis of the " just compensation " that the Constitution requires be paid to you . The appraisal will typically take into consideration a variety of factors about the propertys condition , location , improvements , natural resources , and broader market conditions .

Such evidence might include the reports of one or more appraisers , market surveys , or other presentations of value . The judge or jury , as the finder of fact , will determine the proper value . <p> Types of Takings <p> Not all government takings involve the total confiscation of your land . There are different forms for taking property . A taking could be complete , where the property and all rights connected to it are taken , or partial , where the government takes only a portion of a parcel of land ( for example , land needed to widen a road or lay a cable ) . <p> Easements ( the right to use your property ) , such as utility easements , are also a form of taking .

@@25933977 @5933977/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> How to File Divorce in Missouri <p> Laws governing property , custody , and support often vary widely between states , so dissolving a marriage can become complicated . Here is a synopsis of divorce law in Missouri . <h> Will You Require an Attorney ? <p> Reasonably intelligent people certainly can complete divorce documentation . However , retaining an attorney can ensure that your paperwork is in order and concerns are adequately addressed . Legal professionals also can foresee issues that can become future problems . <h> Other Possibilities <p> Missouri law allows marriages to be declared invalid " known as annulments " although the circumstances are limited and the procedure is rare . Reasons for annulments include incapacity to enter into marriage , such as duress , mental impairment , or close blood relationship . Couples who want to remain married because their religion opposes divorce can negotiate legally binding separation agreements that resolve property , custody , and support issues , but do not dissolve the marriage . <h> Grounds for Divorce <p> Missouri is a no-fault state ; if the petitioning spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce will be granted . At least one party must be a state resident for 90 days before filing , and the divorce can not be finalized until 30 days after the filing . <h> Settling Things <p> The longer a divorce takes and the more contentious the litigation becomes , the more costly the case will be . That is why mechanisms such as mediation and negotiation are used to reach agreements on matters such as custody , property , and maintenance without the expense of protracted litigation . Though mediation is not required in Missouri , many couples find benefits in the process . <h> Court Orders <p> In an emergency , a spouse who fears an estranged partner may request a restraining or protective order . Either side can request temporary orders for urgent issues such as child custody , child support , or spousal maintenance . The terms of these orders can become permanent if the conditions remain satisfactory for all parties . If both spouses agree , and there are amicable co-parenting arrangements and minimal assets , a single order can dispense with many matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For contentious cases , separate filings frequently become necessary . <h> Property and Debts <p> Missouri is an " equitable distribution state , " which means that marital property , assets , and debts are distributed " fairly , " but not necessarily 50/50 . If couples can not reach an agreement , a judge considers evidence to determine an equitable distribution . Not all assets are marital property ; gifts bestowed during the marriage , inheritances , and property acquired prior to the union often are individual property not subject to distribution . <h> Custody and Support <p> There are two types of custody , and Missouri laws favor joint custody when possible : Legal custody sets parameters for medical and other decisions ; physical custody determines where children live . If parents can not agree on a child custody arrangement , a judge will decide . Visitation and support are separate issues , and a state formula determines support . However , a judge can increase or decrease the amount . Tax ramifications accompany support payments " parties who receive spousal support pay taxes on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance <p> Health insurance and payment of medical expenses often become controversial issues in dissolutions . If one spouse has been providing family coverage , that spouse commonly will be expected to continue coverage for a specific period . Parents frequently share noncovered expenses for children . <h> Moving Forward <p> Women have the option of retaining married surnames or returning to any previous name , but either request needs to be incorporated into the final decree . Custody , visitation , and support orders often can be modified later if either party becomes dissatisfied and returns to court . <h> Seeking Legal Help <p> This article is an overview of Missouri divorce law . For specific questions consult a local divorce attorney . 
@@25933978 @5933978/ <p> Not all criminal cases go to trial . In fact , more often than not , a criminal case will be disposed of prior to a trial . Plea deals are common because they can be beneficial for both the defendant and the People . <p> But , there are also circumstances when a case can be dismissed prior to a trial . One common motion that can be brought during the pre-trial stages of a case is a Motion to Suppress . Penal Code section 1538 provides the right of an accused to challenge evidence that may have been obtained illegally . Typically if the evidence is suppressed like the blood results of a DUI stop the case must be dismissed because the evidence is dispositive to the case . <p> One example of when a Motion to Suppress could be successful is when an officer stops an accused for a traffic stop that was unlawful . An officer can not stop an individual without sufficient probable cause , a legal standard provided by the Fourth Amendment . Thus , if an officer reports that he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no Vehicle Code violation , the accused may be able to prevail at a P.C. 1538 hearing . <p> A criminal defense attorney has the responsibility to perform an adequate investigation . Evidence obtained by an attorney could lead to a decision to file a Motion to Suppress . An investigation can include , but is not limited to : requesting discovery from the prosecution , subpoenaing documents , and looking at possible video surveillance . It is now common for officers to have dashboard cameras , and also cameras on their persons . A video could show that a traffic stop was unlawful . <p> Some of my clients have asked what a motion consists of . A motion is a request for the court to do something . The party " moves " the court to make an order . A motion is started ( usually ) by an opening brief . The attorney files a memorandum with points and authorities ( cases in support of the motion ) . Then , the prosecution ( again , usually ) files an opposition brief , highlighting their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself with the law and facts of the particular case . After the briefing with physical documents , there is an evidentiary hearing where witnesses testify . The arresting officer most likely will testify as to the facts of the stop or arrest . <p> A Motion to Suppress is a constitutional protection . It safeguards citizens from police abuses . There are other type of situations , as well , when a P.C. section 1538 may be appropriate . Law enforcement can not exercise a warrant based on false information . Police can not execute a warrant outside the constraints of the warrant . Facts should be scrutinized in every criminal case . <p> In conclusion , a defendant may not need to persuade a jury . There are pre-trial motions that can be potentially made , which could lead to a complete dismissal . It is important to contact an attorney should you be charged with a crime .

Youve hired an experienced divorce lawyer and you 're already moving forward with your divorce . If you 're thinking about picking up the phone to call your spouse , think through why youre calling and what you 're planning to say . <p> There can be compelling reasons to contact a spouse during your divorce . However , its important not to say something that you 'll later regret . Below are some tips for handling spousal communication during a divorce . <h> When Should I Communicate Directly With a Divorcing Spouse ? <p> Before calling or texting your soon-to-be ex , ask yourself whether the communication is positive and important . Hateful messages or threats to make the divorce process miserable are counterproductive . Moreover , foul language and threats may later be used against you in court . Its important to be on your best behavior when contacting your spouse . <p> However , its important to reach out to your spouse immediately if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up or dropping off a child . Remember to keep the communication brief and cordial . A judge who sees parents that are able to respond civilly to one another will be more likely to award joint custody in your case . Yet , even if you do n't  have children , your divorce will run more smoothly if you 're able to maintain open lines of communication with your ex . Its smart to communicate directly with your spouse on issues like upcoming mortgage payments , insurance coverage , selling furniture , or scheduling visitation . <h> When Should I Communicate Through an Attorney ? <p> Although open communication lines are good , sometimes its advisable for spouses to only communicate through an attorney . Specifically , if there 's been any history of domestic violence , do n't  contact your spouse directly . Be aware that if a protective or no contact order is in place , you are prohibited from contacting your spouse at all . The no-contact rule applies whether you 're the victim or the violent spouse . A spouse who violates a no contact order by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim spouse may face jail time .

In a contentious divorce case , its helpful to funnel all communications through attorneys to keep things civil . One downside of using a lawyer for all communications is that you may end up paying your lawyers hourly rate for simple emails about visitation or questions about debts . So be sure to use your lawyers time wisely . <h> Do I Need To Save or Record Communications With My Spouse ? <p> You wont need to send your attorney every email or text from your spouse , but you should file away any significant communications .

@@25933980 @5933980/ <h> Demystifying the Law : What to Do if You Are Sued <p> I think its human nature to hope that if you ignore your problems , theyll go away . Of course , most of us have learned that 's rarely the case . And , if you 're on the receiving end of a lawsuit , I can promise you that it wont simply go away if you ignore it . But if you 've never been sued before , what should you do ? This article demystifies the situation . <p> Copy this link to share with your friends : http : //bit.ly/gHIxiy <h> A Few Legal Terms <p> If you 've been sued , you are the defendant . The party filing the lawsuit is the plaintiff . <p> In most states , there are several types of courts . <p> At the most basic level , there are criminal courts and civil courts . A criminal court hears criminal cases where the government usually in the form of the state or locality brings charges against an individual or company that could result in fines , jail time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or more parties either personal or business where money , property or injury occurred . This could include divorce cases , child custody matters , bankruptcy and more . Some courts hear both civil and criminal matters . <p> The parties involved in a civil lawsuit can either hire lawyers to represent them or can represent themselves without an attorney , which is known as pro se . In some courts such as some small-claims courts lawyers may actually be banned from appearing in the courtroom , although they may serve as behind-the-scenes advisors . In a criminal trial , the state , locality or other government entity is the prosecuting attorney . <h> Steps in a Lawsuit <p> Receive the Summons : Youll probably learn of the suit when you receive a summons , the legal notice that a lawsuit has been filed against you . With the summons will be a copy of the complaint . This is a statement detailing the claim against you . The complaint also explains what the person initiating the lawsuit wants from you or wants you to do , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stopping you from taking certain actions , otherwise known as an injunction . <p> Decide Whether or Not to Hire an Attorney : As soon as you receive a summons and complaint , you should read it , and then decide whether you need to hire a lawyer to defend you . There are a few things to consider , all of which boil down to the seriousness of the lawsuit and the potential outcomes . If you 're being sued in small claims court for a couple hundred dollars , you may not even be able to hire a lawyer , but you may want to consult with one . If your small business is being sued for patent infringement that could put you out of business if you lose , you probably want a lawyer by your side . <p> Defendants Answer : Once you receive a summons , you have a limited number of days ( usually 20 to 30 ) to file an answer to the complaint . In the answer , you set out any defenses you might have to the plaintiffs claim . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone but have already paid it back ; that would be a defense . <p> File a Counterclaim : If you have your own claim against the plaintiff , you can file a pleading called a counterclaim . For example , if you are being sued because of involvement in a car accident , but you believe the plaintiff actually caused the accident , you would file a counterclaim . Not every lawsuit will include counterclaims . <p> Engage in Discovery : After a lawsuit is filed , both parties can engage in discovery , a process for gathering information about the case . One party could send interrogatories , or written questions , to the other party , to find out more information related to the case . Either party can also take the other partys deposition , which means asking and answering questions orally under oath . Either party can also request the other party to turn over documents that are relevant to the case . <p> Try to Negotiate a Settlement : At any point during the case before a verdict is reached you can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can try to talk to the plaintiff directly or ask your lawyer to start discussions with the plaintiffs lawyer . A settlement can be a wise move if you expect a trial to cost a lot of money , or if you think there 's a good chance you could lose the case . <p> Go to Trial : Many civil lawsuits can be heard before either a jury or a judge . At trial , both parties present their evidence and call witnesses to testify . After all of the witnesses have testified , the judge gives instructions to the jury about which laws apply to your case . The jury deliberates and reaches a verdict . In a trial without a jury , the judge considers all the evidence and reaches a decision . <p> Judgment : In a jury trial , the judge enters a judgment based on the jurys verdict . In a bench trial , the judge enters a judgment based on his or her decision . <p> Motions After the Trial &amp; Appeals : The losing party may ask for a new trial and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . Both parties have a right to appeal to a higher court if they think a legal error in the trial occurred . <p> Enforcing the Judgment : If the judgment includes relief , such as a cash payment from one party to the other , the winning party is responsible for attempting to collect the judgment . <h> Worst-Case Scenario <p> Let 's say you receive a summons and ignore it . There 's one possible outcome and only one outcome : The court automatically rules in favor of the plaintiff . <p> What does this mean ? Well , it depends on why you were sued . <p> If your spouse sued you for divorce and you do n't  appear in court on the specified time or date , the judge grants your spouse a divorce , and will probably get everything he or she asked for . <p> If a creditor sues you for money owed to them , the judgment allows the plaintiff to collect that money from you , which could include putting a lien on your property . <p> If a default judgment has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney to appeal it . Its almost certain to cost you more money than if you 'd addressed the lawsuit immediately . You also stand less chance of winning than if you 'd tried to defend the lawsuit at the outset . So let 's just agree : If you ignore your lawsuit , it wo n't go away . <h> Related Links : <p> Did this article help you ?

@@25933981 @5933981/ <h> Contesting a Contract <p> Contracts are legally binding promises . Each party to a contract makes certain commitments that are expected to be kept : An employer promises to pay a certain salary in an employment contract ; a vendor promises to provide a certain number of widgets to a buyer ; a contractor promises to provide certain remodeling services . <p> In your personal and professional life , you are likely to enter into many contracts . In certain situations , however , you do not need to keep your promise to perform under the contract . The law provides several reasons why you may be permitted to break a contract . These are called " defenses " to performance . In some cases , they arise from the moment the contract is created . In other cases , they result from events that occur long after the contract is made . <h> Defenses Arising When a Contract Is Made <p> Under certain circumstances , a contract can be avoided based on the nature of its formation . These contracts can be void from the get-go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under duress can be voided . Duress is used to obtain a person 's consent against his or her will . Consent , freely given , is a necessary part of any contract . Without consent , a contract is not valid . Duress can take many forms . It can be a threat of force or some other harm . For example , if a person holds a gun to your head to get you to sign a contract , the contract is not enforceable . <p> Fraud and misrepresentation are also defenses to a contract . Misrepresentation is a false statement about a material fact relied on by a party to the contract . In the case of a misrepresentation , the injured party may rescind the contract . A misrepresentation can be interpreted as an innocent misstatement of a fact , whereas a fraud is a deliberate misstatement of a fact . <p> In the case of fraud , the defrauded party may rescind the contract and sue the wrongdoer for damages . For example , imagine that an antique dealer gets you to buy a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the dealer knows it was really made in 1950 , that is fraud . You may rescind the contract . That is , you can return the table and get your money back . You may also be able to sue for other damages resulting from the transaction . And you may have additional remedies under the law of consumer fraud . <p> Mistake occurs where one or both parties to the contract believe a fact to be true when it is not . If one party makes a mistake , the error is called a unilateral mistake . Generally , this type of mistake does not invalidate the contract . The law does not excuse negligence or inadvertence . For example , if you sell somebody a table that you think is an ordinary table made in 1950 for a few dollars , and it turns out to be a valuable antique made in the year 1800 , the law will not ordinarily invalidate that contract . However , if the buyer induced the mistake , then you may rescind the contract . <p> If both parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bilateral mistake . This type of mistake generally voids the contract because there was no meeting of the minds or consent . <p> Lack of consideration is another defense to a contract . Consideration is what each side gives to the other in a contract . Consideration makes a contract different from a plain promise . For example , a promise to make a gift is ordinarily not enforceable as a contract . <p> The situation may change if you promise to do something and the other person relies on your promise . For example , imagine that you promise to donate a million dollars to your college , in order to build a library . The college starts to build the library in the belief you will honor your promise . Most courts would hold that you are required to make the gift . The law assumes that the building of the library in reliance on your promise serves as the consideration for the promise to make the gift . Additionally , according to the law in some states , a promise to make a gift to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no consideration . <p> The Statute of Frauds may sometimes be used as a defense to certain kinds of contracts . The Statute of Frauds requires some contracts to be in writing . Usually these are contracts for the sale of land , as well as contracts over a certain amount in value . If these kinds of contracts are not in writing , they are not legally enforceable . However , the Statute of Frauds may not be a defense to an unwritten contract if one of the parties has relied on the contract to his or her detriment . <h> Defenses Arising After a Contract Is Made <p> Even if your contract is valid at the time that it is made , you may still lawfully refuse to honor it if certain events occur afterwards . <p> If the other side fails to perform its part of the contract , you do not need to perform yours . Let 's say you contracted to buy a ton of Granny Smith apples for $100 . The seller delivers a ton of crisp apple pies . Obviously , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to perform ( that is , pay for the pies ) . <p> Your performance also may be excused if it becomes impossible to do what the contract requires . This concept is known as " impossibility of performance . " Impossibility can be the result of a change in relevant law , or a change in relevant fact . <p> For example , let 's say you agree to deliver 100 pounds of medical marijuana to a dispensary in three months for $50,000 . One month later , lawmakers pass a bill making medical marijuana illegal . Your contract is now impossible to perform legally , and you are excused from delivering the marijuana . <p> Facts can change too . Imagine that you make a contract with a singer to sing at a party . A few days later , the singer passes away . The contract is no longer possible to perform because of this change in facts . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> I bought a cheap framed painting for $2 at a yard sale .

It was signed with the artist 's name but it turned out to be a forgery . Can I get my money back ? <p> My elderly aunt signed a contract to buy a car she ca n't afford .

@@25933983 @5933983/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Wages and Time of Payment 34380 @qwx234380 <p> Find out when and how you must be paid by your employer . <p> Most people know that federal and state laws require employers to pay employees at least the applicable minimum wage , as well as premium pay when they work overtime . What you may not know is that these same laws do n't  just cover how much employees have to be paid : They also dictate when employees have to be paid . Below , we explain some of the rules that determine when your wages must be paid . <h> Wage Payment Basics <p> The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) is the primary federal law on wages and overtime . Under the FLSA , employers are generally required to pay their employees in cash or by a " negotiable instrument " something that can be exchanged for cash at its face value , such as a check . In other words , you ca n't be paid in tokens , IOU vouchers , gift cards , or store credit . <p> Wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you unless they are paid finally and unconditionally , or in legal terms , " free and clear . " For example , you ca n't be required to kick back all or part of your wages to your supervisor or any other person acting on your employers behalf . <h> Timing of Payment <p> The FLSA provides a few specific rules on when employees are entitled to be paid . State laws , however , often provide additional rules . ( To learn more about wages , including minimum wage and overtime , see Wages and Hours FAQ . ) <p> As long as your employer meets your states payday requirements , you and your employer can agree to a more frequent pay schedule . <h> When You Must Be Paid Under the FLSA <p> Courts have interpreted the FLSA to require " prompt " payment of wages . The FLSA does not , however , require employers to pay wages on certain days of the month or at a particular frequency . Rather , the FLSA requires only that employers pay employees their wages , including any earned overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they worked those hours . <h> When You Must Be Paid Under State Law <p> Unlike the FLSA , many state laws do require employers to pay employees at certain intervals or on certain dates . For example , employees in Georgia must be paid at least twice a month . In some states , including California , payday rules depend on the type of work you do . Although most employees must be paid at least twice a month , those who work for farm labor contractors must be paid weekly , for example . <p> As long as your employer meets your states payday requirements , you and your employer can agree to a more frequent pay schedule . For instance , in Ohio you have to be paid at least on a semi-monthly basis , on or before the 1st and 15th day of each month . But you and your employer are free to arrange weekly or even daily payments . <p> Many states also have rules on when your employer has to provide your final paycheck if you leave the company and whether that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , see Vacation Time After Leaving an Employer . ) <h> When Overtime Is Due <p> Generally , overtime pay that 's earned in a particular workweek is due on the regular payday for the pay period including that week . So , if you get paid every two weeks , any overtime pay you 've earned during that time must be included in your paycheck for that pay period . In other words , your employer can not let overtime pay accumulate and then pay it to you all at once ( after two or three months , for example ) . <p> If the correct amount of overtime pay ca n't be determined until after the regular payday for that pay period , your employer must pay you as soon as possible after it can determine the proper amount . For example , you might work unplanned overtime the night before the pay period ends , which ca n't be included in your hours . In this case , your employer has only as much time as is reasonably necessary to calculate and arrange for payment of the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next payday after the calculation is possible . <h> Changing Pay Schedule <p> An employer may change its payday schedule without violating the FLSAs rules about prompt payment , but only if the change : <p> is made for a legitimate business reason ( like a change in accounting methods ) <p> does n't cause an unreasonable delay in payment <p> is intended to be permanent , and <p> is n't intended to allow the employer to avoid the FLSA 's minimum wage or overtime requirements .

The exact length of time depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding your deportation . ( Most deportees are barred for ten years . ) For the details , see the Immigration and Nationality Act ( I.N.A. ) at Section 212(a) ( 9 ) . <p> Who is barred for five years : If you were summarily removed or deported when you attempted entry at a U.S. border of other port , based upon a finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deported after having been placed in removal proceedings when you first arrived in the U.S. ; or if you , without reasonable cause , failed or refused to attend or remain an immigration court proceeding or walked out before it was over ; you may be barred from returning to the U.S. for five years . <p> Who is barred for ten years : If an immigration judge ( IJ ) ordered your removal at the conclusion of a hearing in Immigration Court ( even if you did not attend the hearing ) , you are barred from return to the U.S. for ten years . <p> Who is barred for 20 years : If you were deported once before and then attempted to reenter the U.S. prior to the expiration of your ten-year period of inadmissibility , an Immigration Court judge could add an additional ten years to your original ten-year ban .

If you violated the terms of your visa , for instance , that visa has now been canceled . If you committed a crime , or did something else that makes green card holders deportable , you no longer have U.S. lawful permanent residence . <p> In rare cases , where there was a miscarriage of justice or new information has come to light , you may be able to have your case " reopened " or " reconsidered .

Form I-212 is a request that the U.S. government lift the bar early and allow you to go forward with your visa application . Not everyone is allowed to use it ; if , for example , you have committed murder or certain other crimes , this waiver is not open to you . <p> You will also need to submit various documents that explain and support your case , including records of your removal proceedings .

This word originated in the Middle Ages when land reverted to the feudal lord when one of his tenants died without a will . Instead of going to a feudal lord , it now reverts back to the government . <p> The term escheat does n't always refer to " land . " It can also refer to other proceeds , such as money . Most states have abandoned property laws that can be complex . New York state has the most confusing laws concerning escheat . <h> The Legal Effect of Escheat <p> Once property goes to a state , there 's no difference between the state 's ownership of the property and the beneficiary 's ownership . Property is still subject to liens and claims in existence before the escheat proceedings . For example , if you had an easement to cross your neighbor 's property , and the neighbor 's property was turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely remain in force . <h> Escheat Traditionally <p> Before states enacted laws to specifically address escheat situations , land immediately reverted to the state government after the owner died without a will and no heirs . This type of escheat is called " true escheat . " In New York , for example , the current laws require certain proceedings to take place before property is turned over to the state government . In addition , the property of non-citizens who died without a will would escheat to the state government immediately before laws addressing escheat were adopted by state legislatures . Most states now have laws similar to those of New York , which require some sort of court proceedings prior to the distribution of property to the state by escheat . <h> Escheat in New York <p> Sometimes people die without a will . Before a dead person 's property passes to the state under the law of escheat , a court must determine that there are no close relatives or heirs . A close relative is defined in New York as a cousin-once removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a closer relationship to the dead person , a sibling , for example .

@@25933992 @5933992/ <h> Slander or Libel : What Is the Difference ? <p> When someone tells lies about youwhether verbally or in writingyou may wonder if you can sue . After all , lies can cause you real damage . If someone spreads personal rumors about your character , your reputation might be harmed in your community among your friends and family . If someone spreads falsehoods about your competence or skill , your professional reputation might suffer , resulting in lost business or career opportunities . <p> Even though it can be difficult to quantify the exact amount of economic harm , the law provides causes of action against people who lie about you . Defamation is a false statement communicated to someone else to damage your reputation or good name . Defamation through writing is called " libel " ; spoken defamation is called " slander . " <h> Standards to Prove Libel <p> To win damages against someone who has libeled you , you must prove the written statement was : <p> false <p> harmed your reputation or your businesss reputation <p> published to at least one other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> made with some degree of fault and intention . <p> Note that a false and harmful statement broadcast over the media , whether on television , over the Internet , or via something similar , is still considered libel , even if it was n't in writing . <p> Imagine , for example , that you are an accountant . You are always ethical and cautious , and have a good reputation among clients and colleagues . And yet , someone writes an op-ed in a local newspaper accusing you of stealing your clients money . The claim has no basis in reality . The author is an individual with a personal vendetta against you ; perhaps for a personal slight years ago ; and writes the article simply to hurt you . This qualifies as defamation , specifically libel . The author has written a knowingly false statement about you and published it to at least one other person . <p> Perhaps the most important element of a libel claim is falsity . Truth is an absolute defense to a claim of libel . In other words , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen clients money , then you would not be able to succeed on a claim for libel . Moreover , libel is a false statement of fact , not opinion . It is libelous for someone to write that you stole money from a client when , in fact , you did not . But it would not be libelous for someone to write that he did not like working with you , or found you to be an unprofessional accountant . These sorts of statements , whether they are " true " or not , are a matter of opinion . <p> Different standards of fault apply depending on who you are . If you 're a public figure , such as a politician , celebrity , or some other well-known person , it is more difficult to establish libel . Courts believe that such individuals should expect a certain degree of public criticism , by virtue of their own decision to choose public lives . Public figures must prove that they were defamed with " actual malice . " In other words , they must show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would harm their reputation , or recklessly disregarded these concerns . <p> If you 're not a public figure , you have to prove only that the person defaming you was negligent . That is , you have to show the person disregarded the duty of care to not make knowingly false statements about another person . <h> Standards for Proving Slander <p> Slander is very similar to libel in that it also involves a knowingly false statement . The difference is that it lacks the requirement of " publication " in writing or through other media . Slander is spoken defamation , whether the false statement is made at a cocktail party or at a local town hall . <p> Importantly , you do n't have to prove actual harm to your reputation from slander to collect damages if someone says something untrue about you that : <p> affects your business , trade or profession <p> implies you committed a crime , or <p> leads to the conclusion that you have a loathsome disease ( such as a sexually transmitted disease ) . <p> Otherwise , you 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect for slanderous behavior . This can be hard to do . After all , if someone spreads rumors that you have a sexually transmitted disease , how can you quantify the economic harm done to you ? Reputational harm is far more difficult to quantify , and thus courts do not force plaintiffs to do so . <h> Going to Court With a Slander or Libel Claim <p> If you 've been libeled by a public media such as a newspaper , TV station , or magazine , the first thing to do is to demand a retraction . If the defamation is ongoing , you will probably want to send a " cease and desist " letter demanding that the defamation stop immediately . These sorts of letters serve as evidence to the court that you acted in good faith to negotiate a deal before jumping to litigation . <p> A slander case is more difficult to prove , as a verbal statement is n't lasting . Its a good idea to keep a log of when and where the slanderous comments occur , and exactly what was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of witnesses to the verbal statements . <p> The time you have in which to file a lawsuitcalled a " statute of limitations " can be as little as one year for defamation . So , contact a lawyer right away if you think you may need to sue in order to correct the damage done to your reputation . <h> Calculating Damages for Slander or Libel <p> If you 've been defamed , you may receive a money award from a court to compensate for your damaged reputation or lost business . You might also collect " punitive damages . " This is money awarded to punish the person defaming you for particularly reprehensible behavior . <p> However , be aware that it can be difficult to prove damages in defamation cases , absent extraordinary circumstances .

For most people , these are the most valuable things they own , and they do n't  want to lose them if at all possible . To get a better idea of what happens with homes and vehicles in bankruptcy , we surveyed our readers across the United States about their experiences . Heres what we learned . <h> Your House in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy <p> If you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcythe kind that gets rid of debt most quicklyyou can keep your house under two conditions : Youre current with your mortgage payments when you file ( or you 've recently gotten current through a loan modification ) , and the laws in your state allow you to protect ( " exempt " ) all of the equity you have in the property . ( For details , see our article on keeping a house or car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds of debts , like credit card or medical bills , bankruptcy can free up money to help you keep up with your mortgage .

Filing for bankruptcy let 's you stay in your home another month or two , but ultimately , the bank will foreclose on the property . But if the foreclosure sale price is less than what you owe on the mortgage , your remaining mortgage debt can be discharged in bankruptcy . ( And you may save money on taxes . For more on this , see our article on Chapter 7 bankruptcy and foreclosure . ) Our readers who lost their houses reported an average discharge of $130,000 in mortgage debt after filing Chapter 7 . <p> Likelihood of Completing a Chapter 13 Plan <h> Your House in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy <p> When you 're behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chapter 13 bankruptcy might give you the time you need to catch up . Under this type of bankruptcy , the court approves a plan for you to repay the past-due mortgage amounts over three to five years , while continuing to make your current mortgage payments . As long you keep up with both of those payments , your lender ca n't foreclose on the house . <p> How often do Chapter 13 filers succeed in completing their repayment plans ? Many of the readers we surveyed were still making their plan payments , but of the others , nearly half ( 48% ) had their case dismissed before they were able to complete the plan , which usually happens when a debtor ca n't keep up with the payments . It was likely that these readers did n't  have enough income to cover their living expenses ( including their current mortgage payments ) as well as the monthly plan payments . Bottom line : Despite good intentions , not all Chapter 13 bankruptcy filers are able to keep their houses . <p> How Many Kept Their Car in Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a house , you can keep your car in Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you 're current with your loan payments ( or the car is paid off ) , and your states laws allow you to exempt your equity in the vehicle . Not surprising , the vast majority of our readers ( 87% ) who filed under Chapter 7 were able to keep their cars . <p> Many lenders will allow you simply to keep making payments on your auto loan after your file for bankruptcy , but they potentially could repossess the car ( even if you do n't  fall behind on those payments ) unless you " reaffirm " the debt by agreeing to a new contract . Still , less than two in ten ( 17% ) of our readers told us they reaffirmed their auto loan debt . <p> How Much Car Debt Was Wiped Out in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy ?

If you 're behind on your vehicle loan , you can use a Chapter 13 plan to catch up with your overdue payments ( as with mortgage debt ) , but you also have a couple of other options that do n't  apply to house loans .

Most states require drivers who want to do traffic school to first admit guilt for the violation and pay the citation fine . After the driver completes traffic school , the court dismisses or removes the violation from the drivers record . <h> Pleading Not Guilty <p> Typically , pleading not guilty is the equivalent of requesting a traffic court trial .

But most judges will be less apt to reduce your fine or allow you to do traffic school than they would have been had you plead guilty at arraignment . <p> Generally , judges can require you to post bail when you plead guilty at arraignment . Bail typically wont be more than the fine amount for your ticket . The court will refund the bail if you win your trial .

When the officer finishes testifying , the defendant also has a chance to testify and present evidence . ( The defendant , however , has the right to choose whether or not to testify . ) Once both sides finish their presentations , the judge makes a decision , finding the driver guilty or not guilty .

That 's generally the exception rather than the rule . Any hospital can choose to employ doctors . But most doctors are independent contractors and instead have an arrangement with hospitals allowing them to see patients there . <p> Even emergency room ( ER ) doctors are generally not employed by the hospital where the ER is located .

These can include requirements that the doctor reside within a certain distance from the hospital to be sure that the doctor can arrive quickly when needed . <h> Timing Can Save or Cost Lives <p> Time can be critical , especially in the labor and delivery room . For example , a case in Illinois involved a doctor who took nearly an hour to arrive at the hospital for a complicated delivery , and during that time the infant died . <p> The evidence that may have swayed the jury to award pain and suffering damages to the mother was that the doctor showered at home before driving to the hospital .

In this article , well explain the basics of default judgments : what they are , when and how defendants can set them aside , issues related to collection , and more . <h> What is a Default Judgment ? <p> In a civil lawsuit , a defendant who does not respond to the suit papers in a timely manner is considered " in default .

The plaintiff can usually pursue more than one of these enforcement mechanisms simultaneously . <h> " Setting Aside " a Default Judgment <p> In most jurisdictions , the defendant will have a prescribed period within which to ask the court to set the default judgment aside , on good cause shown . In California , the defendant typically has 30 days to make this kind of motion , starting from the date on which the court clerk mailed the Notice of Entry of Judgment .

In a proceeding known as a " creditor 's exam , " the defendant is required to testify under oath and produce documentation about these matters .

If the plaintiff is able to obtain information about the defendant 's bank accounts , garnishment and attachment proceedings can be initiated to reach the assets in these accounts . If the defendant owns vehicles , non-exempt real estate or other items of real or personal property , this property will be subject to seizure by the local law enforcement authorities . Once it is sold , usually at a public auction , the sale proceeds will be available to help satisfy the judgment amount owed . <p> It is often said that a judgment is only worth the paper it is written on .

Many jurisdictions permit the renewal of judgments that are about to expire , providing additional time for the plaintiff to pursue collection remedies . Unless the defendant tries to discharge the judgment debt by filing for bankruptcy , the cloud of court-authorized actions to enforce the default judgment may well hang over the defendant 's head for decades .

For example , let 's say a publicly-held company makes false earnings statements to thousands of investors , or a car company designs and manufactures a vehicle with an unreasonably dangerous component . In situations like these , and when certain procedural qualifications are met , instead of hundreds or thousands of individual lawsuits making it to court over the matter , there may be only one : a class action lawsuit . <h> What is a Class Action ? <p> It 's not enough that there are a large number of people who may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class action rules laid out in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( which many states have largely mirrored in drafting their own procedural rules for class actions ) , in order for a lawsuit to be certified as a class action : <p> the class of people affected must be so numerous that joining them all into the lawsuit is " impracticable " <p> the same or similar questions of law or fact must be common to the class <p> the claims ( and claimed losses ) of the representative parties must be typical of those of the class , and <p> the representative parties must be able to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class . <p> It 's not enough that the class representative 's claims ( and claimed losses ) are the same or similar as those of the rest of the class .

In order to get a lawsuit certified as a class action , under federal procedural rules , the chosen class representative must be able to " fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class . " So , when examining the suitability of the representative parties , it 's not enough that the representative 's claims ( and claimed losses ) are the same or similar . The person him or herself must be able and willing to act in the best interests of the class . That means the representative should : <p> have interests that are sufficiently intertwined and interrelated with those of the class <p> be familiar with the basics of the case <p> be willing to devote the necessary time and energy to fair resolution of the class action <p> be free of any conflict of interest , and <p> not have a history of fraudulent behavior ( a criminal record may be okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class representative ) <h> The Class Representative 's Responsibilities <p> A lead plaintiff has a pretty big job in a class action case . He or she usually works very closely with the attorneys handling the case ( " class counsel " ) and is often there in the courtroom or at the conference table at key points of the litigation , including during formal settlement talks . So , the class representative usually has to make a significant commitment to the case , as opposed to class members , who essentially do nothing while the class action progresses . <p> Despite being in a higher-profile position in relation to the rest of the " class , " the lead plaintiff is usually in the same position as all members of the class when it comes to attorney 's fees . Class action attorneys take cases under contingency fee agreements and take a representation fee ( typically somewhere around 33 percent ) only if they win or settle the case .

@@25934006 @5934006/ <h> Q : My employer is conducting a workplace investigation into misconduct , and my boss wants to meet with me . What are my rights ? <p> A : Your employer is entitled toand may even be obligated toinvestigate acts of wrongdoing in the workplace . For example , your employer may conduct an investigation into thefts , workplace accidents , property damage , or discrimination or harassment . While your employer cant force you to cooperate or sit down in a meeting , you might be putting your job at risk by refusing to participate . <p> Union employees have special rights in these circumstances . If you 're a union employee , you have the right to have a union representative present at any meeting that might result in disciplinary action . These are called " Weingarten rights . " For example , if your employer is investigating a cash register shortage and you were on-duty when the shortage occurred , you can reasonably expect to be a potential suspect who might be disciplined or fired . If your employer asks you for a sit down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting until you can have a union representative attend . <h> Q : When is someone not an at-will employee ? <p> A : In almost every state , the general rule is that employees work at will . This means the employee can quit at any time for any reason , and the employer can fire the employee at any time for any reason ( as long as the reason is not illegal ) . Montana is the only state without a default at-will employment rule ; in Montana , employees can not be fired without cause once they complete a probationary period of employment . <p> Employees do not work at will when they have employment contracts promising them employment for a set period of time . Employment contracts can be formed in three ways : <p> Written contracts . In every state , a written agreement between an employer and employee is enforceable . Employment contracts usually state how long the employee will be employed for ( for example , one year ) , what salary and benefits the employee will receive , and what specific reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oral contracts are also allowed in every state . Like a written contract , an oral contract includes terms about the duration of employment , compensation , and reasons for termination . However , the agreement is spoken between the employee and a representative of the employer , rather than written down . <p> Implied contracts . Many states will also uphold implied contracts . These types of contracts do not involve express promises from the employer , but instead are implied from the employers words or actions.For example , you may have an implied contract if your boss says " you 'll continue to have a job as long as you do good work , " or your employee handbook says that employees will be fired only for certain types of misconduct . <h> Q : Can an at-will employee be fired for any reason ? <p> A : At-will employees can not be fired for illegal reasons . For example , federal antidiscrimination laws prohibit employers from firing employees based on race , color , national origin , sex , pregnancy , religion , age ( 40 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws may protect additional characteristics , such as sexual orientation or gender identity . Employees can not be fired in retaliation for exercising their rights under these laws , either . <p> Federal and state laws protect employees in several other ways . For example , its generally illegal to fire an employee for filing a workers compensation claim , making a wage and hour complaint , or reporting a workplace health and safety violation . Many states also have a catch-all provision , which prohibits employers from firing employees for any reason that would violate public policy . <h> Q : How much can I collect in unemployment benefits ? <p> A : Each state has its own unemployment rules regarding eligibility and benefit amounts . In general , though , benefits are based on your average earnings during a 12-month stretch called the " base period . " Most states have a maximum weekly amount that workers can receive . Benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states . To learn the rules in your state , select it from the list at Collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I think a former employer has blacklisted me ? <p> A : Blacklisting is when your name is included on a list of " undesirable " employees . Sometimes , employers maintain an actual list that is given to potential employers in a certain area or industry . Other times , employers may simply blacklist you by word of mouth , by telling fellow employers not to hire you . <p> Several states have passed laws to outlaw the practice of blacklisting . Some laws prohibit employers from creating , maintaining , or distributing a blacklist . Other laws prohibit employers from making false statements , or taking other inappropriate measures , to prevent an employee from getting a job . See State Laws on Blacklisting to learn the rules in your state . <p> Blacklisting is not the same as receiving a negative reference from your former employer . Employers are free to make truthful statements in response to reference requests . So if you were fired for stealing or not showing up to work , your former employer can tell your potential employer about it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be able to take legal action . <h> Q : What can my former employer say when giving a reference ? <p> A : Your former employer can give its honest opinion about you and your time with the company , as long as it is based on statements of fact . If the employer lies about you , or speculates about something you did , you may have a defamation claim against your former employer . For example , your employer ca n't say that you were fired for stealing , unless that is a verifiable fact ( for example , you were caught on tape taking money from the cash register ) . Because this can be a tricky line to walk , many employers will only verify titles , dates of employment , and rates of pay in response to a reference request . <h> Q : I was recently fired from my job . I never received any warnings and got good performance reviews . Was I wrongfully terminated ? <p> A : If you 're an at-will employee , your employer is not required to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it does raise some red flags when employees are fired out of the blue , despite glowing performance reviews . In these cases , it may appear that the employer fired the employee for an illegal reasonwhich would lead to a wrongful termination claim . For example , if your employer hired a new manager who said he did n't  think women should work in sales , and the manager fires you three days later , you may have a claim that you were illegally discriminated against . You should consult with an employment lawyer if you have any doubts as to why you were fired . <h> Q : Is my employer required to give me a reason for firing me ? <p> A : Federal law does not require employers to give an employee a reason for his or her termination . However , some states have laws that require employers to provide the reason for termination upon request . This is called a " service letter " law . Employees in these states must typically submit a written request to the employer ; the employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a certain time frame . <h> Q : Can my employer deny my unemployment benefits ? <p> A : Your employer can protest your unemployment benefits , but it ca n't deny them . The state unemployment office , not your employer , makes the decision about whether you are entitled to benefits . Once you submit your claim , your employer will have an opportunity to respond with reasons as to why youre not eligible for benefits . These types of disputes usually revolve around whether you were at fault for your dismissal because you were fired for misconduct or quit without good cause . <h> Q : What is constructive discharge ? <p> A : Constructive discharge occurs when you are forced to quit your job because of illegal working conditions that your employer refuses to correct . For example , if you 're subjected to harassment based on your religion and your employer does nothing to stop it over several weeks , you probably have a good claim for constructive discharge . In this case , you can sue your employer for wrongful termination , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to collect unemployment benefits because you had good cause to quit your job . ( For more information , see Constructive Discharge : Were You Forced to Quit Because of Intolerable Working Conditions ? ) . <h> Q : What kind of employment rights do I have during my probationary period ? <p> A : If you 're an at-will employee , a probationary period usually does n't  give you any additional rights . This is because at-will employees can be fired at any time , for any reason that is n't illegal . As long as the employer makes it clear that the probationary period does n't  affect your at-will employment , you wont have any rights to continued employment . Your employer can fire you during or after the probationary period , regardless of how well you perform . <p> However , in some states , you might have the right to continued employment if your employer does n't  make it clear that you 're still an at-will employee . For example , some employees have arguedand woncases by arguing that they became " permanent " employees once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Employee 's Guide to Probationary Employment . <h> Q : When must my employer give me my final paycheck ? <p> A : The time limit for when your employer must give you your final paycheck depends on the laws in your state . Those laws may vary depending on whether your leaving was voluntary or involuntary . For example , in many states , you must receive your check on your last day if you are fired , or on the next regular payday if you quit . Check with your state 's Department of Labor for specific guidelines . <h> Q : Can my employer hold my final paycheck until I return company equipment ? <p> A : No , your employer ca n't withhold your final paycheck until you return company property . However , your employer may be able to deduct the cost of the unreturned equipment from your paycheck , as long as that would n't cause your wages to fall below minimum wage .

For example , if you are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate planner needs to know enough about Medicaid to know whether it is an issue with regard to your spouse 's inheritance . <p> Unfortunately , there are some attorneys who hold themselves out as " elder law attorneys " but who have little or no experience in this area of practice .

Financial planners , insurance agents , accountants , and bankers , to name just a few other occupations , have been known to do the same thing . ) For that reason , you will want to be particularly careful in narrowing down your selection of an elder law attorney . <p> If you do n't already have a list of prospective lawyers , a great place to start your search is right here at lawyers.com . You can do a free search to come up with a list of lawyers by using the Find A Lawyer search box that can be accessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search box on the right side of your computer screen . ) <p> Once you have a list of lawyers , use the following guidelines to do some initial screening and narrow your list down to three or four prospective candidates : <p> Look at biographical information , including whatever you can find on Web sites for the lawyers and their law firms . Do they appear to have expertise in the area of elder law that you need ? Do they have any information on their Web sites that is helpful to you ? <p> Use search engines to surf the Web . Do searches under the name of the lawyer and his or her law firm . Can you find any articles , FAQ 's or other informational pieces that the lawyer has done that that give you a level of comfort ? <p> Ask other people if they have heard of the attorneys and what they think about them . <p> Contact your state bar association or visit the bar association 's Web site to find out if the lawyer is in good standing . <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear in mind , however , that not every state certifies specialists in elder law . <p> Check the membership directory of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys on the Web . Is the lawyer listed ? If so , does he or she have the designation " Certified Elder Law Attorney " ( abbreviated as " CELA " ) ? <p> Check out the yellow pages of your telephone directory . Does the lawyer advertise ? If so , do you find it compelling ? Helpful ? Tasteful ? <p> Consider any special needs you have . For example , could you benefit from an attorney who speaks a language other than English ? <p> You should n't necessarily cross a lawyer off your list just because he or she did n't have the time to meet with you on short notice . Nor should you expect to be able to discuss your matter on the telephone with the lawyer . Good lawyers are busy so they may not be able to spend as much time as they would like with prospective clients . You should also anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility to his or her staff . In turn , an important consideration should be to assess the way the lawyer 's staff treats you since they are a reflection of how the lawyer practices . At a minimum , you should expect to be treated courteously and professionally both by the staff and by the lawyer . <h> Other Considerations <p> You should be prepared to pay a fee to meet the lawyer . Elder law attorneys seldom take cases on contingency fee or do not charge for the first meeting . When you make the appointment , you should ask what the fee for the first meeting will be . <p> You will probably want to hire a lawyer with at least a few years of experience . However , experience does not a good lawyer make . Every practicing attorney knows other lawyers that he or she would not hire . <p> Unless there are special circumstances , you will want to hire a lawyer with a local office . <p> Before you hire a lawyer , ask for references . You want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustworthiness . Ask if it is okay to talk to some of the lawyer 's representative clients . <p> Ask for a copy of a firm brochure and promotional materials . Crosscheck these materials against other sources and references . <p> Ask to be provided with a copy of the lawyer 's retainer agreement and have it explained to you before decide on retaining the lawyer or the lawyer 's law firm . You may end up paying a lot of money to the lawyer who you retain so make sure you understand what you are signing up for . <p> Use your common sense and gut instincts to evaluate the remaining lawyers on your list . You 'll want to be comfortable with the lawyer you hire . You want to choose the best lawyer who you think will do the best job for you . Start making some telephone calls .

Do n't lose hope : There are ways to enforce a child custody order . <h> Is My Custody Agreement Enforceable ? <p> Its always a good thing when parents can reach their own custody agreements : Parents usually know best when it comes to their own children . But there 's a big difference between verbal custody agreements made by parents and court-ordered custody plans . <p> Parents who work out their own custody and visitation arrangements should submit their agreements to a judge for approval . If you and your ex simply work off of a verbal custody agreement , and then your ex suddenly refuses to follow it , there 's very little a court can do to help you enforce it . By contrast , a custody agreement that 's been approved or issued by a court is binding on both parents and carries penalties if either parent violates it . <p> Some custody orders require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action with the court . But if mediation does n't  resolve the problem , or your ex is unwilling to attend , it 's time to ask a court for help . <h> What Can I Do When My Ex Prevents Visitation ? <p> Both parents must follow custody orders , which includes allowing visitation , even if they do n't want to . If your ex cuts off visitation between you and your child , its important to seek help . For example , if your childs other parent cancels your scheduled visit , you should send a text or email requesting a make-up day . Youll have to take more drastic measures if your ex regularly prevents you from seeing your childtalk to your attorney , write an email or formal letter to your ex , attend mediation to resolve the issue , or file a court action for contempt .

In the most extreme cases , a judge can put a parent in jail for consistently ignoring the terms of a visitation order . Jail time is usually only appropriate when one parent has done something especially egregious , like take a child out of state to prevent visitation . <h> When Should I Call the Police ? <p> Its important not to overreact to minor custody violations . For example , if your childs other parent drops your child off 30 minutes late , do n't  rush to report it to the police .

However , it can be frustrating if your childs other parent is entitled to visitation and never takes it . You may feel like this could be harmful to your children if they 're expecting to see mom or dad , but are constantly being disappointed . On top of that , the other parent constantly canceling at the last minute can be incredibly disruptive as it forces you to plan your life around visits that may or may not happen .

What do you have to prove ? And how does this type of claim ( i.e. , a contaminated food claim ) differ from a food poisoning claim ? The short answer is , you may have a claim if you have damages -- in other words , if you suffered some kind of injury or harm as a result of the incident . Read on to learn more . <p> If you purchased contaminated food in a market or a restaurant , the defendant(s) could be any business in the food product 's chain of manufacture and distribution . <h> Food Contamination Versus Food Poisoning <p> First , let 's look at the difference between a contaminated food claim and a claim alleging food poisoning .

@@25934011 @5934011/ <h> How Does a Lease-to-Own Work ? <p> My husband and I finally finished looking at all the houses on the market in our area that were even remotely within our price range . We short-listed three and began looking at how we were going to get a loan to buy one of them . With the mortgage industry in financial chaos , lenders are taking a hard , close look at applicants . They 're more than willing to loan on our first choice of a home , however , if we can come up with enough of a down payment to sooth their fears . There 's just one tiny problem . We only have about half of what they would like us to have in the way of a down payment . Fortunately , there is a solution . Our favorite house was just reduced in price and the possibility of a lease-to-own option was raised . <p> Bingo . Three weeks later and we just started unpacking boxes in our new house . Its ours , yes , but technically were renting it for the next twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will exercise our option to buy it . <p> So , this is how the process works : <p> First , you 'll make an offer similar to the kind you would make in a straight purchase . They 're asking a certain amount of money , you offer less , they counter somewhere in the middle ( if you 're lucky ! ) . With the offer , though , you also submit your intention that this be a lease-to-own . You will fill out papers that look a lot like a standard rental agreement . When all parties agree on the terms , a lawyer will draw up a contract which everyone signs . This means that legally you have the right to buy the house during the time period when you are renting it and the owners cant sell it to someone else in the meantime . <p> Next , you 'll put down some cash up front which will go toward your eventual down payment . An agreed-upon amount of each months rent will also be applied to your down payment . When you exercise the option to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the down payment on the house . If at the end of your lease you decide you do n't  want to buy the house , or can not get a loan for it , then you lose the money you 've already paid towards the down payment and the monthly rent . That 's the risk . <p> So , why take such a gamble ? Simple . Twelve months can buy you the time you need to make the whole process go smoothly ( or happen at all ) . In twelve months you can finish saving up the money for your down payment and shop for the perfect loan . If needed , you can clean up your credit , too . You also get a chance to test drive your new house and new neighborhood and make sure that its all you thought it would be in the first place . It helps eliminate buyers remorse because you 'll know a lot more about the quirks and pitfalls of the house you want to buy before making a long-term commitment to it . Think of it like an engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement if you have to . It will be messy and costly , but far less so than ending up trapped in a relationship that 's all wrong for you . <p> In formalizing the lease to own agreement with a contract , make sure you have a title company handle things . They can ensure that your right to purchase the house is recorded on the title , which helps protect you by preserving a record of your rights in relation to the house . <p> Not all sellers will agree to a lease-to-own arrangement . However , if you find a house you love and need a little time to make the financial end of the transaction work out , it never hurts to ask . The good news is that right now it truly is a buyers market and the longer things continue the way they are , the more desperateand flexiblesellers will become .

@@25934016 @5934016/ <h> Death during the Commission of a Felony <p> The felony murder rule elevates killings that occur during the commission of a felony to murders . Several limitations apply to this old and arguably unnecessary theory . <p> " A death that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of any felony constitutes murder " is the classic definition of the felony murder doctrine . This doctrine has been roundly criticized and narrowed by commentators and legislators , yet it still exists in some form or other in nearly all states . Modern statutes make it first-degree murder when the death occurs during very serious , specified felonies , such as rape , robbery , burglary , and arson . Deaths occurring during the commission of all other felonies become second-degree murder . <h> Unintentional Death <p> The rule applies whether the felon kills intentionally , recklessly , or even accidentally ; and even when the death was unforeseeable . For example , a robber whose gun discharges by mistake , killing a bystander , can be charged with felony murder . And , a killing by a codefendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two robbers kills a victim , then is himself killed the surviving partner can be charged with felony murder . <p> As these examples illustrate , a perpetrator can end-up charged with murder in the most attenuated circumstances . The problem here is that normally , first-degree murder requires that the prosecutor prove that the defendant intended the death and had a state of mind called " malice . " Broadly speaking , malice is evidence of a " depraved heart , " or an evil state of mind . Prosecutors get around the malice requirement by arguing that the intention that propelled the underlying felony constituted " implied malice . " <h> The Rationale Behind the Felony Murder Rule <p> Several theories attempt to justify the felony murder rule , though they find little support in legal scholarship . The most common one is to claim that the felony murder rule deters crime.This theory argues that if would-be felons realized that theyll face murder charges if an accidental death happens during the offense , these folks will re-think their crime plans ( or at least commit their offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  support this argument ( how does one deter an unintended act ? ) . And , no empirical data supports this argument . <h> Limits on the Rule : All Felonies ? <p> As noted earlier , modern laws differentiate between inherently dangerous , serious felonies , and all others . First-degree murder applies to deaths occurring in the former group , second-degree to those in the latter . <p> Some courts identify " inherently dangerous " crimes by analyzing them in the abstract , and asking whether by their very nature , there 's a substantial likelihood that a killing will result . Other courts examine the facts of the individual cases before them , and decide on a case-by-case basis whether , given the circumstances and the defendants conduct , the death should be considered first- or second-degree murder . <h> Limits on the Rule : No Bootstrapping <p> Courts in many states will not allow prosecutors to charge felony murder when the underlying felony is part of , or depends on , the killing . For example , imagine a husband who discovers his wife in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normally , the husband would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter ( an intentional killing done in the heat of passion ) , a felony . But because a death occurred during the commission of a felony ( the manslaughter ) , might the prosecutor now charge murder ? If that were allowed , the crime of voluntary manslaughter would disappear , which is not a result that the legislature or the courts intended . <h> Limits on the Rule : When Must the Death Occur ? <p> The felony murder rule typically has a time and distance limit . The time period generally begins when the accuseds actions have progressed at least to the point where he could be charged with an attempt at the crime , and it lasts until the perpetrator has reached a place of apparent safety . So , for example , someone killed while the criminal makes his getaway would expose the criminal to the felony murder rule . Importantly , the time component is marked by when the killing occurs , not when death occurs . For example , felony murder could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident but lingers for ten days , long after the crime is over , before succumbing to her injuries . Her assailant could be charged with felony murder . <h> Limits on the Rule : When Non-Felons Kill <p> Targets of assaults , robberies , and other crimes very often fight back , sometimes with weapons and with resulting homicides . What role should the felony murder rule play when , for example , a victim shoots back and kills one of multiple assailants , or accidentally kills a bystander ? May surviving assailants be charged under the felony murder rule for these deaths ? <p> These deaths certainly occurred during the commission of a felony but they did not occur in furtherance of it , which is the limiting consideration that many courts will apply to scenarios like this . Courts that adopt this approach will apply it to a killing committed by a policeman or a bystander , too , and will not allow a charge of felony murder . But notice that this limit applies only to non-felons . When an accomplice of the defendant does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant , who becomes responsible for the agents acts . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> My partner died when our meth lab blew up .

Can you get schools or colleges to change information in education records ? <p> School records often include a lot of sensitive information about studentsand even their families . As a parent or guardian , you might be concerned about what 's in your childs record , who can see it , and whether you can do anything to change it . <h> What 's in a Students School Record ? <p> School records typically include : <p> " directory information " about the student ( name , address , phone number , and other information that typically appears in school yearbooks ) <p> additional , more personal identifying information , including the students birth date and social security number <p> disciplinary actions taken against the student , such as suspensions or expulsions , and the reasons for those actions <p> medical and health records that the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school ) <p> special education records , including individualized education programs ( EIPs ) , and <p> participation in academic and other school activities , such as sports or student government . <h> Who Can See School Records ? <p> The privacy of school records is protected under state and federal law . The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) gives parents or guardians ( including anyone acting in a parental role in the parent 's absence , such as a foster parent or stepparent ) the right to inspect their childrens records . " Eligible " students ( meaning those who are at least 18 or attending post-secondary school ) can also view their own records . The law applies to all educational institutions that receive federal fundswhich includes practically every public and private school and college . <p> Without the written consent of the parent or eligible student , schools can disclose the records ( except for directory information ) only to specified other people , including : <p> school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records ( including schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enroll ) <p> financial aid officials <p> authorities in the states child welfare or juvenile justice system , and <p> anyone who has a court order or subpoena for the records . <p> FERPAs protections have their limits , however . Two important areas of concern : <p> Files created by school police . If a law enforcement unit at a school ( which can include police officers assigned to the campus ) creates or maintains a file concerning your child , its not considered an " education " record under FERPA . This is true even if the information in the file is based on the same incident that led to school disciplinary proceedings ( which will appear in the education record ) . Depending on the laws in your state , this exception means that the school police file on your child may be a matter of the public record and could be released to the media or other third parties without your consent . <p> No satisfying remedy for FERPA violations . If a school releases education records to someone who is n't authorized to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant sue the school for violating their civil rights . The only option for parents and students is to file an administrative complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office of the U.S. Department of Education . Unfortunately , there 's no time limit for processing the claim and no guarantee that you 'll get a formal hearing . ( For more information , see the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse fact sheet on privacy in education . ) <h> Can Noncustodial Parents See Their Childrens Records ? <p> FERPA gives either parent the right to see a childs education records , unless a court order says otherwise . But this seemingly clear rule is anything but when viewed in the context of additional federal rules and state practice . In one case , for example , a federal appeals court held that a mother who did n't  have custody couldnt request a hearing under FERPA to change her childs school records , because the divorce decree stated that the father had " all legal rights " over the childs education . Also , federal regulations state that any parents who claim their children as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their education records . To complicate matters more , some state laws give noncustodial parents more explicit rights to their childrens school-related information . <h> How Do I Get Access to a School Record ? <p> If you want to see your childs education record ( or your own ) , the best place to start is often the last school the student attendedor the school districts main office . ( Generally , school records accompany students when they transfer to new schools , though the old school may also keep them as well . ) Some school districts require you to sign an official release form that you can get from the school . <p> Under FERPA , schools have to make the records available for on-site review within 45 days after a request . The federal law does n't  require schools to mail copies unless that 's the only way the parents or eligible students can get access to the information ( for instance , when they live far away ) . However , many schools make it a practice to provide copies ( sometimes for a small copying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changed ? <p> What if you 're concerned that something in your childs record is wrong or could cause a problem down the road ? Under FERPA , parents and eligible students have the right to request changes if something in the record is inaccurate , misleading , or violates the students privacy rights .

Parents , guardians , and eligible students are also entitled to a hearing if the school refuses to make the requested change . ( For more details , see the U.S. Department of Education 's guidance for parents on FERPA . ) <p> It might be a good idea to review your childs school records periodically , to make sure they 're current , complete , and accurate .

@@25934020 @5934020/ <h> What to Know Before Settling Your Workers ' Comp Case in Georgia <p> Throughout your workers compensation case , you will probably have one or more opportunities to settle your claim . Workers settle their workers compensation claims for a variety of reasons . Sometimes , an injury has stabilized , and the worker no longer wants to deal with the insurance company . Other times , the worker decides that taking a disputed case to trial is too risky and accepts a lump sum instead . ( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <p> Accepting a settlement offer in your Georgia workers compensation case is a big decision . Before signing a settlement agreement , you should consider what you will be getting and what you will be giving up . <h> When Should I Settle My Workers Compensation Claim ? <p> Georgia workers compensation law encourages settlement , whenever possible . Unlike some states , you can settle your Georgia workers comp claim at any time , even before you are fully healed from your injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers wait to settle until their medical conditions are stable and not expected to improve any further . This is called maximum medical improvement ( MMI ) . It is risky to settle before MMI because it might not be clear whether you will need additional medical treatment or whether your condition will be permanent . Without knowing the full extent of your injuries , it can be very difficult to accurately value your claim . <h> What Rights Am I Giving Up ? <p> In Georgia , like in all other states , settlements are voluntary . No one can force you , or the insurance company , to settle ; both parties must agree to the terms of the settlement . <p> Most settlements require you to release all claims against your employer arising out of your work injuryincluding the right to any additional medical treatment , wage loss benefits , and vocational rehabilitation services . <p> Occasionally , a settlement will be more limited . For example , a limited settlement might end your wage loss and vocational rehabilitation claims , but allow you to continue receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements are rare . Most insurance companies are not willing to leave claims partially open ; they would much rather close a workers compensation claim and end their obligation to pay benefits . <h> Types of Workers Compensation Settlements <p> You can settle your Georgia workers comp claim through either a liability or no-liability settlement . Both types of settlements must be submitted to the State Board of Workers Compensation for approval . No-liability settlements are used in disputed claims and require additional paperwork . <p> Most settlements are paid in a lump sum . However , in some cases , the insurance company might agree to a settlement that is paid out over time ( called a structured settlement ) . Typically , structured settlements are used in catastrophic claims , when a worker wont be able to earn a living or needs long-term care . These arrangements give a worker a steady stream of income through scheduled payments ( for example , on a weekly , monthly or annual basis ) . Many structured settlements also include an up-front payment for outstanding medical bills and other expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers compensation settlements . ) <h> How Much Should I Settle For ? <p> Every workers compensation claim is different , and there is no simple formula to valuing a claim .

The insurance company will respond to your demand by accepting it , rejecting it , or making a new offer in response . This negotiation process can continue until you agree on a settlement amount . <p> Mediation is another opportunity to try to settle your case . Mediation is an informal conference where you and the insurance company will present your sides of the dispute to a neutral party ( called a mediator ) .

( For more information , see What Will Be Taken Out of My Workers Compensation Award or Settlement ? ) <p> Once the judge approves your settlement , you should receive your settlement payment within 20 days of the judges order . If you do not receive your check within this time frame , the insurance company may have to pay a 20% penalty . <h> What Happens If I Change My Mind About Settlement ? <p> You can cancel the settlement at any time before approval by the Workers Comp Board , even if the settlement paperwork has already been filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , it is final and you can not change your mind .

While you are not required to hire a lawyer to settle your claim , its usually in your best interest to do so . <p> As noted above , a settlement usually means that you 're agreeing to give up all rights to collect additional workers compensation benefits related to your injury .

Although many people think of all police undercover operations as " entrapment , " in fact law enforcement agents and informants may use false identities and deception in their undercover investigations . But there 's a limit : The entrapment defense is an important check on what police can do to make an arrest by enticing someone to commit a crime . <p> Typically , defendants raise an entrapment defense when they claim that an undercover agent or informant convinced them to commit a crime that they were not predisposed to commit .

For example , an undercover agent might ask someone to commit a crime based on friendship , hardship , or a play for sympathy . If a judge or jury concludes that a defendant was pressured to commit a crime , they will likely find that the defendant has been induced . To establish inducement in most jurisdictions , a defendant will be required to show that it is more likely than not that he has been induced by law enforcement to commit a crime . <h> Predisposition <p> Defendants who have presented evidence that they were induced may not be home free just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , the question of predisposition is usually the more important factor . Once inducement has been raised by the defense , the prosecutor has the burden to prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime . In other words , the government must demonstrate that the defendant was ready , willing and ablethat his will to follow the law was not overcome by the inducement . For example , if the prosecutor can show that the defendant himself had previously proposed similar criminal acts to other people , the defense of entrapment will be extremely difficult to establish . But on the other hand , if the defendant has never engaged in ( or even discussed ) the proposed criminal act , the prosecutor may fail to establish predisposition . In short , when there is inducement and a lack of predisposition , the defendant has established the entrapment defense . <h> " I Did n't  Do It , And If I Did , I Was Entrapped " <p> When asserting entrapment , defendants typically do not deny that a wrongful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they claim that an undercover agent improperly induced the criminal conduct in order to make an arrest . Defendants may , however , defend themselves by claiming both that the prosecution has not proved the crime and that , even if it did , they were entrapped . <h> The Risk of Using an Entrapment Defense <p> Asserting an entrapment defense can have a real downside . By claiming entrapment , a defendant is essentially saying " I would n't have done this if the government had n't  made me . " By taking that position , you invite the prosecutor to respond with proof about your past . If the court believes that such evidence is a fair and relevant response , the jury will get to hear it . This potentially damaging evidence might otherwise not be admissible . <p> For example , the prosecutor may be able to call witnesses to testify that a defendant has participated in the same or similar criminal acts . Even evidence of preliminary discussions concerning proposed criminal activities with other people at other times might be offered by the prosecutor to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant impact on a jurys opinion of the defendant . <p> Note , however , that a defendants prior criminal history will not always come up in an entrapment defense . If the previous criminal conduct is old enough or distinctive enough from the crime charged , evidence of that prior activity should not be admitted into evidence . For example , a defendants history of illegal gambling would be irrelevant to a case involving the solicitation of a prostitute . <h> The Entrapment Defense : Best Case Scenario <p> The best cases for an entrapment defense involve extremely persistent and manipulative efforts by law enforcement to get an otherwise law-abiding individual to commit a crime . Judges and juries look askance at repeated undercover badgering over a long period of time ; or appeals to sympathy based on extraordinary circumstances , such helping a " close friend " obtain critical medical treatment or avoid financial ruin . And , there 's a limit to a courts willingness to allow a misrepresentation about the law : If an undercover officer were to lie to an individual about the requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a court could find entrapment under either the objective or subjective test . <p> In short , if the agent was insistent and the defendant was resistant , the entrapment defense might well be a viable legal strategy . <h> Questions to Ask Your Lawyer <p> How does my prior conduct and criminal history affect the advisability of an entrapment defense ? <p> Can I file a civil lawsuit against a police department if a judge throws out a criminal charge against me based on entrapment ? <p> Is it entrapment when an undercover officer poses as a teenager on a social networking site and posts sexually suggestive comments ? <p> What should I do if I think an undercover police officer is acting inappropriately while investigating suspected crime in my business establishment ? 
@@25934022 @5934022/ <h> What to Know Before Settling Your Workers ' Comp Case in Texas <p> The majority of workers eventually settle their workers compensation claims . In Texas , as in every other state , settlements are voluntary : Both parties must agree to the terms of the settlement . Workers comp claims are settled for many reasons . Sometimes , an injury has stabilized , and the worker no longer wants to deal with the insurance company . Other times , the worker decides that taking a disputed case to trial is too risky and accepts a lower sum offered by the insurance company . ( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <h> When Should I Settle My Workers Compensation Claim ? <p> If a Texas workers compensation settlement involves permanent disability , as many do , it can not be settled until you reach maximum medical improvement ( MMI ) and receive an impairment rating . MMI occurs when your medical condition is stable and is not expected to improve any further . <h> What Rights Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit you from settling the medical portion of your workers compensation claim . In other words , your medical coverage will continue if you need treatment in the future , even after you reach a settlement with the insurance company . You can , however , settle all other aspects of your workers comp claim , such as your right to income benefits . <p> While most other states allow lump sum settlements , Texas does not . The only benefits that may be paid in a lump sum are impairment income benefits . If you have been back to work for at least three months and earn at least 80% of your average weekly wage , you can commute your impairment income benefits . This means you will receive your benefits in a lump sum . In exchange , you give up your right to receive any additional income benefits in the future . <h> How Much Should I Settle For ? <p> Every workers compensation claim is different , and there is no simple formula to valuing a claim . Due to the complexity of Texas workers compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement offers and negotiate with the insurance company . <p> When evaluating a settlement offer , you should consider several factors , including : <p> how much you might be owed in income benefits <p> any temporary income benefits that the insurance company failed to pay while you were off work , and <p> any penalties that the insurance company owes you for failing to pay your benefits on time . <p> You should also consider the weaknesses in your claim , if it is being disputed . When you take a case to trial , there is always a chance that you will lose . If there is a major dispute about whether you 're entitled to benefits , and it is unlikely that you will win your case at trial , you may want to compromise and accept a lower settlement instead . Walking away with something is better than nothing . <p> A settlement means that you 're agreeing to give up most of your rights to collect additional workers compensation benefits related to your injury . <h> Who Starts Settlement Negotiations ? <p> Because you are the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will typically start the process by giving the insurance company a settlement demand . The insurance company will respond to your demand by accepting it , rejecting it , or making a new offer in response . This negotiation process can continue until you agree on a settlement amount . <p> If you have appealed a workers compensation denial , you must attend a benefit review conference . A benefit review conference is an informal conference where you and the insurance company will present your sides of the dispute to a neutral party ( called a benefit review officer ) . The benefit review officer will guide you through negotiations and try to help you reach an agreement . <h> Getting a Settlement Approved <p> Once you and the insurance company have agreed on a settlement , the Texas Workers Compensation Commissioner must approve it . You will not have a hearing . Instead , a series of documents and forms will be submitted to the Division of Workers Compensation . The settlement will be approved only if the Commissioner finds that it is in your best interests . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of legal knowledge and skillyou must be able to give your claim a monetary value , negotiate with the insurance company , complete settlement forms , and comply with other laws . While you are not required to hire a lawyer to settle your claim , its usually in your best interest to do so . <p> As noted above , a settlement means that you 're agreeing to give up most of your rights to collect additional workers compensation benefits related to your injury . At the very least , you should have a workers comp lawyer review any settlement agreement that you are thinking of signing .

Eventually , the incident may raise a different sort of red flag , when the patient asks whether the doctors mistake amounts to medical malpractice . The answer may be more complicated than you might expect . That 's the focus of this article : understanding when an error in the healthcare setting can lead to a valid malpractice claim . <h> What is Medical Malpractice ? <p> There 's a lot more to a viable medical malpractice case than merely a mistake on the part of a health care professional or facility . <p> here 's an overview of the different elements that must be in place -- and that , when in dispute , must be established through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal team -- in order to bring a successful medical malpractice lawsuit : <p> the existence of a doctor-patient relationship <p> the provision of care ( which includes decisions , treatment , and the failure to treat ) that fell below the accepted medical standard of care ( a " breach " of the standard of care that amounts to " medical negligence , " in the language of the law ) <p> a causal connection between the care providers medical negligence and the patients harm , and <p> quantifiable harm ( " damages " ) to the patient as a result . <p> In some ways , defining medical malpractice means defining these elements , so let 's take a closer look at a few of them -- specifically , those upon which the success of a medical malpractice case typically hinge : the " medical standard of care " and the doctors ( or other care providers ) breach of that standard ( " medical negligence " ) . <p> It 's the plaintiffs medical expert who provides the key evidence , through detailed ( and often quite complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , the appropriate course of treatment or diagnosis methodology , and exactly what the doctor did ( or did not do ) at each stage of care . <h> The Medical Standard of Care <p> The issue of the appropriate medical standard of care to apply is often one of the most contentious in a medical malpractice case , and proving this element is usually a two-pronged task that includes : <p> establishing the appropriate medical standard of care that should apply to the patients case , and <p> showing in detail exactly how the defendant ( the doctor or other care provider ) fell short of meeting that standard . <p> In a nutshell , the medical standard of care is the type and amount of skill and attention that a prudent , similarly-trained health care professional , in the same medical community as the defendant , would have provided to the patient .

The plaintiffs expert witness(es) will also need to prove a causal link between that mistake and measurable harm to the patient . In other words , it needs to be shown that were it not for the error , the patient would not have experienced a worsening of his or her health .

The answer depends on what counts as work time and what does not . The basic rule under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) is that time you spend that benefits your employer and that your employer controls is work time , which must be paid . This might include time during which you are not actually working , such as travel time and training . <h> Work Hour Basics <p> Under the FLSA , you are entitled to be paid for all time during which you are " suffered or permitted " to work . This includes not only your scheduled work hoursfor example , 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , Monday through Fridaybut also any work you do voluntarily .

These activities count as work timeand must be paidif they are an integral part of the employees primary work duties . Consider the following examples : <p> An employee who needs to wear heavy protective gear to work with toxic chemicals spends ten minutes each morning and evening donning and doffing the gear . Because this task is a necessary part of the employees job , it must be paid . On the other hand , an employee who showers and changes after biking into work is not entitled to be paid for that time , because it is not necessary to do his or her job . <p> An employee who arrives at work to stock shelves half an hour before starting a register shift must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employees job duties . However , an employee who must wait in line for a security screening before entering the employers office building is not entitled to be paid for that time . <h> Travel Time <p> You are not entitled to be paid for commuting time between your home and regular work site .. However , if travel is part of your jobfor example , because you must go to client offices to troubleshoot computer problemsyou must be paid for that time . <p> If you take trips for work , your right to be paid depends on the length of the trip and when you travel . You are entitled to be paid for all time spent working on the trip . For example , if you do work on the plane ride , you must be paid for that time . <p> For same-day trips , you are entitled to be paid for travel time , less the time it takes you to get to and from your home to the travel hub ( for example , the train station or airport ) . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are entitled to be paid from the time you arrive at the train station through the time when you return to the train station in the evening . This means you wont be paid for your travel to and from your home to the train station , even if it takes longer than your usual commute . <p> For overnight trips , you must be paid for travel that takes place during your normal working hours . If , for example , you usually work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , you are entitled to be paid for travel taking place during those hours , even if you travel on a day you normally have off ( for example , on Saturday or Sunday ) . <p> You must be paid for shorter breaks ( 20 minutes or less ) and for any " breaks " during which you have to work . <h> Waiting and On-Call Time <p> Time you spend waiting at the worksite must be paid .

" Examples include time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ring and time a delivery person spends waiting to pick up the next package . <p> For time you spend on call away from the worksite , your right to be paid depends on how much control your employer has over your time . If you can wait at home or elsewhere while doing what you want , you are likely not entitled to pay . If , on the other hand , you have to stay within fifteen miles of the workplace and report to work quickly after getting called , you may be entitled to pay for your on-call time . To learn more , see Getting Paid for On-Call Time . <h> Meal and Rest Breaks <p> If you are relieved of all work , your employer does not have to pay you for breaks lasting more than 20 minutes under the FLSA .

@@25934035 @5934035/ <h> Quitclaim Deed Overview <p> When might a quitclaim deed be useful for transferring ownership of real estate ? <p> Deeds are legal documents that transfer ownership of real property from one party to another . The real property in question could be a vacant parcel of land , a mobile home , an apartment , or even a large factory . There are several different types of deeds used for real estate transfers , each of which conveys a different type of interest in the property from the grantor/seller ( the person giving the property ) to the grantee/buyer ( the person receiving the property ) . <p> Quitclaim deeds ( sometimes misspelled as " quick claim deeds " ) are one such type of deed . They 're rarely used in an ordinary , arms ' length real estate sale , however . That 's because they could present a significant risk for the buyer . Whether you are a buyer or a seller , you should be aware of the uses of and risks associated with this type of legal document . <p> The simplest situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the property is being given to someone else , rather than being sold . <h> What Is a Quitclaim Deed ? <p> Normally , something called a " grant deed " or " warranty deed " is used to convey title to a particular property or parcel of land . In exchange for a fixed amount of money , the seller agrees to give good title to the buyer . " Good title " in this context means that the seller actually owns the parcel ; the buyer wont move any furniture into the house , only to have a third party suddenly emerge and claim to be the true owner . <p> A buyer who was given a grant deed or warranty deed in the above scenario would likely sue the seller for fraudulent misrepresentation , among other claims . After all , the seller promised good title to the property . <p> A quitclaim deed is quite different . A seller who gives a quitclaim deed is promising merely to convey whatever interest he or she might have in the property . That interest could be full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quitclaim deed passes only such right , title , and interest as the grantor has at the time of making the deed . Put differently , the grantor makes no warranties , guarantees , or promises about the property . This is the complete opposite of a warranty deed , in which the grantor transfers property with a guarantee of clear title . <h> When It 's Appropriate to Use a Quitclaim Deed <p> Given all of this , why would anyone want to use or accept a quitclaim deed ? <p> The simplest situation in which a quitclaim deed is useful is for transfers where the property is being given to someone else , rather than being sold . <p> For example , parents may quitclaim a property to their children when they move to an assisted living center , or for various financial reasons . A married co-owner may quitclaim his or her share of the property to the other co-owner during their divorce . Or , a sole owner can create co-ownership with someone else by using a quitclaim deed , perhaps after marriage in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quitclaim title to the property into a revocable living trust , for estate-planning reasons . <p> Quitclaim deeds may also be used to deal with the possibility of existing or possible questions about a propertys title . A quitclaim deed is also known as a " deed of release " for this reason . If there 's a chance that someone could have a claim to the property , such as a divorced or divorcing spouse , or there 's a problem with the chain of title to the property ( e.g. , a paid-off loan that was n't properly released ) a quitclaim deed from the appropriate party can be used to resolve the possible " cloud " or defect in the title . Such " clouds " can affect value and the ability to sell property . <p> Consider this example : Bob and Susan are getting a divorce . Susan will be keeping the house , and that issue is resolved between them , although no final decree of divorce has been entered . Susan wants to sell the house to Rita and move to a smaller apartment . Rita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob after she buys the house from Susan , given that he and Susan are technically still married , and Bob 's name is on the house title . Ritas concerns would be resolved , however , if Bob simply provides her with a quitclaim deed . This quitclaim deed would grant to Rita any interest that Bob may or may not ever have in the property . This would allow the sale between Susan and Rita to proceed . <p> Consider another example : In a tax sale , a local government or " taxing body " sells a property in order to collect unpaid taxes . Through a quitclaim deed , the government conveys to the tax-sale buyer the interest it gained in the property under state tax foreclosure laws , and no more . Such a deed notifies the buyer that title might be clouded . <h> Quitclaim Deed Requirements <p> Each state 's laws contain specific requirements for completing a quitclaim deed . Most every state requires the following information on the document : <p> grantor and grantee names <p> legal description of the property <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notary public , and <p> grantors signature . <p> In some states , the grantee must also sign the quitclaim deed . A few states , such as Florida and Georgia , also require the signatures of witnesses before the deed can be recorded . <p> After completing a quitclaim deed , it must be filed in the land records office in the county where the property is located ( sometimes called the recorder or county clerk ) . <h> Quitclaim Deeds Are Not Reversible <p> Once a quitclaim deed has been signed and delivered , the grantor no longer owns the property . The transfer is final and can not be reversed unless the grantee " quitclaims " the property back . If the grantee ( person who received the property ) does n't  agree to this , the grantor must prove the transfer was invalid by showing that the deed was signed under threats , external pressure or because the grantee lied .

The mediator will help you to generate options that would not be possible in courtfor example , perhaps there is an imaginative way of renting or sharing the disputed land that would leave both of you better off . <h> Will Title Insurance Cover the Dispute ? <p> Unfortunately , the standard title insurance policy contains an exclusion specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into boundary line disputes .

In a continuing trespass or ejectment action , you are asking a judge ( typically a state court judge ) to find that your neighbor is trespassing on your land , and further ordering that the neighbor remove him- or herself and any possessions . This type of lawsuit can win you money damages in some cases , especially if you can show that the value of your home has been diminished by your neighbors extensive , continuous occupation over part of your land . <p> Second , you can sue for a declaratory judgment . A declaratory judgment is a way to put your dispute in front of a judge , and have the judge make a legal determination as to whether or not you own the subject land . A declaratory judgment is , perhaps , a less aggressive form of litigation , since it does not ordinarily include an award of money damages ( unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determination based on the applicable deeds and laws . <h> Property Improvements a Common Source of Boundary Disputes <p> Neighbors rarely begin random arguments over boundaries .

A neighbor 's most likely defenses with regard to a boundary dispute might include : <p> You have the facts wrong , or have incorrectly read the deed to your property . <p> Your neighbor owns the disputed property through adverse possession , a doctrine that allows someone who has used a piece of property without the owner 's objection for a statutorily prescribed number of years ( for example , seven in Florida , ten in New York , and 20 in Maryland and New Jersey ) to gain ownership over that piece of land . <p> Property use established a prescriptive easement , authorizing your neighbor to come across your property . <p> You gave consent to use your property . <p> You waited too long file a lawsuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to file ) ran out . <p> Familiarity with the legal and factual issues can help you communicate with your real estate attorney and find the best way to solve your boundary dispute , in or out of court . <p> Percentage of lawsuits that settle before trialApproximately 95% of all the cases filed in U.S. never go to trial , but instead are settled out of court . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Is this the sort of dispute my title insurance policy might cover ? <p> If this is n't a clear case of where the boundary lines lie , but has more to do with usage ( such as an adverse possession claim ) , who would likely win the dispute in court ? <p> How should I deal with my neighbor 's encroaching activities in the short-term , while we wait for the dispute to be resolved ?

The figure that you 'll remit , as well as the date that its due , will appear in the order sent to you after the trial . In this article , you 'll learn about alternative ways to pay a judgment , what could happen if you are n't  able to pay it , and how you might benefit from filing for bankruptcy . <h> Paying the Judgment : The Process <p> The small claims court system allows people to resolve legal problems in an efficient and cost-effective manner . It starts when the plaintiff files paperwork asking the court to award money for harm caused by the defendant ( the person or company being sued ) . The defendant might file allegations , as well . <p> A creditor who ca n't locate your property independently can ask the court to order you to appear and answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter and decide the outcome . The winning side , or " judgment creditor , " will receive an award stating the amount owed . The losing party , or " judgment debtor , " is expected to pay the award to the judgment creditor . Otherwise , the judgment creditor can take steps to recover the debt using collection techniques ( more below ) . <h> Other Payment Options <p> If you have a judgment against you , in most cases you 'll be expected to pay the entire amount in one lump sum . However , some courts will set up a payment plan if both parties agree to it at the trial . The schedule should appear on the order . <p> Be aware that your court might have other payment options available . For instance , California has a special small claims rule that allows the judgment debtor to make payment directly to the court . While this is an unusual practice , if it 's available to you , it would be a good idea to use it . The court would have proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court to find out if it offers a similar program . <h> Paying Less Than What You Owe <p> You can also negotiate a payment schedule directly with the judgment creditoror even come to an agreement that allows you to pay a lesser amount . For instance , the judgment creditor might take less if you offer to pay right away . For most , the offer would be more enticing than the prospect of chasing you down using time-consuming , and sometimes costly , collection techniques . Once you give the creditor the full or agreed-upon amount , the judgment creditor must let the court know that you paid the debt . <h> The Consequences of Refusing to Pay <p> Judgments do n't  go away quickly . Your state will likely give the judgment creditor a significant amount of time to collect the debt .

The bank will be instructed to withdraw the funds in your account up to the amount necessary to pay off the judgment . <p> Seizure . The judgment creditor can take propertysuch as real estate and personal possessionsto sell at auction . Because of the time and expense involved , its unusual for a creditor to use this procedure unless you own valuable property free and clear . <p> Till tap . The judgment creditor can instruct law enforcement to enter your business and empty your cash register . <p> Keeper .

Youll be required to disclose information such as the location of your bank accounts and real estate holdings , and whether you have any business interests . If you fail to show up for the examination , the court will likely issue an arrest warrant . <h> You Can Protect Necessary Property <p> A judgment creditor is n't entitled to take everything that you own . Your states exemption statutes will tell you what you can protect . Most states allow residents to keep the things needed to work and live , such as clothing , furnishings , and a modest car . In fact , many people can keep everything that they own . Even so , some states are more generous than others . Take , for instance , Texas .

But what if you work in a state , city , or county that has its own wage laws ? Which rules apply to you if these laws conflict ? Usually , your employer must follow whichever law is most generous to employees . However , there are some exceptions to this rule . <h> Most Favorable Provisions Apply <p> The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) is the federal law that governs wages and hours . The FLSA requires employers to pay the minimum wage , requires employers to pay overtime when employees work over 40 hours in a week , and creates child labor standards . ( For more information , see our Wage and Hour FAQ . ) <p> Most states also have their own wage and hours laws .

@@25934042 @5934042/ <h> Q : What is a class action ? <p> A : A class action is a unique kind of lawsuit that is filed on behalf of a class of people who all have similar claims against the same defendant ( or sometimes , against multiple defendants ) . The case is filed by one or a few class representatives or lead plaintiffs . Once the case is filed , the court will determine whether it is appropriate for the matter to proceed as a class action . Typically , the court bases this determination on careful consideration of four main factors : <p> Numerosity - Are there enough individual claims to make class certification the most efficient and reasonable way to proceed ? <p> Commonality - Are the claims sufficiently alike in terms of harm and wrongdoing ? <p> Adequacy - Are the representatives up to the task of representing the class fairly and effectively ? <p> A typical class action arises when hundreds or thousands of people have been affected by the same problem or issue . Class actions may be filed against : <p> a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects <p> a bank that has improperly charged fees to hundreds or thousands of customers , or <p> a large company that has engaged in discriminatory conduct against thousands of its employees . <h> Q : How will a class action settlement or judgment affect me ? <p> A : If you 're a member of the class , you 'll be bound by the terms of any class action settlement or judgment , unless you have the choice to opt out , and you follow the procedures for doing so . In general , all class members must abide by the terms of any judgment or settlement . If the lawsuit is one that seeks monetary damages from the defendant , you 'll usually receive notice of the proceedings ( by email or " snail " mail ) , a description of the action , and instructions on how to opt out . By opting out , you will not be bound by any settlement or judgment , and you 'll be free to file an individual claim against the defendant , seeking your own damages and making your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by opting out , you will not be able to share in any financial recovery obtained by the larger class . And if the lawsuit primarily seeks some kind of " declaratory " or " injunctive " relief ( meaning the whole point of the class action is to spell out the parties ' rights , or force the defendant to take a certain action , or stop certain conduct ) , you usually wo n't have the option of opting out . <h> Q : How do I become part of a class action ? <p> A : In most situations , you become part of the class automatically ; you do not have to do anything to join . <p> If any action is required on the part of a prospective class member ( this is exceedingly rare ) , the notice of the class action will spell out what steps must be taken in order to participate . But again , usually no action is required . At the beginning of the process , the attorneys determine who might have been affected by the defendant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated SEC rules , or who bought the defective vehicle , for example . Then , all identified individuals will get some kind of notice -- usually by U.S. mail , or email -- about the class lawsuit . At that point , class members are usually given a chance to " opt out " of the class action , if they want to file their own lawsuits and not be bound by any class settlement or judgment ( no " opt out " may be possible if the class action seeks something other than money ) . <h> Q : What types of cases are suitable for class actions ? <p> A : When it comes to deciding whether a certain dispute is suitable for resolution as a class action , many states mirror the " certification requirements " set out in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( FRCP ) : <p> Numerosity . There must be so many potential claimants that it would be " impracticable " to include all of them as named plaintiffs in one lawsuit . <p> Commonality . Across all potential claims there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In other words , the claims must all be based on the same problem or wrongdoing ( the same faulty vehicle brakes or the same discriminatory action , for example ) . <p> Typicality . The class representatives must have the same claims as other class members , and any arguments that the defendant might raise in response to those claims must be the same or similar . In the vehicle example , the named plaintiff 's claim ca n't be connected to a defective airbag while other class members have claims related to the braking system . <p> Adequacy . The class representatives must provide fair and adequate protection for the class . The lawyers representing the class will also be scrutinized , especially when it comes to the fee agreement . <p> A typical class action might involve a prescription drug with unreasonably harmful side affects . The medication could be taken by thousands of people , satisfying the numerosity factor . The side effects may have caused liver problems in these people . That 's a common factual claim . Whether the drug maker should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or at least provided adequate warning of the risks ) , is a common legal question . If the class representatives are in a similar boat , and are up to the task of representing the class , the typicality and adequacy factors are satisfied , and it 's likely that the case can proceed as a class action . <h> Q : How do I decide whether to remain in the class or opt out and file my own lawsuit ? <p> A : This decision usually rests on two factors : the extent of your losses and your willingness to litigate a claim yourself . If you 've been harmed only to a small extent , it will usually make sense to just let the class action proceed , see how it gets resolved , and receive the benefit of any settlement or judgment . For example , if your bank has illegally charged fees that add up to $35 , opting out of the class action wo n't make much financial sense . On the other hand , if you were seriously injured in a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , you 'll want to pursue your own claim against the vehicle manufacturer even if the braking system defect affects thousands of cars ( and therefore thousands of vehicle owners ) . <h> Q : How do I know if a settlement is unfair , or the representation improper ? <p> A : Cases in which courts find a problem with a class action settlement ( or with the class representation itself ) usually share one or more common traits . Here are some red flags to look for : <p> Coupon Settlements . Manufacturers and other defendants like to settle class actions by offering coupons to class members , in lieu of paying money damages . Meanwhile , class action attorneys get real money for their services ( not coupons ) . Coupon settlements are usually carefully examined by the courts , usually with one eye on the fairness of the corresponding attorney 's fee agreement . <p> Intangible Benefits . If class members have suffered clear financial losses because of the defendant 's product or conduct , settlements for something other than money will be closely scrutinized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , and then weighed against the propriety of the class action lawyers ' fees . <p> Broad Releases of Unrelated Conduct . If a class action claims the defendant engaged in a very specific illegal action , and the settlement agreement contains a release in which members give up their right to bring any future legal action related to every other conceivable action take by the defendant , this is likely to raise alarms . <p> Insufficient Investigation of the Case . Some class actions may settle very quickly , especially if the defendant is motivated to limit its liability . A quick and fair ( at first blush , at least ) first settlement offer might discourage the class attorneys from fully exploring every angle of the defendant 's liability and the resulting harm to the class . <p> " Clear Sailing " Agreements . If the settlement appears large on its face , and the defendant has agreed not to object to it ( called a " clear sailing " agreement ) , plaintiffs or some class members might inquire into the reasonableness of the corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief are possible in a class action ? <p> A : The same kinds of relief that are available to a plaintiff in an individual civil lawsuit are typically on the table in most class action lawsuits as well . Most class actions seek some kind of financial relief -- an award of money damages ( usually minimal ) to each class member , for example . These are known as " common fund " cases . In some class actions where the potential claims are too numerous or too large for the defendant to pay in full , a class action seeks to obtain the largest payment possible , to be split fairly among the class . These are called " limited fund " class actions . A class action may also ask the court to declare and define the rights and obligations of the class versus the defendant . This is called a " declaratory judgment " class action . Finally , and not infrequently , a class action seeks what 's called " injunctive " relief .

This percentage varies -- usually from 25 percent to 33 percent of the fund -- but it 's usually determined by the judge who approved the settlement agreement or entered the judgment . It 's increasingly rare that a class action lawyer 's fees are based on the amount of time spent on the case , and/or the quality of the result obtained .

An MSJ might also be based on lack of evidence , so that even if the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff , there is no proof that the duty was breached or that the breach caused the injury . <p> If an MSJ is granted , the case is closed with regard to the moving party . <p> If you 're the plaintiff in a case where the defendant has filed an MSJ , to successfully oppose the motion , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury could use to find in your favor . <h> Responding to a Motion for Summary Judgment <p> If you 're the plaintiff in a case where the defendant has filed an MSJ , to successfully oppose the motion , you will need to present the judge with evidence that a jury could use to find in your favor . This evidence could take the form of statements made in a deposition , police reports , medical records , witness affidavits , or other materials that you would use at trial . <p> If a defendant has brought the motion while there is still a significant amount of time before the trial date , you can also argue that there is still evidence yet to be gathered , so ruling on an MSJ would be premature .

Learn how to prepare for court . <p> If your divorce is headed for trial , the worst mistake you or your attorney can make is to go into the courtroom unpreparedyou may damage your case beyond repair . Judges are n't impressed by disorganized litigants that are n't ready for court . <p> Court rules vary from location to location , but for the most part , the following guidelines apply . <h> Prepare an Opening Statement and a Closing Argument <p> If you do n't  have an attorney , you 'll need to give the judge an opening statement and a closing argument . Write these ahead of time and become familiar with them , so that you are n't  handicapped by nerves . It 's best to memorize your statements , but you 'll also need to be prepared to change them on the fly , depending on what evidence comes in during the trial . <p> Remember that an opening statement is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you expect the evidence to show , and what you think the outcome of the case will be . Do n't  argue your case at this point , or the other side will object , and the judge will cut you off . Youll have an opportunity to argue in your closing argument , where you can go over the evidence , explain how the law and the facts favor you , and ask the court to rule in your favor . <h> Understand How to Testify <p> If you 're called to testify , you 'll be sworn in by the clerk of court ( or the judge , in some jurisdictions ) and asked to swear that you will tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth . <p> There are two kinds of testimony : direct examination and cross-examination . If you have an attorney , your lawyer will ask you questions on direct examination . If you do n't  have a lawyer , you will narrate your testimony and possibly answer some questions from the judgethere are no juries in divorce trials .

Your testimony must relate to the legal issues the judge has to decide . <p> You 'll understandably feel eager to tell your story , and youll likely feel anxious . Regardless of your nerves or your desire to tell the judge everything that 's happened , you are legally limited to testifying about relevant matters only . For example , if you live in a no-fault divorce state , such as California , where you do n't need to justify getting divorced , you wo n't be allowed to testify about your spouse 's cheating ways .

Listen to the question , take a moment , and respond only to what was asked . For example , if someone asks you if you 're wearing a red sweater ( and you are ) , then a simple " Yes " is all that 's called for , rather than , " Well , I 'm wearing a red turtleneck sweater with buttons on the cuffs , which I purchased at . . . . " Also , be sure to let the question sink in for a moment or two before answering so that you or your attorney have an opportunity to object if the question is inappropriate or legally impermissible . <h> Familiarize Yourself with the Exhibits <p> Both you and your spouse will have to submit documents and other items as evidence in the trial . Be sure you 're entirely familiar with all possible evidence , including the material your spouse will introduce . There should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you will have exchanged all the items you intend to enter as an exhibit for the judge to consider . Its also wise to bring extra copies of documents . At the very least , for each document , you should bring a copy for yourself or your attorney , a copy for the opposing side , and a copy for the judge . Also bring pens and tablets , so you can take notes during the trial . <h> Control Your Emotions <p> Divorce is one of the most profoundly painful and life-altering events you may experience . Regardless of how hurt or angry you are , do n't  approach your soon-to-be ex-spouse or your spouses lawyer and reveal how upset you feel . On cross-examination , simply respond to the question , but do n't  get angry with the person asking it . Untoward behavior will only make the judge view you as an angry and irrational person , which might have an impact on the courts decisions .

For instance , the self-defense doctrine does n't  allow someone to use a minor scuffle as an excuse to shoot the opponent . <p> In this article , we take a look at some of the nuances to self-defense law . To read up on the basicsincluding fundamental limitations on the right to defendsee our article on self-defense basics . <h> Self-Defense and " Aggressors " <p> Self-defense is designed to protect people who do n't  start trouble . It fundamentally does n't  apply " aggressors . " <h> Acts of Aggression <p> The most basic definition of " aggressor " would include someone who illegally attacks another . Some state definitions include under the " aggressor " umbrella a person who threatens to attack another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughn , grabs a baseball bat and waves it , and shouts threats to kill . To protect himself , Vaughn punches Doolittle in the gut and grabs the bat . As the aggressor , Doolittle is n't entitled to forcefully defend himself against Vaughns act of self-protection . <p> But the aggressor limitation to self-defense does n't  mean that you can never use force if you did anything to contribute to a fight . If one man insults the fit of anothers suit , and the insulted party retrieves a revolver and points it as if to shoot the insulter , the insulter is likely legally justified in using deadly force to prevent the shot . <h> Regaining the Right to Defend <p> Despite the general rule , aggressors can gain the right of self-defense in some circumstances . It comes down to who the aggressor was at the moment defensive force was used . <p> Deadly aggression . To earn the self-defense right , an aggressor who employs deadly force must generally " withdraw " from the conflict and in some way communicate the withdrawal to the other person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knife . Violet fights off Donald , so successfully that Donald runs away and hides . Violet pursues . Donald has to communicate to Violet that he s done with the confrontation in order to have the right to self-defense .

If Donald does n't  communicate his withdrawal to Violet and he kills Violet in what might otherwise be self-defense , he s guilty of murder .

But can he be convicted of murder if he defends himself against the sword attack with a gunshot to Vinsons head ? <p> Some courts would say that Drummond acquired the right to self-defense once Vinson escalated with the sword attack . In one of these courts , Drummond would have a self-defense claim if the other components of self-defense were met ( he reasonably believed that the gunshot was necessary , and so on ) . <p> Other courts have said that , to claim self-defense , an initial aggressor like Drummond would have to first take any opportunity to safely retreat . In these courts , Drummond would have been entitled to use deadly force only after retreating , provided that a clearly safe retreat was available . If he retreated or there was n't an opportunity for safe retreat , he would be allowed to use deadly force in self-defense .

Critics contend , however , that " stand your ground " encourages violent encounters . States of this latter perspective require that innocent people who are aware that they can retreat in complete safety do so instead of responding with deadly force to threats of deadly force .

" Retreat " proponents argue that , where one person points a gun at the other , the retreat requirement is highly unlikely to kick in because it probably would n't be completely safe to retreatand even if it were , the victim might well not be aware of that fact . <h> The Castle Doctrine <p> While there 's quite a bit of disagreement over stand-your-ground laws , there 's much less when it comes to the " castle doctrine .

@@25934049 @5934049/ <p> 1 . How much money is at stake , and how important is the case to the creditor ? <p> First , try to make sure you understand what your clients main concerns are in the case . Often the creditor is most concerned about the payment rate being offered as it compares to the contract rate in the promissory note . Other times the creditor is most concerned about the value of the collateral . Sometimes the creditor is concerned about the interest rate . Regardless of the main concern , you have to take into account the amount at stake .

What type of bankruptcy is it ? <p> If it is a Chapter 7 bankruptcy , everything is usually pretty cut and dried unless an adversary proceeding or motion for relief has to be filed . If your client has an unsecured claim and it is a no asset case , there is nothing a creditors attorney can do but monitor the case for an asset notification or discharge .

More often than not , a creditor , by objecting , can persuade the debtor to pay the claim over a shorter period .

Is there a basis for a dismissal ? <p> If you get the file shortly after the bankruptcy has been filed , you should consider whether there are grounds to seek a dismissal pursuant to 1307 based upon bad faith . However , these cases are quite rare , and judged on a case-by-case basis . Good faith is to be determined by the totality of the circumstances . In re Barret 964 F2d 588 ( 6th Cir. 1992 ) . Examples of cases that may warrant a motion to dismiss are : making false statements and concealing assets , Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts , 127 S. Ct . 1105 , 166 L. Ed. 2d 1956 ( U.S. 2007 ) ; and failure to file overdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F3d 320 ( 1st Cir. 2002 ) . <p> If your creditor-client sent you the file because the creditor is not receiving payments , other common grounds for dismissal under 1307 are unreasonable delay that is prejudicial to creditors ( 1307(c) ( 1 ) ) and failure to abide by the terms of a confirmed plan ( 1307(c) ( 6 ) ) . The former usually applies when the debtor has failed to timely confirm their plan and the latter usually applies when the debtor has failed to make plan payments after confirmation . <p> 5 . What kind of claim does the creditor have ? <p> Generally , priority claims are paid first ; then secured claims and finally unsecured claims . If your client has an unsecured claim , there is not much to be done beyond filing a proof of claim . Often unsecured creditors receive 10% or less in a Chapter 13 . In Chapter 7 cases , creditors rarely receive a dime . Priority creditor claims are rare for the typical creditor-client . <p> Unless adequate protection is set up in the plan , secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you represent a creditor , it is important to move for adequate-protection payments : too often debtors are unable to get plans confirmed for months or the case is dismissed before confirmation . <p> 6 . Is your claim entitled to special treatment under the code ? <p> If your claim is secured by a purchase money security interest in a consumer vehicle purchased within 910 days of the bankruptcy filing , the claim has to be paid in full regardless of value ( 1325(a) ( 9 ) ) . This is true because 506 does not apply to those claims . However , if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt , you may want to object to the value nonetheless to make sure your attorneys fees are fully paid . <p> Another claim afforded special treatment under the code is a claim secured solely by residential real estate . Those debts can not be modified by the debtor ( 1322(b) ( 2 ) ) . <p> 7 . Creditor should get the file to the lawyer as soon as possible . <p> If you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file to your lawyer soon for several reasons . First , you may want to question the debtor at the meeting of creditors . The meeting of creditors is often the best opportunity to get something resolved expeditiously . If an objection is not filed in time , you may be stuck with what the debtor proposed . You typically have ten days from the creditors meeting to object to a plan . Also , adequate protection payments do not commence until a proof of claim is filed . Finally , you may not be able to pursue your claim at all if you miss a deadline . <p> If you represent creditors , the single most important step to take is immediately recording the deadlines for filing an objection , filing an adversary proceeding , and filing a proof of claim in your calendar system . You should go over your deadlines at least weekly . The quickest way to lose a client for good is to have to tell the creditor you cant pursue something because a deadline was missed . <p> 8 . Are there grounds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether ? <p> The most common example of grounds to except a debt from discharge involves fraud ( 523(a) ( 2 ) ) . Other common examples are : fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity ; embezzlement or larceny ( 523(a) ( 4 ) ) ; domestic support obligations ( 523(a) ( 5 ) ) ; and claims resulting from willful and malicious injury ( 523(a) ( 6 ) ) . <p> If you believe there is a decent chance that your case will be litigated , you should attend the meeting of creditors . First , you should look at the elements of what you must prove and decide what questions to ask . For example , if the debtor has more than three vehicles , you will want to determine the use for each vehicle . If the issue is adequate protection , you will want to nail down how many miles the vehicle is driven per day . <p> If it is a Chapter 7 case involving a reaffirmation , you will certainly want to present the reaffirmation agreement on or before that date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrequent contact between the debtor and his or her attorney following the meeting . You will want to question the debtor about the condition of the collateral and whether there is insurance coverage on the collateral . <p> 10 . Would a 2004 exam be useful ? <p> If you believe your case will be litigated , a 2004 exam is invaluable . Often the argument for your client will turn on the debtors testimony . Knowing the debtors testimony is crucial to advance the best arguments for your client . A 2004 exam is also useful in negotiating a higher payment rate . In an effort to avoid the exam , the debtors will on occasion offer better terms for your client . <p> Important Timeline Considerations <p> The most important deadlines for the creditor to calendar are the meeting of creditors , the deadline to object to the debtors plan , the deadline to file a proof of claim , and the deadline to file an adversary proceeding . <p> The meeting of creditors date is important for several reasons . It is an opportunity to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the collateral is insured . It is an opportunity to present a reaffirmation agreement in a Chapter 7 proceeding . Also , it is a good time to attempt to resolve an objection to plan , if you have filed one . <p> Perhaps the most important deadline to calendar is the date to object to the debtors plan . If no objection is filed to the debtors plan and the plan is confirmed , the confirmation of the plan is resjudicata as to treatment of the creditors claim . If another creditor or the trustee has objected to the debtors plan , there still is an opportunity to object if the plan has not been confirmed , although the initial deadline to object has passed . <p> The deadline to file an adversary proceeding will preclude you from filing a complaint to object to discharge or except a debt from discharge if the deadline expires without an extension being granted . Generally , the courts will grant a request for extension of time if the motion is filed before expiration of the deadline . <p> Determining the Priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of claims are given priority over others . All claims can generally be divided into three categories : 1 ) Priority claims under 507 , 2 ) secured claims , and 3 ) general unsecured claims . Priority claims are those that must be paid first according to 507 . Secured claims are paid from the sale of collateral , and the remaining balance , if any , will be an unsecured claim . Finally , general unsecured claims are typically last in priority as they are not tied to any sale of collateral and are subject to whatever priority claims may be in place . <p> The priorities of bankruptcy claims are listed under 507 . The first level of priority claims involves those domestic support obligations owed by the debtor , as well as the trustees administrative expenses . The second level of priority involves other administrative expenses chargeable to the bankruptcy estate . The third level is those unsecured claims arising from the ordinary course of the debtors business that after the case has commenced , but before a trustee is appointed . Fourth are unsecured claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the filing or the cessation of business , whichever is first in time , for wages , salaries , commissions , etc . Fifth are claims for contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered within 180 days before the date of filing or the cessation of business . Sixth , are claims by grain producers or fishermen against a debtor who operates a storage or processing facility of the same . Seventh , are claims up to $2,600.00 , for deposits related to the lease or purchase of property that were not subsequently leased or purchased . The eighth level of priority is unsecured governmental claims for various taxes . Ninth are claims for any commitment by the debtor to a federal depository institution regulator to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution . The tenth and final priority claim are claims for death or personal injury resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol . <p> After all the priority claims are paid , the next set of payments will come from the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debtor that acts as security for any loan by a creditor will be sold , and the creditor will receive the value received from the sale . If the sale fails to yield the amount of value that is actually owed the secured creditor , the remaining balance will be converted to an unsecured claim and will be subject to priority of such a claim . <p> General unsecured claims are the final category of claims against a bankruptcy estate . These involve all those debts owed by a debtor that fail to fit into a priority claim definition or those debts that are not secured by any collateral . These debts will be last in priority and will only be paid once the first two categories of claims are satisfied .

The answers depend on your employers grooming and dress code policies , whether your employer enforces those policies consistently , and whether your tattoos have religious significance . <h> Employer Dress Code &amp; Grooming Policies <p> Employers are free to adopt dress codes and grooming requirements that reflect their company culture or promote a particular brand or look . For example , a law firm might require employees to dress in formal business attire , a restaurant might require servers to wear black pants and white button-down shirts , and a retailer might require employees to wear uniforms bearing the company logo .

And , many state laws protect additional characteristics , such as marital status , sexual orientation , and more . <p> An appearance or grooming policy can be illegal if it is applied in a discriminatory manner .

In most states , once alimony has been terminated it can never be reinstated . Some court orders now include alimony termination provisions that call for the end of alimony payments when the supported spouse begins cohabitation ( living ) with a new romantic partner . While the exact definition of " cohabitation " varies from state to state , it generally means people living together and sharing living expenses . Other states require a conjugal relationship , similar to marriage . <p> Although the recipient spouse 's cohabitation generally puts an end to spousal support , some courts have ruled that alimony may be reinstated when the supported spouse 's cohabitation ends and that spouse becomes " single " again .

You may ask the court to reclassify the payments so that they 're tax deductible for you and taxable income to your spouse , but you will need your ex-spouse to agree to the change , or there must be a provision in your settlement agreement ( or a state law ) that allows the court to modify the agreement . <p> A : There is a definite possibility she can still collect .

In many states , courts wo n't let you use laches as defense to back-alimony simply because you knew you were legally obligated to make the payments , and you knew you were n't paying them . <h> Q : Does my ex-husband have to continue to pay alimony if I 'm now living with a new romantic partner ? <p> A : It depends on the alimony laws in your state and the exact wording of your divorce settlement agreement or decree . <p> Your state 's laws and/or your alimony order may call for the automatic termination of alimony once you began cohabiting .

Can I ask the court to increase my alimony ? <p> A : This depends entirely on the laws in your state and your specific spousal support order . <p> Alimony is usually awarded based on events that happened during the marriage and the spouse 's incomes , expenses , and earning capacities at the time of the divorce . For example , where one spouse stayed home to raise the couple 's children and sacrificed career prospects , there may be a good argument for long-term alimony payments and even future increases . In many states , judges may consider one spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the other spouse 's career , professional success , and long-term earning capacity . In states that follow this theory , courts may have the power to change or modify the alimony order and increase support payments if the higher-earning spouse receives a significant raise . <p> It 's also possible your spousal support order " looks to the future " and includes language that allows for an increase if your ex 's income goes up ( as it was expected to do ) at some point after the divorce . <p> You should consult a local attorney to figure this out . More importantly , if you 're currently divorcing , ask your attorney about any proposed alimony agreement or order and potential for a future increase . <p> A : When it comes to temporary alimony , courts in some states look at both the payor 's ability to pay as well as the payee 's financial need . A court is n't supposed to penalize or reward a spouse when setting a temporary amount for spousal support . <p> That does n't mean the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ca n't afford the order , it may be that you simply have too many bills , and you need to change your spending habits or life style . <p> It 's also possible that the order is simply too large .

You should probably talk to an attorney about possibly appealing the alimony order or asking the court to modify it . <p> A : Judges usually consider many factors in making alimony decisions . The payor spouse 's assets are normally one of the factors , so the judge probably will consider your wife 's savings accounts and other assets . And , if the savings account contains marital property ( income or savings that were acquired by either or both of you during the marriage ) it 's likely you 'll receive a portion of the savings when the court divides your assets .

While moderate drinking wont affect a custody decision , courts will strongly consider any substance abuse issue that impacts parenting ability .

In cases where the addicted parent has caused serious injury to a child due to substance abuse , a judge may terminate that parents custodial rights altogether . <h> How Substance Abuse Affects the Division of Assets <p> In many states , courts wont consider fault when dividing a marital estate ( everything a couple owns together ) , but in some states , a spouses behavior during the marriage is relevant to the division of property .

In most states , a judge could decide to award additional alimony to the spouse of an addict if the addict drained the couples finances fueling the addiction . <p> In some relatively uncommon cases , a sober spouse could be required to pay alimony to an addicted spouse .

In an acquisition , one business acquires another . In a merger or consolidation , two businesses join together into one . <p> A business might decide to buy or join with another business for many reasons . Sometimes , businesses combine to control market share and eliminate the competition . Sometimes , one business acquires another to save money . For example , rather than breaking into a new market and figuring out how to sell something new , it might be cheaper for a company to buy a business with expertise in that area . <p> Ultimately , however , the driving force behind business combinations is making or saving money .

If you have a contract , however , you may have some protection . <h> Review Your Existing Employment Agreements <p> The first thing you should do ( even before a merger happens ) is to take a look at any employment contracts or agreements you have with your employer . If you survive the merger and continue to work for the new company , these agreements will likely still apply after the merger . Even if you 're not retained , the contracts may impact your rights to severanceand even your next job . <p> Here are some things to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbook , any other written policies , and your employment agreement ( if you have one ) .

Does your employment agreement , handbook , or other policies address severance pay ? For example , your employment contract may provide that you are entitled to a certain amount of severance pay if your employment ends during the contract term , or if you lose your job in a merger or acquisition . Or , your employee handbook may provide that all employees are entitled to one week of severance pay for every year they have served with the employer . <p> Noncompete agreements .

It all depends on how badly the new company wants to keep you . In this situation , you 'll be well served by consulting with a lawyer to figure out your options and help you negotiate the best arrangement . <h> Notice Requirements <p> If you lose your job as part of a mass layoff or plant closing , you may be entitled to notice at least 60 days in advance .

For example , your current employer might want to change your existing employment agreement to give the new employer more leeway . Your employer might also want you to sign an agreement to stay withor to leavethe company . <p> Retention agreement . If your employer wants you to stay with the company , it might ask you to sign a retention agreement . Often , the company has identified certain key employees whose continued employment through the merger will make the process run more smoothly .

Some employers that have sold their companies or agreed to merge with a company that they know will lay off employees offer severance agreements to reward employees who will lose their jobs for their years of service . <p> If your employer , current or new , asks you to sign an agreement , you should consider running it by an attorney . Especially if the agreement gives up rights ( such as the right to compete or to sue your employer ) , you will want to make sure you are getting your moneys worth .

@@25934064 @5934064/ <h> The Process of Buying or Selling a Small Business <p> Understand the process for negotiating and buying or selling an incorporated small business . <p> Generally , the purchase or sale of an incorporated small business will be in the form of either : <p> an asset purchase , where the buyer purchases some or all of the seller 's assets . This transaction is often favored by buyers because you get the assets , like equipment and inventory , without taking on the seller 's debts and liabilities . <p> a stock purchase , where the buyer purchases all or most of the seller 's stock and " steps into the shoes " of the seller . Sellers often like this transaction because the buyer assumes all of the seller 's debts and liabilities . <p> Regardless of how the transaction is structured , the deal usually flows like this : <p> preliminary negotiations <p> drafting a formal agreement and pre-closing review <p> closing . <p> As early as possible in the process , it 's a good idea to consult a lawyer and a financial adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're after .

This usually involves an extensive review of the seller 's finances and assets so the buyer can make its own determination regarding value . How much due diligence the buyer does will depend in part on whether it 's a stock or an asset sale . More due diligence is required in a stock purchase since in addition to assets , the buyer is also taking on the seller 's debts and liabilities . <p> The parties should discuss and determine other matters at this time , including : <p> if shareholder or board of directors ' approval is required <p> whether any government or other third-party documents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title documents ) <p> if any contracts require third-party approval before the buyer can take them over ( like leases or loan agreements ) . <p> Other issues may come up at this stage like whether any key employees of the seller will be retained by the buyer and , if so , how that will be handled . <p> Parties often enter into a letter of intent during this time to show that they are serious about the deal . It helps make sure that you do n't waste time and money performing due diligence and negotiating a formal agreement . These letters are nonbinding in the sense that you usually ca n't force one party to buy or sell based upon a letter of intent . Nevertheless , you can make parts of the letter enforceable and it 's usually a good idea to do so .

Times have changed though , and today , fathers have several ways to assert paternity . <p> Paternity is essentially a legal determination of a childs biological father .

If you were unmarried at the childs birth , but have established paternity , you can seek custody rights to your child . Legal custody gives a parent authority to make decisions about things that affect the child 's welfare , including education , medical care , and religious upbringing . Physical custody refers to the childs living arrangements . Mothers do n't  have any extra entitlement to custody of their children : As a dad , you 're on equal legal footing . <p> You and the childs mother can work out your own parenting agreement , and submit it to the court for approval .

Either way , a judge will turn the parenting schedule into a custody and visitation order , which you and the childs other parent must follow . For example , the childs mother ca n't prevent your visits or give you less time than required under the order . Your obligation as a father is to follow the terms of any custody order , and take advantage of whatever visitation or custody you 're entitled to .

Your specific child support amount will depend on several factors like each parents income and ability to pay , the custody schedule , and the childs financial needs . Similar to a custody order , parents must obey a child support order--even if the custodial parent is interfering with visitation . You ca n't simply stop paying support to deal with custody issues : If you fail to pay child support , a judge can fine you and even send you to jail .

For many spouses , this is one of the most intimidating parts of the divorce process , but having a sense of what to expect can reduce some of the stress . <h> The Basics of Your Deposition <p> Your spouses attorney will want to take your deposition in order to gather evidence related to your divorce case . Both your attorney and your spouses attorney will attend , along with a court reporter , who will record everything that 's said using a stenograph machine .

If the attorney plans to videotape you , he or she will need to include that information in the notice . <p> Normally , your spouses attorney will coordinate with your attorney before sending the notice in order to schedule a date that works for everyone .

Your deposition is an opportunity for your spouses attorney to gather evidence against you . Resist the urge to argue your entire case at your deposition ; answer only the questions that are asked . While the attorneys may use portions of your deposition at trial , the judge likely wont ever see the entire deposition transcript .

Also , you do n't  want to blurt out anything that could hurt your case . Taking your time can allow you to give thoughtful answers , rather than a rushed response you might regret later . <p> If you do n't  know the answer to a question , do n't  try to guess . Its fine to say that you do n't  remember , or that you ca n't recall . Your spouses attorney may ask you questions about events over your entire relationship with your spouse , and you do n't  want to make a statement under oath that can be proven wrong later .

Some attorneys may attempt to get under your skin so that you lash out during the deposition or say something harmful to your case out of anger .

Your attorney is there to protect you if the other attorney becomes abusive . <p> If you have questions during your deposition , you should ask for a break to consult with your attorney . <h> After the Deposition <p> After the court reporter completes the transcript of your deposition , you 'll have an opportunity to review it for accuracy . You 'll need to read it over and correct any errors within a certain time period , usually around 30 days .

Other times , the worker decides that taking a disputed case to trial is too risky and accepts a lump sum instead . ( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <p> Accepting a settlement offer in your New York workers compensation case is a big decision .

In New York , like in all other states , settlements are voluntary . No one can force you , or the insurance company , to settle ; both parties must agree to the terms of the settlement . <p> However , as a practical matter , most workers wait to settle until their medical conditions are stable and not expected to improve any further . This is called maximum medical improvement ( MMI ) . It is risky to settle before MMI because it might not be clear whether you will need additional medical treatment or whether your condition will be permanent . Without knowing the full extent of your injuries , it can be very difficult to accurately value your claim . <h> Types of Workers Compensation Settlements <p> You can settle your New York workers comp claim through either through a stipulation or a Section 32 settlement .

Most Section 32 settlements require you to release all claims against your employer arising out of your work injuryincluding the right to any additional medical treatment , wage loss benefits , and vocational rehabilitation services . <p> Occasionally , a Section 32 settlement will be more limited . For example , a limited settlement might end your wage loss and vocational rehabilitation claims , but allow you to continue receiving medical benefits in the future . However , these limited settlements are rare . Most insurance companies are not willing to leave claims partially open ; they would much rather close a workers compensation claim and end their obligation to pay benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , some Section 32 settlements are paid over time ( called structured settlements ) . <p> Typically , structured settlements are used in catastrophic claims or when a worker needs long-term care . They give a worker steady income through scheduled payments ( weekly , monthly or annually ) . Many structured settlements also include an up-front payment to help with medical bills and other expenses .

Due to the complexity of New York workers compensation law , most workers hire lawyers to help them evaluate settlement offers and negotiate with the insurance company . <p> When evaluating a settlement offer , you should consider several factors , including : <p> how much you might be owed in permanent disability benefits <p> the potential cost of your future medical bills <p> any temporary disability payments that the insurance company failed to pay <p> any unpaid medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company owes you for failing to pay your benefits on time . <p> You should also consider the weaknesses in your claim if it is being disputed . When you take a case to trial , there is always a chance that you will lose . If there is a major dispute about whether you 're entitled to benefits , and it is unlikely that you will win your case at trial , you may want to compromise and accept a lower lump sum settlement instead . <h> Who Starts Settlement Negotiations ? <p> Because you are the one with the claim , you ( or your attorney ) will typically start the process by giving the insurance company a settlement demand . The insurance company will respond to your demand by accepting it , rejecting it , or making a new offer in response .

If your case is being settled by a stipulation , you will present the Board with either a written agreement ( Form C-300.5 ) or testify to the stipulations terms before a judge . <p> If you have agreed to a Section 32 settlement , the process is more involved . First , you will submit a written settlement agreement and a Form C-32 to the Board . These documents and forms set out the terms of your settlement and how your settlement money will be distributed . Attorneys fees , unpaid medical bills , and unpaid child support payments may be subtracted from your settlement , for example . Additionally , if you are a Medicaid or Medicare recipient , you may have to set aside a portion of your settlement money to pay for future medical treatment related to your work injury . ( For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers Compensation Award or Settlement ? ) <p> The Board will then do a preliminary review of your settlement . If the terms of the settlement seem acceptable , a hearing will be scheduled . At the settlement hearing , the judge must decide whether you understand the terms of your settlement and whether it is fair and reasonable . <p> After the settlement hearing , there is a ten-day waiting period . Once the waiting period ends , the workers compensation judge will issue a written approval letter .

@@25934073 @5934073/ <h> How Does Discovery Work in a Lawsuit ? <p> No matter what kind of civil case you 're involved in , once a lawsuit is filed , the court will typically issue a scheduling order that includes a date by which all discovery must be completed . " Discovery " is a legal term of art that consists of several tools that are used to uncover facts relevant to the various claims and defenses at issue in the case . The parties in a lawsuit engage in discovery so that they can be properly prepared for trial , and avoid surprises that can adversely affect the outcome of the case . Let 's look at the different kinds of discovery , and how discovery-related disputes might be resolved . <h> Written Discovery <p> The parties are permitted to discover relevant facts through three main types of written discovery : Interrogatories , Requests for Production of Documents , and Requests for Admissions . Interrogatories are written questions that must be answered in writing and under oath .

A deposition is taken before a court reporter , and the person being deposed must give sworn testimony that may be used at trial . A deposition proceeds in a question-and-answer format similar to what occurs with witnesses at trial ; there is , however , no judge present at a deposition to rule on evidentiary objections . The court rules governing depositions require that certain objections be made at the time of the deposition so that they are preserved in case a court ruling becomes necessary later on .

For example , in a personal injury case , the defendant 's insurance company may require the injured person to attend an " independent medical examination , " or IME . The examining physician is typically asked to prepare a detailed written report setting out his/her findings , test results , diagnosis and conclusions . Get the details on the IME in the context of a personal injury case : <h> Discovery Disputes <p> It is common for disputes to arise between the parties over particular discovery requests . Sometimes a party will argue that a certain question is irrelevant , vague or overbroad ; other questions can be said to invade one 's privacy or a privileged relationship ( e.g. , attorney-client , physician-patient ) ; and still other questions might arguable be asked for improper purposes such as harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery dispute themselves , the court may be asked to intervene and resolve it for them via a motion to compel discovery . Courts do not typically favor these motions -- judges will strongly suggest that the parties resolve the matter on their own -- and will often assess costs and attorney 's fees against the party who does not prevail in the dispute . <h> Forming a Discovery Strategy <p> At the outset of a lawsuit , an experienced attorney will formulate a discovery strategy that is geared toward learning as much as possible about who the opposing party 's trial witnesses will be , what their testimony will consist of , and what documents they will offer to support their claims . <p> Depending on the number of witnesses involved and where they are located , the discovery process can be quite costly and time-consuming .

If you are married and live in a community property state , half of the money that you earn during marriage belongs to your spouse . This means that half of the money you add to your retirement account during your marriage actually belongs to your spouse . So if you do n't  name your spouse as a beneficiary , your spouse could claim part of the account after you die . Among other issues , this legal complication could cause your retirement account to end up in the probate court . To avoid this , name your spouse as beneficiary or have your spouse sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Further , in all states , 401(k) plans require you to name your spouse as beneficiary ( or get a waiver ) .

When you name a beneficiary for your account , you can usually name alternates who would take the property if the first beneficiary is not available to receive them . Naming alternates is almost always a good idea . If you do n't  , and your first beneficiary is not available to receive the funds when you die , the funds in the account will be paid to your estate and distributed through probate . <p> Name a person , not your estate or trust . Do n't  be tempted to name your estate as the beneficiary .

If you want to name a trust for the purpose of controlling the funds over time ( perhaps for a beneficiary who might blow it all at once ) , see a lawyer for help . <p> Make arrangements for minor beneficiaries . Minors can not receive funds from your retirement account outright . Someone will need to manage the account for your young beneficiaries until they become adults .

If you leave your retirement accounts to minor beneficiaries without setting up property management , the court may have to step in to do it for you . <p> Keep your beneficiary designations up-to-date . You can change your named beneficiaries anytime . So as your wishes or circumstances change , contact your account administrator to update beneficiary information . This could be especially important as beneficiaries die or if you get married , have children , or get divorced .

Probate inventories and distributes that persons property after settling any creditor claims . Probate can take months or years to complete , and between court fees , lawyers fees , and executors fees , it can cost the estate a lot of moneyleaving less for beneficiaries . While probate can be useful for some estates , especially those with complicated holdings or a lot of debt , for most simple estates , probate is often a waste of time and money .

@@25934079 @5934079/ <h> Bank Account Seizures <p> If you do n't  pay your debts , the money in your bank account could be at risk . To take your bank funds , most creditors have to first file a lawsuit against you and get a judgment from the court . Once the creditor has a money judgment , it can use a special collection procedure called " levying " ( seizing ) your bank account to get paid . Fortunately , certain benefits like Social Security are off limits from this processat least to some extent . <p> Some creditors , such as the IRS , can seize money from a bank account without first getting permission from a court . <h> Seizure Process <p> Most creditors need to go to court and get a judgment against you before they can levy your bank account . Some creditors though , such as the IRS , can seize money from a bank account without first getting permission from a court . Before doing this , the IRS will send you a " Notice and Demand for Payment " ( a tax bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , call the number provided on the notice to discuss the situation with the IRS . If you cant resolve the matter , the IRS will send a " Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to A Hearing " at least 30 days before seizing your account . After you receive the second notice , you can request a hearing with the IRS if you think the levy is inappropriate . <h> How a Creditor Gets a Judgment <p> If a creditor sues you and you do n't  respond to the lawsuit , the creditor will win " by default . " Normally , the judge will award the creditor a judgment ( a court order that you pay money to the creditor ) that reflects what it asked for in the complaint ( the court document that started the lawsuit ) .

And if the parties settle , the judgment will reflect the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the victorious creditor will end up with a judgment that states the total amount of money you owe to the creditor .

You wont be able to withdraw that money or use the funds to cover checks you 've written . <p> Next , you 'll get a notice that the creditor has levied your bank account . The " Notice of Levy " will likely state that " certain property , owned by you , or owed to you , is being held or taken to pay the claim of the creditor .

You should then determine which funds , if any , are exempt from seizure ( see " Exempt Funds , " below ) . <p> The bank will eventually send any non-exempt funds to the creditor to pay off the debt . <p> Under the Treasury rule , the bank must protect two months worth of federal benefits from seizure . Theoretically , this protection is automatic when the government sends you benefits through direct deposit , because the bank will have a record of all such deposits . In theory , it shouldnt matter whether the funds are in their own , separate account , or co-mingled with other monies . For example , suppose you receive $500 in Social Security each month through direct deposit into an account that holds $7,000 . If you owe $10,000 , the creditor can seize $6,000 from this account ( the creditor will have to look elsewhere to make up the rest ) . <p> Even with direct deposit , however , there 's a catch .

When you know that a creditor has a judgment against you , its a good idea to plan ahead and keep exempt funds in a separate account . <p> If you receive your benefits by paper check , or if you transfer the funds into another account after an initial direct deposit , the bank wont automatically protect your money . Youll have to go to court to prove that the funds are protected federal benefits that the creditor cant take . <h> Getting Help <p> If you already have a judgment against you and you want to avoid a bank account seizure , consider contacting an attorney .

He spent the next seven hours standing in front of the Target Center , where the rally was held . When questioned by police , he showed them his license to carry and conceal a weapon under state law . He was then questioned by Minneapolis police and a Secret Service agent . This incident shows the conflict between a constitutional right and the need for security . <h> Why Did Josh Hendrickson Bring the Guns ? <p> Hendrickson explained that he brought guns to the rally not to cause trouble , but to make a constitutional point and exercise his rights under the Second Amendment to the US Constitution . He justified his action by stating that when he typically leaves the house , " I grab my wallet , my keys and my gun . . . The Second Amendment is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 <h> Is This an Isolated Incident ? <p> As President Obama has been holding rallies across the country in recent weeks , there have been several similar reports of people showing up at these rallies carrying concealed guns . While Hendrickson stated he was not motivated by those events , he said he sympathized with those attempting to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms . <h> Is It Legal to Cary a Concealed Gun ? <p> The Second Amendment of the US Constitution grants US citizens the right to keep and bear arms , meaning that owning and wearing a gun is a **26;154;TOOLONG right . However , the government can regulate and set limits on this right . <h> Concealed Weapons <p> There are laws for acquiring and carrying guns . But there are separate rules and measures for concealing them . In the US , citizens can carry a handgun and other weapons in a concealed manner in public . Laws regulating concealed weapons vary state by state in terms of residency and age requirements and special application procedures and training . <p> There are states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed weapons at all . However , Wisconsin , Illinois and Washington D.C. prohibit concealed weapons completely . Some states have reciprocal recognition agreements of the concealed-carry privileges and rights , meaning that they honor the other state 's concealed-carry permits . A few states do n't recognize any licenses from other states . <p> In Minnesota , where this rally occurred , the law allows a person to carry concealed weapons in public . Minneapolis Police Sgt. Jesse Garcia explained that even though what Hendrickson did was not actually illegal , " it was probably one of those days he could have left his gun at home . He still retained his Second Amendment rights , but he 's going to be questioned .

Therefore some states have specified in the law itself places where carrying a concealed weapon is not permitted . Also , businesses can post specific signs ( the language and format vary by state ) that prohibit carrying a concealed gun .

States can have specific laws not allowing weapons in certain regions ( ex. school zones ) and places that the law does n't specify ( ex. rallies ) can attempt to post signs . In the meantime , while the Second Amendment is n't suspended when the President is in town , it still may be best to leave your gun at home . 
@@25934082 @5934082/ <h> Your Work-Related Appearance : What Are Your Rights ? 34380 @qwx234380 <p> Your employer can create a restrictive dress code , as long as it does n't discriminate based on a protected class . <p> Does your employer have the right to tell you what you can or ca n't wear to work ? The answer depends on whether your companys dress code violates state or federal laws prohibiting discrimination . <h> Dress Codes and Company Culture <p> Generally speaking , employers have the legal right to establish dress and grooming codes for employees . Some companies require formal business attire , some companies allow employees to dress down on " casual Fridays , " and others adopt a more relaxed dress code throughout the week . Some employers , particularly in the retail sector , require employees to wear uniforms bearing the company logo or to dress in particular types and colors of clothing associated with the store . For example , many restaurants require wait staff to wear black slacks and a white , button-down shirt . All of these optionsand many moreare perfectly legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Codes and Discrimination Laws <p> A dress code might be discriminatory if it treats employees differently based on a protected trait ( such as sex or disability ) or if it has a disproportionate effect on members of a protected class . And , even if a dress code does n't  discriminate against certain employees , an employer might be required to make exceptions to a dress code in order to accommodate an employees disability or religious beliefs . <h> Race and National Origin Discrimination <p> Employees have challenged dress codes that prohibit styles or outfits associated with a particular ethnicity . For example , an employer that prohibits employees from wearing traditional African Kente cloth but allows other brightly colored fabrics could be accused of intentionally discriminating based on ethnicity . <p> An employers policy might still be discriminatory , even if the employer did n't  intend to discriminate . In a " disparate impact " case , a seemingly neutral policy is discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on employees in a particular class . For example , a policy that requires male employees to be clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees , who are more likely to have a skin sensitivity to shaving . In this situation , the employer must be able to show that its requirement is related to the job and consistent with business necessity . If , for example , the employers policy is based simply on the owners preference for clean-shaven employees , that 's not a good enough reason to justify a policy that has a discriminatory effect . <h> Sex Discrimination <p> In our culture , it is generally acceptable for employers to impose different dress codes on male and female employees . For example , an employer might prohibit men from wearing jewelry and make-up while allowing women to do so , or it might require men to wear slacks and women to wear skirts . These types of rules are allowed as long as they do n't  place a heavier burden on one genderby , for example , requiring women to wear formal attire while men can wear casual clothing . ( However , state law may impose additional requirements ; in California , for example , an employer may not prohibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need an exemption to your employers dress code policy because of your religion or your disability , ask for a reasonable accommodation . <h> Religious Discrimination <p> If an employees religious beliefs require particular attire , a company might have to make an exception to its usual dress code . In a recent Supreme Court case , for example , clothing company Abercrombie &amp; Fitch decided not to hire a Muslim applicant who wore a head scarf for religious reasons because the companys " look policy " prohibited caps of any kind . The Supreme Court found that this blanket policy was illegal , because the employers decision was based on its desire to avoid having to change its policy to accommodate the applicant . If complying with a dress code would violate an employees religious beliefs , the employer must make a reasonable accommodationby for example , allowing the employee to wear a head scarf or other religious garbunless doing so would create an undue burden on the employer . ( See Religious Discrimination in Employment for more information . ) <h> Disability Discrimination <p> Employers must also create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employees disability . If an employee must wear special orthopedic shoes due to a disability , for example , the employer must typically allow this modification . An employer is n't required to accommodate an employee if it would create undue hardship , but allowing an employee to deviate from the usual dress code usually wo n't meet that standard . <h> If You Need an Accommodation <p> If you need an exemption to your employers dress code policy because of your religion or your disability , ask for a reasonable accommodation . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act give you the right to a reasonable accommodation for your religious beliefs or your disability , respectively , unless it creates an undue burden for your employer . <p> In general , you must tell your employer that you need an accommodation because of your disability or your religious beliefs .

Your employer has the right to request more information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process . <p> Some accommodations are straightforward . If , for example , your religious beliefs require you to grow a beard , your employer might simply grant you an exception to its " no facial hair " policy .

For example , if your employers policy prohibits dangling jewelry based on safety concerns for employees working with machinery , you might be required to wear your rosary under your shirt for safety reasons . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Does an employer have to accommodate my sincerely held beliefs if they are not religious for example , may I refuse to wear animal products if I am a strict vegan for ethical reasons ? <p> Can my employer require me to pay for a company uniform ? <p> Can my employer ask for medical information about my disability when I request an accommodation ?

" Use " immunity does not extend to civil or other non-criminal proceedings . <p> Granting immunity to a witness does not mean that the government can not prosecute the witness for crimes related to those statements .

When conditions or conduct at a hospital rise to the level of medical malpractice , a patient has a legal right to compensation for any resulting harm , but it is n't always easy to figure out who is actually liable -- the facility itself , as an employer ? Or a doctor who practices there , as an independent contractor ? This article will highlight some of the issues that are unique to medical malpractice claims involving hospitals , and help you avoid some common pitfalls . <p> Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital itself is legally responsible . Generally speaking , hospitals , like other employers , are vicariously liable for the negligence of their employees , but not for the negligence of independent contractors . <p> Most doctors are independent contractors , not employees . So , if your injuries were caused by the medical negligence of a doctor who was acting as an independent contractor in the hospital setting , you must bring your medical malpractice claim directly against the doctor rather than against the facility . <p> Typically , nurses , medical technicians , and support staff are hospital employees . If a patient is injured while being treated by a hospital employee , the patient can usually sue the hospital for resulting damages . Most doctors , however , are independent contractors , not employees .

While these limitations periods vary from state to state , the window for bringing a medical malpractice lawsuit is typically between one and three years from the date of the negligent act . If you fail to file your lawsuit within that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you can prove that you 're entitled to more time under one of the rare exceptions that extend the filing deadline . <p> In an effort to prevent the filing of baseless medical malpractice lawsuits , a growing number of states now require patients to file what is known as a " certificate of merit " or " affidavit of merit " along with the initial paperwork that starts the lawsuit . <p> Preparing a certificate of merit entails retaining an expert medical witness to review the relevant medical records and assert under oath that the healthcare provider deviated from accepted medical practices , resulting in injuries . Your medical malpractice attorney will be familiar with this filing requirement and any other procedural hoops that medical malpractice plaintiffs need to jump through in your state . <p> Medical malpractice cases are often incredibly complex , making self-representation an unwise strategy for most plaintiffs . An experienced attorney will help you navigate the legal , medical , and procedural intricacies of your lawsuit and will retain the right expert medical witness to strengthen your case . <p> Most medical malpractice lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not pay the lawyer out-of-pocket .

Pursuing your claim will not only enable you to recover compensation for your losses , but it may also serve to improve the overall quality of health care for others . So if you have a valid medical negligence claim against a hospital , you may be in for a fight from the facilitys insurers and attorneys , but its important to see it through .

Legal custody refers to the right to make major decisions about the child 's health , welfare , and education . Legal custody is commonly shared jointly by both parents , unless the court finds that giving one parent sole legal custody would be in the child 's best interests . For example , if one parent consistently refuses to cooperate in the decision-making process and unreasonably rejects all proposals , a court will likely view this parent as a problem , and grant the other parent exclusive legal custody . Physical custody refers to who the child lives with . <p> Judges make child custody ordersboth temporary and permanentbased on what would be in the best interests of the child .

Depending on a number of factors , including where the divorce takes place , mandatory waiting periods , case complexity , and conflict levels , a divorce involving children may take anywhere from a few months to several years . During this time , either parent may ask a judge to issue a temporary child custody order . The temporary order sets forth how custody will work during the divorce , including who has the right to make decisions for the child , where the child will live , and when visitation will take place .

For example , it may be that at the time of the divorce , 50/50 shared physical custody was in the child 's best interests .

That means the level of care and skill that your doctor ( or whoever harmed you ) should have acted with , based on accepted medical practices in the same community .

It basically means that that the evidence shows it is more probable than not that the plaintiff has proved his or her case . Compare a civil lawsuit 's " preponderance of the evidence " standard with a criminal trial 's requirement that a defendant 's guilt must be established " beyond a reasonable doubt , " which is a much tougher burden of proof to meet . <h> Q : What is " contributory negligence " ? <p> A : " Contributory negligence " is a legal concept that applies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise reasonable care actually played a role in causing or contributing to his or her own injuries , or the extent of those injuries .

For example , if the defendant can point to a string of missed appointments , or the plaintiff 's failure to consult a specialist after being instructed to do so , this could amount to contributory negligence .

@@25934112 @5934112/ <h> What to Know Before Settling Your Workers ' Comp Case in Illinois <p> Workers compensation claims settle for many reasons . Sometimes , an injury has stabilized , and the worker no longer wants to deal with the insurance company . Other times , the worker decides that taking a disputed case to trial is too risky and accepts a lump sum instead . ( For more information , see our article about the risks and benefits of settlement . ) <p> Accepting a settlement offer in your Illinois workers compensation case is a big decision . Before signing a settlement agreement , you should consider what you will be getting and what you will be giving up . <h> When Should I Settle My Workers Compensation Claim ? <p> Unlike some states , you can settle your Illinois workers comp claim before you are fully healed from your injury . However , any settlement that takes place within seven days of your work injury is presumed to be fraudulent and will likely not be enforced . <p> As a practical matter , most workers wait to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve any further . This is called maximum medical improvement ( MMI ) . It is risky to settle before MMI because your condition may worsen or you may need further medical treatment that is n't accounted for in your settlement . <h> What Rights Am I Giving Up ? <p> Most workers compensation settlements require you to release all claims against your employer arising out of your work injury , including the right to any additional medical treatment , wage loss benefits , permanent disability benefits , and vocational rehabilitation services . The settlement will typically cover any and all injuries you have suffered while working for your employer , including injuries that are undiscovered at the time of settlement . However , it will not apply to any work injuries that you might suffer in the future . <p> Occasionally , though , a settlement will be more limited . For example , a limited settlement might settle your wage loss and permanent disability claims , but allow you to continue receiving medical benefits if you need treatment in the future . A limited settlement might also allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most insurance companies would rather close a workers compensation claim entirely and end their obligation to pay benefits . <p> Once you and the insurance company have agreed to a settlement , the Illinois Workers Compensation Commission must approve it . <h> How Much Should I Settle For ? <p> Because every workers compensation claim is different , there is no simple formula for valuing a claim . Due to the complexity of Illinois workers compensation law , most workers hire a lawyer to help them evaluate settlement offers and negotiate with the insurance company . <p> When evaluating a settlement offer , you should considerseveral factors , including : <p> how much you might be owed in permanent disability benefits <p> any temporary disability payments that the insurance company failed to pay while you were off work <p> the potential cost of your future medical bills <p> any unpaid medical bills to date , and <p> any penalties that the insurance company owes you for failing to pay your benefits on time . <p> You should also consider the weaknesses in your claim if it is being disputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a chance that you will lose . If there is a major dispute about your entitlement to benefits , and it is unlikely that you will win your case at trial , you may want to accept a lower settlement instead . Walking away with something is better than nothing . <h> Who Starts Settlement Negotiations ? <p> Because you are the one with the claim , you ( or your attorney ) will typically start the process by giving the insurance company a settlement demand . The insurance company will respond to your demand by accepting it , rejecting it , or making a new offer in response . This negotiation process can continue until you agree on a settlement amount . <h> Getting a Settlement Approved <p> Once you and the insurance company have agreed to a settlement , the Illinois Workers Compensation Commission must approve it . Settlements that have not been approved by the Commission will not be enforced . To get approval , you will need to complete a Settlement Contract form and mail it to the arbitrator assigned to your case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to attend a settlement hearing before the arbitrator ( a workers compensation judge ) . The arbitrator will review the documents and ask questions to make sure the terms of the settlement are fair and that you understand what you are giving up . <p> If you have a lawyer , you will not have a settlement approval hearing . Instead , the arbitrator will make his or her decision after reviewing the settlement documents . <p> The settlement contract sets out the terms of your agreement with the insurance company and how your money will be distributed . Attorneys fees , unpaid medical bills , and unpaid child support payments may be subtracted from your settlement , for example . Additionally , if you are a Medicaid or Medicare recipient , you may have to set aside a portion of your settlement money to pay for future medical treatment related to your work injury .

While you are not required to hire a lawyer to settle your claim , its usually in your best interest to do so . <p> As noted above , a settlement usually means that you 're agreeing to give up all rights to collect additional workers compensation benefits related to your injury . At the very least , you should have a workers comp lawyer review any settlement agreement that you 're thinking of signing , before you commit . 
@@25934113 @5934113/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> After the Audit <p> After an audit is completed , you will receive a notice of proposed assessment . It tells you the amount you owe , not including interest and penalties . There 's no standard requirement for when the notice must go out ; it just needs to go out far enough ahead for the Internal Revenue Service ( " IRS " ) to assess the tax owed before the statute of limitations runs out . <p> Apart from that , it really just depends on your auditor and the kind of work load that he or she has . Since the IRS is putting an emphasis on quick turnover of audit cases , most auditors should get the notice out pretty quickly once they have all the information they need . This typically takes about 30 to 45 days . <h> The Notice of Proposed Assessment <p> Although the auditor has a computer program that crunches the numbers and prepares the notice , usually manager approval is needed before sending it out . In some cases , there may be additional reviews performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is one that the auditor does not deal with a lot , he or she may need to talk to IRS counsel about how to handle it and what wording to use in the notice . <p> If you 're eager to resolve things and think you 'll be able to pay the amount due after the auditor tallies up the numbers , let him or her know . That will probably help speed up the process . <p> The notice of proposed assessment traditionally does not include the interest computation . This confuses some taxpayers as they think the amount on the notice is the total they must pay . If the notice does n't specifically include an interest computation , you can expect the actual amount due to be more because of interest . If the notice does n't include interest , you can ask the auditor to compute the interest to a certain date if you 're going to pay it . The interest compounds daily , so the amount changes every day . The auditor must figure this amount separately . The IRS is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't completely there yet due to the old technology that the IRS uses . <h> The Post-Audit Process <p> The following is a typical sequence of events following an audit : <p> A Notice of Proposed Assessment gives you 30 days to appeal the assessment to the IRS appeals office . <p> If you do n't appeal within the 30 days , or you appeal and lose , then you get a " Notice of Deficiency . " This notice gives you 90 days to file a protest with the United States Tax Court ( it 's an independent federal court , not part of the IRS ) . This is your last chance to protest the assessment before you have to pay the amount the IRS says you owe . <p> If you file a protest with the Tax Court and lose , you can appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit that covers your state . If you lose there , your next appeal is to the United States Supreme Court . <p> If you do n't go to court , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess the tax liability against you and send you a bill for the amount you owe . This bill traditionally is the first one that actually includes an interest computation . The notice will suspend interest for 10 or 21 days to give you a chance to pay it . The IRS can file a notice of federal tax lien after that period expires . <p> If you do n't pay the tax owed after the 10 or 21 days expires , then the IRS will send you between one to four additional notices , each about one month apart . Each letter is more strongly worded than the last . The last notice comes by certified mail and gives you 30 days to pay what you owe or the IRS will start levying assets and income to collect . You have the opportunity to appeal the collection determination if you have not yet made arrangements to pay . <p> Once you pay the liability , if you did n't go to court earlier and you want to dispute the liability , you have two years from the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies your refund claim , you can file a refund suit in either United States District Court ( which entitles you to a jury ) or the United States Court of Federal Claims ( this is a special court that hears only monetary disputes against the government ) . If you went to Tax Court earlier , then you have had your chance for court review and can not file a refund claim . <p> Throughout this entire process , interest continues to accrue on the liability until you pay off the tax . Once the assessment is made , a late payment penalty will be added to the liability if you do n't pay within the 10 or 21 day period following the first billing notice . As you can see , dragging out the process before being forced to pay can get expensive . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> I received a notice of proposed assessment , should I appeal ? <p> If I appeal and win , can I recover my attorney 's fees ? <p> If I am entitled to a refund , can I recover interest for the time that the IRS had my money ?

While sales and foreclosures are major events for owners of rental property , a sale or foreclosure can have just as big an impact on someone who does n't own the property , such as a tenant or " renter . " <p> What happens to the renter when the residential property where he or she lives is either sold or foreclosed upon ? In most cases , the lease continues if there 's a " normal " sale , and it ends after a foreclosure .

This means the new owner can try to collect whatever you owe or could begin eviction proceedings , just as the old landlord could have . <h> How Long the Tenant Gets to Stay in the Property Following a Sale <p> Whether you , as a renter , get to stay in the property following the sale ( and for how long ) will ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fixed-term lease .

Some leases specifically say that a sale of the property automatically ends the lease . If your lease contains this provision and your landlord sells the property , your lease terminates .

( For example , Colorado law requires only seven days ' notice to terminate a month-to-month lease . ) <h> Whether and When You Will Receive Notice About the Property Sale <p> State law typically requires the current landlord ( or the new landlord ) to give tenants information about the sale and/or to provide the new landlord 's name and address . This way , you 'll know where to send rent payments and who to contact about maintenance or repair issues . <p> For example , in Massachusetts , the old landlord must send the last months rent and security deposit to the new landlord .

The notice must also contain the new landlords name , business address , business telephone number , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one ) . <h> What Happens to Tenants in a Property Foreclosure <p> Foreclosure is the legal process by which a lender gets the right to sell a property because the property owner defaulted on the mortgage . The sale proceeds are used to satisfy the mortgage debt . <p> If your landlord fails to make its loan payments , or defaults on a mortgage in some other way ( such as not paying the property taxes or insurance premiums ) , the bank or mortgage company will likely start a foreclosure on the rental property . <p> You wont have to move out while the foreclosure process is going on .

( Residential leases sometimes have a clause that requires the tenant to sign a subordination agreement if the lender later takes out a new mortgage or refinances . ) <p> What happens if you signed the lease after the landlord got the mortgage . If you signed your lease after the mortgage was taken out , the foreclosure terminates the lease . In most cases , the new owner can then have you evicted .

A permanent version of the law was introduced to Congress in 2015 , but it is unlikely that it will pass . <h> Other Laws That Protect Renters <p> Fortunately for some renters , certain states have laws that are similar to the expired federal law , which give tenants protection from eviction after a foreclosure .

For example , employees engaged in fishing and agricultural work , taxi drivers , employees of movie theaters , and car salesmen are all exempt from the FLSAs overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special profession that is exempt from the FLSAs overtime provisions , the exemptions most likely to apply are those for so-called " white collar " employees : administrative , executive , or professional employees ; outside salespeople ; and computer professionals . For these employees to fit within an exemption , they must : <p> be paid at least a certain amount on a salary basis , and <p> perform specified job duties . <p> Misclassification is unfortunately a very common problem . Some employers simply do n't  know the rules , but others are trying to avoid their legal obligations . <h> Salary Basis Test <p> To fit into one of the white-collar exemptions , you must be paid at least $455 per week ( or , for computer specialists , at least $27.63 per hour ) . The federal Department of Labor has proposed regulations that would raise the weekly threshold to $921 in 2016 , but those regulations have not yet gone into effect . <p> You are exempt from overtime only if you receive this amount on a salary basis , which means that you receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your productivity or your work hours .

( For more on this topic , see our article on the salary basis rule . ) <h> Job Duties Test <p> To fit into one of the white-collar exemptions , you must perform the job duties associated with that position . For example , you will be an exempt computer specialist employee only if you are a systems analyst , programmer , or software engineer .

For others , though , having more than one spouse is a way of life . But there may be consequences for choosing that lifestyle . <h> In the Open <p> In Utah , four- women consider themselves the wives of the same man . And they- share their stories and their lives in a- popular reality TV show . The problem is , they may end up in court and prosecuted for committing a crime . <h> Polygamy and Bigamy <p> Polygamy and bigamy are illegal in the US , but as the Utah " sister wives " show , it goes on anyway . Essentially they mean the same thing - someone has more than one spouse . More often than not , it 's when a man has more than one wife . In some states , the law uses the terms interchangeably . There are some legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marries more than one person . That means they go through the hoops set out by state law , such as getting a marriage license , etc . It may happen on purpose , or by mistake , like not having a proper , legal divorce before getting remarried <p> Polygamy is when someone has one legal spouse and one or more co-spouses- he married through some sort of spiritual marriage that 's not legally recognized by the state <h> How It 's Illegal <p> You may be asking : How can it be illegal if the spiritual marriage is legally invalid ? Most states recognize common law marriages , where you act like you 're married- - live together , have children , tell friends and neighbors you 're married , etc . If you 're legally married to one wife and also have a common law wife , you 're committing the crime of polygamy . <p> Also , there are anti-cohabitation laws making it illegal for two people to live together and act as though they 're married . <h> Overlooked ? <p> Often , - polygamists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that have anti-cohabitation laws generally do n't enforce them . There are a few reasons for this , such as the respect for freedom of choice- - the freedom to choose your own lifestyle . Freedom of religion also plays a role . Polygamy is acceptable in some religions , from the mainstream , like Islam , to the not-so-mainstream , like certain cults . <h> Not Overlooked <p> It 's not overlooked , however , when the lives or safety of others are at stake , or the public 's faith in the local government is weakened . For example , in 2008 , law enforcement agents in Texas raided a polygamist compound after a 14-year-old wife made an emergency call for help . <p> And in the Utah sisters ' case , flaunting their violation of state law on- national TV- may spark legal action by state prosecutors to show the public that polygamy is in fact illegal and that state laws mean something . <p> Another situation when it wo n't - and ca n't - be ignored is when it comes to divorce , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one spouse and/or multiple children by more than one spouse , who 's entitled to alimony , custody or child support payments ? A court can hold a polygamist husband responsible for all of it . <h> Penalties <p> The penalties for polygamy and bigotry vary a great deal from state to state . It may be considered a criminal misdemeanor , such as when- no one 's life or safety is at risk . The polygamist , and perhaps the spouses , may face a fine , up to a year jail , or both . <p> When wives or spouses are forced to marry against their will or are n't of legal age to marry , it may be a criminal felony , which may carry a higher fine and longer jail sentence . Not to mention other criminal charges , like sexual abuse , for instance . <p> Before Facebook , Twitter , reality TV and the internet , people could generally keep their business to themselves and do pretty much what they wanted without much interference .

But the sad fact is , most kids have been bullied at school at one time or another . And often the kids who are doing the bullying may come from home environments where they themselves are victims of abuse or bullying . So what can you do if your child is the victim of bullying ? Let 's take a look . <p> Like this article ? Share it with others using this link : http : //bit.ly/odEeAW <p> 1 . Teach your child how to respond to bullying . <p> Children should learn that physical or verbal retaliation rarely works with a bully . Instead , your child should ignore the bully or walk away . Role play with your child if you think it will help . Also , make sure your child does n't  turn around and bully another classmate who 's smaller , weaker , less popular or simply different . <p> 2 . Talk to your childs teacher or school officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When did it occur ? Where did it occur ? What happened ? Who was involved in the bullying ? Who witnessed it ? Was this a one-time experience or is there a pattern of behavior ? <p> 3 .

But you can ask the school to share with you the general steps that are being taken to address the problem . You can also ask how quickly the problem will be addressed . <p> 4 . Work with the school to provide resources and support for your child . <p> If bullying occurs , who can your child talk toimmediately ? Which teachers , counselors and administrators are aware of the problem ? Your child should know who they can go to for on-the-spot help . <p> 5 .

Even if there 's no prior record , the bully may end up in juvenile courtand possibly juvenile detentionas a result of the incident . <p> The police can also help you get a restraining or anti-harassment order to keep the school bully a safe distance from your child . <p> 6 . Consider talking to an attorney if the bullying continues . <p> Students are n't  the only ones who can be bullies at school . Some teachers have been called out about their behavior with certain kids .

Sometimes , these decisions involve how to handle an employee 's poor performance , work-related misconduct , or violation of company policy . Although they 're not the most enjoyable tasks , disciplining employees and consistently enforcing company policies are vital to keeping your business running smoothly and efficiently . <p> However , disciplining employees can also be risky if you do n't do it right . In particular , if you discipline employees differently for the same offense , your company could end up facing claims of employment discrimination . <h> Avoiding Discrimination Claims <p> Under federal law , its illegal to discriminate against employees based on certain protected characteristicssuch as race , gender , pregnancy , religion , national origin , disability , and age . Many states have their own laws that outlaw discrimination on additional grounds , such as sexual orientation or gender identity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more employees ( or 20 or more employees for age discrimination ) . So if your business is very small , these laws may not apply to your employees . But this does n't  necessarily give you a free license to discriminateyour state , county , or city might have a law or ordinance that applies even to the smallest employers . And , even if none of these laws apply , it will be hard to attract good employees once word gets out that employment decisions are based on immutable characteristics rather than merit . ( To learn more , read our article on antidiscrimination law basics for employers . ) <p> Because most employers do n't  intentionally discriminate , the bigger concern is inadvertently discriminating against employees , or even just giving off the appearance of discrimination . This often happens when employers impose discipline inconsistently . For example , suppose you give warnings to three male employees for coming in to work late . Then , because you 're fed up with tardiness , you decide to fire the next employee who comes in late . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you engaged in gender discrimination because you disciplined her more harshly than the male employees for the same offense . <p> Generally , an employee must file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) or a similar state agencybefore filing a discrimination lawsuit in court . If an employee files a complaint against your company , you should consult with an employment lawyer on how best to proceed . <h> Tips for Enforcing Your Discipline Policy <p> The following guidelines will help you avoid discrimination and other types of claims by employees : <p> Create a clear discipline policy . Your company should have a written disciplinary policyeither as part of an employee handbook or as a stand-alone written policy . The policy should clearly state that the company will discipline employees for performance , misconduct , and violation of company rules . You may want to include the types of discipline that may be imposedfor example , a verbal warning , a written warning , suspension , and terminationas well as examples of disciplinable offenses . However , you should explain that employment with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other offenses , and that employees can be terminated without receiving prior discipline . If you need help creating a policy , contact an employment lawyer . <p> Communicate the policy to employees . You should distribute your discipline policy ( and other company policies ) , explain it and answer questions , and ask employees to acknowledge receipt in writing . <p> Consistently enforce the policy . Consistency in disciplining employees is critical . But , consistency does n't necessarily mean that you have to apply the exact same discipline and follow the exact same procedures in every situation . Instead , look at the big picture to make sure that similarly situated employees receive similar discipline for similar offenses . <p> Document disciplinary actions . <p> Creating a paper trail to back up terminations is one of the most important things your business can do . <p> That way , you can show that an employee was really fired for poor performance or misconduct , rather than discriminatory reasons . <p> Have a process for internal complaints . Your company should provide employees with a process for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as having employees come to you with their concerns . If employees are concerned about unfair treatment , you can remedy the situation before they file a lawsuit or agency complaint . <h> Do n't Retaliate <p> The same laws that prohibit discrimination also prohibit retaliation against employees who file a discrimination claim or otherwise exercise their rights . Retaliation can take a number of forms , including demoting an employee , refusing to promote an employee , or giving the employee unjustified negative performance reviews . Even small thingssuch as changing an employees shiftscan be considered retaliation , if the employee finds those shifts less desirable .

A contract is a legally binding promise . It is formed when one party offers to do something , the second party accepts the offer , and each party promises to provide something of value to the other , such as cash , services , or goods . For example , if your company offers to buy equipment from a seller for $10,000 , and the seller accepts your offer , there is a contract for the sale of equipment . <p> Chances are you will enter into many different kinds of contracts while you are in business .

The failure to perform the obligations of a contract is called a breach of contract . If a breach is serious enoughwhat lawyers call a " material breach " there can be serious legal consequences . <h> Nonperformance <p> When you enter into a contract you are legally obligated to perform your contractual dutiesthat is , do what you promised to do in the contract . Nonperformance is the failure to fulfill your obligations under a contract . However , you do not have to perform your promises under a contract until performance is due . For example , if you agree to pay the seller of equipment on delivery of the equipment , you do not have to pay the seller until the equipment is delivered . You will not be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you then fail to pay the seller . <p> But there can be cases where a contract is breached before the time for performance comes . This occurs when one party decides before performance is due that he or she will not perform as promised and communicates the decision to the other party . The second party can sue the first party for breach of contract even though the time for performance has not arrived . This is called anticipatory breach of contract <h> When Is a Contract Breached ? <p> A contract is breached ( broken ) when either one or both parties fails to perform as promised in the contract . A breach may occur when a party : <p> refuses to perform its promises under the contract <p> does something that the contract prohibits , or <p> prevents the other party from performing its obligations under the contract . <p> Some contract breaches are more serious than others . The law distinguishes between material ( or total ) breaches and immaterial ( trivial ) breaches of contract . <h> Material Breach of Contract <p> A material breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breach ) , is serious and gives rise to a cause of action in court . A material breach goes to the very heart of the contract . It renders the contract " irreparably broken " and defeats the purpose for making it in the first place . For example , suppose your company agrees to pay a violinist $500 to play at a company-hosted event , but the violinist shows up at the party without his violin . The violinist has materially breached the contract to perform if he can not play . <p> When there is a material breach of contract , the injured party can go to court and seek damagesa money payment adequate to cover economic losses resulting from the breach . A total breach of contact will also usually terminate the nonbreaching partys duty to perform any of the promises he or she made in the contract . For example , your company would have no legal duty to pay the violinist who could n't play as promised . <h> Immaterial Breach of Contract <p> An immaterial breach of contract is a trivial breach that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . An immaterial breach does not terminate the contract . Example : A building owner enters into a service contract for a heating system that provides that the system will be inspected each month on Thursday . Contrary to the contract , the service person makes inspections on Mondays . This act is a technical breach of the contract , but it is immaterial , unless for some significant reason the inspections needed to be done on Thursday as opposed to any other day . Since this breach is immaterial , the contract ca n't be terminated by the building owner . The two sides should work out an accommodationthe service person can agree to show up on Mondays , or the building owner accepts that the inspections will be done on Thursdays , perhaps in return for paying slightly less . <h> Excuses for Not Keeping Your Contractual Promises <p> Sometimes the law excuses a material breach of contract .

If you believe your employer has violated wage and hour lawsfor example by failing to pay you minimum wage or overtimeyou can file a lawsuit to recover your unpaid wages . However , you only have a limited amount of time to file your suit . In legal terms , this time limit is called the " statute of limitations . " <h> Time to File Under Federal Law <p> Under the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) , you must typically file your lawsuit within two years of the date of your employers wage violation . If the wage violation is ongoing , you will only be allowed to recover unpaid wages for the two years prior to filing your claim . For example , suppose you are claiming that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 2013 . If you wait until June 1 , 2016 to file your lawsuit , you will only be allowed to seek unpaid wages from June 1 , 2014 to June 1 , 2016 . <p> The statute of limitations is extended to three years if your employers violation of the FLSA was willful . An FLSA violation is considered to be willful if the employer knew that its conduct was prohibited by the FLSA or showed reckless disregard as to whether its conduct was prohibited by the FLSA . <h> Time to File Under State Law <p> Most states have their own wage and hour laws with their own time limits for filing a wage lawsuit . The time limits may vary depending on what type of wage violation your employer committed . For example , in New Jersey , the time limit is two years for minimum wage and overtime violations and six years for all other wage violations . In California , most wage violations are subject to a three-year statute of limitations . <p> A lawyer can help you file a wage claim or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both your federal and state law claims are preserved . <h> Wage Claim Versus Lawsuit <p> For violations of the FLSA , you can file a wage claim with the U.S. Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division . However , you should file your claim well before the two-year statute of limitations expires . That way , you will still have enough time to file a lawsuit if you are not able to resolve your claim through the Department of Labors administrative process . <p> In many states , you can also file a wage claim with your state department of labor . However , some states have different time limits for filing a wage claim . For example , in Delaware , you must file your wage claim at least 90 days before the statute of limitations on your wage claim is set to expire .

As a general rule , in the family law context , any activity or behavior by a parent that threatens a childs physical or emotional well-being is considered abuse . This includes verbal abuse that results in emotional trauma and physical abuse that results in visible bruises , scratches , or broken bones . Neglect is another form of abuse , where a parent refuses or fails to provide for a childs most basic needs . For example , a parent may commit neglect by failing to feed , bathe , or provide necessary medical care for a child over an extended period of time . <p> Judges take all forms of child abuse seriously , as children are vulnerable and unable to protect themselves .

A state or local agency like Child Protective Services will get involved in abuse or neglect cases , and may place a child in foster care or with relatives . If a judge determines that the abuse is likely to happen again in the future , a judge may terminate the abusive parents rights , permanently cutting off the parent-child relationship . <p> In less severe cases of abuse , a judge may restrict the abusive parents relationship with the child .

There are many things to think about in starting your own farm , such as what form of business entity you should have and how you are going to pay for the business . <h> Types of Business Entities <p> Three types of business entities make up the majority of farm and ranch businesses . These include : <p> Sole proprietorships <p> Partnerships <p> Corporations <p> Traditionally , farming has been carried on under the sole proprietorship form of organization .

The incorporators must determine how much capital ( in the form of cash and other assets ) to transfer to the corporation and the amount of debt capital to be borrowed from outside credit sources .

Many employers require employees to sign these agreements , which prevent the employee from starting a competing business or going to work for a competitor for a period of time after the employment relationship ends . <p> Its easy to see why employers want employees not to compete : Getting the edge in the business world might require holding more market share than business rivals , selling more goods and services , or landing plum government contracts . By prohibiting employees from competing , employers try to maintain their advantageand keep their practices and strategies to themselves . <p> As advantageous as these contracts can be for employers , they can really hamstring employees when its time to move on . If you 're considering changing jobs , or you 're being fired or laid off , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires . Your employer may also ask you to sign a noncompete in exchange for a severance package . ( For more on this topic , see our article on severance agreements . ) <h> What Noncompetes Require <p> A noncompete agreement is a contract between you and your employer . Typically , a noncompete prohibits you from going to work for a competing business or starting one of your own . A noncompete should define what a competitor isfor example , " an eco-friendly dry cleaners " or " a tax preparation service " . The contract should also spell out how long , and in what geographical area , the noncompete applies . <h> What Makes a Noncompete Enforceable <p> The laws on noncompete contracts vary from state to state . Most states enforce noncompete contracts as long as they meet certain standards spelled out in statutes and cases . In a few states , courts will not enforce noncompetes . In California , for example , it is illegal for an employer to require an employee to sign a noncompete agreement . <p> In most states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements intended to ensure that it is fair and reasonable . These requirements vary from state to state , but generally a noncompete must be all of the following : <p> Protective of the employers legitimate business interests . The employer must have a legitimate need that is met by requiring you to sign a noncompete . Often , this interest is protecting trade secrets , such as customer lists or manufacturing processes . An employer that requires every employee to sign a noncompete agreement , even those whose jobs do n't  require specialized skills or knowledge , might not pass this test . <p> Part of an exchange . For any contract to be valid , it must be two-sided : Each party must get something . In most states , a noncompete agreement is valid if you sign at the beginning of your employment because the employer is giving you something ( a job ) in exchange for your agreement . In some states , your employer must give you something more in exchange for signing a noncompete if you are already an employeea promotion , bonus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . A court will likely find a noncompete contract to be unreasonable if it prohibits you from competing with your former employer forever . Time periods of six months to two years are usually enforceable . Longer periods might make the agreement invalid because it may be seen as too restrictive on your ability to find meaningful work . <p> Limited in geographic scope . A noncompete agreement usually ca n't bar you from competing with your former employer anywhere in the country or the world . Specific market areas may be protected , however . For example , if your employer sells or distributes its goods or services throughout a 25-mile radius of the business , a noncompete limited to that area is more likely to be found valid . <p> Limited in type of work . If an employer restricts the type of work you may do so narrowly that you will have trouble finding a new job , that noncompete may be struck down , particularly if the work you perform does not require specialized knowledge . If you worked as a mechanic specializing in installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your employer may be able to prohibit you from performing that job for its only local competitor . But , it would have more trouble getting a court to enforce a noncompete that prohibited you from taking any mechanic job . <p> A noncompete agreement is a contract , and if you break or " breach " it , your former employer can sue you for damages . <p> If you 've signed a noncompete , and your former employer believes you are violating the contract , it can sue you to stop you from competing . If a court determines that your noncompete contract is too restrictive , state law determines how the court will proceed . In some states , the court can revise the contract and enforce a less restrictive version . For example , a contract that bars you from working in your field anywhere in the state may be changed to restrict you from working in the city where your former employer is based . <p> This is n't the practice everywhere , however .

If this happens , it can be costly for you , your new employer , or both . Your old employer may file a lawsuit against you alone if you started working for a competitor or started your own competing business . Or , your former employer may file a lawsuit against you and your new employer , especially if you share trade secretsspecialized knowledge or information that gives your former employer a business edge and that it took pains to keep confidentialwith your new employer .

@@25934149 @5934149/ <h> Top 5 Factors That Lead To Divorce <p> This is a guest blog post from Bari Z. Weinberger , a Parsippany , New Jersey divorce and family law attorney . <p> Valentine 's Day , the official holiday of love , evokes images of happy couples wrapped in passionate embraces . While married couples know that long-term relationships take more effort than occasional jewelry and flowers , Valentine 's Day might be a good time to consider the attention that you and your spouse give to each other . <p> If you 're thinking that your relationship could be strengthened , you might want to consider the common factors that eventually lead couples to divorce . Life has a way of interfering with our ability to see each other 's needs . When couples come into my office ready to divorce , it 's usually only after a prolonged period of communication breakdown . <p> These are the top issues that bring my clients to the point of divorce . I will list them here in case you recognize your marriage might be suffering under any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they wreak too much damage on the marriage : <h> 1 . Adultery <p> Still the number one reason why people seek a divorce , adultery drives couples apart and is difficult to recover from . <p> My clients often tell me they saw signs of an affair early on , but either did n't recognize them or did n't want to admit it might be happening . Those signs include emotional detachment , a sudden interest in dressing up and looking good , and/or unexplained credit card charges . If you see signs , work up the courage to address the issue and talk to your spouse . <p> Adultery is an obvious sign that something is wrong with the marriage , or something is not right in that person 's life . Either way , the problem wo n't go away by itself and will need commitment from both spouses to be open and honest with each other about moving forward . <h> 2 . Financial Difficulties <p> Bari Z. Weinberger <p> Financial trouble is another key cause of divorce for my clients . It can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning one is a spender and the other a saver " and they come to resent each other because of it . Often , income instability drives one or both spouses to a state of stress and heightened arguments . <p> Ideally , couples should openly discuss their finances before marrying " but not all people get around to doing so . If you 're already married , financial planners can help couples to get on the same page by mapping out both their immediate and future savings and retirement goals . <h> 3 . Work Stress and Obligations <p> Although not as common as adultery or financial troubles , work stress is a big factor that leads couples to go their own ways . Whether one or both spouses have demanding , all-encompassing jobs , this can , over time , lessen or sever the bond that originally brought them together . - <p> My clients who have either uncommon work hours , such as a night shift , or highly demanding careers , tell a story of slowly losing touch with their spouse . If work obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . You may want to talk with a counselor to come up with ways to stay in touch with each other , even with your demanding schedules . <h> 4 . Depression <p> Depression can place a dreadful strain on a marriage , especially if it has n't been clinically diagnosed . Often characterized by extreme mood swings and a severe detachment from life and the people around them , a person may seem like themselves one moment and then suddenly swing into full blown depression in the next . <p> People who are depressed often do n't seek treatment , and their spouse silently puts up with the problem , growing more distant or resentful every day . Depression does n't need to lead to divorce . Doing research to understand depression and then getting your loved one ( or yourself ) to a doctor are the first steps in working to treat the problem and restore a healthy marriage . <h> 5 . Addictions <p> When one spouse becomes addicted , whether it 's to gambling , drinking , the Internet , or other , the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The key with any addiction is to try to get your spouse to recognize that they have a problem , and to get them to seek help . Successfully treating the addiction may allow you , or your partner , to have a healthier relationship . <p> Without attention and proper nurturing , a marriage is sure to slowly unravel and drift apart . By all means , take Valentine 's Day as an opportunity to rekindle some romance , and have some fun . But if more serious problems are lurking , please do your best to take the necessary steps to address them as early as you can . 
@@25934150 @5934150/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Recovering Costs Related to Your Business Lease <p> Many businesses rent or lease the building or property where the business is located and runs . Lease-related costs and expenses can be high and can eat-up a lot of your operating budget . However , there are ways of recovering some of the costs related to your business lease at tax time . <p> Through depreciation , amortization , or deductions , usually you can recoup lease-related costs for : <p> Improvements you make to the property <p> Getting the lease <p> Rent <p> The rules for depreciation , amortization can be complicated . To make sure that you 're not paying too much tax and are getting all the tax benefits you 're entitled to , look carefully at the guidance given by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , or get some help from an experienced tax lawyer . <h> Depreciation , Amortization , and Deductions Basics <p> Depreciation and amortization are very similar . Essentially , you deduct a portion of the cost of certain property or assets over a specific number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " useful life " of the property , that is , the number of years that the property or asset is expected to last . For amortization , the number of years is based on the asset . There are detailed IRS rules and charts that tell you the number of years for depreciating or amortizing an asset . <p> Tax deductions lower your taxable income and so they can lower the taxes you may owe at the end of the year . Generally , you take a tax deduction for the full cost of the qualifying property in the year that you pay for it , rather than over a period of years . <h> Leasehold Improvements <p> You can amortize or depreciate qualified leasehold improvements that you make to the interior of a nonresidential building that you lease for your business . Installing countertops , carpeting , or building new walls to create more offices are good examples . Qualified improvements do n't include things like installing an elevator or altering the building 's structural framework . <p> In most instances , these improvements are depreciated over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be used in certain instances , such as where your business use of the property and improvement is less than 50% for the year . <p> How much do you claim as a depreciation deduction ? You must use the straight line depreciation method to figure how much depreciation you claim each year . It 's calculated by dividing the number 1 by the years remaining in the 15-year period at the beginning of the current year . Usually , in the first and last years of the 15-year period , you can claim only one-half of the depreciation amount , and then you claim the full depreciation amount in all other years . For example , say in 2008 you spent $5,000 in erecting new walls in your leased office building . In 2008 and 2023 , the first and last years of the 15-year period , you 'll claim $184 in depreciation ( .067 ( or 1/15 ) X $5,500 X .5 ( or 1/2 ) ) . In all other years , you 'll claim $369 ( .067 X $5,500 ) . <p> New for 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified leasehold improvement property . This gives you an additional first year special depreciation allowance of 50% of the property 's depreciable basis . " Depreciable basis " is the cost of the improvement minus any deduction you took under Internal Revenue Code - 179 . To qualify improvement had to be : <p> Bought or paid for by you after 2007 and before 2009 <p> Placed in service after 2007 and before 2009 <p> Used by you , as the original owner , after 2007 <p> Generally , if your lease term is less than 15 years or if you abandon the leased property before 15 years have passed , then you can take a tax deduction for the remaining depreciation you were unable to claim . <h> Getting a Lease <p> You recover the cost of the lease for your business 's property by amortizing it over the term of the lease . For amortization purposes , the lease term includes all renewal options , including any other period that you and the landlord expect the lease to be renewed . However , renewal periods are not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease is for the term of the lease remaining on the date you got it . <p> For example , say you got a 20 year lease with two five-year renewal options . You paid $7,000 for the 20-year period and $3,000 for the renewal options . Because $7,000 is less than 75% of the total $10,000 cost of the lease ( or $7,500 ) , you have to amortize the $10,000 over 30 years . That is the remaining life of the lease plus renewal periods . However , if instead you paid $8,000 for the lease and $2,000 for the renewals , you can amortize the entire $10,000 over the 20-year remaining life of the original lease . That 's because cost of getting the lease ( $8,000 ) was not less than 75% of the total cost of the lease ( $7,500 ) . <h> Rent <p> Rent is any amount you pay for the use of property you do n't own . Generally , you can take a tax deduction for the full amount of rent you pay , and you take the deduction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be used in your business , so your deduction is reduced by the amount , if any , that you use the leased property for personal use . Also , if you have or will get equity in or title to the property , you ca n't deduct the rent . <p> Also , if you pay rent in advance , you can deduct only the amount for the current tax year . For example , say you leased a building for 10 years beginning on July 1 , 2008 and your yearly rent is $10,000 . On June 30 , 2008 you paid all of the rent for the first year . On your 2008 return , you can only deduct $5,000 , because that 's the amount of rent that was owed under the lease for 2008 . In 2009 , you can deduct the remaining $5,000 and up to $5,000 for the 2009 rent . <p> In addition , you can take another deduction for " rent " if you pay real estate taxes either to the landlord or to the local tax authorities . Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in which you pay them . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> Can I take any improvements with me when my lease ends , like the new countertops I installed ? <p> If my landlord makes and pays for improvements that I request and I agree to pay him increased rent , can I depreciate or amortize the improvements and deduct my rent payments ? <p> I 'm one year into a 10-year lease . The lease does n't have any renewal periods , and my landlord wo n't discuss renewals until year nine of the lease . I want to make some improvements , but I want to make sure I 'm in the building for the full 15-year period . Is there anything I can do to help ensure that I recover the costs of the improvements ?

@@25934153 @5934153/ <p> Did you know that a medical malpractice law suit in Florida can not be maintained until and unless a doctor of the same or similar specialty as the defendant doctor has reviewed the case and stated by way of affidavit that reasonable grounds exist for a claim for medical malpractice to be made ? That=s right . A case will be dismissed or abated without having an expert doctor review the matter before hand and provide such an opinion . Further , once the case has been reviewed and an affidavit obtained , a letter , called a Notice of Intent to Litigate , must be sent to the defendant health care providers , with a copy of the affidavit attached , before the law suit can be initiated . This is to allow the defendant health care providers 90 days to evaluate the claim and see if they , too , can have a health care provider of the same or similar specialty review the matter and provide an affidavit stating that no reasonable grounds exist for the claim . During that 90 day period , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the parties may engage in discovery-obtaining medical records , medical bills , and taking oral statements from the claimant and the defendant health care providers . This discovery is designed to help each party further evaluate their case with an eye towards settlement . At the end of the 90 day period , the defendant health care providers have three options : ( 1 ) deny the claim by obtaining an affidavit from a physician in the same or similar specialty as the defendant health care provider stating that the matter has been reviewed and no grounds exist for a claim for medical malpractice ; ( 2 ) make a monetary offer to settle ; or , ( 3 ) admit liability and request arbitration . A case must be brought within a specific time frame called a statute of limitations period , otherwise the case will be barred . In Florida , that time frame is two ( 2 ) years from the date the negligent incident occurred or two ( 2 ) years from when the negligence should have been discovered , whichever is later . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more than four ( 4 ) years from when the negligent act occurred unless a child under eight ( 8 ) years old is the injured party . If that is the case , the four years is not applicable if it lapses before the child=s eighth birthday . The statute of limitations can be extended under certain circumstances . Calculating the statute of limitations is technical ans a lawyer should always be consulted well before the two year time frame referenced above has elapsed . 
@@25934154 @5934154/ <h> Q : Are medical bills included in a bodily injury claim ? <p> A : Yes . The term " bodily injury claim " usually refers to a personal injury claim , and after an accident , compensation for all medical treatment made necessary because of your injuries is part of that claim against the at-fault party . Medical bills are a component of " economic damages " ( sometimes also called " special damages " ) , which also include lost wages and other out-of-pocket losses stemming from the accident and your injuries . <h> Q : Can a health care insurer be repaid from a personal injury settlement ? <p> A : Yes , it 's quite common . Most health insurance policies now have language that allows the insurance company to be reimbursed for the amount paid out on medical bills if the insured person gets a personal injury settlement . This right of repayment is sometimes called a " personal injury lien . " <p> Ask your lawyer to provide you with a copy of the actual settlement check forwarded by the insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attorney to cover costs connected with your case . <h> Q : Can I ask my lawyer for a copy of the settlement check ? <p> A : Yes , and you should . As a client you have an absolute right to see a copy of the settlement check , and to review a copy of the settlement breakdown sheet before the check is deposited . Usually , the insurance company check has both your name and your attorney 's name on it , so you would typically have to endorse the check before it could be placed in your lawyer 's trust account . Ask your lawyer to provide you with a copy of the actual settlement check forwarded to him or her by the insurance company , as well as a copy of all checks written by the attorney to cover costs connected with your case . ( More : Who pays " costs " in a personal injury case ? ) <h> Q : Can I break an annuity from an auto accident settlement ? <p> A : Probably not . It 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annuity is to have the insurance company pay out the settlement funds over time , rather than in one lump sum payment . You could try to get a court to set aside the annuity , but that kind of request is rarely granted without a compelling reason . The only other alternative , which may not be a wise one , is to find a company that purchases structured settlements from personal injury victims . Usually these companies will pay you 20 to 50 cents on the dollar and purchase your right to future payments . You 'll be giving up a substantial amount of money if you choose this option , however . <h> Q : Can I gain access to my child 's settlement money ? <p> A : A parent usually does n't have access to a child 's settlement funds . The reason for this is to protect children from parents who might use the money to benefit themselves , instead of the child . A court will generally place a child 's settlement money in a " blocked " trust account until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blocked accounts if the funds are needed for the child 's care and well-being , and the court is satisfied the funds will be used to benefit the minor . You and your lawyer should discuss what expenses might be paid for with the settlement funds . <h> Q : Can my lawyer settle my case without my consent ? <p> A : It 's possible that the retainer agreement you signed with your lawyer allows him or her to settle the case without your consent , and that includes signing the release agreement on your behalf . If your attorney settled the case " in principle " without your permission , and no release agreement has been signed , you should tell your lawyer that you do n't want to proceed with the settlement . If a release has already been signed , things get a lot more complicated , and your only recourse may be a malpractice action against your lawyer .

The insurance company will usually just write a check for the damages up to the limit of the insurance policy . If the person against whom you have the judgment is uninsured , collecting wo n't be as easy . You must have the judgment " entered " with the court and then seek to " enforce " the judgment . There are actually attorneys who specialize in collecting judgments , and it might be a good idea to consult with one . <h> Q : Is there a minimum personal injury settlement amount ? <p> A : No , there is no minimum or maximum settlement amount in personal injury cases ( although some state laws limit the amount of damages you can be awarded by a judge or jury in certain kinds of lawsuits ) .

The only way to know if your attorney is willing to consider a lower fee is to ask . If there is n't much of a fault ( " liability " ) issue , you may be able to find a less-expensive lawyer .

@@25934158 @5934158/ <h> Why It 's a Good Idea to Have a Personal Injury Lawyer <p> Reviewed By David Goguen , J.D. , University of San Francisco School of Law <p> Do you always need a lawyer if you 're making a personal injury claim ? What are the advantages to having a lawyer on your side ? Read on to learn more . <h> You May Not Always Need a Personal Injury Lawyer <p> After a relatively minor accident , or in cases where there is insurance coverage and the at-fault party admits liability , you may not need to hire a personal injury attorney , especially if you are comfortable handling the matter on your own . <p> For example , after a car accident , if the claim is primarily one for property damage to your car , you can probably work out an arrangement with the other partys insurance carrier . The same holds true if you have some minor injuries , such as soft tissue injuries like neck sprain , and you have a good medical outcome . <h> ... But It 's Almost Always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things can get tricky pretty fast . You may not know what the other party 's available liability insurance coverage is , and the adjuster may not reveal those limits . In some states , you can not obtain this information without filing a lawsuit and making a formal request for it . The insurance coverage may not be enough to pay for your injuries and losses . <p> Or , your injuries may be of the type that is often questioned by insurance carriers . For example , car accident claims where there is little vehicle damage and " only " soft issue injuries are often vigorously contested by insurance adjusters . Note : Soft tissue injuries are difficult to " prove up " in an objective medical sense before a jury . The patient complains of pain but there are no broken bones on an x-ray and no torn ligaments that will show up on an imaging scan . A jury can be persuaded that the plaintiffs complaints of neck or back pain are contrived to take advantage of the accident and " get something for nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequent , it makes sense to get a personal injury attorney to make sure you get a fair resolution . <p> Beyond the routine cases that are hard to settle , a vast range of cases present complexities that are far beyond the abilities of a non-lawyer . For example , medical malpractice cases are extremely complex in terms of both evidence and procedure ( many states require medical malpractice plaintiffs to jump through a number of special procedural hoops ) . The same goes for products liability cases , burn cases , seat belt cases , and virtually any case that requires expert opinion . <h> Many Attorneys Specialize in Specific Type of Accidents <p> Think of any area of personal injury , from trucking accidents to airplane disasters , and it 's a safe bet that a number of attorneys in your area specialize in that field and know which experts to hire and how to optimize the outcome -- get the best settlement , or try the best case . <p> Aside from the issue of expertise , the very practical question of costs must be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the services of accident reconstruction experts , forensic accountants , civil engineers or a whole host of other trained professionals in order to prove liability and establish damages . These services do not come cheap . <p> A personal injury firm that specializes in a particular field will know not only which experts to engage but also how to engage them on an economical basis , so far as possible . The firm will usually advance these costs for you , even if the outcome of the case is not clear . Most plaintiffs would be unable to find , much less afford , the services of the experts needed to prove up liability in a case and also make a convincing case for calculation of damages . <h> Reputation Can Go a Long Way <p> When you hire a good personal injury firm , you 're also acquiring the advantage of that firms reputation when dealing with insurance adjusters . For example , if the firm regularly litigates personal injury claims , when your attorney raises the threat of litigation during settlement negotiations , there will be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff tactic . <p> Since most personal injury firms will provide a free consultation , there is little in the way of downside if you decide to sit down and discuss your case with an experienced personal injury attorney . 
@@25934159 @5934159/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Speaking Up for the Right to Remain Silent <p> They showed it best in the grainy black and white movies : A bare light bulb dangles from the ceiling , casting stark shadows on a haggard face . Sweating and exhausted , the suspect cracks . At long last the hard-edged cop gets what he has waited days for : A confession . <p> No more , said the US Supreme Court in an April 2009 ruling . The FBI had held and questioned a robbery suspect for two days . The Court said that interrogation involving isolation and pressure causes innocent people to give involuntary confessions . The Court held that a person charged with a federal crime ca n't be held and questioned more than six hours without being brought before a federal Magistrate Judge . <h> Police Interrogation Has Its Limits <p> Over the years , police interrogation in the US has come under scrutiny for interfering with the fundamental rights of people - presumed innocence , to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and free from self-incrimination . What was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now viewed as unfair and inhumane . <p> If you 're questioned by police , remember that you are not required to respond to questions posed to you , but always have the right to remain silent . There are serious legal outcomes to being persuaded to confess to a crime , and it 's always preferable to speak with a lawyer before confessing . Serious consequences can result from making seemingly harmless , joking comments in order to " ease the tension " with a police officer . Any comments you make will be documented and , worse , can be misquoted or misconstrued . <h> Basic Rights When Questioned or Arrested <p> Nearly every American has heard of " Miranda rights " What most people do n't realize is that the suspect in the Miranda case was arrested for a heinous crime , and was set free because the police had not given him the required warnings , " You have the right to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford an attorney one may be provided for you ... " and so on . It 's sometimes said that the mark of a civilized society is the degree to which even the most despicable of persons are treated fairly . And so it was that the Miranda case , decided in 1966 , led to the now-routine list of warnings given by police . <p> You probably ca n't envision yourself under a bright light in a police interrogation room . Yet our fundamental rights - including the right to remain silent - apply to everyone arrested and taken into police custody , for any offense , such as DUI . Making a confession to any offense - in writing or verbally - is an extremely serious matter which should never be taken lightly . Many people do n't know what consequences will flow from a confession . It could lead to a guilty finding , which , in the case of a DUI , could lead to a suspension or revocation of your driver 's license . <h> Court Decisions Have an Impact <p> Cases from one court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can impact the decisions of other courts . When a court is required to follow a higher court 's decision , it 's known as a " precedential " or " binding " decision . When a court is not required to follow the decision of another court , it 's " persuasive " authority and can be influential , even though it 's not binding . <p> State courts ( i.e. , the judges in your local county courtroom ) are not obligated to follow the decisions of federal courts , but those decisions might be persuasive to them . Federal court cases are those which are cases against persons of two different states , or involving federal laws . Traffic charges and minor criminal charges are most often in state courts . <p> The Supreme Court 's ruling on the six-hour time limit was described by the Court as being limited to federal charges only . A Supreme Court decision in 1991 defined a maximum delay of 48 hours before a criminal suspect is brought before a judge for a preliminary hearing ( thus leading to judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could Result in Quicker Hearings <p> The result of the recent decision is that local police departments may well err on the side of caution to bring suspects before a judge sooner rather than later , to avoid the risk of a confession being thrown out as not voluntary or pressured. 34379 @qwx234379 <p> If a court sets a limit on when and how the police can question someone , or how they must proceed once someone is taken into custody , is it a strict limit ? Does it depend on the facts of a given case ? <p> If someone thinks the police are n't following proper procedures during questioning or in detaining him , should he object , or just stay silent until a lawyer can be contacted ? <p> If someone 's being questioned or detained , how quickly do the police have to act in allowing him to contact a lawyer ? Is it truly one phone call allowed ? 
@@25934160 @5934160/ 34378 @qwx234378 <h> Who 's Responsible When Your Child 's at School ? <p> For about nine months out the year , your child spends most of her time away from home . She 's in school , five days a week from early morning to mid-afternoon . During that time , who 's responsible for your child ? <p> It 's a complicated matter , but in general the school is responsible for your child 's safety . There are some exceptions , and parents have some responsibilities , too . <h> Safe Place <p> Schools generally have to provide a safe environment for their students . This means the school has to take reasonable steps to make sure your child is n't harmed by other students , teachers or staff , persons entering the school without permission , or structural problems with the school building and grounds . <p> This does n't mean , however , your child 's school is responsible for all of her injuries . For example , if your child was hurt when she fell down some steps , the school likely is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps . <p> In most cases , it comes down to a question of negligence : Did the school do something wrong , or fail to do something all together , that caused your child to be injured or made the school unsafe ? For instance , the school may be at fault for an injury when : <p> A teacher or school officials knew about- bullying incidents at the school and did nothing to stop or prevent them <p> There were inadequate plans to evacuate students in the case of an emergency or to seek shelter during bad weather , or the fire alarms did n't work properly during a fire <p> A student was hit by a car near the playground because there was a lack of supervision on the playground or vehicle traffic near the playground was n't restricted properly <p> Necessary medication was n't given to the student properly <p> An injury was caused by damaged stairs or walls or peeling paint and the school was aware of the problem but did n't make necessary repairs <p> School personnel ignored security policies and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child was injured when his school bus was in an accident or was hit by school bus after being dropped off at school <p> As you can see , in these examples - any number of others that may come up - a school 's responsibility for your child goes only so far . The school does n't , and ca n't , guarantee your child 's safety in all things . It can only take steps to prevent or stop those things it knows about , or should know about , that may put your child 's safety at risk . <p> Mainly because of this , most schools have zero tolerance policies . They 're designed to keep discipline and order in the school by barring students from bringing weapons to school or threatening other students or staff with violence . <h> Parents <p> Even though you 're not at school with your child , you have some responsibilities to keep him safe while he 's there . And , like the school , you can find yourself in legal trouble for his misbehavior . For example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , such as insulin , it 's your responsibility to make sure the school has a supply of the medication and instructions on when it 's to be given <p> It 's your job to make sure your child treats other students and school staff with respect , and if there 's a problem , it 's up to you to work with the school and your child to correct the problem before the situation becomes violent <p> If your school has a zero tolerance policy , you need to make sure you and your child understand what the policy covers and- follow the rules <p> Your child should understand how to keep himself and others safe at school . No running in the halls or rough-housing , and the need to pay attention to the safety rules on the playground and parking lots are good examples <p> If your child injures another student or someone on the school 's staff , you could be sued . You could also face criminal charges if your child takes a weapon to school <p> To a big extent , your responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins long before you drop him off at the bus stop or at the school doors , and it does n't necessarily end once he 's at school , either . <h> Common Goal <p> Parents and schools share a common goal : To make the school a safe place for students to learn . Most schools take extraordinary measures to make their schools safe , as do most parents . If everyone knows their responsibilities and does everything they can to meet those responsibilities , our schools- will be a much a safer and effective place to learn . 34379 @qwx234379 <p> My child 's bus was in an accident on the way to school and my child injured her arm . Can I sue the school or the school bus driver for her medical bills ? <p> My child says he 's being bullied on the bus , but the school says there 's nothing it can do about since the other student goes to a different school . What can I do ? <p> Are teachers at my child 's school allowed to use a paddle or spanking to discipline and punish students ? 
@@25934161 @5934161/ <h> Worker Fired for Not Promptly Reporting Injury to Employer <p> If you think you 've been injured on the job , report it immediately to your employer . That 's the hard lesson learned recently by a Tennessee Caterpillar employee who was canned for failing to do so . Although she got compensation for her injury , the workers compensation law did not prohibit her firing . <p> Employee fired for failing to report workplace injury within 48 hours <p> Company rules requiring early notification not prohibited by workers comp law <p> Employees getting squeezed by workers comp trends <h> Workers Comp No Safe Harbor for Reporting Injury <p> All states prohibit an employer for firing an employee for making a workers compensation claim . Most workers compensation laws say an employee has to give notice of an injury no later than 30 days after its occurrence especially if the injury is " gradually occurring , " as repetitive motion injuries can be . In this case though , the employer , Caterpillar , had a company rule requiring employees to report injuries within 48 hours of occurrence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being transferred to a new assembly job . It was a couple of weeks before the pain was so great and shed researched carpal tunnel syndrome online that she told a company nurse . She was fired the following day for violating the companys 48-hour rule . <p> She claimed she was retaliated against for giving notice of her injury and that the 48-hour rule contradicted the workers comp notice provision . She lost on both counts . <p> When asked why she did n't  report the pain sooner , the employee said she felt she needed to work through it to keep her job . With unemployment over 9 percent nationwide , and much higher in some places , that 's an understandable concern . But what 's the best course for an employee who 's suffered an on-the-job accident or injury ? <p> " Report it immediately , " says Andrew Neuwelt , a workers compensation practitioner with Franks &amp; Koenig in Florida and Georgia , " as soon you think you may have been involved in a workplace injury , accident or exposure . " <p> Neuwelt points out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident or injury . " He acknowledges though the reality that , " as a practical matter there can be subtle pressure from management or coworkers then about your fitness to do your job , and that 's a reality . But by failing to report it you not only run the risk of violating a workplace rule , like in this case , but also of hurting your ability to recover medical and indemnity ( wage ) benefits possibly available to you under your states workers compensation system . <p> " You do n't  have to go immediately to a doctor , but if something happens you should report the incident , detail every aspect of your pain or injury , and document this with some written communication , like a note or an email . " <h> Workers Comp Trends Not Favorable to Employees <p> Reporting and documenting your injury is especially important now , Neuwelt notes , because of legal trends friendly to employers and insurance carriers and unfavorable to employees . <p> " Certain pro business states in particular , like Florida and Texas , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This shows up in several ways , from coverage , to examinations to access to a claim even . <p> Neuwelt points out , " In many states the initial medical providers are often selected by the insurance company with the understanding employers and the insurance companies want workers back to work with minimal time and productivity lost . Its the employers choice of doctors . Even when some states allow a second opinion it may be the carrier that chooses who that doctor is . " <p> As for an employees access to a claim , Neuwelt identifies a big problem : " In Florida , the attorneys fee schedule makes some claims impractical to pursue . While once an attorney who handled a claim was entitled to be paid an hourly rate , the fee is now geared to a percentage of the benefit attained by the injured worker . So while a $10,000 award can make or break a workers finances , a $1,000 attorneys fee makes it impractical to try such a claim .

After all , how many of us can afford to pay for major car repairs or medical bills out of our own pockets ? <p> Regardless of whether you look at it as a legal requirement or a necessity , car insurance costs money , and like any other item in you personal budget , you 'd like to keep the cost of your insurance low . Sometimes , that 's just not possible , because accidents and tickets have a direct impact on your insurance rates . <h> " Surcharges " <p> A surcharge is an amount your insurance company adds to your insurance premium , which is the amount you pay for your insurance , because of some event or occurrence . Usually , you can expect a surcharge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , or citation <p> You 're involved in accident and you 're at fault for the accident , meaning you caused the wreck <p> Tickets or citations that will cause a surcharge typically have to be " moving violations . " So , while a speeding ticket will cause a surcharge in almost every case , a parking ticket usually wo n't . <p> Also , a surcharge will be added if your spouse or child is covered by your insurance policy and they 're the one who gets the ticket or causes the accident . <p> The idea behind the surcharge revolves around the : <p> Assumption by the insurance company that a ticket for a moving violation , like speeding or reckless driving , makes it more likely that you 're going to be involved in an accident and cause harm to yourself or others , which increases the risk that the insurance company will have to pay a claim under your policy <p> The fact that the insurance company will have to pay claims under the policy , whether it 's to cover property damages or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone in the other car , or anyone else involved in the accident , and so it will recoup those payments through the surcharge <p> Also , you should know that you might get a surcharge even if you 're not at-fault for an accident . For example , in some states , you might have to carry underinsured or uninsured motorists protection , which essentially covers your damages if you 're involved in an accident with another driver who either does n't have any insurance or does n't have enough insurance to cover your damages . In such a situation , if your insurance company has to pay you , it 's likely that you 'll see an increase in your premium . <p> Nonetheless , in some states , the insurance laws make it illegal for your insurance company to increase your premium when you 're in an accident with an uninsured driver or for your first accident that was not your fault . But , in such a state , your rate can be increased if you have a second not-at-fault accident within the policy period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can expect a surcharge to be on your policy for several years , usually between three to five years . Usually , the amount will vary depending on what triggered the surcharge ( was it a ticket or accident ? ) , how much the insurance had to pay out , and the amount of your premium . That 's because many surcharges are based upon a percentage of your current premium . Every insurance company has a different formula for determining the exact amount of a surcharge . <p> In many states , the surcharge is directly connected to the " point " system that 's used by your state 's motor vehicle agency ( sometimes called the department or bureau of motor vehicles , " DMV " or " BMV " ) to track unsafe drivers and suspend or revoke their drivers ' licenses . Your insurer might use the " points " connected to your license to calculate a surcharge . For example , a point system might look like this : <p> 5 points for a major traffic violation , such as driving under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points for a major at-fault accident , which is when the claim against your insurance is over $2,000 <p> 3 points for a minor at-fault accident , where the claim is less than $2,000 <p> 2 points for a minor traffic violation , like speeding <p> Sometimes , an insurance company will have its own point system that will assign a point value for all kinds of traffic-related offenses . <p> In either case , the insurance company usually will use some type of mathematical formula that converts your point value to a dollar amount . <h> Surcharges Are Almost Automatic <p> Every insurance company has to file its rates with the state in which it sells policies , usually with the state 's department of insurance . The filing usually has to include surcharge amounts and/or how the insurance company figures out the amount of surcharges . So , if you 're involved in an accident or get a ticket that would require a surcharge according to your insurance company rate filings with the state , the insurance company must add it to your policy . It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to avoid a surcharge . In some states , especially in those that use the BMV/DMV point system and particularly for speeding tickets , you might be able to pay for and take a " safe driver " or " defensive driving " course .

Reaffirmation works best if your payments are up-to-date when you file your Chapter 7 case .

There are alternative ways to solve your legal problems outside of court . These alternatives are called alternative dispute resolution or ADR for short . <p> ADR is a process in which a neutral person helps parties resolve their case . ADR is designed to provide an opportunity to settle all or part of the case early on and keep the costs to a minimum . <p> There are many different kinds of ADR . But all of them use a neutral person to decide a case or help both sides come to an agreement without a trial . ADR is usually less formal , less expensive and less time-consuming than a trial . <h> Types of ADR <p> The most common types of ADR for civil cases are mediation , settlement conferences , neutral evaluation and arbitration .

The amount of time necessary to accomplish this varies , depending on what issues are being mediated .

Generally , the parties may not appeal an arbitrator 's decision in binding arbitration . Nonbinding arbitration means that the parties are free to request a trial if they do n't agree with the arbitrator 's decision . <h> Neutral Evaluation <p> In neutral evaluation , each party gets a chance to present the case to a neutral person called the " evaluator . " The evaluator then gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of each party 's evidence and arguments and about how the dispute could be resolved .

His recent five-day " Spiritual Warrior " course drew more than 50 participants who paid more than $9,000 each . <p> Ray 's expensive retreats are meant to push people beyond their physical and emotional limits . The ' ' Spiritual Warrior ' ' event is arguably the most physical of Ray 's events .

@@25934204 @5934204/ <h> If I File for Bankruptcy , What Happens to My Debt ? <p> Bankruptcy can bring a lot of relief when you 're overwhelmed with debt , but there are some debts that even bankruptcy ca n't eliminate . <p> For most people , the only reason to file a bankruptcy case is to eliminate overwhelming debt . The relief most people are looking for is called a discharge . <h> Understanding Your Choices in Bankruptcy <p> Most people choose to file one of two types of bankruptcy : a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy . <p> Chapter 7 bankruptcy . In this type , the debtor ( the person who files for bankruptcy ) can keep ( exempt ) a certain amount of property needed to work and live , such as clothing , household possessions , and a modest car . The bankruptcy trusteethe official tasked with overseeing the casesells any nonexempt property and distributes the funds to creditors . Qualifying debt gets wiped out after an average of four to six months . ( Learn more in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Basics . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this chapter , as well as catch up on past due debt , such as car and house payments . The debtor pays into a repayment plan for three- to five-years . Any dischargeable debt gets wiped out on completion of the plan . ( For further details , read Chapter 13 Wage Earner Bankruptcy Basics . ) <h> What Is a Bankruptcy Discharge ? <p> Bankruptcy professionals use the word discharge to mean " get rid of " or " wipe out " debt . At the end of a bankruptcy case , if the debtor has followed the law and cooperated with the bankruptcy court , the court will issue an order of discharge , also known as the general discharge . This order tells the world that the case successfully concluded and that dischargeable debts are no longer collectible by creditors . <h> The Effect of Discharge <p> When a debt gets discharged , your responsibility for paying for it goes away . The discharge acts as an " injunction " that stops creditors from taking any action against you to collect the debt . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , send demand letters , file a lawsuit against you , or garnish your wages ( deduct money from your paycheck ) . <p> The law considers some obligations so important that you cant get rid of them in bankruptcy . <p> The discharge does n't  prohibit the creditor from trying to collect against someone who is also liable for the debt ( a co-signer ) , however . Also , a lender can repossess or foreclose on any property that you might have pledged as collateral to secure the debt , such as a car for a car loan . <p> Example . Before his bankruptcy , Kyles aunt agreed to cosign for a car loan . Kyle made regular payments until he lost his job a year later . Because he owed a significant amount of credit card debt , he decided it was best to file for bankruptcy . Kyle also owed $10,000 on the car loan . Because he was unable to make the vehicle payment , after the bankruptcy concluded , the lender repossessed the car , sold it at auction , and pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saleeven though Kyle was no longer responsible for paying the debt . <h> Dischargeable and Nondischargeable Debt <p> Not all debts get wiped out in bankruptcybut many do . Heres what you can expect to get discharged in a typical Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 case : <p> credit card balances <p> medical bills <p> personal loans <p> promissory notes ( but not security agreements ) <p> overdrafts <p> unpaid utility bills <p> unpaid rent or lease payments <p> most judgments <p> most debts that arise from accidents <p> most debts that arise out of contracts , and <p> any other debt the bankruptcy code does n't list as nondischargeable . <p> The law considers some obligations so important that you cant get rid of them in bankruptcy . For instance , the following nondischargeable debts wont go away in your bankruptcy case : <p> domestic support obligations , such as child support and alimony <p> most taxes ( old income taxes might be dischargeable ) <p> fines , penalties , and restitution resulting from a criminal conviction , and <p> obligations that arise if you hurt or kill someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common debts are listed above , this is n't a complete list . For instance , you can get rid of some debts in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that you cant wipe out in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy . <h> Debts That Might Be Dischargeable <p> Student loan debt is n't usually dischargeable ; however , sometimes it will go away in bankruptcy . The debtor must file a lawsuit called an adversary proceeding and prove certain legal requirements , including that its unlikely that the debtor will ever be able to pay back the loan . <p> The reverse can also be true . Other debts will get discharged unless the creditor files and wins an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy case . For instance , if a creditor wins an adversary proceeding , you might remain responsible for the following : <p> debts for luxury goods or services that you bought shortly before filing for bankruptcy ( or cash advances ) <p> bills that you failed to list in your bankruptcy paperwork <p> obligations arising from willful or malicious injury to a person or property , and <p> a judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loans for Cars , Houses , and Other Collateralized Obligations <p> Debt is " secured " or guaranteed when you put up valuable property as collateral that the creditor can take if you fail to pay . Examples of secured debt include car loans , home mortgages , and many debts for other big-ticket items like appliances . A bankruptcy will discharge the obligation to pay the loan , but it does n't  wipe out the creditors right to repossess or foreclose on the collateral . The bottom line is that if you do n't  pay a secured loan , the creditor can take back the collateral . <p> However , you might be allowed to keep the property if you reaffirm the debt . In essence , when you reaffirm a debt , you 're entering into a new contract in which you agree to pay for the item . The new contract remains in effect after your bankruptcy concludes . In some cases , you can redeem the property by paying just its value in a lump sum and discharging any remaining debt . Redemption is n't available for your residential property , however . 
@@25934205 @5934205/ <p> It is hard to keep up with what seem like daily innovations in social media . With almost every person maintaining some type of social media site , it is inevitable that social media will seep into the educational arena in a number of different ways . Of course , the hot button social media concern at the moment is the issue of students bullying and harassing one another online . However , of equal importance is the question of the type of student-related information that can be posted on social media sites without violating FERPA laws and most districts social media and privacy policies . For purposes of this article , we will explore what happens when a staff member decides to posts to a social media site " bragging " about a students accomplishments in a school sponsored activity . <p> Are " Bragging " Social Media Posts Strictly Prohibited by FERPA ? <p> A high school quarterback completes several touchdown passes one Friday night and his coach posts to Facebook , " I 'm so proud of John . He really played lights out tonight ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , but is such an act allowed under FERPA ? FERPA generally prohibits the improper release of personally identifiable information contained in education records . The post probably contains personally identifiable information ( the coach uses Johns first name and , unless several players named " John " played " lights out , " using his first name more than likely makes him identifiable ) . The crux of the issue , then , is whether this post is actually an education record , such that the personally identifiable information can not be disclosed under FERPA . <p> The good news is that these " bragging " posts are very unlikely to be an education record or the disclosure of personally identifiable information under FERPA . Policy FL ( LEGAL ) reflects the FERPA definition of " education records " as " those records , files , documents , and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by an education agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution . " A students touchdowns and a staff members subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , file , document , or material , and would not be a record " maintained by " a district . Moreover , the student information in the example above could be obtained by any member of the public attending the football game or play , and is , therefore , clearly not confidential . <p> What if the Information is " Directory Information " ? <p> In the last few years , many if not most school districts have taken advantage of the current thinking at the state and federal levels about " directory information " and have adopted a quite limited definition at FL ( LOCAL ) for disclosure to members of the public , on request . But , because of state law in place since 2005 ( Tex . Educ . Code 26.013 ) , districts are also authorized to approve a broader definition of directory information for limited school purposes . Generally speaking , under most districts FL ( LOCAL ) policy , directory information for limited school purposes includes participation in officially recognized activities and sports , and honors and awards received , height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . Unless a parent has withheld consent for the district to release directory information about his or her student , districts are permitted to use directory information for school purposes . Therefore , if a social media site is a school-sponsored site , then much of this information ( for example , certain students being on a particular athletic team or certain students receiving an honor or award ) could fall under the category of directory information used for school purposes . Under these conditions , a school district websites inclusion of such information on a school-sponsored social media site probably does not violate FERPA . Further , most policies require that parents opt out of having their students FERPA directory information disclosed ( they do not have to " opt in ) , but state law allows parents to " pick and choose " which items of information can and can not be released for limited school purposes . Thus , a district would want to ensure that it keeps good track of what parents have declined to have released about a particular child and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While it is not recommended that staff members post information about students to their personal social media sites , it can be difficult to police every personal social media site of every staff member . These types of posts generally do not violate the typical " social media " policies- commonly DH ( LOCAL ) - because there is usually only a prohibition against staff using electronic media to communicate with students about matters outside the scope of the employees professional responsibilities . This would not prohibit staff from communicating about students . Accordingly , if this issue becomes problematic , districts may need to re-evaluate their local policies and/or Employee Handbook to address the issue of staff members posting student-related information to social media sites in greater detail . <p> Where Do Most Districts Stand Today ? <p> As FERPA and the majority of district policies are currently written , it is doubtful that " bragging posts " are prohibited . That said , allowing staff to post about students to their personal social media sites invites controversy if nothing else ( as many districts have likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of activity would be to update both local FL and DH policies , as well as employee handbooks , to include a ban against staff members naming or referring to any specific student on any personal social media sites . This of course opens up a bevy of other problems like , " What if the staff member is a family member of the student ? " or " What if the staff member interacts with a student outside the school for other purposes , such as church or Boy Scouts ? " Accordingly , changing policies in this way could begin to present problems with infringing on employees First Amendment rights . <p> Unfortunately , there is just not a very " clean " way to make a policy against communicating on social media about students , which is a problem all districts are facing . Until and unless FERPA is amended to include instructive guidance on this issue and/or districts revise their policies and handbooks , the only answer is to evaluate " bragging " posts on a case-by-case basis , realizing that they are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

If they did n't  have lawyers , they may not have known to take this step . For those with legal representation , their attorneys may have negotiated with the insurers over the phone . ( Many states require an injured patient to give a health provider advance notice of plans to file a medical malpractice lawsuit , and that notice often kick-starts the settlement negotiation process . ) Either way , our survey showed that readers who sent a demand letter were much more likely to see a positive outcome for their claims : 30% of them received a settlement or award , compared to 9% for those who did n't  send a letter . <p> Effect of Filing a Lawsuit on Likelihood of PayoutsReaders who filed a lawsuit ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as likely to receive a settlement or award as those who did n't  file . <h> Filing a Malpractice Lawsuit <p> Only one in five readers took the next step of filing a malpractice lawsuit against their health providers .

Providers want to minimize costs while plan participants want comprehensive coverage with minimal restrictions or out-of-pocket costs . Federal healthcare reform legislation that provides U.S. citizens with a number of legal rights is expected to take effect in 2014 . <h> Access to Medical Services Not Subject to Dollar Limits <p> The federal government recognizes that U.S. citizens often fail to receive needed medical treatments simply because insurance companies wo n't pay for them . Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , however , health insurance companies will no longer be allowed to limit your access to essential medical care through annual or lifetime cost limitations .

It 's your case , and you certainly have the right to try it , but if your lawyer is adamant that going to trial is a bad move and he or she absolutely does not want to go that route , you are in a difficult position . Let 's take a look at a few options and factors you might want to consider . <h> Should You Get a New Lawyer ? <p> You have the right to get a new lawyer to take over your personal injury claim , but if trial is approaching , it will not be easy to find a new one . Most lawyers do not want to take over a case after all pretrial investigation ( i.e. , discovery ) has been done and trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suitable replacement , the new lawyer might only be able to take the case on the condition that trial be postponed so that he or she can get up to speed , and judges are typically reluctant to postpone a trial for such a reason .

But you hired your lawyer for a reason , and unless you have a concrete reason to disregard his or her measured opinion , it 's probably not a good strategy to do so . <p> So you have the theoretical right to get a new lawyer , but , in reality , you are likely stuck with the one you have . And the flip side of this discussion is that your lawyer is stuck with you . If trial is approaching , a lawyer who does n't  want to try a case usually has only two options : try the case anyway , or file a motion with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But just as a judge will rarely postpone a trial to let a new lawyer get up to speed on the case , a judge will rarely allow a lawyer to withdraw from a case when trial is approaching .

And in order to take an objective look at the answer , you need to admit that your lawyer almost certainly knows more than you do when it comes to the law and the practicalities of personal injury cases , including settlement value . There 's also a good chance that your lawyer is familiar with the judge who will be presiding over your trial , and also with the proclivities and tendencies of the juror pool in your county .

There 's a reason lawyers are called " counselors . " They counsel and advise their clients as part of representation . <p> So if lawyer tells you that , in her opinion , if you go to trial , you have a 90% chance of losing , you should probably take that advice seriously .

If you 're injured while working in Ohio , workers compensation will typically cover your medical expenses , pay a portion of your lost wages , and compensate you for any permanent impairment caused by your injury . However , to receive benefits , you need to follow certain procedures . <p> Unlike in other states , Ohio does not allow employers to purchase workers compensation insurance through private insurance companies . Rather , most employers fulfill their obligations by paying into a state fund operated by the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation ( BWC ) .

Still , nearly nine in ten readers ( 89% ) did n't  hire an attorney , though not for lack of trying . In fact , when we asked about the reason for delays in resolving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was finding a lawyer to represent them . This was clearly a frustrating experience , but it makes sense when you understand a bit about how the system works . <p> Reason for DelaysNearly 8 in 10 readers said their cases were delayed because of difficulties finding a lawyer . <p> Medical malpractice cases are notoriously complicated and difficult to win . Experienced attorneys are familiar with the legal intricacies and procedural hurdles that are common in these cases . They also know how to evaluate the evidence and determine how much you 're likely to receive as a payout ( in the form of an out-of-court settlement or a court award after trial ) . Lawyers turn down cases for many different reasons , from understaffing to conflictssuch as when they have a professional relationship with the doctor or hospital you want to sue . ( Several readers told us the issue of conflicts was a particular problem in their small communities . ) But the most common reasons cited by our readers reflect the biggest stumbling blocks to finding a lawyer : potential payouts that are too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits , and the difficulty of proving that a medical mistake amounted to malpractice . <h> Costs vs . Rewards for Lawyers <p> Lawyers in this field generally agree to work for a " contingency fee , " or a percentage of the payout ( see our article on how much medical malpractice lawyers cost ) . That makes it easier for people to afford attorneys , because they do n't  pay unless and until they receive compensation . But it also means that lawyers carefully screen cases , only accepting strong claims with a potential payout that 's higher than the expenses needed to get there ( more on that below ) . Otherwise , theyd be working for free too much of the time . Some factors that go into a lawyers costs-rewards calculation include : <p> High costs . The day-to-day costs of pursuing medical malpractice claims can be especially brutal . Among other expenses , you 'll need medical experts to prove that you have a valid claim ( more on that below ) . These cases generally come down to a battle of the experts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 ( or more ) in big malpractice cases . Experienced medical malpractice lawyers know how to find and work with qualified experts who will testify for patients . And attorneys might agree to advance the costs and deduct them from any settlement or award you receive . But theyll consider those expenses when they 're deciding whether its worth the risk of taking on your case . <p> Caps on awards . Payouts in medical malpractice cases are generally based on the losses ( or " damages " ) that the patient experienced as a result of the medical errorfrom extra medical bills and lost earnings to noneconomic damages like pain and suffering . Many states set caps on medical malpractice damages . In some states ( like California ) , those maximum amounts havent been adjusted for inflation in a long time . In addition to these caps , several states require that any payout be reduced by the amount of benefits related to the injury that the patient received from other sources , like health insurance or disability benefits . So your award could be cut down significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional medical costs that were covered by insurance . <h> Tight Deadlines for Filing a Lawsuit <p> Many readers told us that by the time they contacted a lawyer , they learned that the deadline ( or " statute of limitations " ) for filing a medical malpractice lawsuit had already passed or was coming up too quickly for the attorney to prepare the case . The time limits vary from state to state ( usually from one to four years ) , and they often have provisions that are n't  all that easy for ordinary people to understand ( such as when the " clock " starts ) . If patients wait too long to start looking for a lawyerwhich can easily happen when they 're overwhelmed with health issuesthey may be out of luck . <p> Have all your ducks in a row .

@@25934241 @5934241/ <p> It has been widely reported that African-Americans may be disproportionately targeted by law enforcement , charged with more serious crimes and sentenced more harshly whites . Regardless of whether one believes that laws and law enforcements strategies and officers are biased , there are actions that African-Americans can take to ensure the best outcome when being investigated or charged with a crime . <p> I was a Deputy Public Defender for ten years . During that time , I represented defendants after charges were filed . Consequently , in many cases , my negotiating strategy was constrained by the charges and allegations which greatly enhanced the sentence faced by my clients . Such large potential sentences , limit the judges ability to impose lenient sentences and often make trial too risky . <p> Since leaving the Public Defenders Office , I have learned the benefits of a proactive approach to criminal defense . As soon as a person learns s/he is being investigated , s/he should responsibly participate in the defense . This proactive approach allows defense attorneys to build a rapport with law enforcement officials and prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakes are too high and the prosecutor must seek a conviction . To even the playing field , African-Americans must take charge of a defense investigation and address any underlying concerns regarding the activity as soon as s/he becomes aware an investigation has been initiated . <p> BE PROACTIVE <p> I recently represented an African-American man who shot another at point blank range . I was retained within a day of the shooting , well before the shooters arraignment date . I immediately called the prosecutor and told him that I had been retained and would like an opportunity to show him why my client had not committed a crime and should not be charged . The prosecutor responded that there was sufficient evidence to convict my client and he intended to charge him .

If an African-American takes a proactive approach prior to charges being filed , s/he will have an opportunity to show prosecutor the weaknesses of the governments case , the reason the equities are in the potential defendants favor and why severe charges will not support any goal of government . In response , the prosecutor will reject the defense attorneys proffer immediately , appreciate some of the nuances of the purported crime and charge less severely or decide that the charges can not be proven and not file .

For instance , the person may be addicted to controlled substances , have trouble with anger management , need to avoid certain friendships or relationships , misunderstand sexual boundaries or have caused a financial loss . It is best to begin to address these issues as soon as possible . If a defendant is engaged in drug treatment , sex offender therapy , or mental health counseling or has repaid the victims of a crime , a judge will be more likely to take seriously the defense attorneys argument at bail or sentencing that the defendant will not commit any further crimes , is remorseful for what has already occurred and is willing to address the concerns of the Court . <p> When a defense attorney tells a client to get into to treatment or find the funds to repay the victim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attorneys arguments for reduced bail and a lenient punishment at sentencing , if the case proceeds that far . <p> CONCLUSION <p> The criminal justice is system is rife with problems .

Public Defenders can not be appointed until arraignment and many opportunities are lost by then . Prosecutors will have made charging decisions , some of which may involve " mandatory minimums " or " no probation " allegations which severely limit the defense attorneys options .

@@25934242 @5934242/ <p> Overtime pay can be a difficult discussion to have when employees are unsure of their rights and how to calculate the overtime pay they are owed . The first question is whether the employees position qualifies for overtime pay . So who qualifies for overtime ? Although most employees in California are entitled to overtime pay , there are some important exceptions . <p> An " exempt " employee is an employee whose job does not qualify for overtime protections because of the type of work the employee performs . Examples of positions that are generally exempt from overtime include doctors , certified public accountants , teachers , licensed engineers , managers who regularly supervise at least two or more employees , and certain sales employees who receive at least one half of their compensation through commissions . <p> To be an exempt employee , in addition to salary requirements , there are multiple characteristics of a position that the employee must meet . However , it is important to keep in mind that just because your employer says you are exempt does not make it true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not automatically make you an exempt employee . Many employers missclassify their employees as exempt , when they really should be paid hourly and receive overtime pay . Therefore , it is best to consult with an employment lawyer to determine whether you are properly classified as an exempt employee or whether you are owed overtime pay . <p> For employees entitled to overtime pay , how is overtime calculated ? In California , the overtime rate is 1.5 times an employees regular hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a work day or 40 hours in a work week . If hours worked are in excess of 12 hours in a work day , then the overtime rate is 2.0 times the regular hourly rate . <p> Keep in mind that numerous cities , including Pasadena , have recently increased the minimum wage and have set a schedule for future increases to automatically take place .

For example , if the custodial spouse must stay home to provide round the clock care for the child with severe medical disabilities , a court may take that into consideration when setting alimony . <h> Public Assistance <p> If your child receives public assistance , like Social Security benefits , or Medicaid , or if they may need it in the future , your parenting agreement should include a statement that requires both parents to comply with the application process .

However , in the eyes of the law , there are typically three types of trespassers , and as a homeowner , you need to be aware of your legal obligations when it comes to all three of them . <p> As a homeowner , you probably need to inspect your property to see if it contains any artificial hazards or conditions that might attract child trespassers . <h> The Undiscovered Trespasser <p> An undiscovered trespasser is someone who enters onto your property without an invitation , and whose physical presence on your property is unknown to you . <p> Assuming people will obey the law and not trespass on your property , you are not obligated to protect such trespassers--as long as you have no intent to cross the line by " willfully or wantonly " injuring them . Acting in a " willful or wanton " manner , on the scale of wrongdoing , typically means doing something that falls somewhere between an intentional infliction of harm and gross negligence .

Unaware of her presence , you back your car down the driveway , striking the ladder . Since your neighbor was a trespasser on your driveway without your knowledge or consent , there is probably no liability for any resultant injury . <p> On the other hand , creating deterrents for uninvited hunters to stay off your property -- through the strategic placement of dangerous hazards , booby-traps , and other devices -- will likely result in legal liability if anyone is injured as a result . <h> The Discovered Trespasser <p> Once you discover the presence of a trespasser on your property , you are under a duty to exercise ordinary care to warn him or her of any particular danger , or make safe any artificial conditions you are aware of so as to prevent any risk of death or serious bodily harm . ( Learn more about the Duty of Care in Personal Injury Cases . ) <p> For example , say you notice occasional trespassers walking across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you are aware of their presence , you likely have a duty to warn the trespassers about a semi-hidden and relatively large hole behind your garage .

Until you repair the cracked concrete walkway , you will need to warn her about the tripping hazard leading up to your door , otherwise you could face slip and fall liability . <h> The Child Trespasser <p> Another type of trespasser is the child who wanders onto your property without permission . Because of their young age , children are naturally playful and curious . But if you create an artificial hazard on your property that lures them onto it , you may be liable for resulting injuries , especially if the children are unaware of the dangers posed by the hazard . <p> Such artificial or human-made hazards are known as " attractive nuisances . " They include conditions such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cars , or heavy machinery . They do not include naturally occurring hazards such as ponds , lakes or steep embankments . <p> As a homeowner , you probably need to inspect your property to see if it contains any artificial hazards or conditions that might attract child trespassers . If there are , you 'll need to either correct or contain the dangers to protect the safety of children who may wander onto your property . If you fail to do so , you will most likely be liable for injuries to the children , especially when the cost to repair or maintain the artificial hazard is small in comparison to the potential risk involved . <p> If in doubt about whether a condition on your property constitutes an attractive nuisance , use common sense and good judgment to make sure children can not gain access to it .

Your response can range from doing nothing to filing your own divorce petition <h> Do n't  Respond to the Divorce <p> There are circumstances in which you could get away with doing nothing . One such scenario would be where a couple has no children , no assets to divide , neither spouse is looking for financial support , and the spouse receiving ( being served with ) the petition has no objection to the reason given for the divorce ( " grounds " ) . If these conditions exist , and the petition requests nothing other than the granting of a divorce , not responding to the petition may not be detrimental , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another situation is where the couple has already resolved all their issues and incorporated their settlement terms in a written agreementdepending on where you live , these are commonly called separation agreements , divorce settlement agreements , or marital settlement agreements . However , not filing a response to the petition would only be a viable option if the petition specifically requests that the agreement be incorporated in the divorce judgment . <p> All that said , remember that if you choose not to respond to the petition , in all likelihood the court will enter a default against you . In effect , this means you wont be participating in the divorce process . If that 's a position you 're uncomfortable with , you should consider filing a response . <p> In all instances , before you decide not to file an answer , you should ( at a minimum ) book a one-hour consultation with a local divorce attorney to make sure not responding wo n't hurt your position . <h> File an Appearance <p> An " appearance " is the response you 'll usually file if you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be involved in determining issues such as custody and parenting time ( visitation ) , child support , alimony ( spousal support ) , and dividing the marital assets , like a house , bank accounts , a business , and pensions or other retirement accounts . <p> In these scenarios , the divorce is normally based on " no-fault " grounds , such as irreconcilable differences ( incompatibility ) or living apart for a period of time ( typically , a year to eighteen months , depending on your state 's laws ) . Because the spouse filing the petition is not alleging you were guilty of bad behavior , there may be no need for you to address the grounds for the divorce . <h> Respond By Filing an Answer <p> If you disagree with representations ( " allegations " ) or any of the requests your spouse made in the divorce petition , you can file an " answer " as your response . Here you can address each allegation individually . Most of the representations in a petition are cut-and-dried , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ages of your children . Almost invariably , its the grounds for divorce that poses the problem . <p> If your spouse has chosen to include fault-based reasons for seeking the divorce , and you believe those reasons are false , you 'll want to deny them , in writing . Filing an answer allows you to do that . Some classic fault-based grounds for divorce are cruelty ( physical and/or mental ) , adultery , and desertion ( also known as " abandonment " ) . <p> Not denying allegations of wrong-doing on your part is tantamount to admitting they 're true . And sometimes the divorce grounds can impact how a judge deals with other aspects of your divorce , particularly child custody and parenting time . But even speaking generally , you do n't  want a judge having a negative impression of you . <p> Note that as divorce law has evolved , fault-based grounds have fallen out of favor in the judicial system . In fact , several states have abolished them , allowing only no-fault grounds . <p> You can also use the answer to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree with . For example , if your spouse is asking for sole custody , but you want shared custody or sole custody on your own behalf , then you will let the court know that you do n't agree with your spouse 's request and identify how you want custody to be shared in your answer . <h> File an Answer , but Add a Counterclaim <p> Sometimes spouses are n't  content with just filing an answer . They may want to file for divorce in their own right . In that case , the spouse responds with an answer and " counterclaim . " The counterclaim is your divorce petition , containing your allegations , including your grounds for seeking a divorce . <p> There could be any number of reasons why a spouse would want to take this route . Occasionally , its just spiteyou sued me for divorce , so I 'm suing you right back . But there can also be more substantive bases . For example , if you believe you 're entitled to alimony , but the divorce petition does n't  mention it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state allows it ) or filing a counterclaim and specifically requesting alimony , to ensure the court addresses the issue during the divorce . <p> Another reason for filing a counterclaim is to guarantee that the case will continue if your spouse decides not to proceed . If you filed an answer ( without a counterclaim ) , your spouse would need the courts permission to drop the case . You would oppose that request , but this could result in legal wrangling that will end up costing you time and moneyand , you could lose . Had you filed the counterclaim , you could have avoided this , because even if the court allows the original petition to be dismissed , your counterclaim would remain viable . <p> Another scenario which would give rise to the filing of a counterclaim involves a legal concept known as a " tort , " which is a legal claim based on a wrongful act that caused harm to someone and would entitle that person to compensation . A typical tort case involves someone injured in an automobile accident caused by another driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrongful act by one spouse against the other , causing physical or emotional injury . Domestic violence is a classic illustration of this . Some states allow spouses to include marital tort claims in their divorce actions . If you live in one of these states , failing to include your tort claim in your divorce action could result in a court barring it later . If you 're the one whos been harmed , but your spouse filed the divorce petition , you should speak to a local divorce attorney to find out if you should file a counterclaim to assert your marital tort.

Generally , in the absence of a statutory exception , covenants not to compete are unenforceable in California . Covenants are generally promises to do or not to do something . Covenants not to compete are essentially a way for a buyer of business or an employer to keep competitors at bay . In this article , we explore in some detail the statutory exceptions to the general unenforceability of covenants not to compete in California . <h> GENERAL RULE OF COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE <h> The basic rule in California is that in the absence of a statutory exception , " every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession , trade , or business of any kind is to that extent void . " Bus &amp; P C 16600 ; Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP ( 2008 ) 44 C4th 937 , 955 . This restriction is applicable to both companies and people . <h> EXCEPTIONS FOR TRANSFER OF INTEREST IN BUSINESS <h> In spite of the unenforceability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such covenant is found to be valid : <h> ? ? Substantial or Entire Sale of Business : The substantial or entire sale of operating assets together with goodwill of business or its subsidiary or subdivision ( Bus &amp; P C 16601 ) ; <h> ? ? Sale of Goodwill : Sale of goodwill of business by a seller who agrees not to compete ( Bus &amp; P C 16601 ) ; <h> ? ?

Case law , generally , has defined such specified geographical area in the above situations as reasonable and not a per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUSINESSES <h> In a merger of two or more businesses covenants not to compete are generally valid . In Monogram Indus. , Inc. v Sar Indus . ( 1976 ) 64 CA3d 692 , the Bus &amp; P C 16601 exception for sales of shares , was held to prevent selling shareholders from competing with the corporation that purchased the shares as well as from competing with the corporation whose shares were purchased . The two corporations in this case were engaged in almost identical businesses , and the court considered such a construction necessary to protect the purchasing corporation from suffering a reduction in the value of the property right it had bought . <h> In another case , the court applied strict interpretation of Bus &amp; P C 16600 and Bus &amp; P C 166001 to find a covenant not to compete to be unenforceable in a stock redemption agreement between a radiologist and a professional corporation . In Hill Med .

The covenant not to compete provision in the agreement provided that , on a " buyout event , " the radiologist would be barred from practicing radiology within a 71/2-mile radius of any of the corporations facilities for 3 years . The court concluded that the covenant not to compete was unenforceable under Bus &amp; P C 16600 , and it did not fall within the exception of Bus &amp; P C 16601 because the repurchase price did not include any payment for goodwill and the covenant contained no indication that goodwill was part of the repurchase agreement . <h> Now , a rather vexing question that often arises for businesses and their legal counsel alike is whether a non-compete clause that does not fit within the delineated exceptions , but is not a restriction per se , but a partial restriction , would pass muster .

Recently , many innovative cities and towns have found ways to increase that revenue stream . <h> Cameras <p> It 's not uncommon to see cameras above or near traffic lights .

If a city or town ca n't or does n't want to raise taxes , the alternative is to cut spending . Sometimes officials may take salary cuts , but in most cases it means cutting back on services .

Tell them about any ideas you have to save money <p> Think carefully about your vote if your local officials propose higher or new taxes .
