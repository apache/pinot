In addition , there can be confusion between the everyday meaning of the words used and their geometric meaning ( e.g. ' similar ' ) . <p> Visualising relationships in diagrams Many problems in geometry require the analysis and/or construction of a diagram , and the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to visualise without the addition of a construction line ; the placement of that line is often not immediately obvious.In complex diagrams sometimes students need to be able to focus on a particular part whilst ignoring others .

Differentiation is instructional design that meets differing learners ' needs and applies to content , process and product . Differentiated teaching provides for a wide range of students . Teachers can cast a wider net by allowing students some control over the level of difficulty that they are working at , modifying set tasks and problems so they allow for more solutions or a wider range of responses and this approach encourages the use of multiple models . <p> Differentiated mathematics learning is most successful when teachers believe that all students have the capacity to succeed at learning ; Teachers will succeed when they Recognise that diverse thinking is an essential and valued resource ; Know and understand mathematics and are confident in their ability to teach mathematical ideas ; Are intentional about curriculum choices Develop strong learning communities in their classrooms ; Focus on assessment for learning ; and Support each other in their efforts ( Maths Solutions ) <p> To learn more about differentiated teaching go to the Learning and Resources sections of the Engaging All Students community website.
