To " sync " means to synchronize your data , so that by entering it onto one of your iOS devices or Mac computers , it is updated to all of them . This saves you having to re-enter your calendar or contacts data from your iPhone or iPad onto your computer(s) , or keep track of which device has the most up to date information . <p> Today I 'm going to look at setting up your Calendars to sync between your iPhone or iPad and Mac . To get started , you will need to create an iCloud account . This is your user I 'd with Apple . It is used to sign into iCloud on each device that you wish to keep in sync and keep track of your App store and iTunes purchases . <p> To create and sign into your iCloud account ; go to " Settings/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System Preferences/ iCloud " on the Mac and follow the prompts . <p> iCloud Preferences on the iPhone and the Mac <p> After creating your iCloud I 'd and password , you can choose which Apple services you wish to keep in sync across your devices , such as Mail , Calendars , Bookmarks or Contacts . <p> iCloud Preferences Mac OS X Lion <p> On the Mac this is done by clicking on the check-boxes next to each service from the iCloud menu , while on the iPad or iPhone , just select " On/Off from the slide buttons next to each service . This determines which data will be " pushed " or updated across your devices by iCloud . So make sure you have selected Calendars as " On " on your Mac , iPhone , and/or iPad , before you open up the Calendar App to create a new event . <p> Apples Calendar app ( iCal on the Mac ) also let 's you determine how your events are organized within your schedule . By clicking on the " Calendar " button at the top-left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed under your Home or Work calendar as defaults , or create a new calendar name such as " Gym " or " Holiday " . The events you create are then color coded to match the appropriate calendar . <p> Selecting which calendars are in sync , as well as adding or removing custom calendars is done under the edit calendars menu . This menu is found by tapping the " Calendars " and then " Edit " buttons from the iPad/iPhone . On the Mac , existing calendars are listed under the " Calendars " button , although to add a new Calendar , first select " File/New Calendar " from the drop down menu , before choosing " On My Mac " or " iCloud " for the Location of your new Calendar . <p> Editing Calendars on the iPad Calendar App <p> *Note that the first time you sync your device , you will be asked to select from either : merging your data together , to replace the data on iCloud from your Mac/iPad/iPhone , or replace the data on your computer from the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Microsoft Outlook 2011 . It is safest to select to " Merge " your data for the first time you sync . <p> While this may cause some doubling-up of information if you have multiple address books or calendars across differing applications , it is usually better to retain all of your contacts and calendar details than to lose them by choosing one source to replace another . You can always erase duplicated details later on . <p> Adding a new event is then as simple as clicking/tapping the " + " button for a quick event , set by default to todays date , or by first selecting the correct date on your calendar . While your devices are connected to a data network or wi-fi , your new calendar events will now automatically sync across them . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342723 @2342723/ <h> How To Fix WiFi Connection Problems in Mac OS X Lion <p> If you 're having any WiFi connection issues ( such as frequent dropouts , slow speeds or you simply cant connect ) with Mac OS X Lion , there are a few things that you can do to troubleshoot and hopefully restore connectivity to your Mac . <p> WiFi can be the most convenient way to connect to the Internet , but its not occasionally without its difficulties possibly problems with your Internet Service Provider , the local access point ( i.e. your router or hub ) , or other technical issues ( hardware or software ) with the Mac . <p> Follow our brief guide below to troubleshoot some of the most common WiFi issues you might encounter with Lion . <h> Check Your Macs WiFi Settings <p> The first thing to do when you 're experiencing WiFi problems is to check and validate your network settings in System Preferences to make sure everything is setup correctly . <p> 1. - Open System Preferences and select the Network icon , which is in the Internet &amp; Wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2. - Click the Advanced button at the lower right to view more details about your network connection <p> Click the Advanced button to open up more options <p> 3. - Under the TCP/IP tab , under most circumstances you 'll need the Configure IPv4- item set to Using DHCP . The reason is that in OS X Lion there have been some reports that manual configuration causes issues ( though this may only be with early versions after the OS was first released ) <p> Set TCP/IP to DHCP <p> 4 . You should also look at the other network tabs such as Wi-Fi , - and check that the network you want to join is shown in the list . Drag the networks into the desired order , for example you may as well move the network that you want to connect to right to the top of the list to make sure your Mac looks for that one first <p> Rearrange the wireless networks into the desired order <p> Its also definitely worth just plugging in a network cable between your router and your Mac , to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even connect to the Internet with a cable , then it points to a broader problem that may not be related to WiFi . <h> Remove and Re-Add The WiFi Service <p> One thing to try when you 're experiencing wireless network problems is to delete and then re-add the WiFi service . <p> Follow the steps below : <p> 1. - Open- Network settings under- System Preferences <p> 2. - In the left-hand side panel , select the Wi-Fi icon and then hit the Delete button ( the small " " icon ) and confirm when prompted <p> Use the " - " button to remove the WiFi service <p> 3. - Once the WiFi service has been deleted , add a new one with the Add- ( " + " ) button , and then enter the name of the new connection followed by Create . This establishes a new WiFi connection with the default settings . Just go through the various tabs to make sure WiFi is configured correctly ( items such as the password ) and try connecting to your wireless hotspot again . If prompted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service <p> Add a new WiFi service <h> Check Your Wireless Router Settings <p> Your wireless router is normally provided by your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) when you sign up to an Internet , phone or TV package . Sometimes however its necessary to reset the router ( there should be a small reset button on the back ) , or even login to it and play around with the settings to use the optimal configuration . Unfortunately , quite often the administrator password is n't provided to customers to stop them changing the default settings accidentally . If you know the password , its definitely worth logging in to the router to inspect the configuration . <p> To get to your router , open a new tab in Safari and enter the following address in the address bar : <p> http : //192.168.0.1 <p> This should take you to the routers login / administration page where you need to enter its admin user name and login password . If this address does n't  work , you can try one of the other default addresses commonly used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you take a look at the security settings ( such as the wireless key ) and inspect the logs to see if there are any clues about potential issues . Every router is different , so there 's not one set of specific instructions that works across all models , but in general a few tweaks can usually help resolve your WiFi connection issues . For example , if there are dozens of WiFi hotspots in the area where you live , you might be subject to wireless interference issues if someone else has configured their router to use the same wireless channel try changing it from the default channel to something different . You can also change the security settings ( for example to use WPA or WPA2 ) or remove them completely , to see if that makes a difference . <h> Try Connecting Other Devices <p> It might seem pretty obvious , but you should always try connecting another device over WiFi to see if its actually your Mac or the wireless network itself which is experiencing technical issues . If you can successfully connect another computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an issue with your Mac rather than the network kit or Internet connection . <p> Also , you should of course try connecting your Mac to another wireless network to see whether the problem persists . If you can connect to another WiFi setup , then consider noting down the routers configuration and setup details and comparing that to your own . <h> Reset PRAM and SMC <p> Your Macs Parameter RAM ( PRAM ) memory can occasionally be the cause of various technical issues , so if you have WiFi woes and nothing seems to work you could try to reset it . Follow the procedure below : <p> 1 . Shut down your computer <p> 2 . Locate the Command , Option , P and R keys . You 'll need to use these in a moment in step 4 <p> 3. - Turn on the computer <p> 4 . Press and hold down the Command , Option , P and R keys before the grey screen appears <p> 5 . Hold down the keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should now be reset to the default values . Try connecting to the Internet by WiFi again when your computer has fully rebooted . <p> Another approach is to reset the main SMC chip ( System Management Controller ) , which may resolve issues related to fans , lights , video and power . If you 've tried everything else and you still cant get your WiFi to work , you may as well reset the SMC , as there are n't  any negative consequences of doing so . <p> here 's how : <p> 1. - Shut down the computer <p> 2 . Plug in the power adaptor <p> 3 . Press the Shift + Control + Option keys and- the power button at the same time <p> 4 . Release all the keys and the power button simultaneously <p> 5 . Press the power button to turn on your Mac <h> Delete The Internet Preference Files <p> You can try deleting some of the Internet preference ( . plist ) files from your system Library folder . Sometimes , corrupted preference files can be responsible for things not working correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files somewhere ( e.g. to your desktop ) as a precaution and then delete them from the Library folder . Any similar files named com.apple.internetconfig can also be safely deleted <p> 4 . Turn your Macs airport off and back on ( just click the airport symbol in the menu bar and choose Turn Wi-fi Off ) <h> Call a Professional ! <p> Finally , if you 've exhausted every possible avenue and still cant resolve your WiFi connection issues , it might be time to concede defeat and take your Mac to the Apple Store to see if they can resolve the issue . Most problems with your Mac should be fixable by the technicians there , but there are of course lots of resources on the Internet that you can also use . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <p> Dude , you saved my life tonight ..

@@22342724 @2342724/ <h> How To Hide Folders Using Terminal <p> Occasionally it may be desirable to hide a folder on your Macs filesystem , either to keep it away from prying eyes or simply because its better not to be able to view some folders that could easily be removed or deleted by accident . <p> Finder does n't  have any built-in ways to hide a folder ( i.e. with a simple keyboard shortcut or from the Get Info window ) , and so the recommended method is within Terminal using the chflags command . This tutorial describes how to hide any file or folder in seconds . <p> The folder specified and all its contents will disappear from view in Finder , but its important to note that the files are still there and have not been deleted . If the filename contains spaces , you may need to put quotes around it , for example : <p> chflags hidden " /Documents/Hide This Folder " <p> Rather than type in the whole file path , its also possible to enter the chflags command and then drag the file or folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . This just speeds up the process of entering the file path manually . <p> Use the chflags hidden command to hide a folder <p> It may be necessary to enter the chflags command as the super user if you 're not already logged in as root . To do this , use the sudo- command ( the " super user do- command " ) and enter the root password when prompted . <p> sudo chflags hidden &lt;filename or folder&gt; <p> The chflags command can be used to change many properties about files . For more complete details on chflags , just type in- man chflags at the command prompt to display the manual pages . <h> Unhide a Folder <p> Once your folder has been hidden , you might be wondering how to view it again . The simplest way is to use the same terminal command with the nohidden flag as follows : <p> chflags nohidden &lt;filename or folder&gt; <p> Chflags with the nohidden option will unhide a folder <p> This makes the file reappear in Finder and resets its visibility back to normal . <h> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unhide a folder , you could open Terminal and type in the chflags command . However , another perhaps more convenient method is to use Terminal to build an Automator workflow . This let 's you create a small app that you can drag and drop files onto to hide , or even as a service to act on Finder items . <p> One approach to create an application is as follows : <p> 1 . Open up Automator and choose workflow- to create a new workflow <p> Open Automator and create a new workflow <p> 2 .

It can be found in the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder , or just type its name into Spotlight ( the Spotlight shortcut is COMMAND + SPACEBAR ) . <p> The main window is displayed as follows . <p> The main window of Activity Monitor shows the list of processes and applications <p> The main window is where every process and application running on your Mac is listed , together with a whole bunch of related details in each column for example : <p> Process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %CPU <p> Threads <p> Real Memory <p> Kind <p> Its possible to view additional columns by selecting them from the View menu , by expanding the Columns option and choosing the ones you want to view : <p> Columns can be customised to show the desired information <p> You can sort the information displayed by any of the columns in ascending or descending order . Just click on the column header once or twice to sort by that column and change the order . There is also a Filter box at the top right , that let 's you enter the process name you want to view , for example if you type " Sky " any process that matches will be displayed ( such as Skype ) . <p> To view the deltas ( i.e. the changes in status such as CPU usage ) , go to the View menu and choose Show Deltas for Process ( COMMAND + SHIFT + J ) . This let 's you view only the differences in status as follows : <p> You can also view the deltas for each process <p> To view each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list found at the top of the window . <p> As an example , if you choose only- Windowed Processes , you 'll see a list of every process or application that has a window open somewhere on your Mac ( in the current space or elsewhere ) : <p> Windowed processes are those which have an open window <p> There are also three controls found at the top left of the window , namely Quit Process , Sample , and Inspect Process . <p> The top of the window has 3 main controls to quit , inspect and sample processes <p> Along the bottom of the main window , additional information is displayed related to CPU , System Memory , Disk Activity , Disk Usage , and Network . <p> The bottom of the window gives an overview of different categories <h> Terminating a Process <p> If you need to terminate ( sometimes referred to as killing ) a process , you first need to identify the process or application in the list . <p> For example , if you want to terminate Skype ( perhaps its become unresponsive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the search filter ) and highlight it . Select the red Quit Process button and then choose- Quit or Force Quit- to confirm as below . <p> The difference between these two quit functions is that Quit performs a " soft " quit which gives the application time to gracefully terminate , whereas Force Quit just exits the process or application immediately . Its advisable to use Quit first and if that does n't  work , use Force Quit instead . <p> Press the Quit Process button to terminate a process <h> Inspecting a Process <p> To view more details about an individual process , highlight it in the main window then use the blue Inspect button . A new window opens which shows vital statisticsabout that process , such as its CPU use , the parent process ( i.e. what launched it which is launchd in most cases ) , the memory used , CPU time used , any open files and the number of times the process has hanged . This is very useful information that allows you to see the status of any process on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information <p> here 's an example of the details shown in the- Memory- section . <p> The memory section gives a breakdown of memory ( real and virtual ) used by a process <p> The Statistics section displays details such as the threads used , the number of ports and the number of system calls its made to Mac OS X. <p> The statistics section gives an more detailed overview <p> Finally , the Open Files and Ports tab shows all the files being used ( such as images , resources and cache files ) : <p> Selection the Open Files and Ports tab to view all open files / ports used by the process <p> From the three tabs , you can sample a process with the Sample button or terminate the process using- Quit- ( note that the quit button does n't  close the inspection window- but actually terminates the process , so remember to close the inspection window using the- red button at the upper left corner of the window as normal . <h> Sampling a Process <p> The ability to sample a running process is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first look confusing , but it let 's you see exactly which functions the application / process is executing over a period of time . Samples are usually performed every millisecond . <p> A typical sample output looks something like this : <p> Sampling a process provides an extremely detailed view of all system calls <p> Why is this useful ? Its a great debugging tool in fact . Consider the case when you 're using an application like Photoshop . You might experience regular hangs or crashes when you do something as simple as opening a file . To diagnose the problem you could use Activity Monitor to take a sample and see what the application is really doing you might find that its trying to make a call to your print server for example , which would allow you investigate whether your networked printer is working OK . <p> There could quite literally be thousands of reasons why an application hangs , but taking a sample can occasionally help you find the solution , and you do n't  necessarily have to be that technically competent . Another reason to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Internet forums who might be able to determine the cause of your issue just by taking a look at the sample output ( since you can save it as a text file ) . <h> Send a Termination Signal to a Process Manually <p> Activity Monitor also gives you a bit more control over how you interact with each process . It uses the concept of UNIX-style signals , which can be sent by Mac OS X to the process . Not every signal will elicit a response from the application / process , but those below ( such as SIGKILL ) are intended make the application terminate . <p> The complete list of signals that you can send to an application / process from Activity Monitor are : <p> Hangup ( SIGHUP ) <p> Interrupt ( SIGINT ) <p> Quit- ( SIGQUIT ) <p> Abort- ( SIGABRT ) <p> Kill- ( SIGKILL ) <p> Alarm- ( SIGALRM ) <p> Information Request ( SIGINFO ) <p> User Defined 1- ( SIGUSR 1 ) <p> User Defined 2 ( SIGUSR 2 ) <p> To send one of these signals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View menu and - select the process from the drop-down list , then press Send . It may not be explicitly clear what each signal does what ( for example sending SIGUSR 1 to Skype causes it to terminate ) but they all pretty much do the same thing . <p> Send a specific SIGNAL manually to terminate a process <h> Changing the Dock Icon <p> If you want leave Activity Monitor open ( or set it to run when you login ) , its useful to change its Dock icon from the default to one of the other options . <p> You can choose from : <p> CPU usage <p> CPU history <p> Network usage <p> Disk activity <p> Memory usage <p> To change the icon , go to Activity Monitors View- menu and expand the Dock Icon sub-menu , or just right-click on the Activity Monitor icon in the Dock and choose the option you want . <p> You can view real-time data in the Activity Monitor Dock icon <p> Activity Monitors CPU Usage icon looks like this when enabled in the Dock : <p> And the CPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all there is to using Activity Monitor . Its a good idea to play around with it to learn the full extent of its capabilities , as its certainly an invaluable tool to help you monitor everything that 's running on your Mac . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342728 @2342728/ <h> 17 Ways to Speed Up Mac OS X Lion <p> Just like people Macs are prone to slowing down the older they get , but after recently upgrading to OS X Lion some users are protesting their machines have aged before their time . <p> Since the release of Lion back in July its been subject to a number of criticisms , while some of these may not be justified , it is difficult to ignore the growing chorus of reports of performance issues after upgrading . <p> It is of course possible that Apple will fix some of these issues in a future update , however until then many users will search for ways to boost the performance of their machines . After researching and testing a wide range of suggestions and fixes I have compiled a list of what I think are the 17 best ways to speed up your Mac running Lion . <h> 1 . Meet the minimum requirements <p> It sounds obvious but check your system meets Lions minimum requirements . Lion requires a minimum of 2GB of RAM and a Mac with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Core i3 , Core i5 , Core i7 , or Xeon processor . - 2GB of memory should be considered the absolute minimum , many people are finding that for Lion to roar you will need at least 4GB. <h> 2 . Clean install <p> The majority of " upgraders " to Lion did so using the Mac App store which does n't  provide the facility to do a clean install . - If you are experiencing serious issues with Lion its highly recommended you try this step . <h> 3 . Repair Disk Permissions <p> The usefulness of repairing disk permissions on the Mac has long been the subject of debate . It is often wrongly heralded as the solution to a wide variety of performance problems . However recently many people have reported that after upgrading to Lion repairing disk permissions cured a host of issues . <p> It may be preferable to run Disk Utility in Recovery mode , Restart your Mac while holding the option key , then select Recovery HD and click the arrow . Select Disk Utility and repeat the above steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running an application that is n't optimised for Lion and causing your system issues . You can see what apps and processes are running on you Mac and their memory usage using Activity Monitor . <p> You can find Activity monitor in your Utilities folder , fire it up to see which processess are using your systems resources . You can force quit individual processes by selecting them and clicking the " Quit Process " button . - Before you start quitting processes check out this great list of common OS X processes . <h> 5 . Disable Auto-Resume <p> One improvements brought to OS X with Lion is Auto Resume , a feature borrowed from iOS which enables applications to save their states automatically . This feature applies to all applications and the finder itself , while definitely welcome addition to the OS there is no doubt that on older machines could suffer from the extra burden . <p> To disable open System Preferences and click " General " uncheck the " Restore windows when quitting and restoring apps " option . <p> You can also use this keyboard shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GGQ - ( alt + command + Q ) <h> 6 . Check application compatibility <p> Many users performance issues stem from software or utilities that are out of date or havent been optimised for Lion . Check that your apps are compatible using this handy App Compatibility Table . <h> 7 . Disable browser extensions <p> For many web browsers are the most resource hungry applications they use . Aside from the obvious tips like clearing the cache and closing unused tabs , extension have been reported as causing slow downs with Lion ( AdBlock in Safari being the cause of one commenters pain ) . Try disabling them to see if they are the thorn in your Lions paw . <p> To disable extensions in Safari : Launch Safari , open " Preferences " under the main " Safari " menu then choose " Extensions " . Select the extension in the left hand column that you wish to disable then click the Uninstall button in the main window . <p> To disable extensions in Chrome : Launch Chrome , open " Extensions " under the " Window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to disable . <p> To disable extensions in Firefox : Launch Firefox , open " Add-ons " under the " Tools " menu . Choose " Extensions " in the left hand column . <h> 8 . Stay Organised <p> With the introduction of full screen apps and Mission Control in Lion , its easier than ever for your mac to get bogged down with unused spaces , windows and apps . - Stay organised and streamlined by closing unused applications , windows and spaces . To close/combine spaces launch Mission Control and hover the cursor over a desktop at the top of the screen , after a slight delay a close icon will appear . <h> 9 . Turn off unnecessary Login items <p> Login items can be handy but they do effect boot up times and often costume resources while unused . This can become even more of a problem if you have Auto resume enabled . <p> To turn off Login items . open System Preferences , click " Users &amp; Groups " then choose the " Login items " tab . - Simply select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remove them with the " minus " ( - ) button . <h> 10 . Force Spotlight to Re-index <p> Spotlight automatically indexes the contents of your Mac in the early hours each morning . But if you turn your Mac off at night Spotlight may not have had a chance to reindex . While unlikely to cause major - performance problems it could cause unresponsiveness and issues while using spotlight . <p> To force Spotlight to reindex , open System Preferences , click " Spotlight " then choose the " Privacy " tab . Click the " + " icon and choose the volume you want to reindex . After a few minutes remove the volume using the " - " icon . Spotlight will reindex the volume . <h> 11 . RAM <p> The role of Ram in system performance really can not be overstated . If your Mac is upgradable and you can afford it increasing your Ram is the single biggest thing you can do to speed up Lion . It does n't  cost the earth either : for a 2011 iMac you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . <h> 12 . Reclaim Hard Disk Space <p> When your Hard Drive gets close to its capacity ( in excess of 90% full ) system performance can dip considerably . OS X cleverly uses your Hard Disk as Virtual memory it can use in addition to your actual Ram . A full hard disk and insufficient Ram is the recipe for an extremely lethargic Mac . But before you start ruthlessly culling your music library of Barry Manilow and ABBA albums you could try a few of the space saving tips below . <p> Remove the unnecessary language files and resources bundled with OS X by downloading- Monolingual . This should- recover up to half a gigabyte of disk space . <h> 13 . Upgrade to an SSD <p> Anyone familiar with using one of the latest generation of Macbook Airs will attest to the massive speed benefits of SSDs . Despite the constraints of the Airs limited Ram and Processor it still achieves blistering start up times of under 15 seconds . SSDs improve system performance radically because data can be retrieved much faster than from traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Macs but if you are willing to get you hands dirty and void your warranty you may be able to upgrade you old Mac . <h> 14 . Preferences <p> Preference files can become corrupt and can cause programs to crash or run slowly . Deleting these files will cause them to be recreated once the application they are associated with is relaunched. <h> 15 . Caches , log files &amp; temporary items <p> Regularly clear out built up caches and log files to save disk space and keep your system lean . <h> 16 . Eye Candy <p> OS X has always had more than its fair share of animations and lighting effects . - However Lion takes this to a new level incorporating iOS style effects and skeuomorphic UI Textures . <p> While its certainly arguable that the performance increase gained from removing Lions animations is slight , the time saved from these effects " playing out " adds up - and makes your Mac feel more responsive . <p> Disable window animations in the terminal by typing:defaults write NSGlobalDomain **34;0;TOOLONG -bool NO Press Enter then relaunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cmd+alt+esc ) . To enable again repeat but replace the NO at the end of the terminal command with YES <p> Disable Mail reply animations in the terminal by typing:defaults write com.apple.Mail DisableReplyAnimations -bool YES Press Enter and relaunch Mail . To enable again repeat but replace the NO at the end of the terminal command with YES <h> 17 . TinkerTool <p> If you are not comfortable playing around in the Terminal then I suggest you check out TinkerTool . TinkerTool has a simple interface that allows you to easily tweak system settings by just checking or unchecking boxes , rather than entering lengthy terminal commands . TinkerTools gives you access to a wide array of extra preferences that have been built into OS X. You can use Tinkertool to simply turn off Animations for opening apps and files , deactivate the Dashboard and turn off font smoothing and Dock transparencies. 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 <p> Nice post . After usage over time period , Mac starts operating at slow speed due to many factors . The above mentioned tricks can be done manually rather buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all these tricks get failed and still Mac is slow .

@@22342731 @2342731/ <h> How to Setup a VPN on the Mac <p> In this day and age , Internet security is more important than ever . Additionally , many people that- travel abroad are frustrated to find that- they cant- access their favourite websites and video services ( such as the BBC iPlayer or 4oD ) , due to restrictions based on the users location imposed by the content owners or government regulations . <p> In these situations , a- Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) may be the most convenient and simple solution to provide enhanced security and allow access to the web as if they were at home . <h> What is a VPN ? <p> Just what is a VPN and what does it do ? Put simply , a VPN allows all your Internet traffic to be encrypted and sent- directly to the VPN servers ( usually in the country that you choose ) and then forwarded to- the websites and video services that you want to use thus making it appear as if your computer is actually in another country . For example , suppose you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its blocked when you try and watch - with a VPN you can appear- as if you 're in the UK and therefore watch as normal . <p> A VPN is also very secure , as it encrypts your web traffic ( such as email , web browsing and banking transactions ) so that not even your Internet Service Provider can easily intercept and decipher it . This- provides an additional layer of security and can help to protect your identity , location and browsing habits from prying eyes , and even hackers . <p> Using a VPN is usually very straightforward most of them involve- a very simple setup procedure on your Mac ( which has VPN- options built right in ) or via an app that takes the hassle out of configuring it manually . Note however , that most VPNs are not free ; they typically cost a small amount each month . Its advisable to shop around to find the best deal before you sign up . <h> Step 1 Open System Preferences <h> Step 2 Add a New VPN Connection <p> In the network window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + icon to add a new VPN connection . A popup window then appears ( shown in the image below ) which prompts you to enter more details such as the Interface , VPN Type , and Service Name . <p> For Interface , choose- VPN from the drop down list . <p> For VPN- Type , use the appropriate one specified by your VPN provider ( there 's a choice of- L2TP over IPSec , PPTP , - and- Cisco IPSec ) . Note that some of these protocols might be blocked by your ISP ; in that case , you 'll need to check whether your VPN supports- any of the other options of course its a good idea to do a little research first to check if your- ISP imposes- any restrictions . <p> The- Service- Name field can be anything you like this is just the- local name that you 'll see- on your Mac and has nothing to do with any VPN connection settings as such . <p> Create a new VPN connection and set the interface , type and name <p> When you 've entered the relevant details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection . The VPN now appears in the list shown on the left with a red status icon ( to indicate its not yet been configured ) as shown below . <p> The new VPN should be visible in the left-hand pane ( but not yet configured ) <h> Step 3 Configuration <p> You 'll notice the VPN in the list of interfaces- it should appear at the bottom of the list , though its possible to drag it up/down to change the order . In this case however , just leave it where it is . <p> In the- Server Address field , enter the server address provided by the- VPN company . For example , suppose you asked for a UK server address , you should enter that one . If you 're trying to access content that is only available in the USA for example , you should choose a suitable US-based server . Your VPN provider- should provide guidance on which servers to use , and normally has a huge selection for you to choose from . <p> In the- Account Name field , enter the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in menu bar option so you can easily access the VPN and check its status from the menu bar . <p> Add your VPN account details ( such as server name and account ) <h> Step 4 Authentication <p> Next , click on- Authentication Settings- and enter the password you were provided with . This is the most common- method , however there are other options ( such as RSA SecurID ) just make sure that you check the option according to your particular VPN . <p> Once the information has been entered correctly , click- OK- to dismiss the popup and return to the previous screen . <p> Choose the relevant authentication- options <h> Step 5 Advanced Settings <p> In most cases , you wont need to alter many other settings unless explicitly told to do so by your VPN provider . However , its usually the case that you should send- all- your Internet traffic over the VPN . To do this , click on the- Advanced- button , and then- make sure- Send all traffic over VPN connection is checked , then click- OK to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web traffic- is sent over the VPN <p> Once you 've returned to the main setup screen , click the- Apply button to apply the changes the VPN is now ready to use . <h> Step 6 - Activate the VPN <p> To start using the VPN , click on the VPN icon in your menu bar and select- Connect- &lt;VPN name&gt; ( for example- Connect ExpressVPN ) . <p> It usually takes a few seconds , but once the connection has established successfully , all your Internet traffic will now- be sent- over the- VPN and- you should be able to access whatever content you like that is- normally accessible in the chosen server location . <p> Connect to the VPN from your Macs menu bar <p> Once its connected , the VPN icon in the menu bar indicates success and also displays- the time you 've been connected in the drop down . <p> The VPN menu shows connection status and the time you 've been connected <h> Step 7 Access the Internet ! <p> You should now be able to browse the Internet as normal . In our case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the UK , while we were visiting- Asia . As you can see below , the BBC iPlayer works as expected even though it would normally be blocked if we werent using the VPN . <p> If any of the previous steps failed , you can normally refer to the Support section of the VPN companys website most of which contain guidance on the recommended settings and also how to troubleshoot if you cant connect properly . <p> Access any content you want even from abroad ! <p> You might find- that- videos do n't  play smoothly this is mainly affected by the bandwidth your VPN company offers ( and of course your local ISP ) , so its important to choose a VPN that has a decent network infrastructure and good user ratings . In our case , we also discovered that once a video was playing in the BBC iPlayer , we could then disconnect the VPN and the video still played probably because the iPlayer only checks the users location before you click on playing the video , and not during playback . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

You can use the workflow within Automator or save it as an application that allows you to drag and drop the files you want to rename @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add the date and time , insert custom text strings , change the case , make them sequential , and so on . <p> Using Automator means that you do n't  need to mess about with complicated scripts , and its also built right into Mac OS X so its by far the easiest option . Besides , once you realise the power of Automator and what else it can do , you 'll be tinkering with it for days automating many other daily tasks on your Mac ! <h> Building The Workflow <p> 2 . When prompted to choose a document type , select Workflow as shown below . <p> Create a new workflow <p> 3 . In the left hand column of Automator , use the search field to find the item named- Get Specified FinderItems and drag it into the main window ( labelled Drag actions or files here to build your workflow ) on the right hand side . <p> Notice the little- Add button that can be used to add files and folders into your workflow . If you plan to run the workflow within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved anywhere to re-use later ) this is where you choose which files to rename . Otherwise , this can be left blank for the moment , as the workflow will be run as an application . <p> The workflow should look something like this : <p> Drag " Get Specified Folder Items " into the main window <p> 4 . Next , use the search field to locate the item called Rename Finder Items- and drag it into the main workflow window . <p> Drag " Rename Finder Items " into the main window <p> 5 . A popup window appears and asks if you want to make a copy of the files or not . If you choose Add- an intermediate step is added that copies your files but leaves the originals untouched . If you choose Do n't  Add , the original files will be renamed and saved in the same folder . <p> Create new versions of the files to rename <p> 6 . If you choose Copy Finder Items , you need to select the folder where copies of your original files will be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Copy the files you wish to rename to a suitable location <p> 7 . The next step in the workflow is automatically added . The input to the rename process is the output from- Copy Finder Items . Six renaming options are available use the drop-down field at the top-left of the workflow to choose the one you want . <p> Add Date or Time inserts the date and time into the filename . There are many different format options available : <p> Add the date and time to filenames <p> Add Text inserts text before or after the filename or as the file extension : <p> Add predefined text to filenames <p> Changes the filename to uppercase , lowercase , or Title Case- ( the first letter of each word and the filename extension are capitalised ) : <p> Change the case of filenames <p> Make the filename sequential- with incrementing numbers before or after the filename : <p> Number filenames sequentially <p> Rename a single file . Note this option ca n't be used for more than one file at a time , as it will give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error . As a consequence , this item can only be used to rename multiple files if you move each file into separate folders first before you proceed to rename the next one . However , this option can save you a lot of time rather than typing filenames in by hand : <p> Rename a single item <p> Replace the specified text with a new string : <p> Replace the specified text in any filename <p> 8 . Its even possible to incorporate- multiple steps in the workflow as input/output to each other . For example , suppose you wish to add text before the output filename and append the date and time onto the end . To do this , simply drag another instance of Rename Finder Items from the list of- Library Actions- on the left into the workflow as shown below . Note that you can reorder any step in the workflow by dragging and dropping it into the correct position . <p> Combine multiple steps to rename files <p> 9 . At this point when you 've chosen all the renaming options , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save the workflow as an application that can be use repeatedly without needing to open Automator <h> To Run The Workflow in Automator <p> Select the files to rename by clicking the Add- button shown in- Get Specified Finder Items ( the first step shown at the top of the workflow ) , or simply drag and drop files from Finder . <p> Click the Run button on the top right of the workflow window to begin renaming . <p> Choose the files to rename <p> If the workflow is successful the Results tab at the bottom of each step displays a small tick mark within a green circle ( and your Mac makes a happy little chime ) you can view more information by clicking on Results . Your files should have been renamed and saved either in the original directory , or it will have created copies of your files with the new names in the folder specified in step 6 . <p> If the workflow is unsuccessful , your Mac will make a rather disgruntled ding noise , and you can subsequently try again . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workflow as an App <p> Your newly-created rename workflow can also be saved as an application , which allows you to re-use it many times simply by dragging files onto its application icon ( the Automator robot icon is always used ) . <p> 1 . From Automators- File menu choose Save and enter the apps filename and destination folder where you want to save it . In the File Format section , select Application and hit the Save button . <p> Save the workflow as an application <p> You now have a handy little application that can be used to rename practically any files and folders on your Mac . <p> 2 . The next step is to run the app drag some files onto the icon of your new Automator renaming app . The files will be renamed and copied to the folder specified earlier , or left where they are complete with the new names . <p> As an example , the source image files as follows <p> The source files to rename <p> were renamed to include the text Chris Writes at the start of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Using Automator <p> Automator can also create a batch file renaming workflow that can be saved as a service . This means that itll be accessible from the Services menu in Finder once you 've selected a file or folder . <p> The steps to create a service in Automator are as follows : <p> 1 . Open Automator from Spotlight or the Utilities folder . <p> 2 . Select Service and click the Choose button to open the Automator main window . <p> Create a Finder service to batch rename files <p> 3 . At the top of the main Automator window , change the inputs to files or folder in Finder- as shown below . <p> 4 . As before , search the- Library Actions- on the left to find- Rename Finder Items- and drag it into the main Automator window . The workflow should look something like this : <p> Set the various options to use when renaming files <p> 5 . Change the workflow to whatever you want it to do such as add text or sequence numbers , the date and time , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show this action when the workflow runs is ticked , which causes a confirmation window to appear when you run the service ( shown below ) . <p> 7 . From the File menu , Save the service and choose an appropriate name . The service is saved in your Services folder at : <p> **29;36;TOOLONG name&gt;.workflow <p> Note that the service can only be removed from Finders Services menu by deleting the service from the folder above . There is no option within Automator to delete any services you 've created . <p> 8 . Open Finder and highlight all the files you want to rename . <p> 9 . In the Finder menu , select- Services and choose the name of your renaming service . A dialog window opens ( as shown below ) prompting you to enter various options as determined by the workflow . When you 've done that , just choose Continue and Hey Presto the files you selected will be automatically renamed . <p> Choose the files you want to rename and run the service from Finder 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can not seem to figure out . How do i set an automator script to rename a file in sequential order into another folder , taking into account what is in the folder already ? i.e. if i want to do the rename one file at a time , rather than a batch rename ? Can anyone help me with this . Much appreciated !

@@22342738 @2342738/ <h> How To Free Up iCloud Space on iPhone <p> iCloud is great : it can remember your place across devices , download purchases , create back-ups and more . The problem is that with all this functionality , the 5gb of free space provided for all users can quickly disappear , leaving you with the option of shelling out or reducing usage . Here 's some tips on how to do the latter , and save yourself some cash . <h> Backups <p> The first action to take when aiming to reduce storage usage is to delete backups of devices you no longer use . To find out which of them your iCloud account still contains , pick up your iDevice and head to Settings iCloud Storage and Backup . They 'll be listed first on this page . Deleting unused backups will save you an easy 1.5gb per device ; you 'll notice that the size listed for the iPhone in the example is a 1.7gb ; huge , relative to the 5gb maximum we 're trying to stick to . <h> iWork <p> This page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content is being saved to iCloud from Pages , Numbers and Keynote . To check whether you need all of the documents you 're currently saving online , it 's best to head to your Mac . If you 're running OS X 10.7 or higher ( Lion or Mountain Lion ) , iWork will allow you to store your documents in the cloud . However , if you back up your computer regularly using Time Machine or a non-Apple solution , you should n't need to worry about documents being lost , and so could consider local saves . <p> If you do n't back up , or if it 's a priority to be able to access all documents at all times from any iDevice , saving to the cloud may be a matter of necessity . However , there are many cloud-based alternatives which can solve your problem while leaving your iCloud storage unaffected , the best of which is probably Dropbox . This app , when downloaded to a Mac , allows the user to save documents to a folder which uploads its contents to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for iPhone or iPad . While accessing documents in this way wo n't be as slick as opening them straight from the Pages app , it may be a sacrifice you 're willing to make to stay under the 5gb level in iCloud . <h> Camera Roll <p> When it comes to hogging virtual space , pictures are the main culprit . By default , a backup will save each and every one of the pictures and videos on your iDevice to the cloud , ready to re-download , should your device get wiped , or should you decide to copy your backup over to a new device . If you 're anything like us , this will mean that Camera Roll is taking up a lot of your 5gb allowance . To stop this storage hog , simply move the slider for pictures from on ' to off ' under the backup options . If you 're worried about losing your photos , you can either enable Photo Stream , Apple 's excellent picture sharing network which will store your 1,000 most recent photos in the cloud separate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac you 've linked up , or go the old-fashioned route : connect your iDevice to your Mac via a cable every so often to copy the pictures across this way . <h> Other apps <p> Within your backup , you 'll find the list of apps whose contents is being saved to iCloud . There may be some in there that do n't contain any information important enough to save : Shazam , for instance , or iPlayer . By turning off backup for these individual apps , you 'll find yourself saving a hefty chunk of space in total : Shazam alone takes up a whole 5.9mb , although it 's saved nothing but songs we 've identified through the app in the past . In fact , deleting backup on this app wo n't even mean we lose this information : it 'll stay on the iPhone , but simply be unavailable , should I wish to restore from this backup on a new device . <h> Safari <p> One last thing : a feature introduced in iOS 6 was the offline Reading List , enabling users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perusal , even when they might not have a wifi or cellular signal . iCloud keeps a backup of these , however , and depending on how many articles you have saved , size can quickly add up . The easiest way to deal with this is simply to delete an article once you 've read it that way , you 'll keep the amount of storage used for Safari manageable . <p> So , do n't despair next time you 're informed that your iPhone was unable to backup due to lack of space on your iCloud account ! Try these tips , and you 'll find yourself with space and to spare . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

Most MacBook users will already be familiar with many of the trackpad gestures , but there are some additional shortcuts and techniques that can help to streamline your daily tasks and routine . This tutorial describes 10 basic ways to navigate around Mac OS X using the keyboard and trackpad gestures only , but its just the tip of the iceberg as there are literally hundreds of keyboard shortcuts and many more can be user-defined . <p> Its possible to perform almost any task on the Mac using keyboard shortcuts alone , and many experienced users hardly ever use the mouse once theyve committed the shortcuts to memory . The longer you use a Mac , the more shortcuts and gestures you 'll pick up ; so much so that eventually you 'll wonder how you ever got on without them . <h> Keyboard Shortcut Tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some basic advice to get you started . <h> TIP #1 : Memorise Common Application Shortcuts <p> Mac OS X supports umpteen systemwide shortcut combinations that are common to most applications . Its strongly recommended that you learn these as they can speed up most common tasks . Some applications use a slight variation on the normal shortcuts , for example in Safari Command + W closes the current tab only and not the whole window , and in iTunes Command- + N creates a new playlist rather than a new window. - In general though , most applications stick to the regular shortcuts or use sensible variations pertaining to its particular features . <p> here 's a list of just a few of the most well known systemwide application shortcuts . <p> Command + N to open a new window , file or other item <p> Command- + O to open an existing file <p> Command- + Q to completely quit an application <p> Command- + W to close a window or tab <p> Command- + P to print from the application <p> Command- + S to save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the applications preferences <p> To view the available shortcuts for Launchpad , Mission Control , Screenshots and other categories : <p> Open System Preferences and choose Keyboard <p> Select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab <p> Select the relevant section on the left such as Application Shortcuts or Universal Access <p> All the applicable shortcuts are displayed in the main window . <p> View common shortcuts across different categories <h> TIP #2 : Create Your Own Keyboard Shortcuts <p> Even though every application supports the common keyboard shortcuts or even implements custom ones , you can make your own on the Mac quite easily as follows : <p> Open- System Preferences- and choose- Keyboard <p> Select the- Keyboard Shortcuts- tab <p> Select Application Shortcuts from the left-hand side panel <p> Add a new shortcut with the Add ( + ) - button as shown below <p> Add new keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard System Preferences <p> When the drop-down sheet appears , choose an- application and enter the menu title of an existing menu item that you want to assign a shortcut to . With the- Keyboard Shortcut field highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and then hit- Add . Do n't  worry if the shortcut is already in use in the application , because it will just be re-assigned to the menu item entered here . For example , you could quite easily assign Command + O ( normally used to open a file ) to the- About Safari menu item instead . <p> Create a custom shortcut for any application 's menu item <p> In the example below- Command- + A was used as a shortcut to select- About Safari . Note that you may need to restart an application for its custom-defined shortcuts to take effect . Safari appears to pick them up immediately without a restart . <p> Your new shortcut appears in the application <h> TIP #3 : Turn on Full Keyboard Access <p> While you 're on the keyboard shortcuts tab , its a good idea to enable Full Keyboard Access . This allows the Tab key to be used to switch between all of a dialog boxs controls , rather than just text boxes and lists only ( the default settings ) . As an example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normally highlighted in blue as the default which can not be changed unless you use the mouse or trackpad to choose another option such as Restart . When Full Keyboard Access is on , the Tab key moves between each option and Spacebar selects it . This technique makes it simple to do away with the mouse completely ! <p> Enable Full Keyboard Access to be able to select every menu option using Tab <p> To turn on Full Keyboard Access , check the All controls radio button in the Keyboard Shortcuts section or just press Control + F7 to swap between each mode . On newer Mac keyboards you may need to use Fn +- Control + F7 instead . <p> Enable Full Keyboard Access in the Keyboard System Preferences <h> 10 Ways To Navigate Without a Mouse <p> Here are a few simple ways to navigate your Mac without a mouse . There are literally dozens of possibilities , so its worth experimenting to learn all the various shortcuts and gestures . <h> 1 .

Access Spotlight <p> Spotlight is one of the most useful tools on the Mac to locate files , applications , emails and pretty much anything else on your computer . Its essential to know how to access Spotlight with a shortcut because its such a handy feature that can help to find any item . <p> Hit- Command + Spacebar- to open Spotlight and start typing for what you 're looking for .

Open Folders or Go Up a Level in Finder <p> Many tasks you do each day probably involve Finder , so its immensely useful to be able to open folders or go back up a level using only the keyboard : <h> 5 . Safari Bookmark Shortcuts <p> To quickly choose from your existing Safari bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar , use Command + the number of the bookmark . For example , if you 've added Apple as the first item and Facebook as the second , - Command- + 1- takes you directly to Apple and Command + 2 to Facebook . Alternatively , technique number 8 can be used to open the main Safari menu and navigate using the arrow/cursor keys from there . <h> 6 . Swap Between Open Tabs in Safari <p> In Safari its often necessary to swap between open tabs quickly . If you do a lot of typing , your hands will always be close to the keys and so moving them frequently to the mouse and back be a tiresome manoeuvre . A far simpler shortcut is- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + Shift + to select the next tab. - Command + T opens a new tab in Safari . <h> 7 . Select Files in Finder The Easy Way <p> To select a file in the current Finder folder , - begin typing the name of the file and the active item will update to match what youve just typed .

This feature resembles the familiar iPhone autocorrect whereby misspelled words cause a little popup to appear below the offending word . It seems useful but it can be intensely annoying at times , especially as incorrect words are changed so fast whilst typing that you do n't  always have time to accept or reject the suggestions proffered . Both the automatic spell checker and the autocorrection features in Lion can be used independently its possible to turn on the familiar red dotted line that underscores errors without having to enable autocorrection , and vice versa .

If we had a penny for every horror story of a user who 's accidentally attached a ridiculous photo of himself to an important work emailwe 'd need a piggy bank . But does the Mac offer a way to change this ? This article will go through ways of doing the impossible : retrieving sent emails . <h> Using Gmail <p> Google understands your terror at the current irretrievability of emails and has come up with an easy solution in its Undo Send addon for Gmail . This is a Google Labs option , so to enable it , navigate to Settings , then Labs . A quick search for Undo Send ' will locate the option . <p> This feature works by delaying sending your email for up to thirty seconds . During that time , you have the opportunity to rack your brains for potential problems with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sent , simply click undo ' in the yellow bar that will appear on the screen . <h> Using the Mail app <p> Unfortunately , there is as yet no handy delay system for Apple 's Mail app , so the workaround we suggest is purely psychological . If you are prone to firing off emails you later regret sending , you could remove the send ' button from the menu bar altogether by customising the toolbar from the View menu . When you 've written an email , then , you will be prompted to save it as a draft before closing . Once it 's in your Drafts folder , you can give a moment 's thought to whether it 's ready to send , before selecting Message Send from the menu bar . While the chief merit of this trick is that it avoids users impulsively clicking send ' , it is n't quite as swish as Google 's method . <h> Back to basics <p> Lastly , one very simple method - though- good as a last resort to stop that awkward email disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ethernet cable . What , people still use ethernet ? ! Alright , then ; the Wifi alternative ( you 'd have to be quick ) is to select Turn Wifi off ' from the menu bar icon . The unsent email can then be edited or deleted from Mail 's outbox . <p> These fixes should save you from email woes for the time being ; here 's to hoping , though , that Apple introduce an undo send feature in the near future . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

Nevertheless , it gives you the ability to make high quality video calls over the Internet , much in the same way that Skype does . In comparison , both apps are actually quite similar , but FaceTime is more tightly integrated into Mac OS X and the interface is much nicer and less fussy . What it does n't  support however is the ability to call landlines and mobiles , and there are no subscription options either . <h> FaceTime Setup <p> Once you 've purchased , downloaded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission Control ( pictured below ) or simply type its name into Spotlight . <p> FaceTime can be found in your Applications folder once installed <p> When the main window opens , you 'll initially be prompted to enter your Apple I 'd ( your email address ) that you want to be contacted on . Enter the relevant details and proceed to the next screen . Be warned you might initially be shocked at how bad you look on camera <p> Setup FaceTime with your email address <p> FaceTime needs to be on to be able to receive calls . Under Preferences there 's a slider to enable it as shown below . This allows you to make FaceTime calls , but even if you quit the app it means you can still receive calls . <p> Make sure FaceTime is turned on <h> Making a Video Call <p> FaceTime uses your Address Book contacts to make calls . You cant however just dial anybody because they might not have FaceTime switched on or they may be on another type of phone . The righthand panel lists or your contacts directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown in FaceTime <p> Select any of your contacts and their details will appear on the right along with the phone number and email address . There are additional tabs at the bottom for- Favourites and- Recents . Click once on a contacts email to start a FaceTime call . In this example , I 'll call my friend " Gary " ( last name hidden to save his embarrassment at being caught unawares ) <p> Click on a contact to make a two-way video call <p> When the call starts , the list of contacts disappears and you 're left with a clean , uncluttered interface while it dials the other party . Note that to use FaceTime , iOS users- must be on a WiFi network ( its currently disabled over mobile networks , unfortunately ) . <p> FaceTime ca n't make you appear more attractiveperhaps in the next version ? <p> Once the other party answers the call , within a few seconds you 'll receive a live video and audio feed but the quality depends largely on your network connection and bandwidth . Thankfully , FaceTime does n't  require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a low delay . Once the call is connected , your own video image is shown as as a small window overlaid on the main display . If you move your mouse away from the call , the controls ( i.e. the Mute , End Call and Fullscreen buttons ) disappear , but fade in again if you hover over the window again . <p> As you can see from the screenshot below , its possible to have a video call between 2 people with call quality at least as good as Skype ; on this call the connection was very stable throughout . <p> Smile Gary , you 're on camera <p> The FaceTime window can be resized or even switched to fullscreen mode . If the iPhone user rotates their phone the display also expands to match the sideways-on aspect ratio as shown below . <p> Two-way video calling has never been so much fun <h> Summary <p> FaceTime is undoubtedly a very well-implemented and slick video calling app which works seamlessly between Apple devices and the Mac . Its not really a suitable Skype replacement as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a great additional communication tool and can really be a fun way to enjoy video calls with iPhone users ( many of whom may not have Skype installed ) . Making and receiving calls is a breeze just click the contacts you want to dial and FaceTime makes the call . <p> FaceTime is very useful as it is but iOS 6 should allow video calls over mobile networks , which should make it even easier to keep in touch with friends and family without having to check that they 're on a WiFi network first . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

If not , select it ( you may then be prompted to enter your iCloud password ) . <p> You will notice at the bottom of the iCloud options there is an indication of the amount of space you have . This obviously depends on the plan you 've signed up for more options can be found by choosing the Manage button . <p> The- Options button takes you to another drop-down panel that shows which apps are currently using iCloud . You can deselect any of them to remove an apps data , after which they will disappear from the list . <p> As far as setting up iCloud Drive on your Mac , there 's not much more to it than that . As long as you have turned it on and chosen a plan ( or stuck with the free tier ) , you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , Apples iCloud storage plans are as follows : <p> 5 GB free <p> 50 GB -0.79/month <p> 200 GB -2.49/month <p> 1 TB - -6.99/month <h> Using iCloud Drive <p> The first place to look for iCloud Drive on your Mac is in Finder . Open a new Finder window and take a look at the Sidebar , as you should notice its icon in the Favorites section . If its not there , simply open Finder Preferences ( Command + comma- or from the Finder &gt; Preferences menu ) , select the Sidebar tab and check iCloud Drive as shown below . <p> Now , click the iCloud Drive icon and- you 'll see what , if any , files and folders are already there . Its likely the first time you use it that the drive is completely empty , however . <p> Because iCloud Drive is essentially just a remote place to store- files , you can as expected drag and drop anything from your Mac into the drive , as well as create new folders just as you would do locally on your machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed save dialog can also be used to select iCloud Drive : <p> Likewise , the expanded save dialogs also show iCloud Drive under the Favorites section of the Sidebar : <p> Whenever files are saved or copied to any of the folders in iCloud Drive , Finder will indicate synchronisation progress by showing a progress bar as well as status text for each file . Notice also that the iCloud Drive icon in Favorites also shows the overall progress , represented as a circular clock/pie wedge in OSX El Capitan : <p> Choose another Finder view , such as- list view , and you 'll likewise see- similar status icons as each file is copied . Additionally , a small cloud icon is shown in the second column ( which disappears as soon as the upload is complete and properly synced ) : <p> Deleting files from iCloud Drive is just as intuitive and works exactly- as you would- expect in Finder . Command + Delete sends the selected files to the Trash , however a- pop-up warning message appears reminding you- that the items will be removed not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iCloud account . There does n't  appear to be a- quick way to disable this warning if you 'd prefer not too see it , however . <h> What About Apps That Use iCloud Drive ? <p> Many- of the built-in apps on the Mac can make us of iCloud- Drive to store your data . Some apps are only able to save to the drive by way of selecting an existing folder , whereas others create their own- folders ( they are , according to Apple , Application Library folders ) - complete with custom app icon . Whilst you can put anything in those folders , they are typically set as the default iCloud Drive locations for their associated apps , and when opening iCloud documents- in Pages for example , you 'll see only relevant Pages documents in its specific- folder . <p> Think of those- folders as app-specific folders that just make finding and saving files on a per-app basis a little more convenient . Of course , - that works on iOS devices too . For example Pixelmator documents that I have- saved in the Pixelmator- folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive On The Web <p> Besides using iCloud Drive on your Mac via Finder or within- various applications , you can also simply visit the web-based version at- icloud.com . Once you have logged in , selecting iCloud Drive from the main list takes you the list of folders . <p> You can browse the contents of each folder , as well as create new ones . There are also simple controls to download or upload files , as well as to delete them . <p> Selecting any file by double-clicking will open the file in the relevant web app , such as Pages or Numbers . <p> Unfortunately , its all too easy to- encounter the situation where changes to a document- made on one device are out of- sync with the- cloud-based version . In this case , you are- prompted to choose- a version to keep : <p> It would be more convenient if- the documents were- automatically merged , but for the moment its still a manual process . Thankfully , the different versions are timestamped so its fairly easy to determine which one is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , its always advisable to properly close a document and its - app on each device where you have- edited an iCloud document , to avoid such synchronisation issues . <h> Summary <p> iCloud Drive on the Mac- is a very- useful feature that- is especially useful if you use multiple Apple devices . Furthermore , there- is also a PC application that you can use to browse- your cloud-based files . <p> Despite some minor technical- niggles and lack of sophistication compared with offerings from the likes of Google and Dropbox , iCloud Drive is easy to use and- will no doubt add more features as time goes by . For people with a Mac , an iPad , and an iPhone , - its one of the best ways to keep everything in sync. 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342757 @2342757/ <p> Interference caused by geographical factors such as hills , or living in a basement flat <p> If you live in a rural location miles from anywhere , its quite possible you might only receive 2G and no 3G at all , but at least having a strong 2G signal is better than nothing . Here are a few things that you can do to boost your signal , without having to follow the famous advice of Steve Jobs to just hold the phone in a different way ! <h> 1 . Disable 3G <p> It might sound strange , but turning off 3G can actually boost your signal because in the UK at least , there are more and stronger 2G signals available than 3G . This is fine if you just want to make some phone calls and send a few SMS messages , but not really that great if you want to do anything else such as surfing the web or sending an email . One major advantage of disabling 3G also is that your battery should last longer , but of course you wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off 3G on your iPhone : <p> Go to Settings <p> Select General <p> Select Mobile Data <p> Turn off Mobile- Data and- Enable 3G <p> Disabling 3G and mobile data may improve your signal by switching to 2G <h> 2 . Remove Your iPhone From the Case ( or Buy a Special Case ) <p> Removing your phone from the case can supposedly increase your signal strength , because most normal cases slightly dampen the signal from your iPhone . Putting your phone on a flat surface without the case will give enable it to get the strongest signal possible . <p> However , there are cases available that claim to actually- boost- your signal , such as those from case maker Pong . We 've not been able to try these out personally , but reviews on the Internet are quite positive . <p> Pong cases feature a cool design and claim to increase the signal as well as protecting you from radiation and they 're quite rugged to boot . <p> The Pong iPhone cases boost signal and shield you from radiation <p> Besides such cases that enhance your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available that boost your Wi-Fi signal only . This can be quite handy if you use Wi-Fi a lot but cant quite lock onto weak signals in your area . Check out the Linkase- series by Absolute Technology they also come in a range of cool colours and retail for about $50 . <p> The Linkase should boost your Wi-Fi signal noticeably <h> 3 . Use a Signal Booster <p> One guaranteed way to improve your iPhones reception is to use what 's known as a signal booster typically a small device that you use at home to increase your signal strength . They work by boosting the radio waves between your phone and the transmitter , or by acting as a local mobile phone cell ( connected to your home network ) and are often called a femtocell . These act just like tiny base stations and can really help to improve a dodgy signal . <p> All of the UKs major mobile operators provide femtocell products . Three UK offers the 3 Home Signal product only if you 're eligible its not available for general purchase but is provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak e.g. if you live in a rural area outside the coverage area . <p> 3 Home Signal provides excellent 3G coverage at home <p> According to their website , it works with up to 4 phones simultaneously but you obviously need an existing broadband connection and a 3G mobile connected to Three ( it wont work with mobiles on O2 or Vodafone , for example ) . You can also register friends and family numbers so that up to 32 devices can use it quite handy if you 've got a group of friends coming over . <p> O2 offers a similar product called the BoostBox , and Vodafone has the SureSignal . Thankfully , Vodafone does seem to sell its version to anyone that wants to buy it ( -100 ) , rather than going through a complicated technical support session to determine if you qualify . You can find out more about SureSignal here . <p> The Vodafone Sure Signal <p> All in all , such products work well and could be the ideal solution for anybody that needs to boost their iPhones signal . <h> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We did say this would include some creative ways to boost your signalapparently sticking your iPhone in an empty glass can vastly increase your signal strength . Having tried this method , I cant really see a vast improvement but its worth having a go somewhere you know has a poor reception . <p> Were not sure how you could really make calls with your phone stuck in a glass , and of course youd need a pretty large one to use the same method on an iPad <p> Can putting your iPhone in a glass really improve reception ? <h> 5 . Use a Signal Finding App <p> There are several apps available on the App Store which can help you find the strongest mobile or Wi-Fi signals in your area , based on crowd-sourced data or information provided by the mobile phone companies . <p> While they wo n't physically improve your reception with the touch of a button , such apps will help you find the best location in order to get the best chance of a decent signal , without having to randomly walk around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot is located when you 're visiting somewhere new and need to get online quickly without racking up large mobile data charges . <p> One such free application is called OpenSignal , which also has a few nifty built-in features such as a speed tester and the ability to share your results to Facebook . <p> Use an app such as OpenSignal to find the best reception 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <p> I guess another reason to having Enable 3G option turned off is that 4G takes over 3G now .

@@22342760 @2342760/ <h> How to Disable Auto Resume in Mac OS X Lion <p> One of the most useful features in OS X Lion is the ability for applications to automatically resume where they left off . This is apparent in applications such as Safari when after quitting and subsequently reopening , the previous tabs and websites are displayed . If the application was in fullscreen mode , it will reopen in the space space fully sized . <p> Auto-Resume is very convenient if you wish to continue working from the previous application state , but it can be rather irritating in apps such as Preview because all the documents that were open in the last session are opened again when Preview loads . <p> Auto-Resume can be desirable in certain applications but not others ; it can cause your computer to seem sluggish because applications can also take longer to open . <p> Fortunately , there are several simple techniques to disable Resume as follows . <p> Disable systemwide for every application <p> Disable per application using the Terminal application <p> Disable once only upon quitting the application <h> Disable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every application in Lion , perform the following steps . <p> Open System Preferences either from the Dock or the Apple Menu <p> Select the General settings in the Personal section <p> Enable the tick box in the lower section named- Restore windows when quitting and reopening apps <p> Disable auto-resume for every application <p> Once this setting is enabled , whenever you reopen an application its previous state will not be not remembered . <h> Disable Resume Per Application <p> Depending on the situation , it may be desirable to selectively choose which applications can resume automatically . In Safari it can be particularly useful , but you may prefer to disable it in Preview and Pages for example . <p> There are two main methods as follows . <h> Method 1 : The Alternative Quit Command <p> Rather than exit an application using the Command + Q shortcut ( GQ ) , the alternative combination of Option + Command + Q- will temporarily disable Resume . In this case when Safari reopens , it shows the default new page rather than reloading any tabs that were open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopen in the same mode ( i.e. fullscreen or windowed ) or space . <p> The shortcut sequence above does n't  permanently alter the resume function for the application . In other words , the next time you exit an application with a regular Command + Q , its current state will be saved and resumed the next time its opened . <h> Method 2 : Change the Application Permissions Using Terminal <p> You can disable Resume for individual applications using the defaults write- command within Terminal . This method should be used with care as its quite easy to accidentally change file permissions and even delete files if you are not familiar with Terminal . <p> Of course , Resume can be turned off for any application you choose . But how do you know which name to use in the default writes command ? <p> Open the Saved Application State folder named- /Library/Saved Application State/ . A simple method is to type this path into the Go To Folder popup from the Finders Go menu .

Note that the- savedState suffix is always omitted when the command is entered . <p> The basic steps to run the defaults write command and disable Resume is : 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342762 @2342762/ <h> How To Share Files &amp; Folders Between the Mac and PC <p> Anybody that has both a Mac and a PC will understand that its sometimes very convenient to setup shared folders that can be accessed from either machine , to save copying files to external media such as USB drives . There are several ways to share folders , and the process is actually quite simple . However , its not necessarily very obvious , but with just a few minutes of setup you 'll be able to share files and folders easily between machines . <p> This functionality is particularly useful if you frequently work on a PC and need to copy files occasionally to the Mac in order to backup automatically using Time Machine . <p> This tutorial some of the basic ways to setup sharing between your Mac and a PC . <h> How To Share Your Macs Folders With a PC <p> One- option is to share one or more folders on your Mac with your PC . The steps you need to follow are detailed below . <h> Create a New Sharing-Only User @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new user account on your Mac that will be used for sharing only ( i.e you wont be able to login with it ) . This is the account that your PC will use when it connects to the Mac . <p> 2 . In the left-hand panel you 'll see all the current users already setup on your Mac , including the current user account that you 're logged in with . Its usually best to create a new sharing-only user for your PC to access the Mac . Just click the + sign- which is located just below the Login Options button <p> Add a new sharing-only user <p> 3 . A new drop-down window appears with various fields that you need to complete . In the New Account field , select the drop-down menu and choose Sharing Only <p> Add the user and choose Sharing Only <p> 4 . Next , enter the full name , account name and password- for the new account and select Create User . Bear in mind that its advisable to use the same account name as the Windows logon account that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you normally login to Windows as pc-admin , then the new account name on the Mac should also be called pc-admin . This just means that you do n't  need to enter the login details every time the PC connects to the Mac because the PC user account and the Mac sharing account details will match <p> Enter the user details and create the account <p> 5 . Once you 've entered the relevant details , the new sharing-only account will be active and appear in the Other Users section in Users &amp; Groups- as below . In this case , my sharing-only account for the PC is just called- roland <p> placeholder <h> Configure Sharing Preferences <p> 1 . The next stage is to enable and configure sharing on the Mac , which is normally turned off by default . Open System Preferences- and then the Sharing icon from the Internet &amp; Wireless section <p> Open the sharing options in System Preferences <p> 2 . In the left-hand panel you 'll see a list of available options . Tick the checkbox labelled File Sharing <p> 3 . Next , turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macs ) access your computer . Click- Options- and make sure the item Share files and folders using SMB ( Windows ) - is ticked . <p> In the main window you 'll see a list of users , so just add the new sharing-only user account that you created in previous steps . Youll be prompted to enter the password for the user this will be the same as the Windows password you use , and that you entered earlier . Next , hit OK to continue <p> Choose sharing options and enable SMB ( Windows ) sharing <p> 4 . Back in the Sharing window , you 'll see a list of shared folders . Click Add ( the- + button ) - to open a drop-down window where you can select the folders you want to share . By default , normally only your public folder is shared with read-only permissions . In the drop-down window that appears , navigate to the folder you want to share in this case well choose the main Documents folder on the Mac , and click Add <p> Choose which folders you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like shown below . File sharing will be enabled , the shared folders will be displayed as a list , and a small green status icon indicates whether its been turned on successful . <p> In the example below , the new user ( " roland " ) does n't  have any file permissions set ( the user names Roland visible below is my main Mac account , not the new sharing-only user ) . <p> The shared folders have now been selected <p> 6 . Next , you need to assign the new sharing-only user with the appropriate file permissions in order to be able to read and write to the shared folder. - Click the + button on the lower right of the Sharing window to bring up the list of users and groups . Find the new sharing-only user , highlight them , and hit- Select <p> Select which users can view this folder <p> 7 . To assign the correct file permissions for the shared folder , click on the drop-down permissions icon as shown below , and change the default value to Read &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 8 . In Finder , you can check if the shared folder is setup properly by opening the directory location that youve just added . If its working , a dark grey strip across the top will display Shared Folder , just under the view icons <p> The shared folder is now shared and highlighted in Finder <p> 9 . The last thing to do is to select Get Info ( CMD + I ) on the shared folder and check its properties . It should clearly be shown as shared , and the permissions at the bottom should indicate which users have access to it . <p> In this example , the Documents folder is set to read and write by my main Mac account ( my short username is just- Roly ) , and also by the new sharing-only user called Roland ( which is my login account I use on the PC ) <p> Check the file permissions on the folder <h> Access Your Shared Mac Folder on The PC <p> On your PC , go to the Start menu- and select- Run . A dialog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP address- ( the network address ) of your Mac . The format should be ipaddress . After that , just hit OK to continue and open your Macs shared folder <p> If you do n't  know your Macs IP address , you can use- Network Utility to find out ( just type network utility into Spotlight ) , and also from the Network item in System Preferences . <p> Alternatively , in Network preferences , click on the WINS- tab to find your NetBIOS Name , which is assigned automatically by default and in my case is MACBOOKPRO-105C . You can change this value on the Mac or just keep the default , but this name can also be entered into the Run dialog box in Windows , for example MACBOOKPRO-105C <p> Your Mac 's NetBIOS name can be found in the Network item in System Preferences <p> Once youve successfully connected to the Mac , your Windows Explorer window should look something like shown in the screenshot below , with a list of all the folders that you 've shared . <p> Open the folders as normal by double-clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other folders onto your Mac . Note that you can also permanently map the Macs shared folder as a network drive ( e.g. the Z drive ) on your PC . There are various options on the PC which should be fairly obvious once youve actually connected to the Mac ( try looking in the Tools menu in Explorer ) . <p> View your Mac 's shared files on your Windows PC <h> An Important Note on File Permissions <p> Note that copying files from the Mac to the PC works perfectly , but when you 're copying files to- the Mac , there may be an issue with file permissions . Any files that you copy from your PC to the Mac may not assign read and write permissions to your main Mac account in other words , after you 've copied a file to your Mac , you cant actually open it to view ! <p> You can solve this dilemma by changing the file permissions on any folders youve shared ( look in the- Sharing &amp; Permissions- section for the folder after doing a Get Info ) . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac account , and apply those permission to all sub-folders and files . Unfortunately , there does n't  seem to be an easy way to set the default- to read and write for all files copied from the PC , so you may need to edit the access rights / permissions regularly , or just create an Automator script to do it periodically . Alternatively , if you set your main PC login and user name to be exactly the same as your main Mac account , there may not be any permissions issues . Oh , the joys of sharing files ! ! ! <h> How To Share You PCs Folders With a Mac <p> Sharing folders on your PC with a Mac is just as easy as in the previous examples . This section explains what you need to do on your PC and Mac . Note that this applies Windows 7 only , but the process is fairly similar for other versions of Windows . <h> Setup Sharing On Your PC <p> 1 . Open Windows Explorer and click on the folder or drive that you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire " D : " drive with the Mac in order to access all the user documents , pictures , music and videos stored on the PC . <p> Right-click the drive ( or folder ) and either choose- Properties followed by the- Sharing tab , - or- just expand the Share with menu and choose Advanced sharing . Both methods eventually brings you to the same screen <p> Right-click the folder to share and select properties or advanced sharing <p> 2 . In the Sharing tab , select the Advanced Sharing option <p> Select the Advanced Sharing options <p> 3 . Make sure the Share this folder checkbox is ticked . You can also set the number of simultaneous users that you want to be able to connect to the shared folder ( the default value is 20 users but Ive set mine to just 2 ) . Next , hit the Permissions button <p> Enable sharing for this folder <p> 4 . In the permissions dialog box , make sure the user you 're going to connect from the PC to the Mac as ( normally , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown in the access permissions with Full Control . If its not , choose- Add and look for the correct user name <p> Set full control permissions on the shared item <p> 5 . Once you 've set the correct sharing permissions , go back up the hierarchy of dialog boxes youve just been looking at and choose OK or Apply on each one to finish the process <h> Connect To Your PCs Shared Folders On The Mac <p> Now that you 've setup sharing on the PC , the next step is to access those shared folders ( or drive ) from your Mac . There are several ways to do this and well cover them in more details below . <p> 2 . In the popup menu that appears enter the name of your PC preceded by smb : //- in the Server Address field and click the Connect button . You can also add your PC to the list of favourite servers by clicking the + button found at the right of the Server Address field <p> Placeholder <p> 3 . You 'll most likely want to use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant login details ( i.e. the same as your Windows login ) . If you choose the option Remember this password in my keychain , you 'll only need to enter the details once because the Mac will remember them for subsequent access attempts <p> Enter your PC login details <p> 4 . Another window appears prompting you to select which volume to mount from the list . In this case , we shared the " D : " drive on the PC , so this is what appears in the list . Choose the desired destination and hit OK <p> Choose the folder or drive to mount on your Mac <p> 5 . In Finder , your PC should appear in the SHARED- section of the side panel , and the shared drive or folder will be shown in the main window . Simply double-click the folder to open and start using it as normal ! <p> Connected to my PC 's " D : " Drive <p> An alternative method to connect to your PC is to open the Network folder on your Mac . The Network icon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate it ( use CMD + up arrow until you see it ) and double-click the icon . You should then see a list of all shared machines on your local network . As shown below , my PC pops up on the list as expected . Follow the other steps ( login details and mount point ) as before to connect to it if you have n't accessed it previously . If you 've already stored the login details in the keychain , clicking on the PC will just open it straight away . One nice touch you might notice is that PCs are shown in Finder with the " blue screen of death " error message on the icon . Cheeky Apple ! <p> You can view local PC 's from the Network icon in Finder <p> Yet another way to connect to your Mac is just from the SHARED section in Finder . Click on the PC name and you 'll be prompted for your login details as shown . Enter the relevant details and click Connect <p> Select your PC from the Shared section in Finder <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . The title bar indicates the user name you 're connected as . <p> Connected to my PC 's " D : " drive <p> Open the shared folder to view its contents . In this case , I can see the My Documents folder and a few others . <p> Note that you can unmount- ( i.e. disconnect from ) your PC at any time by clicking the small eject button- next to the PC in the SHARED section of the Finder sidebar . <p> All the folders in my PC 's " D : " drive were shared successfully 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <p> Great article . I solved the issue of permissions by creating an Apple Script ( with Automator ) which changes owner and permissions automatically as soon as a new file is added in my dropbox folder . Usually after a network scan . <p> The script does the change and moves the files into another folder automatically . It asks me for the admin password all the time though . <p> where " lance " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newly landed file -it makes me the owner of the file instead of the shared-only account . The second line changes the privileges so I can access it . <p> I saved the script as a workflow . I then right-clicked on the dropbox folder itself in the Finder and selected the saved workflow from the " Folder Action Setup " .

Simply navigate up to the Apple icon at the top left of your computer screen and go ahead and check for any software updates . After doing so plug your device into the USB port and see if the problem was resolved . You may want to restart after updating for a clean slate . <h> Complete shut-down <p> On occasion a Mac can just be tired " as silly as it may sound " and needs a fresh start much like a speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . Start by shutting off the Mac then unplug any devices that are connected to the Mac whether they are working or not . Now unplug the power supply from both the Mac and the wall socket and just let your Mac chill for about five or so minutes . <p> Once your Mac has had a decent amount of time to rest go ahead and plug your power supply back in but any devices that plug into the USB port i.e. a mouse do n't connect just yet " even if that port and device was working previously . Once the Mac is running and all start-up applications are done loading go ahead and connect any devices into the unresponsive USB ports and see if this fixed your problem . <h> Resetting the PRAM <p> When ports and other Mac components tend to be glitchy or unresponsive we need to reset the chips that are basically in charge of these actions . The PRAM ( Parameter Random Access Memory ) is one in which we will reset . To do this we want to shut the Mac down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P + R keys . Now restart you Mac and hold these keys down as the Mac starts-up . When this is done your Mac will restart again on its own and once you hear the start-up chime a second time go ahead and let go of the keys . Once the Mac is loaded and running check the USB ports and see if they are working properly . <h> Resetting the SMC <p> Start by ensuring that no applications are running and if they are go ahead shut them down . Now put your Mac to sleep then wake it back up . Next restart your Mac and once it has completely restarted and running again you need to turn right around and shut it down . <p> Now while its shut down unplug the power supply from your Mac and from the wall socket and remove the battery from the Mac . Reinsert the battery and turn your Mac back on .

@@22342765 @2342765/ <h> Moving to a new Mac ? How to transfer all your files without any fuss <p> Purchasing a new Mac is always exciting , but before you can dive in and start enjoying your shiny new laptop , there 's the small matter of migrating everything from your old machine , to your new one . That means transferring all your important documents , photos , music , videos , apps , user accounts , settingsthe list goes on ! <p> Do n't let this admin suck all of the fun out of your new purchase ! In this article I 'll share lots of tricks , techniques and software that you can use to quickly and easily transfer the entire contents of your old Mac , to your new Mac . <p> And , just in case you 're a new Mac convert ( welcome ! ) we 'll also be looking at some ways of transferring data and content from an old Windows computer , to a new Mac . <h> Migration Assistant <p> Migration Assistant is an app that can copy all your Mac 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new Mac over Wi-Fi . <p> Just be aware that migrating large amounts of data may take a few hours , or maybe even overnight depending on your Wi-Fi connection , so before you start make sure both Macs are connected to a power source . You should also make sure you wo n't need to use either Mac for at least a couple of hours , just to be on the safe side . <p> Once that 's sorted , you can start the migration : <p> Make sure both Macs are connected to the same Wi-Fi network . <p> On your new Mac , open your Applications/Utilities ' folder and launch the Migration Assistant app . <p> 3 . Launch the Migration Assistant app on your old Mac . When prompted , confirm that you want to migrate your data To another Mac ' and click Continue . ' <p> 4 . Enter your admin password . <p> 5 . Migration Assistant will now scan for potential sources and display the results . Select your new Mac from the list , and click Continue . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macs . Confirm that the code is the same on both screens , then click Continue . ' <p> 7 . Select all the data and content you want to migrate , such as music , movies and documents , and user accounts . <p> 8 . Once you 're happy with your selection , click Continue ' and Migration Assistant will begin copying all the selected content to your new Mac . <p> If you encounter any issues or strange behaviour with Migration Assistant , then try the following fixes : <p> Double-check that both of your computers are connected to the same Wi-Fi network . <p> Make sure all apps apart from Migration Assistant are closed on both your old Mac and new Mac . <p> Disable any Firewall or antivirus software that 's running on both machines , as these can potentially interfere with Migration Assistant ( just remember to re-activate this software afterwards ! ) <h> Windows Migration Assistant <p> If you 're migrating from a Windows computer , then you 'll still use the Migration Assistant app on your Mac , but you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once again , make sure both computers are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and that they 're plugged into a power source . Then : <h> Migration Assistant Alternatives <p> Although Migration Assistant is usually the fastest and easiest way of transferring large amounts of content , there 's some instances where you might be unable to use the Migration Assistant app . Most of the time , this will be because your Mac or Windows computer is n't compatible with Migration Assistant ( for example , Windows Migration Assistant only works with Windows XP , Windows Vista , Windows 7 or Windows 8 ) . <p> So , what should you do if Migration Assistant is a no-go ? Let 's look at some alternatives . <h> File Sharing <p> File sharing gives you a way of transferring files between computers that are connected to the same network . <p> Your two Macs are now connected , and you can drag and drop files between them . <p> If you want to copy files from a Windows computer to a Mac , then enable File Sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 ) . Next , open your PC ' File Explorer , ' select Network ' and double-click your Mac . <p> Enter your username and password if prompted , and that 's it you 're ready to transfer files from your old PC to your new Mac . <h> Airdrop <p> If you need to transfer a small number of files between two Macs , then one option is to send these files via Airdrop . <p> To get started : <p> Make sure Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled on both Macs . <p> Open a Finder ' window on your old Mac and select Go ' from the menu bar , followed by Airdrop . ' This opens a new window where you can see all nearby devices . <p> Repeat Step 2 on your new Mac . <p> Once your Macs have detected one another , you can transfer files from your old Mac by dragging them into the Airdrop window , dropping them onto your new Mac 's icon and then clicking Send . ' <h> Dropbox : LAN Sync <p> If you 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it provides a quick and easy way of sharing files with other people . <p> Drag a file into your Dropbox account and it gets uploaded to the Dropbox servers . You can then choose who you share this file with , and that person can download the file from the Dropbox servers and onto their local machine . <p> This is a pretty good process when it comes to sharing files with others , particularly over geographical distances . But what if you 're just moving a file from one computer to another , and both computers are in the same location potentially just inches apart ? Involving the Dropbox servers feels like overkill , especially since it adds upload and download times to every file you transfer . <p> This is where Dropbox 's LAN ( Local Area Network ) Sync feature comes in . When your computers are connected to the same network at the same time , Dropbox will look for new files on the LAN first . This allows you to transfer files over your local connection without involving the Dropbox servers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sync , download the Dropbox app to your old and new computer and make sure you 're logged into the same account on both . Note , if you use multiple routers to extend your network , then you 'll need to connect to the same network and the same router on both computers , in order to use LAN Sync . <p> Then , all you need to do open the Dropbox app on your old machine and drag all the files you want to transfer into the Dropbox app . Switch to your new Mac and open the Dropbox app all your files should be there , ready for you to drag onto your new Mac . <p> Depending on the number and size of the files , you may still experience some lag , but one thing 's for sure : transferring your files via LAN Sync will be significantly faster than involving the Dropbox servers . <h> Cloud Services <p> There 's no shortage of cloud services out there , and although most were designed to provide storage and backup for your most important files , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one machine to another . <p> Just upload a file to your cloud account of choice , then log into this account on your new computer and that file will be there ready and waiting for you to download to your new Mac . <p> The major drawback is that once again you 're relying on external servers , which means there 's going to be an upload and a download time for every file you transfer via this method . For this reason , you 'll typically only want to use this method for transferring a small number of files . <p> If you 're transferring files between Macs , then chances are you already have an iCloud account . To use Apple 's iCloud Drive service , open a Finder ' window on your old Mac and select Go &gt; iCloud Drive ' from the menu bar . You can then drag your files into the window that appears . <p> On your new Mac , make sure you 're logged into the same iCloud account , then open the Finder and select Go &gt; iCloud Drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available , ready for you to drag into an appropriate location on your new Mac . <h> Resilio Sync <p> If you 're not a Dropbox fan , then you may want to try Resilio Sync ; an app that let 's you share folders between MacOS , Windows and Linux machines . You can download Resilio Sync for free , or purchase the pro version which includes some additional features . <p> To share a folder via Resilio Sync , install the app on both your old computer and your new one . Launch the app , enter a username and then click Get Started . ' Repeat this process for both computers . <p> On your old computer , click Resilio Sync 's Add Folder ' option and then select the folder you want to share . <p> You 'll need to share the link to this folder with your new Mac , which you can either do via email or by copying the link to your clipboard , and then pasting it into the location of your choice . <p> Once you have your link , launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little arrow icon , followed by Enter a key or link . ' <p> Paste the link into the Manual connection ' box that appears and then click Next , ' followed by Connect . ' You can now access this folder on your new Mac . <p> Rinse and repeat for every folder you want to transfer . <h> External Drive <p> There 's a common theme to every method we 've discussed so far : they all require an active Internet connection . But what if you do n't have easy access to the Internet ? Maybe your current connection is slower than you 'd like , which makes transferring a large amount of content out of the question , or perhaps you 're on a capped Internet allowance , and do n't want to risk running up a huge bill ? <p> Whatever the reason , if you ca n't transfer files over the Internet then you can always move them the old-fashioned way , using an external hard drive . Simply connect the drive to your old computer , copy all the content across , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files to their new home . Simple but effective and with no Internet required ! 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342769 @2342769/ <h> Mac Slow to Empty Trash ? <p> Is your Mac taking forever to empty the trash ? Well the reason for this could be down to one simple hidden setting ; Secure Empty trash has been turned on by default . Before explaing how to configure this setting let me start by explaining what it is and how it works . <p> Most people believe that when they have deleted a file it is removed from the computers hard drive permanently , unfortunately it is n't quite as simple as that . <p> Instead of the file being destroyed in many cases it is just the index that remembers the location of the files data that is erased , which leaves the actual data still salvageable by some data recovery programs . Secure empty trash is a utility that 's built into Mac OS X that attempts foils data recovery methods by repeatedly writing over the blocks the deleted files occupied . A side effect of this security measure is that it much much slower to empty trash . <p> 1 . Go to the Finder menu and choose preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2. choose advanced from the top menu . <p> 3 . Untick the Empty Trash securely option . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 <p> Yes it will leave things insecure , since they are technically still on your drive , but when all you are trying to delete are some images and text files , secure emptying your trash is over kill . You mostly want speed over security . If you are deleting , for example , a 401k PDF , you might want secure empty trash on . For the most part , the faster empty trash is better .

@@22342774 @2342774/ <h> Making Sense of Apple TVs Photo Slideshow Screensaver <p> The Apple TV/iPhoto screensaver is always a crowd pleaser at my house when we have guests . I 'd like to say its because of my incredible photographic skills , but its more likely just the fun of viewing 10+ years in snapshots . My Apple TV serves as my home entertainment system so whenever music is playing , so is the slideshow . Just recently , I decided to clean up my shared photo library and create a custom slideshow for the Thanksgiving guests that were visiting from out of town this year . I was quite surprised to find out that : 1 ) I did n't  have any idea how Apple TV displayed an iPhoto album and , 2 ) after searching the internet for guidance , I discovered that I was not the only one confused about it . <h> iPhoto Libraries Through iTunes <p> After nearly a year of enjoying the slideshow on my new HD TV , it was n't until I created a custom album and tried to view it , that I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings as I thought I had . Oddly , though the photo album is created and managed within iPhoto , the configuration requires- iTunes- which acts as an- intermediary between the library you create and the way Apple TV displays it . <p> Let 's step through the setup and see if we can clear up some confusion : <h> The SlideShow Album <p> I wanted to display only photos from this year , so I chose New Smart Album- from the- File- menu and used theDate &gt; is after option and typed in 1/1/2012 . I named the album- Apple TV Slideshow- but you can create any name you like . <p> Also , while you 're in iPhoto verify that your album will be shared . I recommend sharing the specific album so that Apple TV will use only those photos for the screensaver ( see below ) . <p> At this point you might be thinking that were all configured and its time to go to your television and crank up the Apple TV . Just like me , you would be wrong . <h> iTunes Photo Sharing Preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the- Advanced- menu , select Choose Photos to Share - you 'll see something like this : <p> Since iTunes- is the app that speaks directly to the Apple TV , - by selecting your custom-made album from the list and checking the appropriate box , the Apple TV- will be able to find it on the network . <p> Finally its time to move to your television and , in the Apple TV interface go to : - Settings &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Choose Photos &gt; Computers select your shared library &gt; Albums select the name of your custom album. - To test your slide show , click your way back to the main screen and wait until the screen saver starts ( 5 minutes by default but can be changed in Settings ) . <h> Tweeking the Slide Show <p> There are two main advantages to this setup : <p> The slide show album can be created , managed and shared from any computer on your network . You may find this to be a good dedicated task for that old Mac Mini that you could n't get yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac Mini- Server as a Time Machine backup and since its always powered up , and always connected to the network , its a perfect computer to store and share photos from . <p> Any changes you make to your slideshow album will take effect next time Apple TV loads the shared library . So as you run through the show , its a simple matter to make final edits to the shared album in preparation of the live performance . <p> As I said before , the setup is confusing to many and is something that Apple will hopefully simplify with future updates . Fortunately , once its understood and configured , its easy , if a little time consuming , to manage . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 <p> Chris your comments are great but looking for something more up to date .

@@22342776 @2342776/ <h> Troubleshooting Mac Crashes and Freezes <p> The Mac has a reputation for reliability and ease of use , but crashes and freezes do in fact happen from time to time either due to performance-related issues or software bugs . <p> It can be a nasty surprise when your Mac temporarily freezes , or worse still crashes completely ( thankfully that 's a very rare occurrence ) , and you might start to wonder whether its time to upgrade your machine . There are many things you can do however before such drastic steps are necessary . <h> Reasons Your Mac Can Crash <p> Some of the main reasons that Macs may freeze or crash are : <p> Software bugs and incompatibilities <p> Not enough system memory for applications to run <p> Resource-intensive applications that heavily use the CPU <p> Too many applications open at once using up a lot of memory <p> Applications competing for simultaneous disk access and other resources <h> Types of Crashes and Freezes <p> There are usually two types of issues : <p> Application crashes/freezes , which are typified by the appearance of the multi-coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death ( SBBOD ) , or an application-specific error message saying it has unexpectedly quit .

In these cases there 's very little that you can do once the problem occurs except force a restart ( hold down the power key for a few seconds ) . If you have already set your Mac to restart automatically when an unrecoverable system freeze occurs ( in the Energy Saver control panel in System Preferences ) it should restart by itself in such circumstances <p> Your Mac is able to automatically restart when it freezes <h> How To Avoid Crashes and Freezes <p> There are a few basic precautions that you can follow to minimise the chances of crashes , freezes and other slowdowns that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly obvious but its surprising just how many people neglect to keep their computer ship-shape . Over time , the issues just tend to get worse so its wise to keep on top of such activities . <p> It may also be worth doing a quick hardware check to verify that everything is in working order as follows : <p> From the Apple menu choose About This Mac <p> Click on the More Info button <p> Choose- System Report to view- the status of all your hardware <p> This will highlight any hardware issues that may be contributing to system problems . Also in Disk Utility , you can check the S.M.A.R.T . status of your hard disk , which will highlight any potential problems . A failing hard disk would likely contribute to system freezes and crashes . <h> Keep Your OS and Apps Up To Date <p> Its highly recommended that you ensure Mac OS and all your applications are up to date , because regular updates should fix critical performance , security and compatibility flaws in Mac OS and your apps . Thankfully , Macs check for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily obtain the most recent versions of their apps . <p> Make sure your Mac software is up to date <h> Install More System Memory <p> Insufficient system RAM in your Mac will cause applications to run slowly as your computer tries to free up the memory space it needs . This is one of the most common causes of system freezes , but the computer usually resumes without a catastrophic failure . Adding more system memory is one of the best things that you can upgrade , giving your Mac the best chance of performing well . It will also allow you to open more simultaneous applications without noticing any slowdown . <h> Perform Regular Housekeeping <p> Your Mac will generally run OK by itself with few serious issues , but when applications or the OS itself starts to freeze or crash its recommended that you invest a little time in sensible housekeeping duties . <p> A few activities you might consider are : <p> Defragment your hard disk , especially if you use massive files such as video .

This also gives a chance for daemons and other background system processes to reinitialise , which can sometimes resolve any issues . <p> You do n't  need to restart your Mac every day , but once a week seems like a sensible compromise . Note that starting a computer actually increases the strain and wear and tear on its components when they transition from an unpowered to fully powered state , so its probably a good habit to leave your computer in sleep mode rather than turning it off completely ( and itll be ready to use more quickly ) . <h> Free Up Some Hard Disk Space <p> Macs do n't  like operating with hardly any free disk space , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

From this point onwards , any items you add to your Documents folder or Desktop will automatically sync to your iCloud account . <h> Disabling Optimize Mac Storage <p> As already mentioned , Optimize Mac Storage ' automatically removes files and folders from your local Desktop and Documents once storage starts to get low .

@@22342778 @2342778/ <h> 5 of the Best Notification Centre Widgets for OS X Yosemite <p> Apple has enabled developers to create apps that also include " Widget " extensions which- populate the Today screen section of the Notification Centre on your Mac . <p> In the past , the Notification centre was n't really that useful , but now its much more- closely aligned with the iOS version because all your important information is displayed , in addition to any custom apps that you want to include . <h> How to choose widgets <p> Before we list our favourite- widgets , here 's a quick recap of how to choose which ones- you want to see . <p> First of all , slide the Notification Centre out from the side of your screen by using two fingers on the trackpad just swipe from off the right edge ( if you have kept the default gestures ) towards the centre , and the Today screen should appear as shown below . <p> Then tap on the Edit button , which I have highlighted in red in the screenshot below . <p> Slide out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once you have clicked Edit the list of installed widgets is shown- on the right hand side . Use the green " + " button to add items from the right into the main list , and use the little grab handles ( horizontal bars to the right of the widgets title ) - to rearrange them up or down as you wish . You will notice that there are some built-in widgets already populated , such as Reminders , Weather and Social . <p> Choose whichever widgets you want to appear in the notification centre . <p> Likewise , you can remove any widgets from the list by using the red- " - " button . Note that this does n't  actually uninstall the items from your computer , as theyll just stay in the unused list until you add them again . <p> Once you are finished , either click the Done button or just slide the Notification Centre back in again ( which has the same effect ) . <p> Once installed , Notification Centre widgets appear in your apps folder and also in Launchpad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal app if you want to . <h> The best Notification Centre widgets <p> There 's already a small but growing- decent selection of- widgets available on the App Store for- Yosemite , so here 's our rundown ( in no particular order ) of the best ones <h> 1 . Monity <p> Monity is a system monitor tool that that- provides important at-a-glance system information in categories such as System , Memory , Network and Battery . Installation is very quick , and the- main app launches with instructions showing how to- enable it ( similar to I have already described above ) . <p> For anyone that prefers not to have System Monitor open all the time and does n't  like the old style system monitoring tools that would place an icon in your menu bar , its incredibly useful to have all the stats available right in Notification Centre . When using apps in full screen mode , its also handy just to be able to slide out the Today screen to view the info . <p> Once you 've opened Notification centre to view- Monity , you can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which categories you want to show ( and the order ) , then click Done to proceed : <p> Choose which categories you want to enable . <p> The app can also be launched in standalone mode too , as shown below . Its essentially the same information , so in our view its more convenient to use the app solely within Notification Centre . <p> Monity also works as a standalone app . <p> Note that there is a similar app in the App Store called iStat Mini , but it does n't  have nearly as detailed system data , and some users have complained that its inaccurate . Currently , we prefer Monity due to the extent of information available . <h> 2 . Deliveries <p> Deliveries is a really convenient app- to track all of your packages something that is particularly useful around Christmas time when you might be waiting for delivery of lots of items . <p> Deliveries is a proper , standalone app as well as a Widget , and it- displays a summary of all your shipments and also counts down the days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map ) , or just view the shipping companys web page . <p> Check deliveries of all those Christmas presents from Notification Centre . <p> Thankfully , all the main delivery services are support such as UPS , DHL , FedEx , Royal Mail and many more note that not all of these are supported in every country . <p> The Notification Centre widget presents a very nice summary of each item , and the whole thing synchronises using iCloud to- the iPhone and iPad apps , if you have them installed . <p> There 's also a main app that you can use to track everything . <p> There is another Widget called Parcel Delivery Tracking in the App Store . It offers similar functionality but is free ( with options to add push notifications as an in-app purchase ) , but in our view Deliveries is the better app as it has maps built in and the interface- is more attractive . <h> 3 . Battery Diag <p> For anyone that has a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro , its always useful being able to monitor your battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps that provides a very useful summary and can be accessed from the menu bar . <p> here 's the summary of Battery Diag its very well designed with clear information . <p> There is a quick battery overview with a very well designed panel with important health and status information concerning your battery , such as the charge percent and time in the menu bar , as well as several different themes . <p> Besides the menu bar app itself , its all shown in the Notification Centre as well , so its quickly accessible even when you 're in full screen apps . <p> Battery Diag has a rather attractive battery summary in Notification Centre . <h> 4 . Wunderlist <p> Wunderlist is basically a list manager for almost anything from shopping lists to your Christmas presents . The- great thing about the app is how quickly and seamlessly any changes you make are synchronised with all your other devices its all very snappy indeed . <p> Make tasks and lists like you 've never created before <p> When you open the Mac , there 's a 2-column user interface with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-do list on the right side , which shows all the items associated with the tasks youve selected . <p> There are also some built-in default lists which can be configured in the Preferences section , such as Today , Completed , and several more. - You might think that Apples own Reminders app is good enough , but once you 've tried Wunderlist you 'll wonder how you ever managed without it . <p> All these lists and- activities are nicely displayed in Notification Centre , as shown below . <p> An avid Wunderlist user ? Get all your lists in one convenient place in the Today view . <h> 5 . Exchange Rates <p> If you 're anything like us , having quick access to the latest exchange rates is always useful when you 're filling in expenses claims or just want to know the best rates before you travel abroad . There are so many websites out there ( such as xe.com ) that its sometimes hard to know what to use , - and sometimes you just want a simple list of the rates you 're interested in . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency calculator that stays in the menu bar always available and always up to date . Everything can be done with keyboard shortcuts , so you can easily convert- between currencies without launching another application . <p> Your favourite currencies , once configured in the app , can be added to Notification Centre so that they 're always just a swipe away . <p> Keep all your favourite currencies to hand in the Today screen . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342782 @2342782/ <h> How To Change File Permissions Using The Terminal <p> It can sometimes be necessary to change file and folder permissions on your Mac , usually because you want to restrict access to certain users and groups . <p> Even though its possible to set the file permissions using Finder , Terminal gives you slightly more control , and of course can also be used in Automator scripts for a little more flexibility . This article shows you how to change file permissions on files just using Terminal . If you are new to using the OSX Terminal , I highly recommend the Macintosh Terminal Pocket Guide by Daniel J. Barrett as a great starting point . <h> About Permissions <p> File permissions permit users different types of permissions to read and write files . For example , its possible to set read only access to files and folders so that they ca n't be changed or deleted by mistake . You might even want to delete all permissions for a particular user so that the file can not even be opened ( though it will still be visible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Permissions are usually assigned per User , Group , or- Others and may have attributes such as read , write , and execute . Through Terminal , you have a lot of control over permissions , but at a basic level you can set them in Finder as follows : <p> 3 . Add or delete user names ( under the Name column ) and choose the permissions you want ( under the Privilege column ) <p> Now that you know how to edit permissions in Finder , read on to find out how it can be done in Terminal . <p> Set user permissions in Finder 's Info panel <h> How To View File Permissions <p> In this example well use a temporary folder called My Folder- on which to demonstrate the various file permissions options . <p> 1 . Open Terminal ( type Terminal into Spotlight or open from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder ) . A terminal window should open , but if not you can use CMD + N to open a new one or just choose New Window from the Shell menu. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you enter commands ) is labelled with the name of your Mac , the current folder and your user name . For example : <p> Rolys-MacBook-Pro : roly$ <p> 2 . Navigate to the folder where the file , folder or application you want to change resides . At the command prompt , use the cd- command ( which means change directory ) by typing in the text indicated below in bold followed by the Enter/Return key . <p> Rolys-MacBook-Pro : roly$ cd " work/chris writes " <p> Note that you will need to use quotes around filenames only if the item you want to edit contains a space , as it does in this case . <p> 3 . Inspect the current file permissions by typing in the- ls- command with the -l- option to show in the long format , for example : <p> Rolys-MacBook-Pro : roly$ ls -l <p> You should see the list of files in the current directory along with all the relevant file permissions for each item in the directory , as shown below . In this case Ive actually used the - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current ) and " .. " ( upper level ) folders , but its not necessary . <p> List the properties of files in the current directory <p> In the leftmost column , the file permissions for each item are listed . You 'll notice that the item My Folder ( the last item in the list ) has the permissions drwxr-xr-x . The first item " d " in these permissions indicates its a directory rather than a file ( but the same principles apply ) . The subsequent 9 items are split into three flags ( read , write and execute ) for Users , Groups , and Others and can take the values " r " ( read ) , " w " ( write ) , " x " ( execute ) or " " ( unset ) . <p> Its important to realise that Groups- usually means the group to which the owner of the file belongs to , such as administrators or staff , while Others just means everyone else such as other people that have regular user accounts on your Mac . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , write and execute is enabled for the current user , but nothing for anyone else <p> drw-rr means that its a directory and read and write is enabled for the current user , read access for the Group , and read only access for other users ( i.e. they cant write to the file ) <h> How To Change File Permissions <p> The next step is to actually change the file permissions to whatever you want . The chmod- command is the easiest way to do this . It has hundreds of different options ( type man chmod- in Terminal to view its help files ) , but well concentrate on the simplest ones in this tutorial . <p> The chmod command runs in two modes absolute and symbolic mode . The absolute mode uses an octal number with various values that can be combined to set many of the different read , write and execute permissions at once . This mode is only recommended for advanced users , but if you 're using chmod regularly you 'll get to know the different codes and might find it more convenient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is rather more human-readable . To change the file permissions on a file , you need to specify the category ( User , Group , Others , or all three ) , the type of operation ( e.g. add permissions , delete permissions , clear permissions , or use the defaults ) , and the permissions themselves ( read , write , or execute ) . <p> The folder I created earlier called- My Folder- has the permissions- drwxr-xr-x which means : <p> User : rwx ( read , write and execute ) <p> Group : r-x ( read and execute ) <p> Others : r-x ( read and execute ) <p> Here are a few examples of adding and removing permissions from my folder . <h> Example 1 : Set Read , Write and Execute For User , Groups and Others <p> In this case , at the command prompt type chmod ugo+ rwx " My Folder " then hit Enter , - followed by ls -l- to view the new permissions : <p> Adding read , write and execute permissions to a folder <p> Instead of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " option which sets permissions for users , groups and others as follows : <p> chmod a+rwx &lt;filename&gt; <h> Example 2 : Remove Write and Execute Permissions For Groups and Others <p> At the command prompt type chmod go-wx " My Folder " - followed by Enter then the- ls -l- command to view the files and permissions for every item in the current folder : <p> Removing write and execute permissions for Groups and Others <h> Example 3 : Remove all Permissions For Groups <p> There 's another option for chmod- which is to reset ( i.e. set to unset ) file permissions for Users , Groups or Others using the " = " option . <p> To reset all the permissions for Groups , just type chmod g= " filename " . In my example , this is how it looks : <p> Reset permissions for Groups on the folder <h> Example 5 : Change Permissions on Multiple Files <p> Changing permissions is simple enough using the examples already described , but usually you 'll want to change permissions on more than one item . Thankfully , chmod can act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text files that have a txt- extension . Simply combine the chmod command with the appropriate file list filter , such as : <p> chmod go+wx *txt <p> This enables write and execute permissions for Groups and Others to all text files in the current directory . <p> Change permissions on multiple files simultaneously <h> More Advanced Scenarios <p> Changing the file permissions is relatively straightforward , and there are lots of combination commands that can be used together for more advanced use cases . Its definitely worth reading the user manual ( type man chmod ) to view the complete list of its capabilities . Once you start playing around with file permissions , you could even build chmod commands into Automator scripts , for example to run a shell command that contains chmod directives . <p> There are also several related commands , notably chown- which changes the ownership of files and folders for example you might want to change the ownership of a file to the administrator user . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 2 Comments <p> Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS software I could no longer see my external hard drive in finder although it was visible in disk utility .

@@22342795 @2342795/ <h> Troubleshooting Memory Usage Problems in OS X Lion <p> Every operating system needs a decent amount of free memory to function properly , and without a sufficient amount applications are prone to run more slowly and your Mac will seem more sluggish . Whilst Mac OS is a fairly robust and modern operating system built on a solid UNIX-style foundation ( unlike Windows ) , there are nonetheless occasional glitches and issues plaguing users that can make things grind to a halt over time . Issues such as what 's know as- memory leaks ( caused by inefficient or sloppy coding ) in applications , as well as inefficiencies in the core OS can cause your Mac to perform less than optimally , so its always wise to make sure your system is as up to date as possible . <p> Thankfully , there are a few things that you can do to resolve some of the most common memory usage problems . After all , buying a new Mac or more memory ( RAM ) is n't necessarily a viable solution to the issue memory is a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will inevitably be used up ! Regardless , its advisable to have as much RAM as possible installed in your Mac , and certainly more than you need so that Mac OS has room to manoeuvre . <p> If your memory issues are caused by too many applications ( and tabs in Safari ) being open , then closing a few of these will certainly help things move along smoothly . But what if you 've already done this and your system memory usage is still going through the roof ? - This article discusses some of the common memory usage issues and tips to resolve them in Mac OS Lion . <h> 1 . Check How Much Memory You Have <p> The first thing to do is to check how much RAM your Mac has . If you cant remember the configuration , the simplest way to check this is to choose About This Mac- from the Apple Menu- which opens a small window showing basic system information as below . <p> View your Mac 's system memory <p> The amount ( and speed ) of installed memory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days come with at least 4 GB of memory . Its speed is also a factor that contributes towards performance DDR3 is the most common speed and considerably faster than DDR2 or DDR1 . If you have less than 4 GB then you should certainly consider upgrading your memory , but bear in mind the analogy that taking your foot off the accelerator pedal wont increase your speed ; rather , it will just stop you slowing down . Memory can be thought of as a bottleneck in your system , so the more you have and the faster it is , the better . <p> From the About This Mac screen , selecting More Info will helpfully bring up a more detailed view click on the Memory tab to show the details about memory installed in each slot ( most Macs have 2 memory slots which accepts 2 lots of memory modules , such as 2 x 1 GB , 2 x 2 GB , 2 x 4 GB and they are always installed in pairs . This means that if you have 2 x 2 GB and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy 2 x 4 GB modules you cant just add a 4GB in one slot and leave 2 in the other . <p> View more details on your memory configuration <h> 2 . Check Memory Usage With Activity Monitor <p> Every Mac comes with a fantastic utility called Activity Monitor . This useful application let 's you inspect CPU activity , memory usage , disk and network activity , and is often the first port of call to determine what 's going on in your system . Activity Monitor presents a list of system and user processes which are currently running , and let 's you see how much memory they 're taking up you can sort applications and processes by the amount of memory used and check them over time to see if its ballooning . If any applications memory usage is steadily increasing over time , it should be obvious and can help you to track down the root of the problem . <p> Open Activity Monitor from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder on your Mac or just type its name into Spotlight . When it opens , the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of all the processes currently active . <p> Activity Monitor is a great tool to view what 's going on inside your Mac <p> To determine which greedy process is hogging memory , click on the System Memory tab at the bottom to display overall system memory statistics . At the top of window , choose All Processes- from the drop-down selection , and then click the Real Mem- column header to order them by the amount of memory used . <p> Of course , just knowing which process is using the most memory wont solve the issues , but at least it will point you in the right direction . For example , Mac users consistently report that Safari uses heaps of memory which grows steadily over time possibly caused by having lots of tabs open or plug-ins ( such as Flash ) and extensions enabled , or perhaps due to inefficient code in Safari itself . <p> In the bottom of the Activity Window , if you can see a lot of Page Outs- then it means you have had some RAM shortages since the last power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snapshot of the current- status of your Mac , and tells you nothing about the usage history or previous peaks in demand . <h> 3 . Perform a Software Update ( and Update Safari ) <p> It goes without saying that its always wise to keep your software up to date , and most Mac users are very good at this after all , Mac OS constantly reminds you when there are application updates available , and anything obtained via the App Store can be updated that way . However , if you use Safari as your main web browser ( and most of us do ) , then its especially important to keep Safari updated . The reason is that since it seems to be the main offender in terms of memory use on the Mac , new versions are regularly being released that address some of the most common related issues . <p> For example , the latest version of Safari ( which is 5.1.7 at the time of writing ) addresses memory and performance issues as indicated below in the Software Update window . <p> Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't already set Software Update to check automatically , open System Preferences- and choose Software Update from the- System panel located at the bottom . At the next screen , choose the automatic settings youd like ( e.g. when to check for updates ) , or just hit the Check Now button to check immediately . <h> 4 . Update / Disable Flash ( and Other Offending Extensions ) <p> Adobes Flash gets a lot of bad press on the Mac unfortunately . As they say there 's no smoke without fire , so its probably somewhat true that Flash ( especially the older versions ) do- in fact consume more system resources than they should . There 's a simple way to solve this firstly make sure that your Flash player is as up to date as possible ( the latest version of Safari disables older , less secure versions ) as follows : <p> Go to System Preferences and under Other choose Flash Player- ( if its not visible , it should be available in the View menu ) <p> From the Advanced tab in the Updates section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the latest version <p> It 's vital to have the most recent version of Flash installed <p> Secondly , its fairly easy to install an extension for Safari to block Flash on websites completely ( when the extension is enabled ) . Click To Flash- is perhaps the most well known and can be downloaded from the Safari Extensions Gallery . It gives you more control over when to view Flash content in websites and can be selectively turned on or off from Safaris preferences , in the Extensions section . <p> If you have lots of Safari Extensions , its also a good idea to try disabling some of them ( one at a time ) and then view memory usage in Activity Monitor to see whether that makes a difference . If you find a specific extension is to blame for the increase in memory , try disabling it to see what happens . <p> Block Flash with a Safari Extension , and try disabling other extensions <h> 5 . Use Third-Party Apps to Free Up Memory <p> There are dozens of third-party apps available in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up system memory with just one click of a button . Most of these should be able to improve performance somewhat , and range from totally free to just a few pounds . Quite how effective they are might depend on each users applications and the way they use their computer , but they are certainly worth a try especially the free ones ! <p> Check out some of these apps which can free up your Macs memory . They can be obtained via the App Store : 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342796 @2342796/ <h> Ten Ways To Free Up Space On Your iPhone or iPad <p> It is pretty much a law that , no matter how much space you have on your iDevice , you will always manage to fill it . I 've lost count of the number of times I 've eagerly waited for a new application to install , only to be notified that I do not have sufficient space ' . With that in mind , what are the ten best ways to free up space on your iDevice ? <h> 1 . Delete games you 've completed <p> If you 've reached the end of any games and do n't see yourself returning to them in the near future , clear them from your device for the time being . As games like Infinity Blade 2 can take up over 1gb of space ( with its older brother demanding a hefty 500mb ) , this is one of the best ways to reclaim storage . <h> 2 . Check for app duplicates <p> If you find that apps on your iPad or iPhone have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that space free for a new application . Weather apps may be a noteworthy exception to this , as it 's often good to double-check weather predictions , just to be on the safe side . <h> - 3. - Clear Photo Roll once you 've synced <p> IPad users may prefer to keep their entire photo library , but for those with an iPhone , once your photos have been imported by your computer , you may wish to start over with an empty Photo Roll . With the iPhone 4 , and especially with the 4S , pictures now take up precious megabytes of space , and you 'll notice the difference in storage capacity immediately . <h> 4 . Music from the Cloud <p> If you 're willing to pony up for it , iTunes Match offers the perfect middle ground between all or nothing , allowing you to access music on the go , given you have an internet connection . Another great thing about this service is that even if some of your music is recorded at a low bit rate , iTunes will stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -21.99 a year worth it , for those who do n't want to leave behind any of a large music collection . <h> - 5. - Use playlists when syncing music <p> It 's very easy to create playlists with iTunes in both iOS and OS X. Why not use that function to allow you to sync only your favourite tracks and albums to your iPad or iPhone , instead of your whole library ? Smart playlists allow you to get technical by choosing songs that have been played above a certain number of times , or that you 've rated highly . <h> - 6. - Forgo music ? <p> The simplest way of saving space as regards music is choosing not to store any on your iDevice . Do you have another MP3 player you use sometimes ? Or is it only on rare occasions that you listen to music while out and about ? It may be best to skip music syncing altogether . <h> - 7. - Remove videos and TV shows you 've watched <p> This is a straightforward one ; there 's no point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't intend to watch for a while . Remember that any content you 've downloaded from the iTunes store will always be available for you to re-download no worries on that score . <h> - 8. - Clear Safari 's cache <p> As you use your iPad or iPhone 's browser , Safari collects information about pages you often visit and stores it in a cache , allowing for faster load-up times on these sites . If space is more important to you than speed , do n't hesitate to go to Settings and empty the cache . <h> - 9. - Tidy up your history and cookies <p> Safari 's web page history , though normally negligible in size , may start eating up space if it is never cleared . It 's a good idea to clear it every so often from within the app itself . As for cookies , these allow websites to remember information about you , such as your login details . While useful , if you want to reclaim the space they take up , or suspect that a site may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete ' from Settings . <h> - 10. - Delete in-app purchases or downloads you can do without <p> A look inside Settings will tell you how much extra data your apps are holding . If that added content is n't serving much purpose ( for instance , if you have unwanted books in your iBooks app ) , just delete it from within the app itself . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342797 @2342797/ <p> Although your Mac will lock automatically whenever you close the lid , for increased security you should try and get into the habit of locking your Mac every time you step away from it . <p> There 's various ways that you can lock your Mac , ranging from using a keyboard shortcut , to configuring a hot corner or , if you 're lucky enough to own one of the new MacBook Pros , you can even add a Lock button to your Touchbar . <p> In this article I 'm going to be sharing various techniques that you can use to lock your Mac quickly and easily , so you can select the method ( or methods ) that work the best for you . <h> 1 . Lock your Mac Automatically <p> Ideally , you should get into the habit of manually locking your Mac whenever you 're leaving it for a significant period of time . However , it 's still a good idea to setup your Mac so it goes to sleep and then locks automatically after it 's been sat idle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those occasions when you do forget to lock your Mac . <p> You can configure your Mac to either lock automatically as soon as it enters a sleep state , or you can specify that your Mac should wait for a certain period of time before triggering- the lock function . The latter can be useful if your Mac occasionally drifts off to sleep even when you 're sat right in front of it you probably do n't  want to have to keep unlocking your Mac , just because you were lost in thought and accidentally let your Mac doze off as a result ! <p> To setup your Mac to lock automatically : <p> Click the Apple ' logo in the toolbar and select System preferences ' <p> Select the Security &amp; Privacy ' pane . <p> Make sure the General ' tab is selected . <p> Select the Require Password ' checkbox . If you do n't already have a password in place , then follow the onscreen instructions to create one . <p> Use the accompanying dropdown to specify how long your Mac should wait after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automatic Login ' checkbox is selected . <p> You may also want to check how long your Mac needs to be stood idle for , before it 'll go to sleep , so navigate back to the main System Preferences . ' screen and select Energy Saver . ' Take a look at the timeline in both the Battery ' and Power Adapter ' tabs , and make any necessary adjustments . <h> 2 . Lock Your Mac With a Keyboard Shortcut <p> Technically , you can only send your Mac to sleep using a keyboard shortcut , but if you 've configured your Mac to lock as soon as it enters sleep mode , then this is essentially the same as locking the screen . Even if you 've specified that your Mac should sleep for a set period of time before locking , this shortcut may still be useful depending on exactly how long your Mac needs to wait before the locking mechanism is triggered . <p> To send your Mac to sleep , press the Control+Shift+Power ' keys . If you have an older MacBook that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , then you can send your Mac to sleep using the Control+Shift+Eject ' shortcut instead . <h> 3 .

Lock Your Mac Using Hot Corners <p> Hot corners are a bit of a divisive topic amongst the Mac community , with some users appearing to hate this feature . <p> If you 've never experimented with hot corners before , then they allow you to assign an action to each corner of the screen . You can then trigger these actions by moving your mouse to the corresponding corner .

Lock your Mac Using the Touchbar <p> If you own one of the new MacBook Pros , then you can add a Lock ' button to the Touchbar : <p> Open your Mac 's System preferences ' <p> Select the Keyboard ' pane . <p> Click the Customize Control Strip .

Do n't  worry though , your account is more than secure . <p> If , after allowing access to less secure apps you 're still having " password incorrect " issues , there 's a high chance the problem is that you 're either signing in from a new location or device , or the version of the Mail app you 're using does n't  support 2-step verification . <h> If you 're signing in from a new location or device <p> Google knows that , sometimes , a person other than you will try and access your account .

The comparisons provide a closer look at what the new iPhone 's bezel-free design will look like with a smaller form factor . <p> According to the blog , the mould first made its appearance on Chinese online retail site Alibaba , purporting to be an iPhone 8 case . While It is quite likely that the design is based on moulds and schematics that were leaked earlier , it does offer a good idea of how certain aspects of the new phone might look . <p> For example , the cutout for the camera lines up in a manner that supports earlier speculations that the iPhone 8 will boast a dual vertically-aligned camera with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designers to move the power button down so that it does not obstruct when using the camera . <p> As far as size goes , the iPhone 8 case is marginally bigger than the iPhone 7 but considerably smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus .

The new- Notes app is now much- more useful , and- Mac users will find it- can handle some- of the more advanced features typically offered- by third party apps such as- Evernote . <p> In this article , well run through some of- the key changes and how- you can- make the most of the new features . <h> Jump right in <p> To start with , open- Notes on your Mac . The app still lives- in the Dock- by default , but you can also just type Notes into Spotlight if have- previously- removed it . <p> At first glance , little- appears to have- changed in Notes . There is- the familiar list of notes on the left under the heading On My Mac , plus theres- a Notes- and- Recently Deleted sections ( which only appears when you delete notes . They are- permanently deleted after 30 days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore them ) . <p> The- menu bar can be hidden via the- Hide folders button ( the first one in the menu bar ) , or by- selecting the same option from the View menu . <p> Its quite handy being able to organise notes in El Capitan now . To do so , - tap the New- Folder button on the lower left of the folders list ( or use- SHIFT + CMD + N ) and then enter a name for the note . <p> In order to- create a new note there 's a prominent " New Note " button on the toolbar , but- you can just as easily use CMD + N- to achieve the same thing- more quickly . <p> When you create a new note , it will go into the folder you 've selected ( if any ) , otherwise it will just live in the default Notes section . <p> You can only create a flat list of folders rather than a proper hierarchy. - In the example below , I 've created a " Personal " and a " Work " folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Browse notes by attachments <p> Thankfully , there 's a great way to view all these various types of document in a simple list : select the Browse attachments button , which switches to a separate view with sections for each of the document types : <p> As you 'd expect , if you right-click any item in the list , there are also several more options presented . For example , you can open the attachment , quick look , copy it , save , share , or just go to the note . <h> Improved formatting options <p> One of the things people commonly use- Notes for is- to create bulleted lists of things to do or remember . <p> The new- Notes make that much easier , by selecting the checklist- button on the Notes toolbar . You can also check off completed items by placing a check in the boxes , which results in a solid appearance indicating you 've done it . <p> You can select SHIFT + CMD + L to make a new checklist anywhere within a note , or by highlighting existing text- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options <p> Thankfully , there are a few more formatting options in Notes . New notes now start with a proper Title section ( the default can be set in the Format menu , by choosing New notes start with ) . <p> You can also select any text- and change it quickly the formatting to either a- Title , Heading- or Body with one of these shortcuts : <p> CMD + SHIFT + T- to create a Title <p> CMD + SHIFT + H- to create a- Heading <p> CMD + SHIFT + B to create- Body text <p> All the old formatting options are still available- and- work as expected , such as CMD + B to make bold text , or CMD + I- to switch to- italics . <p> There 's still a font browser ( CMD + T ) , that allows you to choose various fonts and set there options such as the type and size . <p> You can also choose type of text or- list type ( e.g. a checklist , or the old style bulleted , numbered or dashed lists ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown as Aa ) . <h> Richer notes <p> Notes now let 's you add various types of media to any note . For example , - photos and video , sketches , audio , web sites , map locations and even documents . <h> Photos <p> To insert a photo , click the photos icon or choose Photos Browser from the Window menu , and then choose an- image . Once you 've found a picture , just drag it into the note . You can also then press the spacebar to preview the image ( or right-click and choose Quick Look Attachment ) , or double-click to open in the Preview app . <h> Documents <p> Its also possible just to drag any item from the Finder into the note , where it will appear inline . In the example below , I 've added a PDF file just by dragging it in . <h> Websites <p> In Safari , select the Share- button and then choose Notes . <p> A popup window appears that allows you to add some additional text , as well as choose whether you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing one . <p> Once you have entered the- details , - a nicely formatted link is inserted into the note you chose . Double-clicking the link takes you to the website , though you can also use- Spacebar to preview the website directly within notes . <p> Note : typing in- a web- address directly within a note itself does- not insert a website snippet in the manner described , and it does not appear in the browse mode either . <h> Maps <p> The process to add a map is exactly the same as adding a website from Safari choose Notes from the Share menu within Maps , and then optionally add- some additional text and choose whether you want to create a new note or add to an existing one . <p> Once the map has been added to a note , you can also- switch to browse mode , select the Map Locations tab and view all your maps in one place . <h> Sketches <p> For the moment , there does n't  appear any- way to add a sketches into Notes . However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that let 's you- sketch a drawing using- your finger . It seems likely that the new Notes app in iOS 9 and El Capitan will- synchronise notes via iCloud , and any notes that you create on one- device will appear on all of them . <p> Currently , Notes in Yosemite and iOS 8 can only- sync if you have a Mobile Me account , which is quite frustrating to users that do n't  . Hopefully , once El Capitan and iOS 9 are available , Notes will sync just like every other native app via iCloud . <h> Final thoughts <p> With the latest version of OS X , Apple has thankfully brought Notes up to date and added features that were sorely needed . While its not perhaps quite as fully-featured as some of the third party apps , the changes will make Notes- more useful than ever , and- hopefully with proper iCloud synchronisation with iOS 9 in the autumn , it will be possible to keep your notes organised on every Apple device 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in notes . Just drag any folder into another folder . You have the ability to collapse the folders embedded in another . And you can do at least 3 levels of folders ( havent tried more ) . <p> The folder hierarchy will appear when synced to iOS devices , but the folders are not collapsible on those devices . <p> In the Yosemite folders , you could actually make subfolders in the same way . But they were not collapsible , and the hierarchy was not displayed in iOS notes , making the ability to create folders rather useless if you wanted to sync. 
@@22342802 @2342802/ <h> Where To Buy The Best RAM For The Mac <p> There comes a time when you need to buy additional memory ( RAM ) for your Mac . It can help things to run smoothly and extend the life of your Mac for another year or two , meaning that you can probably hold off that upgrade a little long ( if you have the willpower ) . Its important to have sufficient memory in your computer , because without it you might experience significant slowdowns as your computer struggles to keep up with todays memory-intensive applications . RAM is the working memory of your computer , and without enough , things start grinding to a halt pretty quickly you 'll see the spinning multi-coloured beach ball all too often . In the past , buying additional memory was one of the most expensive components for your Mac , but prices keep falling and its also one of the few things that can easily be replaced at home rather than taking it to an expensive technician . This article lists some of the best places to buy RAM for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it pays to do a little research and make sure you have all the right equipment . If you 're not confident of upgrading memory yourself , take your computer to an Apple store or other computer shop and theyll be more than happy to install the memory for you . <h> Buying Advice <p> Its worth noting that Apples own memory prices are stupendously high , and there 's nothing special about the RAM they provide either its simply bought in bulk from companies such as Samsung and Hynix . Furthermore , RAM sold by Apple is also not the fastest that you can buy for the Mac its definitely advisable to buy a standard Mac and upgrade the memory later . <p> Its also critical that you buy RAM from major companies only , as its guaranteed to be of high quality and come with a lifetime guarantee there 's no point to buy unknown or unbranded RAM that might fail just after you 've bought it . <p> RAM comes in many different types the key factors to consider are the size and speed . Size-wise , buy as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for it . In terms of the speed , check the type of memory ( such as DDR3-1066 ) is fast enough to keep up with your Mac . If in doubt , simply use some of the superb tools on the websites of the companies below they all let you select your model and some of them can even detect the optimal memory for your system by downloading a small app . <p> Do n't  forget that you can always buy memory elsewhere and take it to a local Apple store or computer shop to install ( for a charge ) , which works out significantly cheaper . <h> Where to Buy ? <p> These days , there are hundreds of online stores that stock RAM compatible with most Macs . There are also lots of independent computer stores up and down the country and of course the Apple Store . Buying online is probably the way to go , as you can check what type of memory your computer needs , and it order it online with little fuss . Below we 've listed a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crucial is one of the most established online retailers and manufacturers of RAM , and stock pretty much every type that you might need . Use their Memory Adviser- service on the main page to select the make and model of your Mac , and itll find all matching memory . For example , select Apple MacBook Pro and the model and you 'll be taken to a page with all the valid options . They also remind you that its advisable to install 2 pairs of matched memory in Macs such as 2 x 4 GB memory modules . This way you 'll achieve the best possible performance. - However , the easiest way to determine what sort of RAM you need is to download the Mac System Scanner- to automatically determine what you need . You cant really get much simpler than that ! What 's more , there 's free shipping on all items to the UK , Channel Islands and the Isle of Man . <h> 2 . Mr Memory <p> Mr Memory appears to be one of the most highly rated online retailers of RAM . They - stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Macs . You can choose the make and model of computer on the main screen , after which is takes you through several screens to narrow down the choice. - Prices are pretty competitive , and they stock all the major branded memory . What 's more , they offer free 1st class delivery within the UK . There 's also a video guide which shows you how to install laptop memory and even though the guide is for a PC , the same basic principles apply to the Mac . <h> 3 . Apple <p> As expected , Apple sells memory for the Mac ( it would be weird if they did n't  ! ) , but we have to point out that their prices are extraordinarily expensive ( that 's an understatement ) compared to the other online retailers in this list . The benefit of buying from Apple is that the memory is guaranteed to be 100% compatible with your Mac ( though the other stores also guarantee this ) , but people with more money than sense might feel safer in the knowledge that they 're buying from Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , you 'll pay through the nose . Prices are very consistent however choose any of the 2011 MacBook Pro 13-inch models and the price is the same regardless of which processor you have . <h> 4 . Amazon <p> Online retailer Amazon stocks a large range of RAM for the Mac from large manufacturers such as Kingston and Crucial many of the products are sold by Amazon but provided by other retailers . The only downside is that you really have to know what type of memory you need before you buy it , and of course there are n't  any online guides on the website to help you choose . Having said that , many people will already have an Amazon account and will be familiar with their buying process , so its not a bad choice if you can find out what specification RAM you need from other sources . <h> 5 . Offtek <p> Offtek stocks a massive selection of memory for every model of Mac you can imagine . Just punch in the model and it will show you the memory module needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crucial one , but the prices appear very slightly cheaper .

Mac uses the BSD grep , while the command that you 've posted is most probably for GNU grep . The two versions of the tools are similar , but not identical . <p> The issue is the following the grep command . GNU grep interprets this as stdin ( thus , those lines that have been identified as duplicates by uniq -d ) , while BSD grep is actually looking for a file called - . <p> Nice article ! For some reason a lot of my songs have duplicated , tripled or even quadrupled . its very annoying because i cant play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a good software . It is called MUSIC CLEANUP . It is really amazing to remove all my duplicates all at once . <p> Ja , that command line fails for multiple reasons . The fancy quotes and em dash are two reasons ( dammit Jim , I 'm a graphic designer , not a programmer ) . The other seems to be deprecated behaviour in grep . <p> Very badly , I 'll explain . Each ( bar symbol ) is a pipe and joins the output from one command to another . So , explaining one command at a time : first is a find on current directory ( . ) for files more than 1k ( -size 20 ) that are n't  directories ( ! ( not ) -type d ) and execute a checksum on these files ( -exec cksum ; ) . The effect is to output a list of files with their directory relative to current directory and their checksum and block count ( size in 512bytes ) . Next bit says take this list of files with checksums , and sort them alphabetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Next bit is tee which means put this output here and there , in this case put it to the file /tmp/f.tmp , and also to standard output ( the screen , or in this case , pipe it along to the next command ) . Next bit is cut which , when you fix the quotes , takes the first two words from our list ( the checksum and size ) and discards the rest ( the filename ) Next bit is uniq , which because of the -d option , prints all the items occurring more than once ( ie duplicates ) Next bit , and this is the grunter , is a grep which says " show me all the items in /temp/f.tmp ( the original output with the file name ) which match the list of duplicate checksums I have been piped " and redirect that list to duplicates.txt <p> That last command , grep , is a little off . The options are -hif which are : -h : do n't  print the filename ( odd , as it should be off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the input is just numbers checksum and size ) -f : read from this file for our patterns to search for , which along with the following " " is actually meant to mean read from standard in . <p> Now the exciting bit where something interesting is revealed . In OS X , Gnu grep was replaced with BSD grep in Mountain Lion ( 10.8 ) . This means that this command line wont work on 10.8+ , since BSD grep does not support the " -f " option to read from standard in . So , what to do ? <p> Well , the standard approach is to wrap the piped commands inside the grep using $ ( commands ) , but that would get very ugly very quickly since we have many layers . An alternative , if less attractive measure is to redirect the output from uniq -d to another file . This means breaking the command in two : <p> But there 's more . For large numbers of arbitrary files , it is possible that you will have the same checksum and filesize low chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to use a better hashing function , MD5 or SHA . But then you run into the problem of computing large numbers of hashes . So , an alternative is to match on filesize first , and if the file size is the same , then do a hash , this reduces the number of hashes you need to do .

Maybe your Mac is clogged with years ' of content and you 've decided it 'll be far easier to just start from scratch rather than trying to sort this mess out manually ; or perhaps you 've tried to customise your Mac and it 's gone terribly wrong , and you need a quick way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to show you how to revert your Mac to a pristine , fresh-out-the-box state . I 'll show you how to remove all your login information , deauthorise your iTunes and , finally , how to restore factory settings by wiping your hard drive and installing a fresh copy of macOS . <h> Before we begin : Backup your Mac <p> Before you remove anything from your Mac , you 'll need to make sure you 've backed up all the files , documents and any other content you want to keep . <p> If you only need to backup a handful of items , then you may want to just move this content to an external storage device , such as a USB stick , or copy it to an online hosting service such as DropBox , iCloud or Google Docs . However , if you have lots of content that you want to hang onto , then it may be easier to simply clone the entire contents of your hard drive to an external drive . <p> When you clone your hard drive , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 're also copying the entire operating system , essentially creating a perfect copy of your Mac that you can access at any time . This is a good way of ensuring that you wo n't lose anything when you wipe your Mac 's hard drive . You can even create a clone and then hang onto it until you 're certain that you did n't forget to copy anything important to your new Mac . <p> A cloned drive can also be a great way of setting up a new Mac , as you can use it as a bootable copy that you attach to your new machine and then use to boot into your original Mac , effectively turning your new computer into a perfect copy of your old one . <p> There 's various apps that you can use to clone your Mac , but for this tutorial I 'm going to use SuperDuper . <p> To create your clone , you 'll need an external hard drive that 's at least the same size as your Mac 's main drive .

Chances are that even if you 're gifting your Mac to another person you wo n't want to pass along all your songs , movies and other purchases as well , so you 'll generally want to deauthorise your computer . Plus , when you purchase content through iTunes , you can only access that content on a maximum of five devices , so why waste content on a computer that you no longer have access to ? <p> Enter your username and password when prompted , and click Deauthorise . ' <p> You should also deauthorize any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you do n't find yourself unable to access a program you 've paid good money for , simply because the serial number is still tied to your previous Mac .

Although we 'll be wiping the hard drive in the next step , it 's always better to be safe than sorry ! <h> Erase and reinstall macOS <p> Once you 're confident that you 've backed up all your important data and content , and you 've signed out of everything that might connect you to your old Mac , the final step is wiping your hard drive and installing a fresh copy of macOS . Note , this step will permanently erase everything on your hard drive , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up . <p> Before you begin , make sure you Mac is connected to the Internet , as you 'll need an active Internet connection in order to download a fresh copy of the operating system . You should also make sure your Mac is connected to a power source , because the last thing you want is to run out of juice halfway through wiping your hard drive , or reinstalling macOS . <h> To wipe your hard drive : <p> Boot into Recovery Mode by restarting your Mac while holding down the Command ' and R ' keys .

@@22342808 @2342808/ <h> How to Setup Family Sharing in iOS 8 <p> Family Sharing is a new feature in iOS 8 that allows you to share all of the iTunes and App Store purchases you make on iOS with your family , even- without sharing the same Apple I 'd . Additionally , there 's a level of built-in protection as children need to ask permission from the designated parent or elder before they are allowed to purchase anything with the notification appearing on your iOS device ( iPhone , iPad or iPod Touch ) for you to accept or deny . <p> To use Family Sharing , there are a couple of steps that you need to follow first in order to set it up correctly . <h> Getting started with Family Sharing <p> With Family Sharing , you can add a number of family members to your own account . Right now that 's limited to six people , which should be plenty for most families . <p> One of the prerequisites is that you need to have iOS 8 installed , which is the latest version of Apples mobile operating system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added each family member , you can also view each others purchases and download them if you want to , just the same way you would from your own account . Once Family Sharing is activated , everything that you purchase- from then on will be charged to the organisers account , unless the individuals iTunes account has enough credit to pay for the item in that case , the credit from individual accounts is always used first . An example is if you have credit that you may have added using a gift card that credit will be used first . <p> Its also possible to remove anyone from Family Sharing if you change your mind some point later on , however , they will- still be able to access items bought before Family Sharing was activated as you would expect . Every Apple I 'd added will be able to access everything that has been shared , and anything that was purchased after you deleted someone wont be accessible by those people . Pretty much all as you would expect , but its worth bearing in mind if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What exactly can you do with Family Sharing ? <p> In summary , Family Sharing let 's you : <p> Share content such as music , TV , and movies <p> Share photos with anyone in- the Family Sharing group <p> Share your calendars ( but you can still keep your personal one ) <p> Share your location to keep track of your familys whereabouts <p> Locate- your familys devices- ( using Find My- iPhone ) <p> Use the Ask to Buy feature children under 18 must request permission to buy anything <p> With Ask to Buy , you must- respond to purchase requests from an iOS device , but there are a few limitations : currently you can- only possible create two Family Sharing groups per year , which means that if you start a group and then want to delete it later you- will only be able to create one more . Additionally , you have to wait at least a year before you create another group , so its probably better in fact to delete individual members from a group rather than the group , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last point to remember is that its not possible to- place purchase limits on anyone over 18 .

Also , the great thing is that you will have access to every item that they buy too . <p> Family Sharing is a great feature that makes it much easier to share content and also be informed whenever anyone in the group wants to buy something .

@@22342811 @2342811/ <h> What 's New in Mail 9 OS X El Capitan <p> Mail- on the Mac- is sometimes believed not to be- the most feature-rich email app available , but its baked right- into OS X and is the default mail client . Its also more than good enough for the majority of- people and offers some nice features that make it that little bit easier to compose and read messages . <p> In the latest version of OS X , El Capitan , it could be said that Apple has n't  reinvented the wheel with Mail , but there are nevertheless some- welcome tweaks that should help make you more productive . <p> Apple has also asked developers this year to focus on some of the- recurring issues people have experienced with Gmail and other third party mail services , so are the improvements in- El Capitan worth that wait ? <p> In this post , we give a brief rundown of- the key new features <h> Swipe to trash and mark messages <p> iPhone and iPad users will already be familiar with swiping left or write on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trash . Apple has borrowed some of these cues from iOS , adding a- two-finger swipe in your messages list to trash ( or archive ) messages , or to mark them as either read or unread . <p> To trash a message , simply use- a two finger swipe to the left manoeuvre which shows the Trash icon . You can either click the red button that appears to complete the action , or continue a strong swipe all the way to the left to perform the delete . <p> If you would prefer to archive a message rather than delete it , this can be configured in Mails preferences . Go to the- Mail menu and choose- Preferences or just use the ubiquitous- command + comma shortcut . Next , click on the- Viewing tab and there you will see the Swipe Left To- option with- the choice of Trash or Archive . <p> Likewise , swiping two fingers to the right will mark a message as- read or unread depending on its current status . Just like the delete action , you can also swipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button . <h> Minimise- emails- and compose with multiple tabs <p> In the past , it was something of a chore in Mail- to- work on multiple emails at the same time , having to close a message ( in fullscreen mode at least ) and save to the Drafts folder before starting another . With El Capitan however , you can easily minimise the current email and start another . <p> To do- so when in fullscreen mode , clicking anywhere- off the mail message such as the background , slides your email down to the bottom of the screen as shown below . You can now compose a new message which- opens a tabbed window with all current messages open . <p> If you want , you can also use the New Message ( command + N ) option from the File menu to add a tab with a new message , without having to minimise it . <p> To quickly switch between any of your tabbed messages , use shift- + command + or to navigate left and right just as you would in Safari tabs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corner of the email window , - you will be prompted whether you want to save a copy of the message in Drafts . Pressing the red button again will then prompt you the same question for the subsequent still-open message . <h> More intuitive search <p> In much the same way that Spotlight now understands fairly natural language , - Mail now allows you to search for emails using- more intuitive search queries . <p> For example , suppose you wish to find all emails that you deleted today , simply enter- " emails received last month with attachments " into Mails search- box in the upper right corner . <p> Its worth experimenting with the search queries , as some are more readily understood than others . For example , - " message does not have attachments " does not seem to work , although others such as " messages ccd to me " - does . <p> You will also notice that typing in certain queries such as " Email from Bill Smith " - will present a list of people matches , and selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style query with a " FROM " icon with a dropdown offering various options . <h> Better recognition of events in mails <p> One of the most useful , time-saving new features in Mail is its ability to automatically recognise events , that show up just below the subject line complete with a new- add button . <p> Clicking- add pops up- a new event screen , allowing you to quickly add it to your calendar or ignore it . There 's also the option to choose which calendar you 'd like to add it to . <h> Mail Activity panel- only appears during activity <p> In previous versions of Mail , there was a Mail Activity panel- below the folders list . It was possible to show and hide that panel , however in El Capitan that option has been done away with entirely . Instead , the Mail Activity status only shows up when Mail is actually doing something and disappears immediately afterwards , making- the left side of the user interface slightly less cluttered . <p> For those that would prefer the activity panel to be visible all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allow you to dock it permanently . Some might see this- feature as an improvement , but perhaps not everyone . <h> Summary <p> Apple has tweaked Mail in El Capitan with a couple of new features , and even though there 's nothing earth shattering , the improvements are welcome and do serve to make the app more useful than ever . It perhaps wo n't replace some of the mail apps that power users prefer , but certainly for most people Mail is not better than ever 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 1 Comment <p> For Admins that have to troubleshoot email issues , I think it is important to note that the Activity Window has also had a change . Previously , this window showed details of what processes were going on for each account , and it allowed you to kill a process that was " stuck . " Now the Activity Window does n't  show much more , if anything , than what is displayed in the Activity panel . While some improvement may have been needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that being able to kill a process might be creating problems rather than solving them ) , it is clearly a loss for anyone trying to troubleshoot multiple email accounts in Apple Mail to have this loss of detail . They have made the Activity Window essentially useless . I hope Apple reverses this in a future update .

User permission issues can prevent Spotlight from finding certain items , or some files and folders may be completely inaccessible to you . <p> This tutorial describes how to change access rights to items on your computer , as well as how to perform a full reset on all your Home Directory permissions and Access Control Lists ( ACLs ) to revert them back to the original state ( see PART 2 ) . <h> PART 1 : How to View and Change File Permissions <h> METHOD 1 : In Finder <p> Its very simple to edit user permissions on individual files , folders and applications without having to resort to the command line Terminal : <p> Select the file , folder or application whose permissions you want to view and edit <p> Choose- File -&gt; Get Info from the Finder menu or use COMMAND- + I <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sharing &amp; Permissions section . Under the Privilege column , click on the drop-down arrows to show the available options . Here you can choose which option to set . <p> User file permissions within the Get Info window <p> The options displayed are usually as follows , but No Access may not always be a valid option ( e.g. for administrators ) : <p> Read &amp; Write <p> Read only <p> Write only ( Drop Box ) <p> No Access <p> If the padlock icon is displayed in the lower righthand corner , you 'll be prompted to enter the Admin password before any changes can be applied . <p> The actions button- ( the gears icon ) at the bottom of the window presents a few more options to change the items owner , or apply the changes to all of the enclosed items and subfolders . If you make any changes and subsequently change your mind , there 's also a useful option to revert the changes back to the previous settings . <p> Additional options to edit permissions <p> Lastly , you can use the + and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permissions on the item . For example , the + button presents a choice of usernames to add to the permissions list , and also allows you to add a new username by creating a new user account . <p> Adding additional users to the file permissions list <h> METHOD 2 : Using Terminal <p> More advanced users that are already familiar with UNIX-style commands may prefer to use Terminals chmod command to change file permissions and Access Control settings . However , the first method mentioned above is far simpler and can achieve the same results . <p> The built-in manual can be used to obtain more details about each command . For example , type man chmod- into the Terminal window to display its detailed help page and usage information . <p> The basic steps are : <p> Open Terminal from the Applications folder or using Spotlight <p> At the command prompt , navigate to the directory that contains the item(s) you want to edit .

Chmod has dozens of options so the manual pages must be read carefully <p> User permissions shown in Terminal <p> Examples : <p> To assign the current user read , write and execute permissions : - chmod u+rwx &lt;filename&gt; <p> To assign the current user full access , but restrict write access to Groups and Others : - chmod u=rwx , go=rx &lt;filename&gt; <p> To remove all permissions for Groups and Others : - chmod go= &lt;filename&gt; <h> PART 2 : How to Repair User Permissions <h> A Note About Disk Utility <p> You might expect that Disk Utilitys Repair Disk Permissions feature ( see below ) can fix any problems with your permissions . However , this is not the case as it does n't  resolve issues with the Home Folder . <h> Using Repair Utilities to Reset User Permissions <p> The most effective way to completely reset your Home Folders permissions and ACLs back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Repair Utilities . <p> Follow the steps below : <p> Restart your Mac and hold down COMMAND + R during restart to open the Repair Utilities screen <p> In the menu bar , click on Utilities and then select Terminal <p> Terminal will open , and at the command prompt type- resetpassword <p> The Reset Password tool opens , but note that we wo n't actually change the password .

@@22342814 @2342814/ <h> 10 Ways To Hide And Secure Your Private Documents And Files in OS X <p> Nowadays , privacy is hard to come by . Large corporations seem to know us better than we know ourselves , and very little can be kept a secret . Sometimes though , certain files need to be kept private , and Macs are great at helping you hide the things you want hidden . Below , you 'll find the 10 best ways to keep your private folders and documents hidden and secure . <h> Enable FileVault <p> FileVault is arguably the easiest and most trusted way to keep files safe on your Mac . When activated , FireVault fully encrypts your startup disk , preventing unauthorised access to your documents and data . To turn on FireVault , go to System Preferences from the Apple menu . From there , click Security and Privacy , then select the- FireVault- tab . Finally , click the lock , enter your administrator name and password and click the- Turn on FileVault button . <p> If you have more than one user on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to unlock the startup disk . To do this , click- Enable User when the option becomes available , and then enter the password for that account . Remember , each user you enable will have access to your Mac from startup . <p> Be careful with FileVault though . If you 're someone who often forgets or misplaces passwords , encrypting your startup disk using Apples service may not be the wisest choice . Due to the encryption technique used when activating FileVault , if you lose access to your account , your data will not be recoverable . <h> Hide everything in the Library <p> If you 're running OS X Mountain Lion or above , /Library is a great place to hide your private files , because it 's automatically hidden until you choose to make it visible . <p> To access the Library , click on the Finder 's Go menu and hold down the Option key . When you do , a new row will appear in the menu titled Library , click that and you 'll be presented with a window full of folders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly what you 're doing , I 'd recommend staying out of these folders , because any alterations to files within them could stop certain applications from running properly . <p> However , you 're free to add any files or folders you wish to the Library , and they 're hidden until someone decides to look there . It 's not the most secure option , but it 's simple and should keep out most intruders . <h> Type instruction code in to Terminal <p> Using Terminal is something many Mac users shy away from ; the program is a complex piece of kit , and not everyone will find a use for it . However , if you know your stuff when it comes to Terminal , there are two methods for hiding your private files and folders . <h> chflags hidden <p> Open Terminal , <p> Type- chflags hidden <p> Drag any file or document you want to hide into the Terminal window , or type in the file path manually <p> Press the- Enter- key <p> Any files you hide wont be moved from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access them via the Go To Folder dialog ( Command-Shift-G ) in Finder and typing in their full paths . To unhide any file or document , go back to Terminal and type- chflags no hidden- followed by the file or document path . <h> mv filepath . newfilepath <p> Open Terminal , <p> type- mv filename . filename- ( be sure to replace filename with the path of the file you wish to hide , and then replace- . filename- with the new , renamed files path ) <p> Press the- Enter- key <p> Using this command renames the original file to place a period at the beginning of its name . By doing so , the file is automatically hidden because of the fact files with periods at the beginning of their names are hidden in OS X. As with the previous code , you- can access the hidden folder by using the Go To Folder shortcut , and unhide the file by repeating the command with the file paths reversed . <h> Install a third-party application <p> Free to try . -16.99 for one license , -26.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far and away the best looking application on this list of three , Hider- 2 has been reviewed and recommended by writers from websites such as TUAW , MacWorld and LifeHacker ; its also recommended by us here at ChrisWrites . <p> Surprisingly easy to use , Hider 2 encrypts the files and documents you wish to keep private and stores them in a secure vault . The vault is password protected of course , and you 're asked to set this password when you first start the app after installing it . <p> Hiders easy drag-and-drop system allows you to pick and choose which files and documents you want to encrypt , but its distinctiveness comes from the fact you can also make any encrypted file invisible in Finder . The double layer of protection , both from encryption and invisibility , makes Hider 2 a highly recommended application if you want to keep your important files private and safe . <p> Free to try . -17.55 for a single user license , -35.11 for a single site license . <p> If you 're not in the business of encrypting files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide private files with a single click . <p> Of course , weve already discussed ways to hide files rather than encrypt them , so Secret Folder is essentially an app that provides a simple way to make your files and documents invisible , and not much more . The list view is handy though , letting you see at a glance exactly what you 've chosen to hide . <p> However , if you 're someone who enjoys the fact individual pixels are virtually impossible to see on a Retina display , Secret Folder may not be for you its yet to optimise itself for use on Retina displays , as you can see from the pixelated text on the above image . <h> Put your files in another User Account <p> While not the safest , putting your files in another user account is definitely one of the easiest options on this list . So , if you 're not too keen on encrypting your disk , using Terminal or downloading third-party applications , create a new user account and put your private files and documents- in there . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to- Users &amp; Groups . Follow the usual procedure of clicking the lock and entering your administrator name and password , and then click the + ' ( plus ) button below Login Options . A new account window will drop down , and from there you 're asked to name the account , and give it a password . <p> Once you 've created a new account , you can start moving your folders and files over to it . This is a useful way of ensuring your files and documents are protected from those who have access to your account , but just be aware that logging in and out of accounts can be an annoyance for some . And , if you often leave your Mac unattended around the house , make sure to lock your private account before moving . <h> Let 's keep it simple just rename the file or folder <p> If all of the above seems too complicated for you to even bother attempting , then let 's keep it simple : just rename the file or folder you wish to keep private . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Folder or- KEEP OUT- though , because that would only encourage preying eyes to open the files and folders you so desperately want to remain private .

@@22342815 @2342815/ <h> How to free up space for an iOS upgrade <p> When Apple released iOS 8 , many people , especially those with 16 GB devices- or with lots of apps and other content , found they were unable to install the update because it required 4 or 5- GB of free space . <p> Ca n't update ? - Follow our guide to free up some space first . <p> Why does the- iOS 8 upgrade need- so much free space , when the update is around 1- GB ? The reason is that during the update process , lots of temporary files are created in order to be able to roll back if something goes wrong . After the installation , those temporary files are deleted , but it means that many people dont- physically have enough room on their device- for the- upgrade. - This short- guide shows you how to free up some room first . <p> Note that before you start deleting stuff from your device , its always worth doing an iCloud backup to ensure that nothing is lost forever ! <p> To avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest option is to connect your iOS device to iTunes and do the- update , because doing it this way does n't  require- all that free space . Unfortunately , if you do n't  have a computer or do n't  want to use iTunes , read on <h> Step 1 : - check what 's using the most storage <p> The first thing to do is to identify what- is taking up the most space on your iPhone , iPad or iPod Touch . In this tutorial , I 've used an iPad throughout , but the steps are exactly the same whichever iOS device you have . <p> You can check how much space everything uses- by going to- Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage -&gt; Manage Storage , where you 'll see a list of the applications ( and content ) and an indication of- the space they are taking up , largest first . <p> The Storage menu shows every application listed by the- storage space it uses . <p> In the example , - you can see that- music is the worst offender in my case followed by a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any item to view more details in my case Music then shows- a list of all albums . For applications , you will see- usually just see details for " Documents and Data " , which is often much smaller than the apps themselves . <p> Select any item and you 'll see a breakdown of usage within that specific app . <h> Step 2 : delete- large apps <p> For gamers especially , some of those apps- can be several GB- in size . Many- normal apps these days can even reach- several hundred MB , especially since Apple increased the resolution of the iPhone which means apps often include several versions of graphics optimised for each device . <p> A minor note of caution- however , is that before you delete an app its worth checking whether it has any documents or data stored locally on your- device , as in that case when you remove it , your data will be lost. - Many apps , such as Facebook and YouTube , will require that you login again when you reinstall , so make sure you have those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications on your device and delete them ( i.e tap and hold on- the home screen then hit the x button that appears , or just select- Delete App from the Storage menu in- step 1 ) . <p> Once you 've deleted an app , you can just- download them again later on from the App Store . Many apps and games these days store their data ( like documents , settings or game progress ) in iCloud , which means that when you re-download the app your- data will still be intact . <p> Tap and hold an icon until they wiggle , the tap the x to remove an app . <h> Step 3 : delete- music , videos and photos <p> After you 've removed the worst offending apps , the next step is- to delete any music , videos and photos that you have stored locally on your device . <p> Open the Videos app and delete local versions of Movies , TV Shows , and Music Videos by tapping the Edit button then hitting the small x that appears on each item . You can download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos that you 've made ( i.e. that you did not download- from iTunes ) - you should- connect to- your Mac via USB cable and then copy- the files into a folder temporarily ( using a tool such as- Image Capture more details on that later ) . <p> In the Movies app , tap the Edit button , delete an item then hit Done . <p> Similarly , open the- Music app , select any local content you have in there , and swipe left to show the delete button , and then confirm . Its a bit of a slow process if you have thousands of songs , however . After you have deleted your music , its worth knowing that you could in future- listen to all your iCloud music just by pressing play , i.e. you do n't  really need to download songs unless you are planning to listen to them when you do n't  have- a network connection . <p> Unfortunately , its not possible to delete an album one at a time ( or all music at once , for that matter ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iTunes by unchecking the Sync button . <p> Select any song , then slide left and tap Delete . <p> If you have copies of photos in iPhoto on the Mac , you may also like to connect your iOS device to iTunes and synchronise- everything. - Ensure your device- is visible in iTunes , select the devices icon in the toolbar , and in the left hand panel select Photos . You 'll then have the option to Sync Photos in the main window , where you can choose- the desired photos. - This means that all your photos in iOS will be copied to iPhoto . You can always export them at a later date and copy them back onto your iPhone or iPad . <p> Its worth doing a sync with iPhoto as an extra backup method . <p> There is another simpler ( and very fast ) way to export photos from your iOS device onto a Mac using a built-in- app called- Image Capture ( it treats your device like a camera ) : <p> Open Image Capture from the Applications folder , or just type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a USB cable <p> Select a folder from the menu ( Pictures is the default ) or even choose iPhoto , and then choose- Import All ( or just select individual photos and click- Import ) <p> This will copy the photos over , enabling- you to- then copy them back again using iTunes later on ( or one of many third party synchronisation apps ) . <p> Another simple option- is to use a cloud-based service like Dropbox . You can upload all the photos on your device , and then delete them from the native Photos app . If you already use iCloud , bear in mind that it only synchronises a limited number of photos to the Photo Stream , so if you just delete all your photos , you may find that some- are not available- online ( this will change in future when iCloud Photos is officially available , as now its still in beta ) . <h> Upgrade to- iOS 8 <p> If you have managed to free up enough space on your device , you should now be able to go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can- then reinstall the items that were- previously deleted . <p> For- Apps , open- the App Store and download them again ( once installed , you may need to re-enter- user names and passwords ) . <p> For- Music- and- Videos , the iTunes store will let you download . But for personal videos that you copied to your Mac or PC , you 'll need to connect your device by USB cable ( as that 's the fastest way ) , and copy the items back manually . <p> Pictures- stored in iCloud should still be accessible as before , but to restore other pictures , - either copy them back from third party apps ( like Dropbox ) or- use iTunes to sync the photos back . <p> We hope that- you enjoy using iOS 8 there are lots of great new features and its certainly worth the time and effort . As always , just make sure that you- backup everything first- just in case something goes wrong . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

It depends whether you 're having problems with headers ( such as the- To , From , Subject , and- CC fields ) or the message content ( i.e. the message body ) , because Mail uses two different systems to search each item . <p> Mail uses several indexes known as the Envelope Index to search message headers , so such problems can normally be resolved by forcing Mail to completely rebuild the Envelope index , as follows : <p> Quit- Mail . <p> In Finder- go to the folder **26;159;TOOLONG and delete the following files : <p> Envelope-Index <p> Envelope-Index-shm <p> Envelope-Index-wal <p> Delete the Envelope Index files in the Mail folder <p> Now restart Mailand you 'll see a message informing you that it has to import your messages . Mail is actually rebuilding the index , which should in most circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As already mentioned , message content is indexed and searched completely independently from headers .

But a search only returned very recent emails matching the query , whereas for the very same query in Spotlight showed matches which spanned over the entire history . Second issue was , that almost all my marked emails were gone ( from previously 150 to only 1 remained ) . The method fixed both the limited search scope and the lost marks . Thanks ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for me , in a slightly different scenario . I had a disk crash on my old Mini ( running Mavericks , thankfully with TimeMachine doing its job as faithfully as always ) , so I bought a new one , preinstalled with Yosemite . Recovering from TimeMachine looked great , except that although the folder structure in Mail ( " On my Mac " ) was intact , all folders showed 0 messages in them . This was truly strange , as all mbox files were in place and were very large ( about 3GB in total ; I never throw anything away ) . Rebuild did nothing . Then I stumbled on your tip above , and noted that you said that this would force a re-import . I then realized that I had never gotten the " sorry , I have to re-import " message that I had expected ( had gotten that when I had upgraded another Mini from Mavericks to Yosemite ) , so apparently this particular corner case ( Mail thinking that it does n't  need to re-import as it got all data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But your suggestion did trigger the re-import , and everything is now exactly as it should be .

Theyre " intelligent files " that show up when i use Mail via iCloud but not in the Mail application itself . any ideas ?

Most applications also have unique preferences and settings which can accessed from their own menus , but System Preferences gives you access to the majority of system wide features . For some people that do n't  use all the features in Mac OS X ( such as accessibility , or laptop users without a mouse ) , some of those Preference Panes are rarely used , and third-party applications like Flash also install their own . <p> This tutorial shows you how to customise and trim down your System Preferences items to show only the options that you want to display . <h> Customising System Preferences <p> System Preferences can be accessed via the cogwheel icon in the Dock ( or just type it into Spotlight ) , which opens up a plethora of different options which are organised into categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items shown , because its one of the first places you look to customise your computers behaviour .

I also never use Universal Access and do n't  have a MobileMe- account and so have hidden those too .

@@22342818 @2342818/ <h> 10 Ways to Speed Up Mac Startup Times <p> Does you Mac still boot up as quickly as the day you bought it ? Over time , most computers have a tendency to start more slowly as they become clogged up with applications that install various startup processes and more disk space is used up , which over time leads to a deterioration in system performance . If your Mac is decidedly lethargic when starting up , its a good idea to perform a few simple checks to make sure it stays in tip-top condition . <p> Most people find that in general Macs boot up much more quickly than PCs , but there are still a few things that you can do to make booting up as painless and fast as possible . Unlike PCs , bothersome tasks such as performing disk defragmentation are unnecessary on a Mac , as this process is performed automatically by Mac OS. <h> 1 . Upgrade to an SSD or Faster Hard Disk <p> A Solid State Storage ( SSD ) disk will massively improve your startup times , because your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly compared with a traditional magnetic disk . The random access time for an SSD is typically around 0.1 milliseconds , whereas for a hard drive its 5-10 milliseconds because the disk has to physically spin to locate the data . The MacBook Air already comes equipped with a fast SSD and boasts one of the fastest boot times of any modern computer . SSD disks are n't  cheap , but they are certainly a good investment to improve you Macs overall performance . <p> An alternative and cheaper option is to upgrade your Macs default hard disk ( likely a 5,400 rpm model ) to a much faster 7,200 rpm unit , which allows your computer to load applications and the operating system more quickly . A hard disk upgrade is n't a particularly easy task for novice users , but it will lead to a noticeable speed increase when starting and during daily use . <h> 2 . Remove Unwanted Startup Items and Fonts <p> Besides login items which run when every time you login to your Mac , there are system wide startup applications and daemons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . These items can be found in- the folder /Macintosh HD/Library/StartupItems/ <p> This folder is usually hidden so the best way to view it is to use SHIFT + COMMAND + G from- Finder and just type in the path above . Move any of the items which you feel are unnecessary or might be causing problems out of this folder , reboot and check to see whether the startup time has improved . Remember not to delete them in case you need to copy them back later on and , are absolutely sure they are not critical applications . <p> Another option which can improve startup time is to remove problematic or unnecessary fonts that may be installed on your Mac . <p> Open Font Book from the Applications folder or using Spotlight <p> Highlight any extraneous or problematic fonts <p> Right-click and select Remove- &lt;font&gt; or Remove &lt;font&gt; Family <p> However , be very careful not to remove essential system fonts because menus and other items may not display properly . <p> Remove unwanted or problematic fonts <h> 3 . Remove Unwanted Login Items <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to remove applications and processes which automatically start when you login . While removing these items may not decrease the actual start up time , you 'll see your desktop more quickly once you 've logged in as normal . <p> Its worth creating a copy of the login items preferences file first , which is at- **37;187;TOOLONG . The reason is that if you subsequently want to re-add any of the items , simply copy the original loginwindow.plist- file back into its original folder . <p> To prevent login items from running , follow the steps below . <p> Open System Preferences and select Users &amp; Groups <p> Click on your user name in the left hand window pane and the Login Items button on the right hand side <p> Remove any items ( such as iTunesHelper ) from the list using the button- to prevent them from running <p> If you have lots of applications in the list , removing them from the Login Items list should speed up your Mac considerably . <p> You can also prevent any application in the Dock from running at login as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Expand the Options menu and uncheck Open at Login <p> Disable login items from the Dock <h> 4 . Use Automatic Login and Disable Reopen Windows <p> In Mac OS X , the default behaviour is to show the login screen when the computer has booted up . This can be quite useful , but if there 's only one user it presents yet another step in the process of booting up before you get to the desktop . To skip the login screen and login automatically as any of the users on the system : <p> When you 've set automatic login your Mac will boot up and show the desktop automatically . One of the nice options in Mac OS X Lion is the ability to reopen any windows that you had open when logging back in . While this is a useful feature , it also slows the whole process down . To turn it off , the easiest method is to uncheck Reopen windows when logging back in- which appears on the shutdown window . <p> Login more quickly by disabling reopening of windows <h> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their Mac even when not used for weeks . Third party items such as scanners and printers have been known to cause slow startup times , especially if they are not working properly or check for updates when the computer is turned on . Disconnect any device that you do n't  intend to use immediately and connect later on when needed . <h> 6 . Use Disk Utility to Verify Your Hard Disk <p> Occasionally , errors on your Macs disk can lead to problems with its general operation which can also adversely affect startup times . Fortunately , its possible to check the disk and fix any errors encountered using Disk Utility as follows . <p> Open Disk Utility from Spotlight or within the Applications / Utilities folder <p> Select your Macintosh HD in the left hand column <p> In the right hand window pane , click Verify Disk . Mac OS checks the volume for errors and displays a short report . Any problems can usually be fixed using the Repair Disk option <p> This suggestion will only improve start up times if there is a disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hard drive is in good health . <p> Verify your Macintosh HD occasionally to check for errors <h> 7 . Periodically Check System Health <p> Its a good idea to check your Macs overall health occasionally to identify any persistent problems that may be impacting boot up times . <p> From the Apple Menu- choose About This Mac <p> Click on the More Info- button <p> Choose System Report- to list your Mac hardware . From here , its possible to see the status and properties of all the installed components , potentially highlighting any areas that might be a cause for concern <p> Its essential to keep your Mac up to date with the latest system updates , as Apple issues regular fixes for common problems that might also be related to a slow startup time . <p> Check your system health periodically <h> 8 . Use Sleep Mode Rather Than Reboot <p> Many PC to Mac converts do n't  realise that sleep mode is actually much better ( and faster ) than sleep mode on a PC when it resumes , your computer will be in exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid restarting in the first place , its a good habit to get into to simply close the lid of your Mac ( or press the power button ) and enter sleep mode , rather than shutting down . Many Mac users go for weeks without ever restarting their system , until a system update or application install requires a full reboot. <h> 9 . Add More Memory <p> If you only have an extremely small amount of memory installed , then adding more to your Mac can help it to start more quickly , plus it will feel much more responsive overall . For users with a decent amount of memory already , adding more wo n't do much to help your start up time , but your Mac will thank you for it anyway . <h> 10 . Recover Hard Disk Space <p> When your Macintosh HD is really full things tend to slow down significantly . Deleting old files and unnecessary items such as unused language packs can help you reclaim disk space and let you boot more quickly .

However , I would like to add my own experience . ( I have a Mid 2011 iMac ) <p> I think that in case of all Macs , slowing down of startup is almost inevitable even if you do n't  use it like crazy . My startup time almost doubled in two years and as of today ( 4 years ) , it is almost 3 to 4x the original startup time . I used to be worried before and searched like mad for solutions and tried all of them , but none seemed to bring it back to original . I think that 's because its almost impossible to do so . No matter what you do , your hard disks WILL become slower with time , get sluggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of course it will get even slower than that . SSD is the way to go if you REALLY want to boost startup . It is in fact the only way to improve it significantly . ( Based on my friends experience on a 13 ? MBP ) <p> Removing startup items makes a negligible difference . The Mac is smart enough to handle small iTunes and Adobe and Google startup files . They do n't  count much . But no harm is removing the clutter anyway . <p> Now , many people feel that RAM is a major issue . I would like to clarify this . I had 4 GB RAM and upgraded to 12 GB , expecting wonders . Guess what , wonders did happen but NOT in startup time . That remained almost exactly the same , but the overall performance , multitasking , app switching everything became buttery smooth . So install RAM if you want . It definitely helps your system but wont affect startup time ( unless you are at 2 gigs of RAM or less ) . <p> Finally , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep your mac clean and keeping the desktop clear ( everything tried by me ) , all have a broad effect on the OS speed , but usually WONT cause any significant , change in startup time . <p> So , the best thing is to accept that your beloved Mac is ageing like anything else and WILL deteriorate over time . If you can live with this and keep your Mac generally clean and healthy , it wont be an issue for many many years . ( My Mac once started up , still works as fast as it used to when new , which is quite incredible , I think ) <p> M Ch makes some good points , and it is certainly true that our computers age , but there is a much more specific reason than their simply becoming " sluggish and deteriorating . " A vast contributing factor to the reason that we experience slower computers as time goes on is because of the software " and more specifically the operating systems " we utilize . For example , new Apple computers in 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 10.7 , and those computers were built to run that version of the Mac OS optimally . Then , as time went on , new technological advances were built into future versions of Mac OS that would still work with those 2011 laptops ( for a while ) , but not as well as they would with new computers . And so the cycle continues . So ultimately , the speed decreases we usually experience are much more commonly due to advancements in the software we are running requiring more hardware power to run them at an optimal level because ultimately , we simply expect more from our technology today then we used to . 
@@22342820 @2342820/ <h> How to View and Kill Processes Using the Terminal in Mac OS X <p> Occasionally in Mac OS X , it may be necessary to force a program or process to quit . For example , if a particular program fails to respond or unexpectedly hangs . Every application on a Mac comprises of one or more processes . <p> Its usually possible to use the Force Quit- command ( GG esc ) in the Apple Menu , but only individual applications are listed in the Force Quit Applications window rather than all processes which are running on your computer . If you are new to using the OSX Terminal , I can recommend the Macintosh Terminal Pocket Guide by Daniel J. Barrett as a great way to get started . <p> The basic steps to check and kill a process are : <p> Open the Terminal application <p> List the running processes <p> Find the process you want to close <p> Kill the process <p> Each step is described in more detail below . <h> About Terminal <p> Probably the most useful tool to check and kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides access to the lower levels of the Mac OS X operating system and files . Terminal is a text-based tool which let 's you conduct all manner of routine tasks such as viewing directories , copying , moving and deleting files , as well as obtain detailed information about each process running including : <p> the process I 'd ( PID ) <p> the elapsed- time spent running <p> the command or application file path <h> About Activity Monitor <p> A related indispensable application is Activity Monitor - a graphical tool that allows you to manage processes , however it does n't  have quite the same capabilities that Terminal does . Activity Monitor shows common process-related details such as the memory used and percentage of CPU that each process is consuming . When used together , Activity Monitor and Terminal provide a powerful yet relatively straightforward way to inspect and manage wayward processes . <p> The main Activity Monitor window is shown below . <p> Each application on your Mac has an associated Process ID- ( a PID ) and a user-friendly name . From here you can inspect or quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monitor simply as a companion to Terminal . <p> The Apple Mail application is displayed in Activity Monitor with a PID number of 14649 . Note that process IDs are assigned by Mac OS , and therefore will not be the same on your computer as somebody elses . <p> The Activity Monitor Application <h> How to Use Terminal <p> The first step is to open Terminal either from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder or simply type Terminal into Spotlight . Terminal is always represented by the icon below . <p> Once it opens you 'll be presented with a standard Terminal window as below . <p> The first line shows the date and time when you last logged in . The second line is the command prompt- which is where you enter - the commands you wish to execute . The command prompt always begins with your computer name followed by your local Account Name . <p> The current directory ( the " working directory " ) when you open Terminal always defaults to your Home Folder . <h> Basic Terminal Commands <p> Before we describe how to check and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few basic Terminal commands . <p> To show the current folder name type- pwd <p> To list the files in the current folder type ls -l <p> To move into another folder type cd &lt;folder name&gt; <p> Note that many commands in Terminal can accept various options ( sometimes called switches ) that can alter their effect . The simplest way to discover the available command-line options is to type the command into Terminal followed by - ? such as ls - ? <p> Another useful command is apropos . Enter- apropos &lt;command&gt; into the Terminal window for a description of that command and its options . <h> To View All Processes <p> Type- ps -ax- at Terminals command prompt to list every process running , along with additional details such as the PID , the elapsed time running , and the process name and location ( shown in the CMD column ) <p> Running Processes Displayed <h> To Find a Specific Process <p> The process list displayed using ps -ax may include a hundred or more processes , but its quite simple to identify a process based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed as LONG ... or even by the PID if you already know it . <p> As shown in Activity Monitor earlier , the Mail application on my Mac had the PID 14649 , so its simple to scroll down the Terminal window until the relevant process is found . <p> One very useful command to help find a process by name or PID is grep- which can filter out the desired information . It can be used in conjunction with the ps -ax command to list only the process that you are interested in . <h> To Terminate ( Kill ) a Process <p> Once you know the process I 'd , killing it using Terminal is very simple . Be cautious however because forcing a process to suddenly exit can have unforeseen consequences , so its advisable to check carefully that the process you are about to kill is the correct one . There are essentially two easy ways to kill a process : <p> By PID : the simplest way is with the kill command followed by the PID , which causes the selected process to terminate immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and causes the process to exit immediately <p> By name : this method uses the- killall- command to kill all- the processes that contain that name . For example- killall Skype will terminate all the processes that have Skype in their name <p> Caution : killall should be used sparingly to avoid accidentally terminating the wrong processes . There is no confirmation prompt to ask if you really do wish to kill the processes , so check carefully beforehand . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <p> Thank you . The second ps command is the same as the first , I assume you copied and pasted it and forgot to change it to use the process i 'd . And kill or killall does n't  work in my case , most likely because my user ca n't see the process I am trying to kill . ps -ax was new to me , but I came to the site not only to find out how to list all processes , but to kill one of them not running in the shell I use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hangs after standby sometimes ) .

Unfortunately , over time Safaris performance can become noticeably degraded unless you follow a few simple measures to make sure it stays running like clockwork . Unfortunately the spinning beach ball can be an all too common and unwelcome sight . <p> To speed up Safari follow the tips below , and ensure you have the latest version installed because frequent updates can often resolve many of the most common performance-related issues . Its also worth remembering that the more memory you have installed in your Mac the better it can greatly speed up applications like Safari , so if your Mac only has 2 GB then consider treating it to an extra few GB of main memory . <p> If page loading times seem to be consistently very slow even after following these guidelines , its also worth checking your Internet connection speed on a website such as speedtest.net , to rule out possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Delete The Safari Preferences File <p> You can safely delete the Safari Preferences file because a new one will be created the next time you open the app . Deleting the preferences can help to speed things up because in rare cases it may have been corrupted . Note that unfortunately when you delete this file you 'll lose Safaris preferences such as Autofill and Homepage settings . <p> To delete Safaris preferences file : <p> 1 . Open Finder and navigate to the folder / Library / Preferences . The easiest way is to use CMD + SHIFT + G and copy the folders path into the drop-down box then hit Go . <p> 2 . Delete the file com.apple.Safari.plist <h> Clear Safaris History <p> Safari maintains a complete list of every single website you visit ( unless you 're in Private Browsing mode ) and if you use Safari a lot then the history can obviously grow quite large . A bloated history means that Safari has to manage and store much more , so it can have a negative effect on its overall speed . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the General tab in Preferences . <p> To delete your entire history , just select Clear History from Safaris- History menu- followed by the Clear button when prompted . Alternatively , make sure the Clear history checkbox is ticked when doing a full reset . <p> Clear Safari 's history <h> Check and Disable Safari Extensions <p> Even though extensions and plugins are useful to accomplish many tasks such as blocking ads , occasionally they can cause Safari to become slow and unresponsive , or even crash . Its wise to make sure all the extensions are up to date , and if you 're having any issues then disable those you do n't  use , or turn them on one by one and see if it makes a difference . <p> Extensions such as AdBlock- are extremely useful , but some have been known to affect Safaris performance . Check them separately to see which one may be the culprit . You could even install a plugin blocker such as ClickToPlugin , which stops Safari from launching any plugin automatically . Browser plugins such as Flash , QuickTime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually selected to launch with the correct plugin . <p> To control which extensions are enabled in Safari , follow the steps below . <p> 1 . Open Safaris preferences using CMD + , - or from the Safari menu . <p> 2 . Go to the Extensions tab and turn off whichever extensions you do n't  need or those you think may be causing speed issues . You can either enable/disable- all- extensions with the slider switch , or select an individual extension in the left-hand side panel and use the Enable &lt;extension name&gt; checkbox in the main window . <p> To update individual extensions , click Updates- at the bottom left of the side panel beneath the list of extensions . <p> Check and disable Safari Extensions <h> Update Plugins and Java <p> Many in-page plugins such as Flash and Java can slow Safari down considerably . Its always wise to make sure they 're completely up to date , which does n't  necessarily happen automatically and not always via software update either . For each plugin ( such as Flash ) , right-click on the plugin that appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings are shown . Alternatively , go to the relevant website for each plugin and follow the instructions to update it . <p> For the latest Java updates , check the Apple website here and Software Update . <h> Quit and Relaunch Safari <p> Sometimes , a speed issue in Safari can be resolved simply by quitting and restarting . The reason is that over time , Safari tends to use up system memory and unfortunately memory leaks can cause the amount used to gradually grow taking up valuable system resources that are needed by Mac OS and other apps . Its possible to avoid such issues by relaunching Safari occasionally . <h> Completely Reset Safari <p> A full reset of Safari is able to fully restore it to the original settings . This way , every issue you might be experiencing should be fixed but its important to note that a reset causes you to lose your history , top sites , preferences and saved form data . Its possible to reset everything in one fell swoop or selectively choose the items to reset .

Its designed to speed things up but the trouble is it can quickly grow very large and actually slow down Safari . If you have a very fast Internet connection , the caches usefulness also diminishes . Its generally good practice to empty the cache occasionally if you 're a very regular user then once a week should be sufficient . <p> To empty Safaris cache is simple : <p> 1 . From the Safari menu choose Empty Cache . <p> 2 . Choose Empty when prompted to confirm . <p> Block Flash content <h> Block Flash Content <p> Flash content such as video and animations can provide a great user experience and interactivity , however Flash has been criticised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be somewhat more efficient but if you can live without it , block all Flash content ( and use HTML5 instead ) through the use of plugins such as ClickToFlash . Many suitable extensions can be found on the Safari extensions website . <h> Disable Or Streamline AutoFill <p> Autofill conveniently stores your names , passwords and other details such as login information for hundreds of websites that you may visit . It shouldnt make much difference to how quickly Safari runs in most situations , but on startup and when filling in forms there will be a small performance hit when its used . <p> If you do n't  need the convenience then Autofill can be disabled . Alternatively just remove the details for sites that you rarely or never visit . <p> 1 . Open Preferences from the Apple menu and select the AutoFill tab . <p> 2 .

However , some people who have installed Lion may wish to revert back to Snow Leopard simply because they prefer its look and feel , or because they have issues with Lion that can not be resolved . For example , some older applications simply wont run on Lion and so the ability to revert to Snow Leopard can be useful . Fortunately the process to downgrade from Lion to Snow Leopard is quite simple , but it depends on a several factors such as whether you 've already made have a backup of your pre-Lion system and files . <p> Here are some of the alternative ways to revert from Lion to Snow Leopard . <h> METHOD 1 : Clean Wipe and Install <p> This method is a good way to totally reset your Mac and clear out any old files and applications that might be slowing your computer down . This default new installation will delete everything on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leopard , so its important to backup your user files before you begin . <p> You will need a Snow Leopard installation disk ( e.g. the one that came with your computer ) and an external hard drive in order to backup your important files . Note this method also removes the system restoration partition created by Lion . <p> Follow the steps below . <p> 1 . Backup all your documents and files to an external hard drive . This is necessary to keep all your documents , music , videos and such . If they 're not stored in the default folders , remember to find them and include them in the backup . You will need to copy them back onto your Mac manually later on . <p> 2 . Insert the Snow Leopard installation disk , restart you computer and hold down the- OPTION- key when you hear the boot chime <p> 3 . Choose Mac OS X Install DVD when the list of options is displayed <p> 4 . When the installer opens , do n't  proceed with the installation but go to the Utilities menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the drive that contains Lion , select it and click on the Partition tab <p> 10 . Run Software Update to make sure your Mac is fully up to date . You will also need to re-install any applications <h> METHOD 2 : Restore From Time Machine <p> Downgrading using Time Machine is probably the easiest way to go back to Snow Leopard , because it returns the OS , applications and files exactly back to the state they were in before you installed Lion . You will be able to choose from various save points , so its easy to find one that corresponds to the earlier installation . <p> Note that if you 've only just upgraded to Lion and follow this procedure , all your up to date files and folders will be intact , but if you 've been running Lion for some time then you 'll also need to manually copy any files that may have changed since you installed Lion . <p> Follow the process below to install Snow Leopard from Time Machine . <p> 1. - Backup- your documents and files to an external hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- OPTION- key when you hear the chime <p> 3 .

Figure out what 's keeping macOS awake <p> If your Mac is stood idle for a significant period of time , then you 'll usually want it to drift off to sleep . <p> Not only does sleeping help preserve your Mac 's battery life , but it 's also an important security feature that can help keep the contents of your Mac safe from prying eyes . <p> Assuming that you 've password-protected your Mac ( and you really should ! ) once your Mac has been asleep for a significant period of time , it 'll go into lockdown and you 'll need to enter a password before you can continue using it . This is a handy security feature if you 're in the bad habit of wandering off and leaving your Mac running , at which point anyone in the area could potentially access your Mac and its contents . <p> Hopefully , the worst that 'll happen is your colleague or housemate plays a practical joke on you , but even discovering that someone has been posting strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sleep is a useful feature , but sometimes your Mac may simply refuse to go to sleep , no matter how long it 's been stood without user input .

Any processes that are marked with a Yes ' have the potential to prevent your Mac from going to sleep , so you should close the related app and then see whether this has solved your problem . <h> Investigating with the Terminal <p> If you ca n't spot any obvious culprits in the Activity Monitor , then it 's time to dig a little deeper . <p> The macOS system supports a feature called power assertions , which programs can invoke if they need to prevent the system from going to sleep . <p> You can check whether any of these sleep assertions are currently active , by launching your Mac 's Terminal .

In this- article- I 'll show you how to add voice-recognition to your Mac so that you can enjoy a similar hands-free experience on your desktop.Dragon Express- is one of the easiest ways to enable voice recognition on your Mac . The package is currently- available- on Mac App Store- for only -34.99 . After a brief install and 1.21GB of space the app with give you access to a robust and simple array of voice-recognition features . Its recommended that you use an external microphone headset , but after ensuring that there was minimal ambient noise the internal microphone on my MacBook Air worked without a hitch . <p> After a quick training process , in which you read a piece of text to the App so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the main window of Dragon Express . Unlike its pricier sibling Dragon Dictate , which allows you to dictate text directly in most - Mac- applications , - you 'll be using this window to process voice-to-text and then using the commands in the above image to send the processed text to a variety of sources . This minor- inconvenience does make the transition form keyboard to voice input a little jarring , but unless you 're prepared to pay up to four times as much for full- integration its worth working around this small issue . <p> Once you get used to the set of verbal commands used to access the features of Dragon Express the process of- diction becomes a breeze .

A small feature but certainly one that would be useful to social-media obsessed fans who want to quickly and easily update their statuses whilst in the middle of other activities . <p> Overall Dragon Express is the cheapest , simplest and easiest way to add voice-recognition to you Mac . It does n't  have the same features as Apples own Siri , and lacks full- integration- with pre-existing- Mac Apps , but if you 're looking for a way to transform spoken language into text on your Mac Dragon Express seems to be the way to go . <p> GAgoogleFillSlot ( " 100postsBigBanner " ) ; 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

@@22342835 @2342835/ <h> Mastering Split View in OS X El Capitan <p> Split- View is a new window- management feature in El Capitan , that makes it much simple to run two apps side by side in full screen mode . Apple introduced what it called " Spaces " ( in other words , virtual desktops ) in OS X many years ago , and Split View is a natural enhancement- that behaves almost identically on iOS too . <p> Spaces is one of the best ways to switch between windows , and is one of those features that MacBook owners in particular get the most of , as they 're the users who are most likely to be running apps in full screen mode due to the limited screen space . People with the latest 5K iMac- are probably content with opening- several apps on-screen , but that 's a luxury that- owners of smaller screen devices do n't  have . <p> However , the downside of Spaces is that it does n't  make it simple to switch back and forth between apps all those sliding windows can be quite tiresome if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking notes , for example. - This is where Split View comes into its own . <h> Using Split View <p> Using Split View is very straightforward . There are a couple of ways to use it , all of which should become fairly intuitive once you 've done it a couple of times . <p> Let 's start with a simple example , arranging two windows side by side in this case well use Safari on one side of the screen and add another app to the other side . <p> Open Safari ( or another app of your choice ) and enter full screen mode either by pressing the green traffic light button , or by using the keyboard shortcut which is Control + Command + F. <p> Next , go back to the Finder- and open whatever other app you wo n't to use as the second app . In this example , well- just use a Finder window . <p> Next , swipe upwards on your trackpad with three fingers to show your available spaces . In El Capitan , a single swipe upwards does n't  show a graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of each space shown as text : <p> You can however just move your cursor to the top of the screen which expands the spaces and shows little graphics of each one . This step is n't really necessary as the next step will automatically do that in any case . <p> The next step , is to grab the Finder window and move it to the space you want to use Split View with . In this example , just move the Finder window onto the Safari- space , after which you 'll see the Finder window in miniature in the Spaces bar , and Safari squeezes over to one side . <p> If you move your cursor ( while still holding down the mouse button or trackpad ) , you can move the selected window left or right on any of the spaces to select the left or right side of the split view . A " + " icon shows which side of the space the window will be positioned : <p> You can of course just ( while holding down your mouse button ) move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View action . <p> Once you have the window on the desired space and the side you want , just release your mouse to drop the window into the Space . The space is not activated by default : you still need to then switch to that space using the familiar three finger swipe left/right , or by clicking on it in the list of Spaces at the top of your screen . <p> Its also possible to just drag any window- " off the top " of your screen , at which point the Spaces view appears and let 's you drop the app into any space to active Split View . This might take a bit of practice , as its a case of dragging the app to the top of the screen and then moving up further until the Spaces view activates , much in the same way that- you would access the Dock in fullscreen mode by dragging your mouse to the very bottom of the screen then pulling down further . <p> By default , Split View- arranges- the new app occupying two-thirds of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> You can resize split to- your liking though by hovering your mouse on the- narrow vertical black bar that separates the two apps . A cursor then appears indicating possible- directions you can drag the divider- to resize both apps . Unfortunately , that cursor is n't captured- when taking a screenshot , but it looks similar to my- rather crudely post-processed image- below . A double-headed cursor is shown when its possible to move- the divider in either direction . <p> In El Capitan , you can- adjust the amount of horizontal space the apps take up in any way you like , - so you could for example have a 50/50 split , or as little as 25/75 or anywhere in between . Its not possible though to have an app occupy less than a quarter of the screen width : <p> For some reason when you resize the apps , one of the windows appears blurred : <p> Quite why this happens is unknown its a nice effect and so it might be purely- for cosmetic reasons . It should be technically possible- not to blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice UI tweak in a future update . <p> If you wish to return either of the apps- back to the normal , windowed mode ( i.e. not in fullscreen ) just use the green traffic light button again ( or Control + Command + F- with the desired app selected ) to return it to a normal desktop view : <p> The other app that remains in fullscreen mode will return to- use the full width of the screen , and the app that you sent back to the Desktop will return to its original position before you put it into Split View mode . <p> That 's really all there is to using Split View in El Capitan . Its a really useful feature for people that want to use two apps simultaneously , and its definitely more flexible than the iOS version ( though that 's also a welcome addition to Apples mobile devices ) . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

@@22342842 @2342842/ <h> 7 Easy Ways of Transferring iPhone Photos to Your Mac <p> Smartphone cameras have come a long way in recent years , to the point where digital camera sales have dropped off dramatically and iPhones are no different . If you own an iPhone , then you pretty much have digital camera-worthy software and hardware within arm 's reach , all day , everyday . <p> It 's no surprise then , that we 're all taking more photos than ever before . The downside is that your typical smartphone has a pretty limited internal memory , and letting your camera roll spiral out of control is a surefire way to burn through that memory at an alarming rate . <p> If you enjoy taking photos with your iPhone , then sooner or later you 're going to have to spend some time sorting through all those photos deleting the ones you 're not keen on , and transferring the ones you do want to keep , to a device that has a larger memory than your typical smartphone . For many Apple fans , your Mac is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can often feel like one of those irritating tasks that 's all too easy to keep putting off . <p> In this article , I 'm , going to be sharing a list of techniques and tools that can take the pain out of moving photos from your iPhone to your Mac no matter how many photos you 're working with . <p> Note , although this article focuses on transferring photos from an iPhone , most of these techniques can also be applied to the iPad , so if you 've been known to snap the occasional photo on your tablet , then these techniques will work for you , too . <h> Using a USB Cable <p> Sometimes the old methods are the best , so the first technique we 're going to look at it simply attaching your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable . <p> Once you 've made this connection , your Mac 's Photos ' app should launch automatically and take you straight to the Import ' page where you 'll see all the photos and videos that are currently stored on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photo , you may want to delete the original from your iPhone , particularly if your iPhone is running low on memory . You can tell Photos to delete the original automatically , by selecting the Delete after import ' checkbox . <p> Then , either select the individual photos you want to transfer and give the Import ( number ) selected ' button a click , or import the entire contents of your camera roll by selecting the Import All Photos ' button . <h> Using Image Capture <p> Although Photos may be the first program that springs to mind when you think about Mac photo management software , your Mac actually comes with one another image management app that shares many similarities with the Photos application . <p> This Image Capture ' app may pre-date Photos , but it still comes in handy if you want to transfer photos to your Mac without automatically importing them into the main Photos library . <p> To see what Image Capture has to offer , navigate to your Mac 's Applications ' folder and launch the Image Capture ' app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable , then make sure your iPhone is selected in Image Capture 's left-hand menu . At this point you 'll see a list of all the photos stored on your iPhone , complete with some technical information about each file , such as its size and aperture settings . <p> Specify where you want your images to be saved , using the Import to ' dropdown at the bottom of the Image Capture window . Then , you can either select the individual photos you want to import , or if you want to transfer the entire contents of your iPhone 's camera roll , give the Import All ' button a click . <h> Using Email or Messages <p> If you only need to transfer a few photos , then is it really worth going to all that effort of hunting down your USB cable ? <p> It may not be particularly high-tech , but sending images to yourself as an email or Messages attachment is a quick and easy way of transferring a handful of photos to your Mac . It can also come in handy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want to transfer to your Mac , but you 're currently nowhere near your computer just message the photo to yourself and it 'll be waiting for you to download when you get home . <p> To send a photo via Messages or Mail , simply open the photo in question on your iPhone , then click the Share ' icon and select either Messages ' or Mail . ' This will create a new message with your selected photo already attached at this point , all you need to do is enter your email address and click Send . ' <h> Using AirDrop <p> If you only want to transfer a small number of images , then AirDrop is another quick and easy option . To transfer a photo using AirDrop : <p> Make sure your Mac and your iPhone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network . <p> Enable AirDrop on your iPhone by swiping up from the bottom of the screen , tapping the AirDrop ' tab and then selecting Everyone . ' <p> Open a Finder ' window on your Mac and select AirDrop ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discovered by ' link and select Everyone ' from the dropdown . <p> Rinse and repeat for every photo you want to transfer and do n't forget to disable AirDrop once you 've finished ! <h> Import with Preview <p> The Preview app is n't just useful for taking a closer look at your photos , you can also use it to import the photo you 're currently viewing . While this may not be particularly practical if you have a long list of photos that you want to transfer to your Mac , it can be a handy shortcut if you 're only interested in the cream of the crop , and want to scrutinise each and every photo before deciding whether you want to transfer it to your Mac . <p> If you do decide that you want to transfer an image you 're currently viewing in Preview , then select File ' from the menu bar , followed by Import from camera ' or Import from phone ' <h> Using iCloud <p> While all of the previously-mentioned methods are fairly straightforward , there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac : let iCloud do all the hard work for you ! <p> With a little bit of setup , your iPhone can automatically upload every photo and video you take , to your iCloud account . At this point , you 'll be able to access all these photos on any Apple device that 's connected to this iCloud account including your Mac . Any edits you make to these photos are also automatically replicated across all your connected Apple devices , so you 'll always have access to the most up to date version of each image . <p> If you like the sound of letting iCloud do all the heavy lifting for you , then you have two options : <p> iCloud Photo Library . Automatically uploads all the photos and videos from your iPhone , to your iCloud account . Just be aware that you 're uploading the entire contents of your camera roll to iCloud , which can quickly eat into your iCloud storage allowance . When you sign up for an iCloud account , you automatically get 5GB of free storage , which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly snap-happy then at some point you may find yourself having to purchase additional storage <p> My Photo Stream . Similar to iCloud Photo library , this feature automatically uploads every photo you take with your iPhone to your iCloud account , but the crucial difference is that these are only stored in your account for 30 days . Before this time limit is up , you 'll need to import any photos that you want to store on your Mac although note that these photos wo n't be deleted from your iPhone after 30 days , they 'll simply be removed from your iCloud account . This is a great way of making sure you iCloud account does n't end up cluttered with unwanted photos , plus any media you upload via the My Photo Stream wo n't count towards your 5GB of free iCloud storage . <p> Once either of these features are enabled , you 'll also be able to access your iCloud photos from non-Apple devices , by launching a web browser , logging into your iCloud account and then opening the online Photos app . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd , so if you do n't have one already then now 's the time to create one . You 'll also need to be logged into the same iCloud account on both your iPhone and your Mac : <h> iCloud Photo Library <p> To make sure all of these photos are available on your Mac , launch your Mac 's Photos ' app and then select Photos &gt; Preferences ' from the menu bar . Select the iCloud ' tab and make sure that iCloud Photo Library ' is selected . <p> Any content that gets uploaded from your iPhone to your iCloud account will now appear in this app automatically . <p> While you have the Photos &gt; Preferences ' menu open , there 's some additional options you might want to enable : <p> Download originals to this Mac . Automatically downloads a high-def version of every photo and video stored in iCloud , to your Mac 's hard drive . Just be aware that if you regularly take lots of photos , then enabling this option can quickly eat into your Mac 's memory . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos , to your Mac 's hard drive . Note that if you select this option , the high-res originals will still be available via your iCloud account and on your iPhone , so you always have the option of downloading the original if you 're craving a high-resolution version of a particular image . <h> My Photo Stream <p> Once you enable my Photo Stream , all your photos will be uploaded to iCloud with a 30 day limit . <p> To enable this feature on your iPhone , launch the Settings ' app , then select iCloud &gt; Photos &gt; My Photo Stream . ' Next , make sure these automatically-uploaded photos appear on your Mac by completing the following steps : <p> Click the Apple ' logo in your Mac 's menu bar , then select System preferences ' followed by iCloud ' and Photos . ' <p> Click the Options ' button , and make sure My Photo Stream ' is enabled . <p> Launch the Photos ' app on your Mac and select Photos &gt; Preferences ' from the menu bar . <p> Select iCloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You 'll now be able to access these photos on your Mac via the Photos ' app . <h> Try a third party app <p> If none of the above options quite meet your needs , then there 's no shortage of third party data transfer tools that you might want to try . One possible solution is AnyTrans , which promises to transfer 100 pictures in under 4 seconds . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

However it 's not impossible for hardware to fail or become faulty , so if you suspect your MacBook is acting up due to a hardware issue , then this article is for you ! <p> In this article , I 'm going to show you how to use your MacBook 's built-in tools to check your hardware for faults , as well as sharing lots of advice on how to quickly and easily find technical support online , so you can fix any hardware issues you do discover . <p> But before we get started , let 's take a few moments to check that the problems you 're experiencing really are hardware-related . <h> Rule out the most likely suspects <p> Faulty hardware is less common than faulty software , so it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before you resort to running hardware tests . <p> Most of the time , you can zero in on misbehaving software simply by tracking the error over time and making notes whenever the error occurs . Every time your MacBook starts acting strange , make a list of all the apps and programs that are running , and jot down what you were doing leading up to the error , for example were you trying to launch an app or access a particular in-app feature ? <p> Once you 've finished your note-taking , look for any patterns that might point towards a particular app or piece of software being the culprit . If you have a likely suspect , then remove that app from the equation by uninstalling or disabling it , and then spend some time interacting with your laptop to see whether this has resolved the problem . <p> If you 're struggling to spot a pattern , then consider whether you made any software changes immediately before these errors started happening . Did you install a new app , or update an existing one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make any changes to the operating system , such as installing a new version ? <p> If you did make any software changes , then try to reverse them ( where possible ) and see whether this has any impact on your MacBook 's performance . If it does , then chances are the app or software was to blame all along . <h> Gathering Information <p> We touched on this in the previous section , but whenever you 're experiencing issues with your MacBook ( or any technology in general ) you should gather as much information about the issue as possible . This is important , for two reasons : <p> If you fully understand an issue , then you may be able to fix it yourself . With more - information and support available online than ever before , if you need advice on how to do anything then the Internet should always be your first port of call , and fixing your MacBook 's hardware is no exception . If you gather enough information , then finding a relevant Apple support document , blog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as booting up your favourite web browser and performing a quick search . You may even uncover a thread where users are discussing exactly the issue you 've been experiencing they may even be debating different fixes that worked for them ! Even if an Internet search does n't lead you to detailed instructions on how to fix your laptop , then you can reach out to the world wide web for help directly by posting your problem to a Q and A site such as Stackoverflow or Quora . If you do decide to post your problem online , then make sure you share all the information you 've gathered ( within reason do n't give away any personal data ! ) as vague questions tend to attract vague answers . <p> The more info you have , the more specific you can be when speaking to technical specialists . If it turns out that fixing your particular issue is beyond your expertise , then you may decide to enlist the help of a specialist . Even if you do go down this route , the more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to resolve your problem . <p> If you followed the advice in the previous section , then you 'll already have a list of all the apps that are running whenever the error occurs , as well as events leading up to the error all of which is valuable information . <p> You should expand on this by making a note of any error messages or alerts that your Mac displays , particularly if they contain error codes . Also , consider whether you made any hardware changes around the time your MacBook started to misbehave . Did you install , upgrade or remove a piece of hardware ? Do n't forget to take any peripheral devices into account ! <p> But the most important information you can gather about a potential hardware error , comes from your MacBook 's built-in hardware diagnostics tools . <h> Apple Diagnostics <p> If your MacBook was released after June 2013 , then you can inspect your laptop 's hardware using Apple Diagnostics ( if your MacBook pre-dates June 2013 , then skip ahead to the Apple Hardware Test section ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices except your MacBook 's Ethernet adapter , if you 're using one . You should also make sure you 're connected to the Internet wherever possible , as Apple Diagnostics can use this connection to recommend relevant Apple Support pages based on any errors it does find . Finally , make sure your MacBook is connected to a power source , because the last thing you want is to run out of battery halfway through an important test . <p> To access Apple Diagnostics , start your MacBook and hold the D ' key until a Checking your Mac ' screen appears . Apple Diagnostics will launch and run a basic test . <p> If Apple Diagnostics does n't detect anything wrong with your hardware , it 'll display a No issues found ' message . ( Note , if this happens and you 're still baffled about what 's wrong with your MacBook , then your best bet is to take another look at your notes to check you have n't missed something important , or you can reach out to either a technical specialist or the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If Apple Diagnostics does detect a fault , then it 'll display some information about whatever fault it 's found , along with a reference code and instructions on how to resolve this issue . If your MacBook is connected to the Internet , then Apple Diagnostics may also recommend sections of the Apple Support &amp; Service website that you should take a look at . To view these pages , click the Get Started ' link . <p> If Apple Diagnostics does n't recommend any articles , or provide you with instructions on how to fix the error , then make a note of the error code so you can enter it into a search engine and perform your own research once you 've exited the Apple Diagnostics tool . To exit Apple Diagnostics , you just need to click the Restart ' or Shut Down ' button . <h> Apple Hardware Test <p> If your MacBook was released before June 2013 , then you 'll need to use Apple Hardware Test ( AHT ) instead . Once again , disconnect all external devices except the Ethernet adapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power supply . You can then boot into AHT by restarting your MacBook while holding the D ' key until the AHT console appears . <p> If AHT detects an error , then it wo n't be able to recommend any support pages , however it will display an error code , which should be all you need . <p> Once you have your error code , you can exit Apple Diagnostics by clicking either the Restart ' or Shut Down ' icon . <h> Generating a System Report <p> If AHT/Apple Diagnostics identifies a problem with your hardware , then it should provide you with all the information and links you need to understand and ( hopefully ) fix the error yourself . - However , sometimes you may need to gather more information about your MacBook 's hardware setup , for example if it turns out you need to replace a component , then you may need to check exactly what make/model/version of this component your MacBook is using . <p> You 'll find all this information in your MacBook 's built-in System Information ' tool . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Mac 's menu bar , then hold the Option ' key to uncover a hidden System Information ' option ( this may appear as System Profiler ' on older MacBooks ) . <p> Select System Information , ' and then select Hardware ' from the left-hand menu to view all the different hardware categories everything from Audio to USB . <p> Select any category from the left-hand menu to view detailed information about any components installed on your MacBook that fall under this category . <p> Although the System Information tool is useful for discovering more information about hardware components you may need to replace or update , it can also be useful if you decide to enlist the help of a technical specialist . Typically , the more information you can provide tech support with , the better , so you may want to generate a report of all the System Information data and then share this file with your specialist . <p> You can generate a system report by selecting File ' from the Mac menu bar , followed by Save ' 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342848 @2342848/ <h> How to Find IP Addresses of Devices on Your Local Network <p> There are times when it can be handy to know which other devices are on your local network . For example , suppose that you need to know whether a certain device ( such as a computer , tablet or router ) is up and running and responding . If you have a PC or Mac , you can just go to the relevant network setting to see what the IP address is , but some devices such as printers and mobile phones do n't  always provide an easy way to do that . <p> Fortunately , there is a very useful command built into Terminal in Mac OS X called- ping- that can be used to do just that . Ping can be used either in the command line form , or from within Network Utility , and there are also lots of other free apps which can help you to build up a local network map by way of using the ping command . <p> This article shows you how to determine the IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How to Use Ping <p> The first thing to do is open Terminal from within the- Applications- -&gt;- Utilities- folder , or just type Terminal into Spotlight ( CMD- +- SPACEBAR ) and click on the icon when its found . <p> Once Terminal is open , you can try out the- ping- command by typing an example at the command prompt . Just type- ping www.google.com- ( and hit- Enter ) or any other website address and you should see some results appear that indicate the website ( or individual server ) is responding . <p> Something akin to the following should be displayed : <p> Use the Ping command in Terminal to see all the devices present on your local network <p> The items of particular interest are the- IP address- ( which is the dotted decimal address in four parts that identifies a machine on the network ) and the response time in milliseconds , which is how long the ping took to complete . In general , the further away the machine is ( or the slower the network its connected to ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command just repeats forever until you press- CTRL + C- to stop it . Some versions of UNIX ( on which OS X is based ) include a special version of ping which let 's you send a broadcast message that every device receiving it will respond to . Unfortunately , OS X does not include this version , but there is another way to get most devices to respond . <p> You need to know 2 things : <p> Your machines IP address <p> Your subnet mask <p> Both of these items can be found in the- Network- section in- System Preferences . Open System Preferences and click the- Network- icon , then select the TCP/IP tab at the top as shown below : <p> Your IP and MAC addresses are shown in Network settings <p> In my case , the IP address is 192.168.2.100 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 . <p> Now , you need to look for any 0 values in the subnet mask , turn them into 255 , and put them into the same position in the IP address field , and then ping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zero in the fourth position so my " special " ping address will be 192.168.2.255 . <p> Now just enter this address into the ping command in Terminal , for example : <p> ping 192.168.2.255 <p> Every device on your local network should respond to this ping . Note however that some devices and computers may be configured- not- to respond to ping requests . <p> After running this command , I see the following output : <p> Ping the special address to see what machines respond <p> In this case only one machine on my home network has actually responded ( on 192.168.2.101 ) . <p> There is also an alternative command called- arp- ( Address Resolution Protocol ) which can be used to find out about every device on the local network . Type- arp -a- into Terminal and you 'll see a response similar to the following that lists all known devices . <p> The ARP command can be used to discover local network devices <p> The machine at 192.168.2.104 is actually a PC ( ! ) on my local network . There 's a useful bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the MAC address basically the physical hardware address of the network adapter on each machine , which can also help you identify each computer . In this case , the MAC address is- e8:3:9a:37:66:22 .

@@22342849 @2342849/ <h> What is Virtual Memory on the Mac ? <p> You may have heard the term virtual memory used in the context of your Mac , but what exactly does it do and why is it necessary ? There are many mechanisms used by Mac OS X to manage the system resources of your computer , and virtual memory is just one of those techniques . <p> This article provides a brief overview of virtual memory , and shows how you can find out how much your Mac is using , and even what you can do to help your Mac attain the best performance possible . <h> So What is Virtual Memory ? <p> Your Mac comes with a limited amount of physical memory ( RAM ) installed by default . Memory is critical to any computer to run applications and carry out all the operations commanded by the user . Memory must be as fast as possible ( and it helps to have as much as possible ) to maximise your Macs performance ; thankfully , prices have drastically fallen in recent years . Nevertheless , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X might actually need to use more than is physically available on your system . <p> This is where virtual memory comes in you can think of it as a kind of extension to the real memory on your system , albeit much slower because it is in fact physical space on your hard disk ( or SSD , if you have one installed ) . Let 's say that you have 4 GB of main memory on your Mac and a 512 GB hard disk . If Mac OS X needs to use all 4 GB of main memory , it can still make use of any free space on your hard disk as an extension to that memory . Unfortunately , virtual memory is much slower than the physical RAM installed in your computer , because hard disks can not match the speed of memory chips . <h> Why is Virtual Memory So Important ? <p> Virtual memory can be critical to your Mac , simply because there often is n't enough physical memory to run all the apps that you have open . As I 'm writing this article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messages , Skype , Activity Monitor , Mail , and Finder ) and many processes . All those apps need a certain amount of memory allocated to run effectively in my case , they 're using 4.43 GB of my Macs RAM , and the more apps that are open , the more memory will be used . <p> If all the memory is used up , my computer will start to use virtual memory and the whole machine will see a marked decrease in performance . Have you ever seen the spinning beach ball in Safari ? That often happens when you 've run out of memory and virtual memory is being used . <h> How Much Virtual Memory is My Mac Using ? <p> There 's an easy way to find out how much memory your Mac is using and to check the virtual memory usage , as well as other information such as the number of " page outs " and " page ins " . The important term here is- page ins , because it gives in an indication of how much virtual memory is being used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood , open up Activity Monitor this is an incredibly useful native app that lives in the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder . When it opens , go to the System Memory section to view more details about the memory usage . Click on the Real Mem column to sort the list based on the amount of memory being used . <p> Inspect how much virtual memory is being used using Activity Monitor <p> At the bottom of the main window , there are some details about the available memory , as well as the virtual memory size , the number of page ins and page outs . In my case , you 'll see that I have 8 GB of memory installed ( thanks to a recent upgrade from 4GB ) , and 181.37 GB of space allocated to virtual memory . This means that even if I use all 8 GB of memory , there is more space available based on the free space on my hard disk ( my disk is 256 GB ) . Unfortunately , many applications such as Safari and iTunes seem to gobble up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to check with Activity Monitor from time to time and decide whether to close a few apps or even restart your Mac . <p> Notice in the screenshot below that no page outs have occurred , the reason being that my memory capacity is sufficient to run all the apps I have open without needing to use any virtual memory . If I had n't  upgraded to 8 GB of RAM however , its pretty obvious that my memory would already be full and the virtual memory would be in use , along with lots of page outs there would probably be a noticeable slowdown in performance . <h> Improve Your Macs Performance <p> So how can you maximise your Macs performance in terms of memory , avoiding the use of virtual memory unless absolutely essential ? <p> The simplest way by far is to increase the amount of RAM installed in your Mac . Most Macs these days come with around 4 GB of main memory , which is more than adequate , but if you 're a power user or frequently run dozens of apps or do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 GB is a decent step up for a MacBook Pro . Keeping as few apps open as necessary and regularly restarting apps that hog memory is definitely advisable . There are even apps available on the Mac App Store that will help you reclaim back memory unused by applications check out the article here . <p> Physical memory prices have come down in recent years , and its now possible to buy two 4 GB sticks of RAM for around -30 ( its far cheaper to buy RAM after you 've bought your Mac from companies such as Crucial than to buy it from Apple , and installation is extremely easy ) . - Perhaps the best way to improve your Macs overall performance is to buy an SSD drive . Even if your Mac does use virtual memory , an SSD is many times faster than a traditional spinning hard disk as it contains no moving parts , so the combination of extra memory and an SSD can make it feel like you have an entirely new , faster computer . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

If you 'd rather watch TV streamed over the Internet instead , then check out our other guide for the best software-based TV solutions . <p> This article describes a few of the best TV tuners for the Mac perhaps surprisingly there are n't  that many options available , especially compared to the amount that are available for the PC , but the following tuners should be more than sufficient for most peoples needs . <h> 1 . Elgato EyeTV Diversity <p> Elgato seems to make most of the TV tuners available for the Mac , and if you want to watch digital terrestrial TV ( known as DVB-T ) , analogue TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EyeTV Hybrid might just fulfil your needs .

Spotlight can do all that and so much more , and there 's now a whole lot to like about it in Yosemite . <p> If you 're already familiar with using Spotlight on OS X Mavericks or earlier versions , you can skip straight to the Tips section further down this article . <h> How to setup Spotlight- search results <p> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its settings so you can control what results are shown , and the order of those results. - For example , suppose that you do n't  want to display any email messages- in searches , you can just disable those but keep everything else . <p> You will be shown- a checklist of items ( shown below ) that will be displayed in your- search results , such as Applications , Documents , Folders and many more . Simply check or uncheck the ones you are interested in . Note also that its possible to move the order of each item , to place- those results nearer the top . <p> Spotlight can be configured to only display certain types of results . <p> Note that you can also change the Spotlight keyboard shortcut on this screen- from- the dropdown list , as well as the shortcut to open a new Finder window for searches . <p> If you want to limit the locations- used to search , click on the Privacy tab and use the- + icon at the bottom to add folders to the ignore list : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Privacy tab . <h> How to use Spotlight <p> Activate Spotlight by using- the- Command- and- Space keys together , or just click on the small magnifying glass in your menu bar . <p> The first thing you 'll notice is that- instead of being hidden away in the corner of your screen , Spotlight now takes centre stage in the middle of your desktop . Its- now much more visible , and even appears on top of other windows when you 're in full screen mode . <p> Spotlight now takes centre stage in the middle of your screen . <h> Spotlight Tips <p> Now that you 're familiar with the basics , here are some useful- tips and tricks to- help you get the most out of Spotlight in OS X Yosemite . <p> Note that , depending upon your location , - some of the- new features such as Spotlight Suggestions may not work , as its currently- restricted to certain countries . <h> Tip 1 : - instant calculator and unit conversions <p> If you need the results of a calculation quickly , its far quicker just to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will take you back to the desktop . <p> Any calculations that you enter are displayed on the top bar with the result , as well as the main panel to the right . <p> A nice added touch is that if you select the result and hit- G +- C to copy it , you can quickly paste that into your documents and applications . <p> Another- related feature is the ability to do inline unit conversions , for example between metric and imperial units . It also works for currencies , too . <p> Perform all manner of unit conversions right in Spotlight . <h> Tip- 2 : - search the Internet- without a browser <p> Type anything- into Spotlight , and you 'll also see ( normally further down the list , depending on your Spotlight preferences ) Bing search results , which were not available pre-Yosemite . Spotlight will suggest a website , a Wikipedia link ( and the definition in the main panel ) , - plus the Bing results which you can click to launch Safari right at that page . <p> Quickly search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content easily <p> Even with iTunes closed , you can quickly find content in your library just by typing the track or artist name . Spotlight shows you the album art where available , and double-clicking the result takes you to iTunes to start playing . <p> Get to your iTunes content with a few keystrokes . <h> Tip 4 : use- Spotlight in- Dark Mode <p> Apple has thoughtfully included a special- Dark Mode for Yosemite that uses a near-black colour for- the menu bars and Dock . Its preferred by many people , especially when working at night . <p> To activate Dark Mode : <p> Open up- System Preferences and select- General <p> Check the option labelled- Use dark menu bar and Dock <p> Activate Dark Mode to make it easier on your eyes for prolonged periods . <p> Now you will notice next time you open Spotlight that it too picks up the dark theme . Unfortunately , not all of the results look that great due to the use of a dark font in the main panel , as shown in the screenshot below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple will tweak over time . <p> Spotlight works in- Dark Mode , but some text it difficult to see . <h> Tip 4 : view an items full path <p> When a file or folder is selected , hold G to view its path on your Macs file system at the bottom of the main panel . Unfortunately , its- impossible to grab a screenshot- of this in action as the path then disappears ! <p> You can also navigate between items using the up and down arrow keys or press Enter to select an item. - You will then be taken to the default application that opens the type of item selected . <h> Tip 5 : get instant directions anywhere <p> Apple made a big deal about some of the Spotlight features during its recent keynote events ( see below ) . You can use Spotlight to get instant directions to anyone in your contacts that has an address field , or places such as restaurants . Just start typing the name of a place- and- you 'll see the directions appear in the main panel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they claim that they only use your " general area " rather than specific details of exactly where you are . However , to make the most of many of Apples services ( such as Find My Friends ) , it always helps to have your location enabled on every device ! <p> Want to find directions to a- nearby restaurant ? Just type it into Spotlight . <h> Tip 6 : see what movies are playing nearby <p> Fancy seeing what movies are playing near you ? - Simply type Movies into Spotlight and you should see a list of the most recent movies playing at cinemas near you , plus the showtimes and review ratings from Rotten Tomatoes . <p> Spotlight let 's you quickly see what movies are showing near you . <h> Tip 7 : - fine tune your search results <p> If you 'd like to- filter the results shown by Spotlight , you can use logical operators such as AND , and- OR as shown below . While not a new feature in Yosemite , its nevertheless an- invaluable search tool . <p> Use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search results . <p> You can also use the- kind keyword to limit the results by file type . <p> Only want to see a specific file type ? Use the " kind " keyword <p> Spotlight is also quite flexible in how it let 's you input search terms , for example- kind:music AND date : 2014- is also a valid example . <h> Final Words <p> Spotlight has a lot of new features in OS X Yosemite , and has thankfully retained some old ones . To get the most out of Spotlight , you really need to practice a few of the advanced search techniques , but even at its most basic level , it has become an even more indispensable search tool and source of information . <p> It seems that , despite a few niggles , Apple has done a great job of- enhancing Spotlight and making it- more accessible to all Mac users . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342859 @2342859/ <h> 5 Simple Ways To Backup Your Mac <p> Perhaps the most important thing to remember for anyone that uses a Mac regularly is to perform regular backups . The importance of this can not be underestimated , because even though Mac hardware is generally pretty reliable , disk errors and even complete failures do occur from time to time . <p> This article outlines 5 simple ways to backup your Mac , to ensure that your data remains as safe as possible . <h> Backup Strategy <p> Its important to realise that one backup is never enough . You might think it would suffice , but most dedicated backup aficionados make two or even three sets of backups and always store one of these offsite . Imagine the worst case scenario if someone stole your MacBook Pro and the backup disk attached to it the whole point of backing up is to be able to recover your data in such an unlikely scenario . So if you 've got backup disks lying around at home , make sure you store them somewhere physically separate from your computer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media to use . Optical disks are cheap and readily available but you might need quite a lot of them especially if you have a large hard disk on your Mac . Most people opt for external hard disk drives ( USB or FireWire ones ) as they 're relatively inexpensive and can store vast quantities of data . <p> An important point to realise is that if you use optical disks such as CDs and DVDs , you should regularly- retire- them . In other words , every so often , make a fresh copy of your data and burn to new disks , and store the older ones somewhere safe . Optical disks can also degrade over time , although they can normally hold data reliably for decades . <h> How to Backup <h> 1 . Time Machine <p> By far the simplest way to backup your content is with the Macs Time Machine application that has been bundled with every Mac since Leopard was released in 2007 . Time machine is designed to be very simple to use and nearly invisible . In fact , all you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Machine to use it for backups . From then on , it makes hourly backups of the changes to your hard disk for the last 24 hours , consolidated daily backups for the last month , and weekly backups for everything older than that . Time Machine also features a very intuitive user interface that let 's you zoom back in time to any date you want to restore individual files and folders from . Once your Time Machine disk is full , it starts deleting the very oldest weekly backups first to make more room . <p> Once Time Machine is up and running , there 's not really anything you need to do except let it continue its backups quietly running in the background . An important point to realise is that Time Machine does n't  make an absolutely perfect copy of your hard disk rather , it backups up your documents and files and the most important system files . It wo n't let you boot from a backup disk either in the event of a catastrophic failure you 'll need to boot from a Mac OS install disk if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then restore using your Time Machine disk . The process is fairly straightforward and will get you back up and running relatively quickly . <p> here 's a quick rundown on the basics of Time Machine . <p> 1 . Open Time Machine- ( from the Dock , Applications folder or Spotlight ) and enable it using the main slider on the left <p> Turn Time Machine on and configure its options <p> 2 . Hit Select Disk if you have n't already been prompted ( such as when you plug in a new external USB drive ) <p> 3 . Choose the disk you want to use as your Time Machine disk , or setup a Time Capsule device then click Use Backup Disk <p> Choose the backup disk for Time Machine <p> 4 . Select- Options to open additional Time Machine preferences , and choose any items that you want to exclude ( normally the backup disk itself ) as well as extra preferences to lock documents and whether to show Time Machine status in the menu bar <p> Choose the locations to exclude and other options <p> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . There 's nothing else you need to do until you want to restore a document from a backup , or completely restore your Macs files and applications on boot up . In the former case , open Finder and click on the Time Machine icon to open the list of files by date and time . Likewise in Mail , just click on the Time Machine icon and all the mail backups will be conveniently displayed <p> Open Finder and then click Time Machine to view all your backup files <h> 2 . Clone a Drive <p> A full clone of your hard drive is often the ideal backup option , as it let 's you boot straight away without having to restore ( and uncompress ) files and applications . If you regularly clone your drive , its certainly the fastest way to get back up and running . A few methods to clone your Macs hard disk are as follows : <p> Disk Utility <p> Even though applications such as Carbon Copy Cloner ( see the next section ) can create a clone of your Macs hard disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disk Utility tool which is located in the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder : <p> 1 . Open Disk Utility from the folder mentioned above or from Spotlight , and go to the Restore tab <p> 2 . In the left panel , drag the source disk that you want to copy into the Source box in the main window <p> 3 . In the left panel , drag the destination disk that you want to use into the Destination box in the main window <p> 4 . Click the Restore button shown on the lower right . Your entire Macs hard disk will now be copied to the disk you 've selected , which can be used as a full and complete copy of your Mac . When you want to restore everything using the cloned image you 've just made , reboot your computer and hold down the Option key , then select the Recovery HD to get to the boot screen . Then , choose Disk Utility and follow the same procedure as above but instead use the cloned disk as the source , and your Macs hard disk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Carbon Copy Cloner <p> Carbon Copy Cloner is a powerful application that overcomes many of the limitations of Time Machine ( for example , the relative lack of control over what 's backed up and its inability to exclude certain file types or files over a certain age ) . Carbon Copy Cloner is free software that relies on donations , so you can try it and see whether you like it first . <p> The advantages it has over Time Machine are : <p> It creates a bootable backup of your hard drive for fast system recovery <p> It uses an ordinary file system which can be browsed in Finder to find specific files <p> It can backup to any drive attached to a Mac on the network <p> It has more advanced scheduling and exclusion capabilities than Time Machine <p> Carbon Copy Cloner <h> 3 . Online Backup Solutions <p> There are several cloud-based backup solutions on the market , and while Apples own iCloud does n't  yet allow full system backups to the cloud , its surely only a matter of time before more advanced functionality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular solutions available today are detailed below . On the whole , online backup solutions are inexpensive and work well , but you may need a speedy Internet connection to use them to their fullest potential . <h> DropBox <p> DropBox is an application that must be installed on your Mac , which provides online cloud-based file storage for all your content such as documents , music and movies in fact anything that you want to keep safe online . Once the app is installed you can select the items to be backed up and synchronised , plus if you have an iOS or Android device you can access your content from there too ( once you 've installed the app ) , as well as designate shared folders that anyone can access . <p> The service is free for just 2 GB of storage , or $99 per year for 50 GB and the top tier is $199 per year for 100 GB this amount should be more than enough to hold your most important files . <h> Backblaze <p> Backblaze is an extremely inexpensive online backup solution that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , install the application and choose what you want to backup and when . Backblaze has lots of customisable options , and can exclude certain file types such as system files . <p> Select all the items you want to backup in Backblaze <h> 4 . Third-Party Backup Apps <p> There are also several third-party backup and synchronisation apps in the Mac App Store . Those which offer proper backup facilities ( not just simple file synchronisation ) tend to be more fully featured and can do more than merely keep two sets of files in sync . A few of the apps are described below . <p> Get Backup Pro <p> Price : -10.49 <p> Get Backup Pro is able to create encrypted backups and synchronise folders across multiple computers . It has the ability to set schedules ( for example daily , weekly or monthly ) , and perform full , incremental or versioned backups . Its simple to use and makes the backup process fairly easy . <p> Intego provides full and incremental scheduled backups from your Mac to all manner of connected disks and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk volumes , as well as all the usual options to exclude various folder locations . <h> 5 . Manual Backup <p> The last ( and least effective ) way of backing up your Mac is to do it manually , by copying the relevant files and directories from your computer to another drive either an external disk or USB stick , or to a network location . If your data rarely changes then it would be easy enough just to copy the relevant files once a day or every week , but you 're prone to forget and it could be quite time consuming if you want to copy lots of individual folders but exclude certain kinds of date ranges . <p> Since there are so many good ( and free ) tools available ( not least Time Machine which is built into Mac OS ) , there 's really no reason to manually backup your files unless its just an added precaution !

@@22342861 @2342861/ <h> How To Create Custom Signatures in OS Xs Mail App <p> Mac OSs Mail app has never made it especially easy to create customised signatures . Its signature editor contains just a very simple text entry field where you can type characters and highlight them as bold , italic or underlined , but there are n't  many more options than that . Its not easy to make a signature stand out if you use the signature editor within Mail . This tutorial describes how to create cool HTML-based custom signatures that can include images and more exciting text than is possible in standard signatures . Well look at how to use Mails templates in another tutorial , which is a slightly different way of achieving similar results . <h> Before we begin- you will need : <p> You should have a HTML editor such as Dreamweaver , Sandvox , etc <p> You should be familiar with the basics of HTML if you want to create something a little more complex <h> Step 1 : Decide What Details To Include <p> This is the easy part you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example your name and phone number , company address and perhaps a logo . In this example , well just use the Chris Writes website address and an image copied from the site . <h> Step 2 : Edit Your Signature in a HTML Editor <p> The most important step is to create a signature using whatever HTML editor you prefer . It does n't  have to be complicated just text , colours , graphics and such . The signature in this example was created using Sandvox- simply by inserting some custom HTML into a page and exporting it , but you could use any such program or a simple text editor as long as you 're familiar with basic HTML . <p> The signature I 've created for this example is shown below . <p> A simple HTML signature with text and an image <p> Any images used in your signature should reside on a web server or a shared DropBox folder that can be publicly accessed , so its important that youve already uploaded any images to your host and named them suitably . The HTML that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your web host . For example , images might be stored at : LONG ... <p> Once you 're happy with your new signature , save it as a HTML file to use in the next step . For example , call it signature.html . <h> Step 3 : Save The Signature as a Web Archive <p> Next , open Safari and drag the newly-created signature into an open window ( or right-click the file and select Open With followed by Safari- from the list ) . Your signature should be displayed in Safari like this : <p> Quit Mail so that next time you reopen it , the new signature is picked up <p> In Mail 's preferences , create a new signature and give it a name <h> Step 5 : Replace Mails Temporary Signature With Your Webarchive <p> The next step is to locate the default signature just created by Mail , and to replace that file with the custom signature you saved earlier as something like- signature.webarchive . <p> Follow these steps : <p> Go to Mails Signatures- folder which is located in- **36;262;TOOLONG . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finder window and just use- Command + Shift + G and paste the folder path above into the window that appears . Alternatively , hold down Option ( i.e. Alt ) and choose the Go menu in Finder , then select Library ( keeping the Option key held down ) followed by drilling down to the folder described above <p> In this folder , you should see a new signature file with a rather long filename . In my case the file was called LONG ... This is the blank signature that you previously created in step 4 . Select the file and copy the filename ( not the file but the actual filename ) . If you have multiple signatures then you can identify the correct file using the Date Modified within Finder ( or use Command + I to Get Info ) <p> Locate your new- signature.webarchive file and rename it to the same long filename as the temporary signature <p> Copy your new signature into Mails Signatures folder , overwriting the file that 's already there . Youll be prompted if you want to overwrite the file , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder should now look something like below . I have 4 signatures setup , with the newest one highlighted at the top . <h> Step 6 : Open Mail and Check Your Signature <p> The last step in the process is to open Mail again and go to Preferences . Under the Signatures tab you ought to see the new signature just created , and its now ready to use in new email messages . You can give it any name you like within the Preferences panel . <p> Any images include in the signature may be displayed as a broken link in the Signatures tab , but will display OK within messages that you send . <p> Lastly , select an email account ( if you have more than one ) and drag the new signature from the middle panel onto the desired account that you want to use it with . When you create a new email message there 's also an option to select a signature from the new message window . <p> You new signature should appear in the Signatures tab within Mail 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342862 @2342862/ <h> How to Manually Uninstall Apps in Mac OS X <p> Many Mac users will have dozens or even hundreds of apps installed on their computer . Occasionally , its desirable to uninstall unwanted or troublesome apps , or simply those which are taking up too much disk space and cluttering up your hard drive. - Uninstalling applications in all versions of Mac OS X can be accomplished with relative ease , especially compared to Windows which has an established but somewhat old-fashioned method of adding or removing programs using the control panel . Fortunately for Mac users , the vast majority of applications can simply be moved to the Trash and deleted with no repercussions ; in most cases deleting an applications executable file is equivalent to uninstalling it , and deleted apps tend not to leave behind much in the way of preference files or settings . OS X Lion- provides an even simpler and almost foolproof method to uninstall apps , which is covered at the end of this tutorial . Always remember that before you delete any app , read its user manual or README @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any special manual steps that must be taken to fully remove the app and all its traces . <p> Despite the availability of " cleaner " utilities that promise to completely remove unwanted applications and optimise your computer , they are not essential as the procedure is really quite simple . <p> This tutorial explains how to completely remove a program manually . <h> Uninstalling Packaged Apps <p> Many people will be surprised to learn that the majority of Mac applications can be uninstalled just by unceremoniously moving them to the Trash ( as long as they are not running at the time , of course ) . <p> Occasionally however , a couple of additional steps are necessary to ensure that preferences files and other unwanted items are not left on your computer indefinitely . <p> Packaged Applications <p> Many Mac applications ( such as iPhoto and iTunes ) are packaged into- application bundles or packages , - which are displayed a single icon but may in fact contain multiple subfolders , preferences and resource files ( such as images and other content the application needs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle without littering additional files around your computer . To inspect a package contents , right-click on its icon and select- Show Package Contents- from the popup menu . <p> The steps necessary to remove a packaged app are : <p> Quit- the application if its already open to make sure the app you are about to delete is not already running <p> As a precaution , use- Activity Monitor- to see whether the application is active <p> Change the filter at the top of Activity Monitor to All Processes . The- full list of running applications and processes are displayed <p> Search the Process Name column for the app in question . If its there , highlight the name and hit the- Quit Process button <p> Open the folder where the application resides its usually in your Applications folder <p> Select the app , right-click and then- Move to Trash from the popup menu ( or just COMMAND + DELETE ) . The app is deleted and moved to the Trash , but be very careful not to empty the Trash until you- are 100% sure that everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files by mistake ! <p> Optionally , restart your Mac it may be necessary in some cases so that Mac OS recognises the app has been uninstalled properly <p> Use Activity Monitor to ensure an app is not running when you remove it <p> Now that the application has been successfully uninstalled , its advisable to check for any remaining files that may have been left behind . Refer to the section entitled Uninstalling Apps and Additional Files Using Finder . <h> How to Remove an App Icon From the Dock <p> Applications can be removed from the Dock- easily , but the app is not- actually deleted it remains on your computer and can be opened as normal . To remove an app from the Dock , just drag it towards the desktop and let go the icon disappears and the Dock automatically move adjacent icons as appropriate . <p> TIP : when you remove an item from the Dock if you change your mind but are already in the process of moving it , then- without letting go of the mouse just tap the escape key to cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original position . This just saves you having to find the application icon again , so you do n't  have to re-add it to the Dock . <h> Uninstalling Apps and Additional Files Using Finder <p> Deleted applications can leave behind umpteen preferences files , support files , logs , caches and other miscellaneous content . Before we describe how to remove these redundant files using Finder , here 's a brief rundown on each . <h> Additional Files : PREFERENCES <p> Every application keeps its preferences in a file with a . plist- extension . These files are usually quite small so they can safely be left on your Mac without causing any serious issues or taking up too much space . The benefit of leaving them in place is that if you decide to reinstall the application later on , your current user preferences should still be intact . <h> Additional Files : SUPPORT FILES <p> An applications support files- are often much larger than preferences files , especially for multimedia apps like GarageBand . Therefore , it may be preferable to find and delete those files . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Application Support / &lt;Application Name&gt; <p> Macintosh HD / Library /- Application Support / &lt;Application Name&gt; <h> Additional Files : CACHE FILES <p> Cache files- can also be fairly large depending on the app in question , so its wise to delete these too when you uninstall an app . <p> Cache files can be found in : <p> / Library / Caches / &lt;Application Name&gt; <p> Macintosh HD / Library / Caches &lt;Application Name&gt; <h> How to Find and Delete Additional Files ( and Applications ) <p> Finder is an incredibly useful tool with a powerful search capability built-in . Finders search function can be used to locate all of an applications additional files , as well as the main executable file itself . <p> Make sure the app is not already running by using Activity Monitor as described earlier <p> Open Finder from the Dock or with Spotlight <p> In the Search field in the upper right corner , enter the application name ( such as iPhoto ) that you want to uninstall <p> To add Search filters so that only relevant files are shown click the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Search filter : - ( System files ) ( are included ) . If " System files " is not found in the drop-down filter menu , choose Other instead- and scroll down the list ( as shown below ) , find System files and hit OK . The inclusion of System files in the filter ensures that preference files and such will be displayed in the Search results <p> Add additional Search filters as necessary to find all of the apps related files . Example filters are : ( Kind ) is ( Application ) , and- ( Name ) ( contains ) &lt;application name&gt; . Its really just a matter of identifying appropriate filters to locate files that may be hidden away in unusual locations <p> You can now safely- delete the applications files and folders identified by Finder . Remember not to empty the Trash until you 're completely sure that your Mac is working properly and - you have n't deleted any important files by mistake <p> Optionally , restart your Mac if necessary <p> Add the " System files " attribute to your Search filter in Finder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mac applications come with dedicated uninstallation programs , which may be included on the original installation disk or inside the application folder or package . However , most apps can be removed as already described but its always advisable to check if the app has its own uninstaller first . <p> As an example , Safaris DivX plugin provides an uninstall app in the Applications / DivX folder . Just run any such app and follow the instructions to uninstall properly . Its always worth checking afterwards if the uninstallation has been successful by searching for related files , to make sure they really have been deleted in full . <p> Some applications come with their own uninstall files <h> The Easy Method to Uninstall Apps in OS X Lion <p> OS X Lion makes the whole process of uninstalling apps a doddle . Anyone familiar with the iPhone and iOS will appreciate the similarities , and Apple has made it unnecessary to search for leftover remnants of uninstalled apps . <p> Hold down the OPTION key , click the little " X " icon and the app is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Open Launchpad from the Dock , Spotlight or with the appropriate swipe gesture <p> Hold down the OPTION key ( sometimes labelled ALT ) until the icons wiggle . You 'll notice a small black and white cross icon in the corner of some of your Applications . Most apps installed from the App Store can be removed in this way , but the technique may not work with older apps . Only the ones that wiggle can be removed ! <p> Click the black " X " icon on the app you want to uninstall <p> When prompted to confirm , choose Delete . The app is now completely removed you do n't  even need to empty the Trash <p> Thankfully , any applications obtained from the Mac App Store can be downloaded again if you need to reinstall them . <p> Open Launchpad to view installed apps 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 2 Comments <p> i do n't  know if this happens in other os versions , but in os x lion applications like safari and itunes say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to delete them , and wont allow you to do so . maybe i 'm just slow and everyone else already knows this , but i just found out that you can enable the deletion of such " required " apps by right-clicking the application , selecting get info for the popup menu , going down to and enabling alteration of the sharing and permissions part ( by clicking the lock and entering your password ) , and then changing the permissions of the name " everyone " to read &amp; write rather than read only or custom . then you can delete the application . <p> also , if you wish to redownload the app at some point and do , the permissions for the reinstalled app will be the default again ( where you can not delete it ) . <p> i 'm sorry for the long post and for posting about this if everyone already knew how to do it and it was unnecessary , but thank you for reading it anyway .

Unlike other ad-blocking programs you may have used in the past , such as the AdBlock extension for Safari , Adguard can block ads across any program in OS X. Adguard is the first program to do this , as previous ad-blocking plugins only worked in your browser . <p> What makes Adguard stand head and shoulders above the other options available is it 's compatibility . As it is a stand-alone program , it can work with whichever browser you 're using , so if you decide to switch browser , you do n't need to install another program . But Adguard 's blocking power is n't just limited to browsers either . Adguard can block ads in programs already installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adguard can even block ads in your emails through Apple 's native Mail app , making them much easier to read .

Unfortunately , Adguard is n't free and does come at a cost of $19.95 per year . However , a free trial period of 14 days is available , allowing you to try before you buy . Now you know what Adguard can do , the next step is installing and setting it up .

Once open , Adguard simply sits in the menubar doing it 's job . From there , you can quickly switch features , such as ad-blocking and privacy protection , on and off . You can also access the settings where you can customise Adguard to fit your needs . Here , you can add or remove ads to the filter list , in case Adguard is n't blocking a particular ad . You can also update the filter settings , so you always have the most up-to-date ad-blocking filters .

Discounts are also available when purchasing licences for mobile devices . When compared with AdBlock Pro , which is currently free , this is obviously a huge disadvantage . However , around $20 a year is a small price to pay for the luxury of not having ads system wide . <p> Installing Adguard is going to be a compromise between how badly adverts annoy you , and how happy you are parting with $20 . Spread out over a year , I think Adguard is more than worth the money but this will be completely up to personal preference .

At the time , iTunes was a serious breath of fresh air . You could properly sync iPods and later iPhones with your media and even download new content without having to go all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from is a sub-standard metadata editor .

It was a case of going through the editor and trying to work out which field did n't  match those in the rest of the album . Similarly , editing genres was always a pain , because they were drawn from existing metadata and you- couldnt just clean them up . <p> At least if you 're dealing with the filesystem , you can pretty much expect something will end up in the right place at the right time . And that 's where Plex , Kodi and VLC are a bit of an improvement . <h> Plex media server / Kodi media server <p> Kodi Media Server <p> Plex and Kodi ( formerly XBMC ) both act as media servers which are accessible from other devices in your house . <p> Both require you to name your files in a specific way , so the systems can then translate the files into visually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as it could ( for example , with video in two parts ) , however , for the most part its pretty good . <p> Both support Android and iOS devices , so you can watch content on your iPad , or even control what 's being played on your TV through the system <p> The only real drawback is that neither of them will play DVD or Blu-Ray content ; you have to rip these to your server machine . But long-term , this is arguably the way of the future . <h> VLC <p> VLC is a simple free alternative to iTunes and basically works without needing to import all your content and categorise it using Metadata . The interface is basic , but that does n't  mean its hard to use . <p> VideoLan player <p> VideoLan Player supports Windows , Linux , Mac and is also available as an iOS app . <p> The app gets special mention here because you can drag and drop media to and from your iOS device through a webpage over your wireless network .

You can organise your media however you like and it wont change things based on metadata that you have n't set yourself . <p> VLC will play most media , including DVDs and audio and video files . It also reads media- streams , so if you happen to have Plex Media Server running , itll play files from there too . <h> Alternatives to Microsoft Office/iWork <p> With Microsoft Office moving to a subscription service , it now costs you money every year you want to use the system . This works for people with money in their pocket , but its not for everyone . <h> Open Office/Libre Office <p> Libre Office <p> Apaches Open Office , and the branch , Libre Office are both open source , free alternatives to Microsoft Office and iWork . <p> They do practically the same as both the paid alternatives with only a few differences in usability .

Apple iWork for iCloud and Microsoft SkyDrive both allow you to store content on their servers , which is much the same thing , and if you 've a license , you can work on your files remotely there . But Google Drive is free .

Over time , the Favicon cache in Safari grows larger and means that it must take longer to search for the correct icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safari down somewhat . <p> here 's an example of a typical Favicon in Safari : <p> Many website display tiny " Favicons " on the address bar <p> If you look in your bookmarks , you 'll also notice that Favicons are used to quickly identify individual sites : <p> Favicons are also used in your bookmarks folder <h> Deleting The Favicon Database <p> Safari stores Favicons in a database file inside your Library folder , so the first thing to do is navigate to that and locate the file as follows : <p> 1 . Open Finder and select COMMAND + SHIFT + G <p> 2 . In the drop-down window that appears , type- /Library/Safari- and hit the Go button . Note that older versions of Safari used to store the Favicons in the /Library/Safari/Icons folder which does n't  exist in newer versions , but the process to delete them is almost identical <p> 3 . Locate the file named- WebpageIcons.db- but before you delete it , you might want to Get Info ( COMMAND + I ) and check the size . In this example , my Favicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  sound like a lot , but considering that Safari has to search this every time you go to a web page , it can impact its speed noticeably <p> Check the file size of the Favicon database file <p> 4 . Next , just delete the file to send it to the Trash. - Note that once the file is deleted , Safari will create a new file and start to populate it , so you will need to delete it periodically to ensure that it does n't  grow too large <p> Its also possible to permanently- delete the Favicon database file to ensure that it does n't  return as follows : <p> 1 . Open up Terminal from the Application -&gt; Utilities folder or just type it into Spotlight <p> This should allow Safari to run more smoothly , ensuring a slightly better browsing experience . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342881 @2342881/ <h> How to Install an Additional SSD Drive in Your Mac <p> replacing a HDD with a Solid State Drive on Laptop computer <p> An SSD ( solid state drive ) is one of the most worthwhile for your Mac . They provide lightning fast disk access times because there are no moving parts , unlike a traditional spinning hard disk . The only minor downside is that SSD capacities are usually way below those of regular disks and they can be quite expensive too . But an SSD will speed up Mac OS X Lion- and provide a significant performance boost applications will open up more speedily and boot-up times will improve noticeably . <p> Many of the iMac desktops have quite a lot of spare room inside , so its possible to install an SSD as a secondary disk drive this way Mac OS X and all your apps can be kept on the SSD and documents , pictures and other files moved to the larger capacity hard disk . Since the vast majority of Mac sales are MacBooks , this- article describes the basics of installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  have space for a second drive by default , but because it has an optical drive ( and most people hardly use them anyway ) this can be removed to make way for the new SSD . <p> SSD disk drives have extremely quick access times <p> A word of caution : its recommended that you read up and consult a professional before attempting any hardware upgrades yourself the upgrade process is difficult so it might be wise to let an expert do it. - And do n't  forget to make a complete backup with Time Machine or another suitable solution , just in case the worst happens ! <p> Lastly , taking apart your MacBook and following the process below will certainly void your warranty , but if you 're not too concerned about this fact then it will probably be the best upgrade you 'll ever do <h> What Youll Need <p> here 's a quick rundown of everything you 'll need to perform the upgrade : <p> A MacBook Pro . Most unibody Macs have pretty much the same insides and layout <p> A solid state hard disk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the excellent Samsung SSD 830 512 GB which provides a decent amount of storage and has had excellent reviews . Note that some SSDs are pre-formatted as NTFS ( for Windows ) , so you may need to reformat using Disk Utility before it can be used in a Mac <p> An MCE Optibay- ( cost : about $99 ) to replace the dusty old SuperDrive ( optical disk drive ) that you 'll remove from your Mac . The Optibay can house either an SSD or a hard disk , and every kit also comes with a USB 2.0 enclosure so that your SuperDrive can be used as a regular external optical disk drive ( there 's no need to throw it away ! ) <p> Carbon Copy Cloner or similar disk cloning utility . Carbon Copy Cloner is free , so its probably the one to go for <p> The MCE OptiBay drive enclosure is an essential item <h> 1 . Open Your Mac <p> Before you open up your Mac and perform open heart surgery , make sure its cool its best to wait 10-15 minutes because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws found underneath your MacBook note that some are longer than others , so its important that you remember which ones go where and put them to one side . Once you 've unscrewed them , you should be able to remove the bottom plate of your computer . <p> Remove all the screws holding your Mac together remember which goes where <h> 2 . Remove the Optical Drive <p> Before you touch your Macs innards , its essential that you 're grounded . Invest in one of those special wrist straps or touch part of the metal case before you handle any of the sensitive electronic components inside . <p> The SuperDrive optical drive is the big flat silver component as shown in the picture below it should be fairly obvious . Remove any cords attached to it ( or there may be a small Bluetooth circuit board in the way which has to be removed ) . The SuperDrive is connected to the motherboard by a small black or red ribbon just pull this out of the socket before you continue . Next , unscrew the drive from the Macs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screws themselves are notoriously easy to lose inside your Mac. - Once you 've freed the optical drive from the case , remove the SATA plug which is attached to the ribbon cable . <p> The standard optical drive and hard disk layout in a MacBook Pro <h> 3 . Connect the SSD <p> The old hard disk is going to sit in the OptiBay where SuperDrive you just removed used to be . The SSD will occupy the space that the old disk uses . The reason is that if you just leave the old hard disk in the current position and install the SSD in the SuperDrive slot , there will be problems when your Mac wakes from sleep , as it does n't  expect the SuperDrive slot will be the main drive . <p> Remove your old hard disk as above its a nearly identical process . Just disconnect the cables and remove any screws . Next , load your old drive into the OptiBay housing before you install it into your Mac . It slides into the OptiBay case but might need some force applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its secure in the SATA plug on the housing . <p> Slide your old hard disk into the OptiBay enclosure <p> Next , connect the SATA ribbon cable that was connected to the SuperDrive to the slot on the side of the OptiBay and put it onto the empty space which was left by the optical drive . Use the old SuperDrive screws that you removed earlier to secure the OptiBay onto the motherboard be careful not to lose any screws in the process . The next step is to connect the SSD to the cables that the old disk drive was using and screw it firmly into place . Lastly , re-attach the bottom panel of your Mac and use the original screws taking careful note of which ones went where . <h> 4 . Check the New Disk is Installed <p> Once all the hardware has been installed , start your Mac and once you 've logged in hopefully the SSD will appear on the desktop . Open Disk Utility- and check that the SSD appears in the sidebar on the left . If so , installation was successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS Journaled using the controls in the Erase tab . Once that 's done , continue to the next step . <h> 5 . Move OS X to the SSD <p> Make sure you 've downloaded Carbon Copy Cloner and launched the app . <p> Carbon Copy Cloner is a free app which will help you move Mac OS X to the SSD <p> On the left side , set the Source Disk to the current boot volume , which is normally called Macintosh HD . Then set the Target Disk to the new SSD which has just been installed . In the Source Disk section deselect the Home Folder checkbox , because your Home Folder will reside on your old hard disk so it should be excluded from the cloning process . When that 's done , just select the Clone button and just wait for it to finish . <p> Next , reboot your Mac and hold down the OPTION key so you can choose the boot disk select the SSD and watch in awe as your Mac boots quicker than ever before ! <p> Next , you need to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SSD . To do this , open System Preferences and select Users &amp; Groups . Click the lock at the bottom left and enter your password to be able to make changes . Then right-click on your user name and select Advanced Options- ( as shown below ) . In the Home directory section , hit the Choose button and navigate to the existing Home folder on your old disk . Then just log out and back in again . This process must be repeated for every user on your Mac . Note that for items such as desktop backgrounds , you may need to set them up again . <p> Change the Home directory to point to the correct folder on the old hard disk <p> Lastly , go to the old drive and delete everything except the Users folder which is at the very top level . This will free up loads of space and also makes it non-bootable , so your Mac will default to the SSD when it boots . <p> That 's really all there is to it saving user files to folders such as- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder . <h> 6 . Configure the External SuperDrive <p> Lastly , you 'll probably want to get your old SuperDrive to work using the enclosure that comes with the OptiBay kit . Just take apart the black plastic case and connect the chip inside to your SuperDrives SATA port , then put the drive in the case and close it . To use the drive , just slide a disk into the slot and itll automatically be sucked in just like when it was installed in your Mac . The enclosure connects via USB and should run without problems on USB power , but just case there 's an extra lead and power socket supplied if necessary . <p> Your SuperDrive can be used externally via USB <h> 7 . Enjoy an Insanely Fast Mac ! <p> Your Mac should now automatically boot from the SSD and all your files and documents will be saved to the old disk drive that was moved to the slot previously occupied by the SuperDrive . Everything should seem snappier and the boot time will be much quicker . So just sit back and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

@@22342884 @2342884/ <h> 3 Spreadsheet Apps For iPhone &amp; iPad Compared <p> If you like number crunching and have an iPad or iOS device , I imagine that one of your biggest disappointments is the lack of Microsoft Office and Excel on the device . The latter is the mother of all spreadsheet and number crunching programs , and is used by people the world over either for some serious calculations or reasonably simple uses such as household expenditure , and if you 're a business , calculation profit . It remains a mystery why Excel is n't on the iPad yet ( presumably something to do with the Microsoft/Apple rivalry ) , however there- are some good alternatives to Excel that already exist on iOS and that you should know about . And all of them run natively on all iOS devices . <h> 1 . Numbers <p> I know what you Excel fanboys out there are going to say : Numbers sucks . Well , if you have n't tried it , I would n't speak to soon . Granted , it is more limited , but you also have to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say that Numbers is targeted more at the consumer who uses Excel than the professional . If you 're the latter , I admit that this probably is n't the best choice , but if you 're the former , Numbers should be perfect for you . <p> Not only can you calculate and create elaborate tables of numbers , you can also make them more interesting and add photos and nice text to make your figures presentable , something that Excel does n't  allow you to do . So in many ways , it actually has more possibilities than Microsofts program . <h> 2 . Free Spreadsheet <p> For all of you that like free stuff , this is the right Excel alternative for you . Its much less glamorous than numbers , and the user interface seems to be less welcoming , however if you like number crunching this really shouldnt be a problem . It will give you everything you need in terms of Excel functions and graph making , and it being free you cant really argue with it . <p> While understandably some might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great way to experience something similar to Excel on a budget for your iOS device . <h> 3. iSpreadsheet <p> I would classify iSpreadsheet as the halfway mark between Numbers and Free Spreadsheet . Its UI is slightly more appealing than the latter , and it is a lot cheaper than Numbers is . Again , this one offers all the standard Excel functionalities ( as I mentioned at the start though , they will obviously be slightly more limited ) , and seems like a good , solid alternative to Microsofts number crunching software . <p> Ultimately I would say this . If you can afford it go for Numbers as it is the best Excel alternative on iOS until Microsoft themselves come out with an official version . Its made by Apple and you know that its going work and perform well . <p> However , if you think $9.99 is too much , then go with one of the other two , and they are also decent . If you do n't  mind ads , Free Spreadsheet is the ideal candidate , otherwise go for iSpreadsheet . <p> wpadcamp3 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

Additionally , the universal search feature is simply brilliant you- just type in the name of a movie , show or even an actor and you 'll see instant results across all channels , and itll tell you whether its going to be free or how much it will cost . <p> Some of the best channels in the lineup include- Amazon , - Vudu , - Netflix , - Hulu , - TimeWarner , HBO Go , Disney , and hundreds more . <p> Supported multimedia formats include- MP4 ( H.264 ) video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , and JPG and PNG images .

And just like Apple TVs Remote app , there 's also a WDTV Remote application for both iOS and Android devices . <p> Unfortunately , the WDTV Play does n't  have nearly as many channels as the Roku box , but does have all the most popular ones such as Netflix , Hulu Plus , Spotify , Pandora and Vudu , as well as the ability to display your photos from online sites such as Flickr and Picasa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can comment and share what youre watching , but it does n't  really add much to the overall experience . <p> Perhaps the best thing about the Play is its ability to play local content from an external device , as it supports a very wide selection of multimedia formats .

Google does n't  make the hardware itself that 's left to a handful of manufacturers such as Sony ( with the NSZ-GS7 ) and Asus ( the- Google TV Qube ) .

Google refers to these devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list available here- ( though the list is actually very small presumably more will be available over time ) . <p> Google TV <p> Regardless of the hardware you opt for , Google TV features a wide selection of movie and video channels . There are also dozens of music apps including Google Music and Pandora , so you can stream virtually unlimited music over the Internet . And because Google TV runs the Android OS , there are thousands of apps and games available via the Google Play online store , making it rather more flexible than the Apple TV and perhaps a good choice for those that want to do more than just watching movies . <p> There 's also an Android app called Airtight- which will let you use AirPlay with Google TV devices . <h> Asus Google TV Qube <p> Price : $129 <p> Dealing with the Qube first ( which seems to be only available in the US currently at around $140 ) , its rather cheap-looking and plasticky ( and quite large , at least compared to the Apple TV ) , but differentiates itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for voice searching , as well as a rather interesting ( albeit slightly confusing ) cube-like interface to browse content and navigate . The cube spins up or down to move between categories ( TV and movies , gaming , social , sports , music , news , education , photos , and favourites ) . <p> Unsurprisingly , the Qube connects to your TV via a HDMI cable , but also provides 2 USB ports to connect to external media . Perhaps its best feature however is the funky double-sided remote , which has a mini QWERTY keyboard one one side and a trackpad on the other , - and and built-in gyroscope- which is great for playing Android games. - Asus also provides 50GB of cloud storage ( in addition to its internal 4GB of storage ) . <p> Perhaps the biggest surprise is that AirPlay is already built into the Asus Qube , so you can watch most of your existing content from your Apple devices .

Still , its quite exciting that AirPlay is supported at all . <p> Overall , the Asus is a pretty decent attempt at a Google TV device that wont break the bank , but at the time of writing there 's no word on a UK release date or price . For Apple Mac and iOS users , there 's probably not enough here to tempt you away from an Apple TV , but for everyone else its definitely worth of consideration . <p> The Asus Qube has a great two-sided remote control <p> Pros : <p> Good choice of content through Google TV and Google Play <p> Comes with AirPlay ( albeit limited in functionality ) out of the box ! <p> Decent remote control with gaming features <p> Slightly cheaper than Apple TV <p> Cons : <p> Fairly cheap-looking and not quite as small as an Apple TV or Roku <p> Even though the cube UI is innovative , it might put some people off <h> Sony NSZ-GS7 <p> Price : - around -100 ( Amazon UK ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and media hub .

@@22342888 @2342888/ <h> How To Disable the Mac Start Up Sound <p> Many of you have complained about the Mac Start-Up sound being annoying or too loud . It is true that sometimes that sound can be both of those things . Luckily , there is a way that you can have the sound turned off at start-up . <p> Before we proceed , it is important to note that the start-up sound is a system sound and is there for a reason . It let 's you know that the computer has passed the POST test . Under normal circumstances if you do not hear the start-up sound , it is an indicator that there is something wrong with the computer . Without this sound , you would not have this warning indicator . Keep that in mind ! Acid ( https : **35;334;TOOLONG ) , a member of the Apple support forums , has been kind enough to post a solution to this issue . All credit to this work-around goes to him . If you are not comfortable entering Terminal commands , I would strongly recommend against doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As always , before you proceed , you should also perform a back up of your hard drive . Cause well you never know ! <p> 1 . Login as administrator and open a terminal window <p> 2 . Create scriptfile for muting sudo nano /path/to/mute-on.sh <p> 3 . Enter this as content , when done press Control+O to save and Control+X to exit : # ! /bin/bash osascript -e set volume with output muted <p> 4 .

@@22342889 @2342889/ <h> What 's new in Safari 9 OS X El Capitan <p> Apple has added- a fair few new features to its new version of OS X , El Capitan , even though the main focus is on performance . There are little tweaks and streamlined ways of interacting here , there and everywhere , and thankfully Safari has n't  been left out . <p> Safari is of course the default browser on the Mac , and its also one of the fastest for Javascript , making sites load quickly . If you use Safari every day like I do , you 'll appreciate some of the refinements in the latest version . <p> This post provides a quick run down of some of those changes and improvements . <h> Improved audio management in tabs <p> Have you ever opened- dozens of tabs and find that one of them is playing- an audio track such as an advert ? - Or perhaps you 've opened YouTube and played a couple of songs , only to find that later you have to quickly scan your open tabs to get back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it much easier to see at-a-glance which tab is playing audio , as well as allowing you to mute all tabs or a single tab . <p> Any tab that is playing- audio now displays a small speaker icon at the right side of the tab itself , as shown below : <p> Every tab playing audio shows the speaker icon . <p> To mute an individual tab , simply click the icon to mute the audio . Likewise , to un-mute just click the icon again . <p> Notice that in the title bar , there 's an identical icon- ( in blue ) that 's solid if the- current tab is playing audio , or just shown as an outline if its on another tab . <p> In the screenshot below , I have selected a tab where there is no audio content , and the task bar audio icon is shown as a blue outline : <p> A blue outline means no music is playing on the current tab . <p> The icon that appears on the task bar changes functionality slight depending on whether- your currently selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon will mute- / un-mute all other tabs if you do n't  have any audio on the current tab . However , if the current tab- is playing audio , the default action of the task bar icon is to mute / un-mute- the current- tab . Confused ? Its pretty natural and intuitive once you actually use it <p> If you click and hold the audio icon in the task bar , you 'll also see various options to mute / un-unmute tabs , as well as a list of tabs that are playing audio . By clicking on any of those tabs , you 'll be taken straight there . <p> Just click and hold on the audio icon to bring up available options . <p> You can perform the same action on the audio icon on- any tab , so see a similar set of options . <p> The audio management in Safari is a small but welcome addition , finally- enabling you to turn off those distracting ( and too loud ) pop-up ads that somehow make it past the pop-up blockers ! <h> Pinned- sites <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - Safari now let 's you " pin " tabs to the left side of the tab bar . Its quite useful for those sites that you always have open , but do n't  want them to take up too much room in the tab bar . <p> To use the feature , simply grab any tab and slide it all the way to the left , where it appears as a much smaller mini tab with its icon simply show as a single letter . In the case of this particular website , Chris Writes.com is shown as a black icon with a grey " c " , helping you to quickly identify it later on . <p> Select any tab and slide it all the way to the left to pin it . <p> If you select any of your pinned sites , - any other pinned sites icons are just greyed out . <p> You can also " unpin " sites by selecting them and dragging back toward the right until they become a regular , full-size tab again . <p> There do seem to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close a pinned tab . For example , usually- with a regular tab open , Command + W will close the tab and take you to- another that 's open . <p> With a pinned tab selected , Command + W seems to just take you to an open tab , if- there is one - the pinned tab is not closed , which is not necessarily the- expected behaviour . Whether this gets fixed or is a feature remains to be seen . <p> This is what happened when writing this article in a pinned tab , after attempting to close my only regular tab : <p> Closing the last regular tab attempts to also close all pinned sites/tabs . <p> The second quirk we 've noticed is that when closing the last " regular " tab , if you have any pinned sites Safari pops up a dialog asking if you want to close them . On other occasions ( it depends what you have open in those pinned sites ) , Safari returns to non-fullscreen mode and closes everything . This behaviour definitely seems like a bug and something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released . <h> Slide-to-open Sidebar in fullscreen mode <p> In the past , the fastest way to show / hide the sidebar was with SHIFT + COMMAND + L , though you could always just choose- Show Sidebar from the- View menu or just se the icon next to the back/forward buttons . Any of these- will open- the sidebar and keep it open , or close it if when- already visible . <p> In El Capitan however , there 's a- new- way to- get to the- Sidebar by sliding your mouse cursor over to the far left of the screen while in- Safaris fullscreen mode , which opens the Sidebar temporarily in a slide-in fashion . If you try and nothing happens just try pushing further to the left , and it should appear as shown below : <p> Temporarily open the Sidebar by sliding your mouse off the left of your screen . <p> Likewise to close it , - move your mouse pointer back toward the centre of the screen again . <p> This is one of those features that is rather intuitive , and once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just want to quickly find something ( as long as you 're in fullscreen mode , of course ) . <p> Notice that the- slide-in Sidebar- appears as an overlay on top of- the website- as a semi-transparent layer . <p> The original method of opening the sidebar and shifts- the- web page- to the right , while- the sidebar stays open . You 'll notice the difference between the- screenshot above and this one : <p> With the Sidebar properly open , web content is shifted to the right . <h> New- Status Bar- behaviour <p> The status bar at the bottom of the- Safari window has always been a useful little area to show you information about links you 're hovering over . The trouble is , it does take up a little bit of screen space ( an important consideration to those of us on laptops ) and adds to the general screen clutter . <p> In El Capitan , Apple has done away with a full Status Bar as such and now shows a semi-transparent status bar that appears temporarily for a second or so as you however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice tweak- for anyone that appreciates minimalism . <p> The new-style Status Bar in El Capitan . <p> You can still use- Command with- /- to turn the Status Bar on and off of course . There 's also a handy little notification when its enabled : <p> " Status Bar is On " . Couldnt be any clearer than that ! <h> AirPlay- web videos without showing your whole screen <p> AirPlay has always been a great way to mirror your Macs screen on your Apple TV , or play iTunes content for example . Safari in El Capitan also let 's you play a web video ( such as those on YouTube ) directly on your Apple TV without sharing the rest of your Macs screen . <p> Find a video to play , and youll notice the small AirPlay icon on the bottom of the video player ( though Apple says it does n't  work with all video content yet ) : <p> Clicking the AirPlay icon opens a prompt that let 's you choose which Apple TV to play the video on , as shown below : <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summary <p> El Capitan is a really solid- update to OS X. As a user of the developer build since day 1 , its been one of the most stable pre-release versions I 've ever used . With the latest Golden Master release ( which should be near-identical to the official , finished version ) , performance is great and very stable . <p> The changes to Safari are admittedly small but welcome , strengthening its position as one of the very best and capable browsers for all Mac users . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 1 Comment <p> Has anyone found out how to disable the " Slide-to-open Sidebar " function ?

@@22342890 @2342890/ <h> How To Run PowerPC apps on Mac OS X Lion <p> So , enticed by smooth gestures , full-screen apps and an iOS-like Launchpad , you 've made the move to Apple 's latest big cat , Lion . The company 's made no secret of the fact that with this release , they 're ditching support for applications in Power PC format . Yet this is a hard hit to take if you use Logic , Photoshop , Dreamweaver or any number of industry-standard applications in their current iterations . Is it possible to claw back control over these apps on your new operating system ? <h> What is the PowerPC format ? <p> Mac apps come in three different flavours : PowerPC , Universal and Intel . As you 'd expect , the latter is fine , as all Macs these days run with Intel processors . Universal is similarly problem-free , as it includes both Intel and PowerPC support the only problem being that this dual support increases the file size of these apps and eats up disk space . PowerPC , though , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be translated before Macs can run these applications , and the translation is done using a process called Rosetta . <p> With Lion , Apple is getting rid of Rosetta , and so making it impossible for Macs to read the untranslated PowerPC code . The theory behind this is that because the translation process makes these apps run slower , it 's best to get rid of them altogether and stick to Intel format . However , there are ways of reintroducing Rosetta and breathing new life into your PowerPC apps . <h> Run your Mac with dual boot <p> Although Lion does n't include Rosetta support , Snow Leopard runs it without a grumble . One solution to the PowerPC problem , then , is to partition your hard drive and install one OS in either partition . <p> To do this , launch Disk Utility . Selecting your hard drive , choose Partition ' from the toolbar . Click the + ' icon underneath the graphic representation of the drive ( showing how much space is used up ) . The graphic will now show a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive into two equal parts ( default ) , or perhaps to make a smaller SL partition just change the value in the Size ' box . <p> Once this is done , hit Apply ' your disk is now partitioned . The first half contains OS X Lion , and it 's your task to install SL in the second half . Do this by inserting the installation CD your Mac ( pre-summer 2011 ) and choosing to install on the newly-made second partition . <p> When you next boot up your Mac , hold down the Option key when you press the Power button . This will take you to a screen allowing you to choose which OS you want to load 10.6 or 10.7 . The next time you need to run a PowerPC application , boot up in Snow Leopard and you 'll be good to go . <h> Run PowerPC apps in a virtual environment <p> If a dual boot setup is n't your thing , consider , running SL virtually from within your Lion OS . To do this , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as VirtualBox ( https : **35;371;TOOLONG ) . This app guides you through the process well , allowing you to allocated hard drive space and even a specific amount of RAM . Once this is up and running , a Snow Leopard environment with support for Rosetta will be created , and you 'll have an easy way to run PowerPC apps without having to reboot . <p> Who says you ca n't have your cake and eat it ? Go ahead and enjoy the new features Lion brings , while knowing that at a moment 's notice , you can create the right environment for your PowerPC apps to come back to life . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 <h> Chris <h> 2 Comments <p> What if you had a Macintosh HD ?

But there are also several ways to make your computer run more quickly just using Terminal commands alone . The following tips can help you squeeze every last drop of performance out of your Mac . <h> TIP 1 : Disable Dashboard Widgets <p> Dashboard widgets consume processor time even when they are inactive , so either turn off as many as you can in Dashboard itself , or disable it completely using Terminal . The advantage of this approach is that you can just turn it off temporarily and re-enable it later on , and the same widgets will come back exactly as they were before . <p> To re-enable the Dashboard , use the command- defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean NO and remember to enter- killall Dock- to restart the Dock . <p> Too many Dashboard widgets can seriously drain resources <h> TIP 2 : Clear Out Font Caches <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become corrupted , or at the very least take up lots of space and cause some degree of system slowdown . If you regularly install and remove lots of different fonts then it might be a good idea to clear out the font caches and restart your Mac occasionally . <p> To remove the font caches for all users type : <p> atsutil databases -remove <p> To remove the font cache for the active user only , use this command instead : <p> atsutil databases -removeUser <h> TIP 3 : Use the 2D Dock <p> The normal " 3D " Dock that most people use on the Mac does incur a small performance hit compared to the 2D version , which can be activated with this command in Terminal . <p> defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES <p> killall Dock <p> To switch back to the normal 3D one , just replace " YES " with " NO " in the defaults write command . <p> Disable the 3D Dock effect <h> TIP 4 : Disable Automatic Window Animations <p> Window animations look pretty but they can be quite annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> You may also need to restart the application in question before you notice the changes . <p> Window animations can be turned back on by replacing the " NO " with " YES " or use the following delete command <p> defaults delete NSGlobalDomain **34;408;TOOLONG <h> TIP 5 : Speed Up Dialog Boxes <p> When certain dialog boxes ( also known as sheets ) open , a nice animation effect is shown .

This feature will enhance your browsing , viewing or gaming experience when it 's working . <p> AirPlay 's current Achilles ' heel is that often , when playing movies in Safari and various other applications , the streamed audio lags two seconds behind the video . Let 's take a look at ways to get rid of this headache . <h> Safari <p> There 's a reason ( according to user ysolmaz ' on Apple 's forums ) why Safari 's having such trouble delivering a pleasant streaming movie experience : it does n't play well with movies encoded in a non-Apple format . You should , therefore , experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . aac , for example , but seeing as YouTube videos and those on many other sites are encoded in different formats , the streaming problem will surface . <p> We 're hoping that Apple will soon release an update to AirPlay on the Mac that fixes this , but while the Cupertino giant gets its act together , the developers of Rogue Amoeba- software ( strange name , as they willingly admit ) have worked double time to release a fix for this frustrating bug : a programme called Airfoil ( https : **30;444;TOOLONG ) . A free trial of this app should allow you to experience fully-functioning movie streaming but the bad news is that if you want to continue the experience , you 'll need to drop $25 on the software . Depending on how essential streaming is to you , it may be worth your while to wait . <h> Quicktime <p> The surprising fact is that while AirPlay in Safari does n't function properly , there 's no problem when using Quicktime .

Something to note , though , is that this app is no longer being supported by the developers ; if problems develop , you 'll have to ask the community of users . <h> VLC <p> This otherwise excellent video player suffers from the same problem as Safari , creating a delay in sound playback whenever you start streaming . Thankfully , there 's an easy and free workaround for those for whom VLC is the app of choice . Offering customisation far greater than that of Quicktime X , one of VLC 's additions is the option to change the audio delay .

@@22342894 @2342894/ <h> 12 Ways to Speed up Mountain Lion <p> OS X Mountain Lion is Apples latest and greatest Mac OS , so its no surprise that its already become a hit with Mac users everywhere . Even though Mountain Lion is generally regarded as better , faster and more polished than Lion , there are still various tips and tricks that you can try to make it even quicker . <p> For those on older Macs with slower processors and disks , its even more important to keep everything running smoothly to ensure the best overall user experience . This article describes some of the many techniques you can use to speed up your Mac running Mountain Lion . <h> 1 . Install Additional Memory <p> You might wonder how additional memory can speed up Mountain Lion , but for any computer its one of the most effective ( and cheapest ) ways to improve performance in general . The reason is that RAM is required for applications and the more apps you have open , the more memory is consumed . Mountain Lion officially only requires 2 GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really enough . Check out reliable memory suppliers such as Crucial an 8 GB pair ( 2 x 4 GB ) can be bought for as little as -30 . Unfortunately , the MacBook Airs memory can not be upgraded because its soldered onto the motherboard , but for MacBook Pros its a relatively simple upgrade that should take only 5 minutes and is a task that can be easily done at home . <p> Installing more memory in your Mac is recommended <h> 2 . Free Up Disk Space <p> Your Mac needs at least 5% of free disk space to function properly . Sufficient disk space is essential for apps , music and media content , as well as being used for virtual memory should your physical memory be insufficient . To reclaim disk space , delete or compress unused files and folders or archive them off to an external USB drive.DaisyDisk- ( -6.99 from the App Store ) is a great app that let 's you immediately see the size and distribution of files on your disk , so you can quickly identify any particularly large ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files with apps such as DaisyDisk <h> 3 . Upgrade to an SSD <p> Unless you 've bought an expensive Mac with an SSD ( sold state disk ) already built in , the chances are that your Mac came with a slower traditional hard disk that spins at either 5,400 or 7,200 RPM . Such disks have relatively large capacities and so are great to store lots of files , though they are- much slower than an SSD . These days , a 256 GB SSD can be obtained for around -140 and prices are coming down all the time . One day , all Macs will come equipped with an SSD <p> If you install an SSD , there are several options : <p> Install the SSD in your Mac and then a clean installation of Mountain Lion , followed by an optional Time Machine restore of your files , folders and apps ( or just re-download them through the app store ) <p> Connect the SSD via USB ( most models come with a SATA to USB adaptor ) and then perform a clone of your existing drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free ) . Then simply install the SSD inside your Mac and you 're good to go . You could also buy an external case for your old disk and use it as a USB drive , or keep it in your safe as a permanent backup <p> An SSD disk is the best upgrade you can do for your Mac <h> 4 . Tweak the Dock <p> The Dock is a nice bit of visual eye candy on the Mac , but it does take up system resources when you 've enabled the various effects and animations . The simplest thing to do is to disable the Genie effect when minimising windows , and turn off animating open applications . <p> Follow these steps : <p> 1 . Open System Preferences and choose Dock <p> 2 . Select- Scale effect under the- Minimise windows using setting <p> 3 . Uncheck Animate opening applications <p> Disable the Genie effect and turn off application opening animations <h> 5 . Turn Off Desktop Animations <p> You can disable the desktop picture animations so you always have the same desktop background . While its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while , it does use less processing power and should speed up your Mac just a fraction . <p> 1 . Select the- Desktop &amp; Screen Saver icon in System Preferences <p> 2 . In the Desktop tab , uncheck the Change picture- setting to use a single desktop image <p> There are lots of other eye candy settings in Mountain Lion that you can disable to speed things up . Small changes add up , so no matter how insignificant something might seem , it can definitely make your Mac faster . <p> Keep a single desktop picture to save CPU cycles <h> 6 . Close Unnecessary Dashboard Widgets <p> Dashboard widgets are small apps that can be accessed by pressing the F4 key on your Macs keyboard ( without holding down the Fn button ) . There are hundreds of useful widgets , but every single one takes up some memory and CPU resources even though its hidden out of the way . Its a good idea not to have dozens of widgets running , so close down any that you do n't  use ( just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears next to each widget ) . <p> A couple of widgets is all you really need <h> 7 . Remove Unused Fonts <p> Unused Fonts take up valuable disk space and can actually decrease performance . Besides , its incredibly simple to remove fonts that you never use or may not even realise you have installed . <p> 1 . Launch Font Book from the Applications folder <p> 2 . Scroll through the list ( or use the Search function in the upper right ) to find fonts you want to remove <p> 3 .

Disable Startup Items <p> It can be extremely convenient to have your most commonly used apps open when you login to your Mac , but the trouble is that as you add more and more to the list , things start to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . <p> To resolve the issue , try and limit the number of startup items that you have . To see what 's set to launch when you login , go to Users &amp; Groups in System Preferences , select your user account from the left hand panel , and then choose the Login Items tab in the main window . Here you can add and remove any apps you want , but its best to try and keep the list as small as possible . <p> Keep your startup items to a bare minimum <h> 9 . Delete Caches and Logs <p> Over time , most of your apps build up local caches and log files that can clog up your system . Most of the caches are stored in the- /Library/Caches folder ( use COMMAND + SHIFT + G in Finder to open this hidden directory ) and can be deleted manually . Log files are likewise stored in the- /Library/Logs- folder and can be safely deleted . <p> Over time , caches and logs build up and are rarely deleted <h> 10 .

If your Mac seems slow with Mountain Lion , try a fresh install and then just migrate your old data and apps back using Time Machine . <p> Having said that , some users never experience any slowdown issues even after several upgrades ; it probably depends on many factors such as how many apps you have installed , your particular hardware , and how your files are distibuted over the hard disk . <p> A clean installation is the best option for OS X <h> 11 . Keep Apps Up to Date <p> Old applications that never get updated wont be able to take advantage of the latest performance features in OS X , such as hardware acceleration and OpenCL. - Always keep apps up to date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest way as you 'll receive automatic notifications ) or by regularly checking from within the apps themselves or on the Internet . <p> You might find that once you 've updated an old app , the latest version is much faster . You ca n't blame Mountain Lion for everything <p> Do n't  neglect old apps make sure they 're all kept up to date <h> 12 . Disk Maintenance and Optimisation <p> Its recommended that you occasionally check your Macs disk for any disk permission errors . Open up Disk Utility- and select the Verify Disk button in the First Aid tab to check for any permissions issues . If everything is OK you should see a confirmation message , otherwise you can then use the Repair Disk option . <p> There are also dozens of disk optimisation apps in the App Store , which can keep you disk in good shape and perform defragmentation ( though the Mac is not as prone to fragmentation issues as Windows PCs are ) . <p> Hopefully , if you 've followed any of all of the recommendations we 've mentioned , your Mac will stay running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 9 Comments <p> When I first installed Mountain Lion I could not believe how slow it was .

While the animations and effects rarely hinder the way you use your Mac , anybody that uses many of the features day in , day out may find that productivity can be improved when the unnecessary eye candy is disabled . <p> This tutorial describes several Lion items that can be tweaked to suit your own personal preferences , such as how to : <p> Disable automatic window animations <p> Disable Mails send and receive animations <p> Revert Mail back to the classic look <p> Remove Reading List and Top Sites From Safari bookmarks <p> Disable Mission Control animation <p> Speed up Mission Control animation <p> Disable Launchpad effects <p> These tweaks to Lions interface require command line directives to be typed directly into Terminal , such as the ever-versatile command defaults write , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the defaults if you do n't  like the new behaviour .

@@22342904 @2342904/ <h> How to Stress Test Your Mac <p> When you have just splashed out on a new Mac or wish to stress test your old machine ( for example before and after a memory or SSD upgrade ) , there are a variety of easy ways to accomplish this and see just how your Mac stacks up . Its always a good idea to see how well your machine performs under load , and its great fun seeing where your Mac comes in the overall rankings online . This article describes several ways to really stress test your Mac and see how well it can handle the heat . <h> Test Using Terminal <p> One of the simplest ways to stress test your CPU is to use the built-in applications- Terminal- and Activity Monitor application , in conjunction with an app that shows your Macs temperature . As you increase the load , your computer will quickly become much hotter <p> 1 . Open Terminal- from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder or just type its name into Spotlight ( COMMAND + SPACE ) <p> 2 . At the Terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will constantly displays the character- y on a new line . This command will only stress one core of your CPU however and does n't  really tell you much on its own <p> The " yes " command will execute as fast as possible <p> 3 . A better way to load up your CPU fully is to type yes &gt; /dev/null followed by Enter which will send the output of the yes command to the null device ( i.e. to nowhere ) without displaying any output onscreen <p> 4 . Once you 've set one Terminal window running with the yes command , open a second Terminal window ( with COMMAND + N ) and type in the same command . If you have a dual-core machine this will load up both cores to around 100% <p> Set two Terminal windows running the " yes " command to /dev/null <p> 5 . To actually view your Macs activity and monitor the load , open Activity Monitor ( which also lives in the Utilities folder ) and click on the CPU tab . Here you can view the overall CPU load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes " commands already running . Click on the %CPU column header to view the list of processes in descending order of CPU time used <p> Activity Monitor is one of the most useful Mac applications <p> With the two Terminal windows still running , you can now view the CPU performance which should reach nearly 100% for each core . <p> Activity Monitor indicates what your CPU cores are doing <p> 6 . To check the CPU temperature , an app such as MagicanPaster ( which is available on the Mac App Store ) is ideal . The CPU , battery , motherboard and disk temperatures are displayed , and as you run the tests in Terminal you 'll see the heat rise dramatically . MagicanPaster has lots of controls and widgets to monitor your Mac , but its the temperature one that were interested in for now <p> Can it take the heat ? <p> Once you have MagicanPaster installed , you can see the temperature go off the scale the Terminal commands are running : <p> Temperatures will rocket when the tests are running <p> There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPULed- which sits unobtrusively in your main menu bar and displays the CPU activity without needing to keep Activity Monitor always open . It has a few simple preferences ( and paid-for add-ons ) and you can also choose the desired CPU meter icons from an extensive list of attractive options <p> Keep an eye on your CPU load at all times <p> Once CPULed is installed , you can easily check on your CPU load from the menu bar : <p> Green icons means your CPU is not being taxed much <h> Benchmarking Apps <p> There are many apps in the App Store which can benchmark and stress your computer to the limit . The advantage of such apps is that you 'll also get an overall performance score , which you can compare with other users and machines . <p> Here are just a few of those apps , but there are many more on the App Store . <h> 1 .

NovaBench <p> NovaBench is a superb free app which produces detailed performance information in addition to an overall score , which can also be submitted to the NovaBench website . The test takes just a few minutes to run and checks such metrics as floating point , integer and 3D graphics performance . <p> NovaBench will assess your Macs performance , and it does n't  cost a penny 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 1 Comment <p> Its impressive how well Mac OS X does handle high CPU loading . When I open multiple instances of the terminal with yes to get all cores to 100% the system and other applications are still fluent to use . Looks like the operating system is clever enough to not give all the CPU power away to some hungry applications . Poorly this fact is n't true to some other operating system . I believe this good loadage handling is one of the reasons why Mac OS X feels that fine .

@@22342906 @2342906/ <h> Troubleshooting Shutdown Problems in Mac OS X Lion <p> Some Lion users have reported occasional problems when trying to shutdown their Mac , such as a grey screen or permanent spinning wheel . But what should you do in this scenario to resolve any issues ? It can quickly become a real nuisance after all , doing a hard reset is not always recommended and probably is n't good for your Mac in the long term . <p> This tutorial describes a few troubleshooting steps you can take to investigate and hopefully restore Lion back to normal . <h> 1 . Repair Disk Permissions <p> Sometimes , corrupted or incorrect disk permissions can cause umpteen issues with your Mac . One of the first things to try is to repair the disk permissions and see if that makes a difference . Follow these steps : <p> 1 . Open Disk Utility from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder or from Spotlight <p> 2 . In the left hand panel , select your Macintosh HD and in the First Aid tab , choose- Verify Disk Permissions <p> Open Disk Utility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite some time , during which you 'll see the progress bar status updating as below and eventually a time estimate will be displayed .

If the permissions are incorrect , you can then select the Repair Disk Permissions option , which is greyed out until you 've done a verify first . Note however that if you hit the Stop Permission Verify button , you 'll be able to do a repair immediately <p> Repair disk permission can resolve many issues <h> 2 . Reset the PRAM and SMC <p> The Parameter RAM ( PRAM ) and SMC ( System Management Controller ) can sometimes cause problems . To reset them both follow the steps below . <h> Reset PRAM <p> 1 . Shut down your computer <p> 2 . Locate the Command , Option , P and R keys . You 'll need to use these in step 4 <p> 3 . Turn on the computer <p> 4 . Press and hold down Command , Option , P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold down the keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time <p> 6 . Release the keys <p> The PRAM should now be reset to the default values . Now try shutting down your Mac and see if it makes any difference . <h> Reset the SMC <p> The SMC can cause issues related to fans , lights , video and power , so there is a chance it might help your shutdown issues . <p> Here 's how to reset the SMC : <p> 1 . Shut down the computer <p> 2 . Plug in the power adaptor <p> 3 . Press Shift + Control + Option keys and the power button at the same time <p> 4 . Release all the keys and the power button simultaneously <p> 5 . Press the power button to turn on your Mac <h> 3 . Try Shutting Down From a New User Account <p> There 's a good chance that some wayward process or setting in your user account is causing your Mac not to shutdown properly . Its a good idea to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which could help to pinpoint exactly what the problem is . Of course , if the shutdown does work in the new account , in the very worst case you could just migrate your documents to the new account and delete the old one , though that is a somewhat cumbersome process . <p> here 's how to create a new account : <p> 1 . Open System Preferences <p> 2 . In the System pane , open the Users &amp; Groups icon <p> Choose User &amp; Groups from System Preferences <p> 3 . Click the small Add button ( the " + " symbol on the left hand side ) and then enter the relevant user details in the drop-down window for example the account type ( standard , administrator , etc ) , Full Name , Account Name , and Password . Next just select Create User- to create the account <p> Create a new user account and shutdown from there <p> 4 . Log out of Mac OS and log back in as the newly created user <p> 5 . From the Apple menu ( or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut Down and see if it works ! If it still does n't  work , then it points to some system-wide issue that is affecting all user accounts . If shutdown works successfully from the new account , its time to investigate what processes and login items are running under your regular account which are causing the issue <h> 4 . Terminate Problematic Processes &amp; Services <p> The reason for not being able to shutdown your Mac could be caused by spurious processes and services which are actively running in the background . The way to check this is to open Activity Monitor and view the list of process and services . This will give you an idea what might be causing the issue and will enable you to kill off processes one at a time to see whether the problem can be solved . <p> Note : we have a detailed article about Activity Monitor planned soon , but for the moment just open the application and look at the basics as described below . <p> 1 . Open Activity Monitor from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main window displays a list of active processes and various details such as CPU utilisation and memory used . Its a useful tool because it might point to something immediately obvious such as a task taking up too many system resources or causing very high CPU use <p> Activity Monitor shows all kinds of details about every process running <p> 2 . You can order the columns any way desired . For example , click the %CPU- column to view processes ordered by amount of processor time they 're consuming , as shown below . You can also look to see which processes are running when you 've selected shutdown and see which ones are still active <p> View each process by several criteria such as the CPU utilisation <p> 3 . Select a process or application that you think might- be the cause of the problem and then choose the blue Inspect button at the top of the menu bar to bring up more details about the process , such as the memory used and any open files <p> Select a process or app then the Inspect button to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view processes arranged by user or type . At the top of the Activity Monitor window , click the drop-down menu and pick the category that you want to view for example System Processes , User Processes , - Active Processes , Inactive Processes , and so on . You might already have discovered that its a user process ( My Processes ) which is causing the issue if you successfully managed to shutdown earlier as another user <p> View processes by category <p> 5 . Any process that seems to be a little suspect i.e. consuming too many system resources or a lot of memory can be terminated using the red Quit Process button . Its definitely worth terminating a couple of processes you think may be to blame for the inability to shutdown , and then try to shutdown your computer once you 've quit them . There 's not really much chance that you can damage your system or cause any damage to files just make sure that any work that you have open is already saved and your files backed up you can terminate any process quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutdown process . <p> Terminate processes that may be misbehaving <h> 5 . Update Mac OS <p> Its always advisable to keep your Mac up to date with the latest software and system updates . If you have n't already done so , go to the Apple menu- and select Software Update to check for any available updates as shown below . If you do n't  do this now , its likely that your Mac is probably already setup to check automatically once a week but it does n't  harm to check manually once in a while . <p> Make sure your Mac 's system software is kept up to date <p> You can also check the Mac App Store for application updates . Whilst your shutdown issues may not be resolved just by updating your Mac and its software , its recommended that you have the very latest versions of all the software on your computer . <p> Another suggestion you could try is to temporarily disable any virus protection software that you may have installed , as there have been various reports on the Internet about shutdown issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Install and Restore <p> If you still cant resolve the shutdown issues with your beloved Mac , there are still a few more drastic measures that you could take to try and fix the problem . Going to see a technician at an Apple store is also a good idea , because they a lot of experience with such issues and , especially if you 're not very technically confident , could be a good port of call . <p> Secondly , if your shutdown issues persist , you might consider doing a clean install and restoring from a backup ( e.g. from Time Machine backup ) to recover your documents and applications . Obviously , this option is quite drastic but if all else fails and you have the time , you might as well give it a try . <p> wpadcamp4 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 1 Comment <p> Can I just say , your advice has been absolutely invaluable .

The Mac App Store has hundreds of home finance applications ( mainly found in the Finance or- Business categories ) ranging from expenses and accounting packages to calculators , spreadsheets , tax calculators , and credit card debt managers . In fact , if you can think of it , its probably already there in the App Store . <p> Here is our guide to 8 of the best home finance apps that you can find in the App Store . <p> 4D Expenses is a handy little program to track expenses and view in various categorisations such as groceries , meals out , house , car and many more . It can produce a range of pie charts and graphs to illustrate your monthly outgoings , and can export data to applications such as - Numbers and Excel . <p> Once you 've organised your data , its possible to drag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import additional data from you bank statements ( in CSV format ) .

Bad Plastic can help you manage your credit card accounts more efficiently with all your cards clearly displayed in one place . Most of the features could admittedly be achieved in Numbers , but Bad Plastic makes it simple to get started and on top of your debt . <p> Add your credit cards and statements to see relevant details such as a timeline of the various balances , as well as details including the APR rate and percentage of credit used , plus the estimated number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well buy the application on your credit card too . <p> Billings is a very comprehensive set of tools for quoting , invoicing and time tracking , and has dozens of very attractive invoice templates already built-in .

The application tracks late-paying clients and highlights them in red to bring to your attention . <p> The companion iPhone app let 's you do all this on the move for example adding new projects and sending invoices to clients. - The app is n't especially cheap , but includes most financial tools that any small business or home financial whiz would ever need . <p> The emphasis in CashBook is on simplicity and the ability to view your finances quickly and in real-time . The various tables are n't  all that pretty but they let you enter expenditure and assign items to different categories . CashBook does n't  come with many frills , but since its free you cant really complain . <p> Easy Books is another free app ( albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time tracking .

Customer invoicing must be unlocked via an in-app purchase which costs -20.99 , after which unlimited invoices can be created ( and emailed ) within the app . <p> Easy Books is also available on the iPhone and iPad with full synchronisation between all your devices . <p> iBank is billed as the most flexible and comprehensive personal finance application , and its certainly one of the most popular in the Mac App Store .

Many essential home finance and budgeting features are perhaps more accessible in the other applications , but can be achieved in Numbers with a little patience especially if you use the built-in templates . Numbers is a very capable spreadsheet app and can do most of the things youd want , but it may not be to everyones taste and novice users maybe better off with some of the other apps mentioned . <p> Have you ever wanted to save up for a holiday or a new car but need help and encouragement ?

At the moment however , its still only a developer preview that 's not quite ready for prime time , and contains quite a few bugs and issues that are still being ironed out . <p> Nevertheless , many of you will want to experiment with Mountain Lion either now or when its released , and the safest way to do that whilst leaving your existing installation untouched is to dual boot your Mac and create a new hard disk partition running Mountain Lion . The advantage of this is that if it all goes horribly wrong ( which its bound to for someone ) you can simply boot up back to Snow Leopard or Lion and carry on as normal . <p> This tutorial shows you the basic steps necessary to dual boot with both systems installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Lion was announced in February this year , and unusually for Apple they gave journalists and some tech websites an advanced sneak peak . Mountain Lion pounced almost out of the blue and took many people by surprise . <p> The list of new features is quite comprehensive and should make for a worthy upgrade to anyone on Lion or Snow Leopard. - For more details on what 's new in the new OS , read our article What 's New in OS X Mountain Lion . <p> Some of the headline features of Mountain Lion include : <p> AirPlay- wireless screen sharing to a TV <p> Notification Center which unifies all your messages and alerts ( hopefully itll be called Notification Centre in the British version ! ) <p> More iOS-like lots of new iOS style features and interface enhancements <p> Game Centre play games with friends across Mac and iOS <h> 1 . Check Whether Your Mac is Compatible With Mountain Lion <p> Before installing Mountain Lion , its recommended that you first check whether your Mac is 100% compatible , because older Macs and those with certain graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , the prerequisite system requirements are : <p> 64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo processor or better <p> The ability to boot into OS X 64-bit mode <p> An advanced GPU ( i.e. not one of the Intel GMA 950 cards ) <p> An Internet connection to download OS X 10.8 <p> Its possible to confirm if your Mac can boot into 64-bit mode using- Terminal . Just open the application ( which resides within the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder , or just search in Spotlight ) and type uname -a at the command prompt . You should see something like this : <p> The Macs which are probably will- not- be able to run Mountain Lion are as follows : <p> Any Mac with an Intel GMA 950 or x3100 integrated graphics card <p> Any Mac with an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics card <p> Any MacBook released before 2008 <p> Any iMac released before 2007 <p> The original MacBook Air <p> In general , the newer the Mac the better , but its always a good idea to check the Apple website and support to double check whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developer preview version of Mountain Lion , and so is subject to change before its officially released . <h> 2 .

Just open Disk Utility- from the Applications -&gt; Utilities folder and follows the steps below each step is labelled correspondingly in the screenshot . <p> ( E ) Choose a decent size for the partition . The amount you choose is entirely up to you , but its recommended that you allocate a decent amount of storage considering how much you think you 'll need for storing documents , photos and applications .

The cool thing about Annotations is that if you draw a freehand sketch ( such as an arrow ) , Mail will do its best to convert that into one of its preset shapes . <p> This guide provides a step-by-step how to guide to Annotations , so that you 'll be up and running in no time creating super pictures that make all your messages look that much more attractive . <h> How to use Annotations <h> Step 1 Launch Mail <p> The first thing to do is to launch Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon in their Dock , so just click it or type Mail into Spotlight if you 're already in another fullscreen application for instance . <p> Launch Mail in the normal way to get started . <h> Step 2 - Compose a new message <p> To create a new message , click- the- Compose new message- button on the right of Mails menu bar . This will open a new window ready for editing . <h> Step 3 Populate the mail fields <h> Step 4 Attach an image <p> To use Annotations , you need- to attach an image ( as otherwise there is nothing to annotate ! ) . <p> You can do this- via the- paperclip icon in the messages- toolbar , - or with the photo- browser . In this case , I- used the photo- browser to find a picture on my Mac . <p> Attach a picture to your mail message . <h> Step 5 - Enter markup mode <p> Once the chosen- picture is- visible in your message , hover your mouse on the picture to show- a small dropdown menu . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to System Preferences to configure- extensions ( which we may cover in another post ) , so in this case just choose Markup . <p> Select the Markup option to- edit your picture . <h> Step 6 - Check out the markup menu <p> Once you 've entered annotate / markup mode , your picture will appear in a new window with a toolbar as below : <p> Your picture appears in a new- window- complete with- markup toolbar <p> The toolbar contains- the following items left to right : <p> Sketch draw any shape <p> Shapes insert one of the preset shapes <p> Text add text to your picture <p> Sign add a custom signature <p> Shape Style set the- line style <p> Border Colour set the line colour <p> Fill Colour set the fill colour <p> Text Style format your text <p> Cancel return to mail <p> Done insert into your final message <p> The various markup options . <h> Step 7 Sketch a shape <p> Using the first icon on the toolbar ( blue in the screenshots ) , draw any old shape on your picture . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough arrow shape . <p> Sketch any shape- in seconds . <p> You 'll notice a popup menu appear on the left- with two options the first- keeps your original sketch- the way you drew it , and the second- converts it to one of the preset shapes ( if any match ) . <p> In this example weve- kept the original sketch , but notice the blue circles you can use these to resize the shape , or just grab anywhere on it to move it around . <p> If you choose the second option from the popup , - your shape will revert to Mails suggested preset : <p> Mail converts your shape to one of its default shapes if possible . <p> Tip : try sketching lots of different shapes such as squares , circles and arrows , and see what Mail does to them ! <p> Note the green dot which appears in the centre of the arrow below you can use this to change its- curvature in any way desired . Most objects have similar controls its just a case of experimenting with each one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move or reshape your object . <h> Step 8 Change your- shape style <p> The next thing you might like to do is to change the thickness or line style- of your shape . For example a thick- or a dotted line . <p> The Shape Style menu has lots of options : <p> There are lots of built in shape styles . <h> Step 9 Choose a colour <p> You can set the- border and fill colour for any shape . For- arrows , there 's only a border colour but others ( such as- squares and circles ) allow you to set a fill colour using the standard OS X pickers . <p> Note that the- Text Style- icon- can be used to set the style- of- text objects- and to any text contained within shapes . <p> In the screenshot above , the speech bubble has two green dots one of them changes the length of the callout and the other changes the width . <p> If you want to add shapes with lots of sides , choose the 6-sided- Hexagon- icon in the shapes menu. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sides it has by moving the green circle . For example , you can easily create a triangle , square , or- shapes with many more sides . <p> Tip : - create lots of different shapes and play around with their blue and green grab handles ! <p> Add a shape and then set- how many sides it has . <h> Step 10 Add text to your- shapes <p> To add some text to- the speech bubble , left-click anywhere on the object and type a few words . They will appear in the currently selected style , but you easily change that using the Text Style menu . <p> Select an object and type to quickly add text . <h> Step 11 - Add a circular " zoom " object <p> One of the items in the Shapes menu is- a cool circle- that zooms into the picture- behind it . <p> Select this icon to zoom into an area of your picture . <p> You can also make the shape larger ( with the blue dot ) or increase/decrease the zoom using the green dot : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 Crop your picture <p> Besides adding all manner of fun shapes , you can also crop your image to remove any unwanted portions . Select the- Crop icon from the shapes menu ( the item on the lower left ) . <p> Small blue grab handles appear- on each side of the image just move these in or out as desired to crop . <p> Use the blue handles to crop your image in any direction . <p> Once its cropped , you 'll notice the- unwanted area is still visible but slightly faded ( only while editing it wo n't appear in your final email ) . <p> You can crop your image but still see the unused parts . <h> Step 13 Add a custom signature <p> Perhaps the best feature in Annotations is the ability to insert a custom signature . This can be done with the trackpad or your- Macs camera . <p> Select the- Sign button on the toolbar and then hit- Click Here to Begin . <p> Creating a signature is very straightforward in Mail . <p> Now you can doodle all over your trackpad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its important to realise that your trackpad matches- exactly the virtual trackpad shown . This means- that its actually easier to just look down at your physical one- to sign your name . It might take you a few attempts , but the results can look pretty good ! <p> Writing your name on the trackpad is easy , and the results are great . <p> Once you have created your signature just press any key . <p> You then have the option to clear and start again , to cancel , or to accept the one you 've just made . If you 're happy with the result , choose- Done . <p> Now select the- Sign menu again and you will see your new signature ready to select click to insert into- your picture . <p> Your signature appears in the Sign menu , and is even saved between Mail sessions . <p> Once your signature is- inserted you can resize it , move it around or- change its style in this example- Ive just made it yellow to match the picture . <p> Once you have inserted your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its colour . <p> Next , repeat the process using your Macs camera . This requires you to- hold up your signature on a piece of white paper <p> It can take your Mac a few seconds to recognise the text , and- the results seem to depend on the lighting and colour of pen used . <p> The original text- on white paper . <p> As you can see below , I 've just gone with " Chris " in the end mainly because the camera would only pick up part of the signature . Unfortunately , - its not obvious what the blue line across the centre of the- capture area does- my results seemed a little sporadic , probably due to the poor lighting <p> You can store multiple signatures . <p> Once you have created a camera-based signature , select- it- from the Sign menu to add to your picture . <p> Its also worth noting at this point that- if you want to change the order of any objects ( i.e. in front or behind each other ) , - right-click a- shape and choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here is my completed picture with my desired text inserted inserted . I 've also coloured it red , just to make it stand out a bit . <p> The- text captured by my- Macs camera . <h> Step 14 Youre done ! <p> When you are happy with your all-singing , all-dancing- image , click- Done- to return to Mail . <p> If you want to save a draft and continue editing later , choose- Cancel and then- Save . <p> here 's my final annotated image . <p> A great way to- brighten up your pictures in Mail <p> Annotations is a great addition to Mail , with lots of useful features that will get even better over time . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

This is a great and surprisingly accurate feature that can make it easier to write , though it is limited to 30 seconds at a time . Thankfully , Mavericks takes this a step further with the- Enhanced Dictation feature basically it will download the speech recognition functionality to your Mac and process speech locally , even when you do n't  have a network connection . <p> This article explains how to turn on and use Dictation , and also describes the new Enhanced Dictation feature . <h> How to Enable Dictation <p> To turn on Dictation , open up System Preferences- either from the Settings icon in your Dock , or type Dictation into- Spotlight . Down at the bottom you 'll see the Dictation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings screen . <p> Turn dictation on in System Preferences <p> Next , you 'll see various options .

Click on Enable Dictation to continue . <p> Confirm that you want to enable dictation <p> The next thing to do is to choose the shortcut key that you 'll use to activate Dictation within any document . The default is set to press the Function key ( Fn ) twice , though you can also choose any of the other options or even customise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcut key from the dropdown menu <p> Once you 've set all the options , you can start using Dictation in lots of apps where youd typically type text such as Pages , Mail or Notes . <h> Using Dictation <p> Dictation is pretty simple to use and behaves pretty much as expected . Open an application ( Pages in this example ) and use the shortcut key that you setup earlier to start dictating . A small microphone icon pops up as shown below , ready for you to speak . Regular Dictation ( i.e. not the enhanced mode ) let 's you talk for up to 30 seconds at a time which is fine for emails but not so great for Word documents where youd typically enter longer passages of text . <p> Hopefully , your words will now appear accurately captured as text onscreen , as shown below .

Turn off Wireless Networking <p> Wireless networking ( i.e. Airport ) takes a big hit on your battery life so try to turn it off when not in use . Its actually a lot more power efficient to use a good old-fashioned cable connection rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coffee shops and airport lounges . <p> Bluetooth is n't nearly as power hungry as WiFi , but its still possible to save a bit of battery life by disabling it when not being used . When you do need to use Bluetooth , just turn it on momentarily from the Menu Bar . <h> 2 . Reduce the Display Brightness <p> Turning down the screen brightness is one of the most important things you can do to conserve battery life , as its typically one of the biggest power drains on any computer . Reduce the brightness as low as you can tolerate whilst still being able to work comfortably . Its claimed that inverting the desktop colours can reduce power consumption its worth a try but the colours are quite garish . Just type- Ctrl + Option + Cmd + 8. - Besides possibly saving a bit of power its also quite a fun little effect and makes quite a handy " night mode " for reading text in applications such as Pages and Mail . <h> 3 . Turn Off or Reduce the Keyboard Backlight <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and while its an extremely useful feature that makes typing in the dark considerably easier , it does pose an extra burden on the battery . Simply reduce the brightness level with the F1 and F2 keys on your Macs keyboard . Alternatively , go- System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard- and uncheck Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light and also reduce the time that they keyboard stays lit up . <p> Turn off the keyboard backlight <h> 4 . Close Unused Applications <p> It quite sounds obvious but many people do n't  realise that having many CPU-intensive applications open simultaneously can considerably reduce your battery life , especially if those applications frequently access the disk or require lots of CPU time ( the Mac becomes hotter which turns the fan on ) , or those which are are especially memory intensive as it can cause memory to be paged in and out of the hard disk . <p> Simply quit any applications that you do n't  need to be running constantly , and also disable automatic checking of email in Mail the reason being is that if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumes CPU cycles and other resources , all contributing to a shorter battery life . <p> In the General tab , set Mail to manually check for new messages <p> You could also kill any non-essential background processes which may be running , for example the iTunes Helper process which looks for attached devices such as iPhones and iPods . Open Activity Monitor to search for such processes , but be careful that you do n't  terminate something important its good to exercise caution and look on the Internet to see what each process does before you close them . <p> Installing additional memory in your Mac will also reduce dependency on paging memory to and from the hard disk , so adding a few extra Gigabytes can be a real battery saver . <p> There has also been a lot of controversy over performance of- Flash- on the Mac and whether it really is detrimental to battery life . For safetys sake it can easily be disabled in Safari with an extension such as- ClickToFlash- to block Flash ads and video clips . With the steady move towards standards-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less essential for the full web experience anyway . <p> Flash can be blocked with Safari extensions such as ClickToFlash <h> 5 . Turn Off Spotlight Indexing <p> Spotlight causes quite a bit of access to the hard drive and so uses power constantly . When running , Spotlight tracks any changes made to your hard drive so that you can search for documents , applications , images , movies and other files very quickly . - However , Spotlight can safely be temporarily- disabled especially if you do n't  use it much or are content with not being able to search for a while . <p> To disable Spotlight indexing go to System Preferences -&gt; Spotlight and select the Privacy button . Next , just drag your entire hard drive icon from Finder or the desktop into the area labelled Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations ( or press the little + button ) , and choose OK when prompted . To turn indexing back on , just remove your hard drive from the list of locations with the button . <p> Prevent Spotlight from indexing your hard disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works optimally within a certain temperature range ( Apple says between 10 to 35 degrees Celsius ) , but the inbuilt cooling fan is designed to come on when the temperature exceeds certain preset thermal thresholds . You may have noticed it whirring away whenever you computer is doing some particularly hard work such as crunching videos in iMovie . <p> The fans operation depends on several factors such as the room temperature , the motherboard and CPU temperature . Since the fan is mechanical it draws power , so keeping your Mac cool obviously means it does n't  need to come on quite so much . Apple states that your Mac should be kept as close as possible to a room temperature of 21 or 22 degrees Celsius. <h> 7 . Calibrate the Battery Once a Month <p> To keep your MacBooks battery in tip-top condition its recommended that you occasionally calibrate the battery once a month or so , especially if you usually leave it plugged into the mains . Lithium Ion ( Li-ion ) batteries such as those in MacBooks lose capacity over time particularly if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure your Mac can charge to its full potential . <p> To calibrate your MacBook battery , follow these steps : <p> Charge your computer fully until the battery meter shows 100% or the LED on the MagSafe charger turns green <p> Let your computer stay fully charged for at least 2 hours . Its still OK to use it as long as it remains plugged in <p> Disconnect the power supply and continue to use your Mac on battery power alone . When the battery is low , you 'll see the usual warning sign popup <p> Save your work but continue to use the computer . When the battery is extremely low , your MacBook will go into sleep mode <p> Give your Mac a well deserved rest and allow it to remain in sleep mode for at least 5 hours <p> Connect the power adaptor once more and charge the computer until its full . Its now properly calibrated and ready to go ! <h> 8 . Avoid Using Optical Disks <p> When you 're running on batteries try to avoid optical disks such as CDs and DVDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drive and so use a lot of juice , so if you really want to watch movies for example try and rip them before you travel . Likewise , a modicum of power can be saved by minimising your MacBooks volume or even by using headphones to avoid powering the inbuilt speakers . The same goes for any external peripherals such as USB-powered hard disks disconnect any such devices when you 're on battery power , and only connect them when its absolutely necessary . <h> 9 . Disable or Decrease the Auto-Save Frequency in Applications <p> Many applications have a convenient auto-save feature that saves your work automatically . The issue is that saving work requires access to the hard disk , which in turn uses battery to spin . In Mac OS X Lion , auto-save and resume is hard to disable but many non-Lion apps still have individual auto-save settings which can usually be changed within their preferences . Check the applications that you use regularly to see if such an option exists . <h> 10 . Switch to a Solid State Storage ( SSD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend your battery life , this one also involves reducing dependence on the mechanical hard drive . In fact , completely swapping out your MacBooks regular drive for a modern SSD drive has many advantages : <p> Your files will open more quickly <p> Reduced boot time and application load time <p> Increased reliability and less overall wear and tear on the system <p> Overall system speed will be snappier and seem much more responsive <p> Less heat ( as much as 95% less when idle ) and so the fan will be used less <p> Your battery will last longer <p> Some users have claimed an 30-40 minutes of extra battery life is possible when using an SSD . Of course , MacBook Air owners already enjoy this luxury , but MacBook Pro users would do well to consider a high capacity SSD as a viable alternative . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

With this merge comes some new shortcuts to make it really quick and easy to navigate your open windows on the Mac . <p> To Enter Mission Control hit F3 or ctrl and the up arrow key . <p> To move between Spaces and Full Screen apps from the Desktop and in Mission Control hit ctrl and the back and forward arrow keys <p> To QuickLook a window in Mission Control just hover you mouse over a window then hit the space bar <h> Reading List <p> Reading List in Safari was introduced by Apple to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcuts will make adding content to your reading list a snap . <p> To add the current page in safari to your reading list hit cmd , shift and D <p> To add any link on a webpage in safari to your reading list hold down shift and click on the link you want to add to your reading list . <p> To view your reading list in safari hit cmd , shift and L. <h> Launchpad <p> By default Launchpad is not assigned a keyboard shortcut in Lion , Apple has favored using gestures to enter and exit launchpad . Using a trackpad to enter Launchpad you just pinch with your thumb and three fingers and to exit just spread your thumb and three fingers . <p> But you can assign a keyboard shortcut , By following these steps . <h> Open System Preferences <p> Go to the Keyboard preference pane then click on Keyboard Shortcuts ' In the left hand column choose Launchpad &amp; Dock ' Then in the right hand column you will see two options , Choose Show Launchpad ' <p> Now to assign a shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty space , Click in this empty space and a text box will appear now simply type the shortcut you want to use . <h> Emoji <p> Emoji has been on the iPhone and iPad for a while now and with Lion Apple has brought it over to the Mac in the form of a new Font called Apple Color Emoji ' But you ca n't actually use emoji without opening and using the Special Characters picker in Mac OS X. To access the Special Characters Picker you first have to enable it . <p> You can do this by following these steps . <h> Open System Preferences <p> Go to the Keyboard preference pane then click on the Keyboard ' Tab You will see an option at the bottom called Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar ' make sure the box next to this option is checked . <p> You will then see this icon n++ appear in the Menu Bar <p> From here you can click on Show Character Viewer ' Once the Character Viewer have opened you will find Emoji in the left hand column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By default Mac OS X Lion hides the user Library folder from view in Finder . Here is a really easy way to get it back .

A vertical swipe down brings returns the window down into the main view , and left and right will slide between dashboard panes . <p> This is easiest to do if you move your whole arm before you make this gesture , without too much strain with the wrist . <p> About the accented letters thing , actually most diacritics were easy to do on every OSX before lion . All you had to do was hold down the alt key and press the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German umla++t , E for a grave accent , A for an acute accent , I for a French carot . If you 're typing a non-latin script such as Japanese or Devangari that makes constant use of all modifier keys , alt had the same use . You also had something like 110 other symbols like G and GP that were accessible through the alt and shift modifiers . Windows , even the " ultimate " version that costs the price of a small econo-tower pc , still does n't  have that level of accessibility . Windows users have to buy a separate app to translate unicode into text for that . <p> As an AVID Mac fan , it pains me greatly to see that Windows 7 KILLS OS X , even Lion , at working with international characters . Cmon Apple ! Dammit ! You can do better than this " hover over the text and hold down the character your want to accent " garbage . <p> I withdraw my earlier comment ! !

@@22342921 @2342921/ <h> Three Alternatives To Instagram <p> If you 've already closed your Instagram account and do n't  know what to with the photos you 've got , then this is the post for you . If you have n't yet done that and want to , you can find out how to do that here . Instagram has long been one of the most popular photo sharing sites on the web , but its recent takeover by Facebook has been controversial to say the least , with privacy a key concern . Here is a rundown of the three best alternatives that you should consider : Flickr , Imgur and PhotoBucket . <h> Flickr <p> Flickr seems to be the most popular alternative to instagram that has emerged in recent days . It seems many are making the move over to the Yahoo-owned photo service which seems to offer a good selection of features . It allows you to do all the usual stuff : organise your photos into albums , and you even add tags and locations you can remember the location in the photo . <p> In addition , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plethora of apps for all devices . It does n't  matter what smartphone platform you use : iPhone , Android , Windows 8 , they 've got your uploading needs covered and more . <h> Imgur <p> The main reason I love Imgur is its simplicity . It takes seconds to upload a photo , there are a whole host of options for sharing , everywhere from forums to Twitter , and you can edit your photos right on the spot in your browser . <p> That 's right . You can crop , rotate and scale as necessary and it really is a great feature made with so much simplicity . Imgur is my photo uploader of choice , and it comes highly recommended . What 's more , it has unlimited uploading something that the other candidates on this list ( I believe ) do n't  have for free . <h> Photobucket <p> Like Flickr , Photobucket has been around for a while now , and it has many satisfied customers . Both sites are actually very similar , with sharing options aplenty and the option to tweak or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photobuckets app is also incredibly popular , even though it is offered on fewer platforms than Flickrs . <p> However , photo bucket do have another app called Snapbucket which is dedicated to sharing your photos with friends and family , something which it makes easier than ever to do . AND , if you 're an iPhoto user , there is a plugin allowing you to directly manage and upload photos to Photobucket right from - the app , something which will greatly appeal to Mac users . <h> Verdict <p> Imgur is the definition of simplicity . If that 's what you 're after , then it will be perfect . However , if you love the Instagram style effects , then Flickr or Photobucket are probably your best bets . They make ti really easy to add all sorts of funky hues and colours to your photos , so if you like that sort of thing , you 'll have a lot of fun . My vote goes to Imgur , but that 's only because I like things that are simple and straightforward . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

However , if you 're in a rush to find and buy things it can be a bit clunky to navigate , first you have to open the iTunes store or the Mac App store , then you need to start your search and then narrow down the results by category until you find exactly what you 're looking for . You 're probably so used to doing this to buy something that you do n't  even notice how time-consuming and slow the whole convoluted process can be , do you really need to open up a whole new app just to quickly search for stuff that Apple wants to sell you ? <p> Unsurprisingly the answer is no , once you download Tunesque ( do n't  us us how you- pronounce- that one ) you 'll be able to search the entire Apple store just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The freely- available- app ( which you can download here ) sits in your menu bar and provides you with a simple search box within which you can write your- queries . <p> The searching process is surprisingly quick , with the results in the slick drop down menu appearing in real time as you type out your search term . Tunesque really does- trawl- every single aspect of app store so you 'll be able to find everything you need including podcasts , iTunesU material and ebooks as well as the more- familiar- songs and movies . <p> Once you 've found what you 're looking for Tunesque even let 's you use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between the different- categories- that its found . As an extra bonus the search results even show you the prices for each bit of content , so you can work out what the most cost-effective way of- purchasing- what you need , or for finding material that 's freely available through the app store .

There must be some restrictions on how Apple allows developers to access the material on its store because as soon as you actually click on the item you want to get from the iTunes store you 'll be moved onto iTunes or the App Store to finalise your purchase and hand over your details . <p> Obviously personal security could be at risk here , and Apple would never want you to give bank details to a third party , but its a shame that although Tunesque really helps you out when you 're searching for items it wont actually make the process of buying them any simpler and you 're still going to have to open another app to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

There are dozens of security camera systems available , many of which run on your Mac and can be monitored remotely from another computer or even your phone . Fancy keeping an eye on the cleaner , or checking that the kids have got home safely ? Or perhaps you 've gone away for a few days and want to check on your house occasionally . <p> Weve listed 10 apps below which are all available in the Mac App Store . Many make use of your Macs built-in camera ( or an external USB one ) so you can check what 's going on while you 're away . <h> 1 . Home Watch <p> Home Watch is quite a simple app it just snaps a picture whenever motion is detected , or it can be set to take pictures periodically , e.g. every 30 minutes . Every image can be saved on your Mac or uploaded to a cloud service such as DropBox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your phone . Home Watch is one of the simplest remote surveillance apps for the Mac , but it gets the job done . <p> A simple security app but the results are effective <h> 2. iSentry <p> iSentry is another simple ( and free ! ) app that uses your webcam record what 's going on . Just like Home Watch , it can be triggered to send you a video or photo whenever motion is detected . There are also various settings to control the activation time , sounds , alerts and email notifications . Images can be uploaded to various hosting sites , so you can view them from literally anywhere . <p> Any movement near your Mac triggers a photo or video <h> 3. iWatchU <p> iWatchU is one of the most feature-rich of the surveillance applications we 've covered , and just like most of them , it features some pretty advanced motion detection algorithms and can record video whenever an intrusion is detected , and let you know by sending an email . <p> Every event is recorded to its history so you can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as either images or movies . The app supports unlimited USB or Firewire cameras simultaneously handy if you want to monitor multiple rooms at once . Perhaps its best feature ( and something the other apps do n't  seem to offer ) is that you can stream live video of the action ! View everything on your iPhone and iPad too with the freely available companion apps . iWatchU certainly provides all the features you could ever need to make sure your Mac is safe and sound ! <p> One of the most advanced and feature-rich surveillance apps we 've seen , including streaming <h> 4 . My Webcam Broadcaster <p> My Webcam Broadcaster is another pretty decent free app , but it does n't  have very many features however - the basics are covered well . Its compatible with the built-in Mac iSight camera and many external USB ones , and can its snaps be viewed on the web , iPhone , iPad and iPod touch ( you need to download the iOS app first ) . It takes regular snapshots to create a time-lapse video , which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the time-lapse video let 's you see everything that 's been going on <h> 5 . OpenEye Remote <p> OpenEye Remote is a little different to the other apps listed , because you need to have one of the remote controlled OpenEye professional cameras for it to work . Check out the OpenEye website for the full range of cameras once you 've got the correct one , you can view them remotely even pan , zoom and tilt ! The app is free but of course you need to splash out on the hardware <p> A brilliant app to monitor multiple cameras - however you have to buy an OpenEye camera first ! <h> 6 . Security Camera <p> Security Camera is another basic app , but its simple to use and setup is a breeze .

@@22342932 @2342932/ <h> How to Use Tags in OS X Mavericks <p> There are some notable new features in the latest version of Mac OS X for example a new version of Safari , iCloud Keychain , and a whole host of memory , performance and power improvements ( such as App Nap and Compressed Memory ) . - However , the feature that you 're most likely to use every day and get the most out of , is probably Tags . <h> What are Tags ? <p> Apple obviously believes that organising your files into folders is a bit old-hat . After all , it does take some effort to keep organised and create an easy-to-use structure that helps you remember where you left important documents . With Mavericks , you can use metadata ( that 's basically information that describes data ! ) to organise your files in a much more efficient and powerful way. - For example , you might want to tag all your electronic receipts or company documents , or perhaps you 're working on a special project that needs to be marked as important . As another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tag " Invoices " and unpaid ones " Unpaid Invoices " meaning that you can instantly see ( wherever they are actually saved ) the ones that need attention . <p> The new Tags feature is a vast improvement ( and long overdue ) on the old " labels " feature available in previous versions of OS X. The concept however is quite similar you can assign a custom " Tag " to any file or folder ( including iCloud items like Pages and presentations ) that help you view and organise your files . However , whereas labels was just a simple visual aid to highlight any item with a colour in Finder , Tags- are much more powerful and can actually be used to when you- search for items on your Mac . Furthermore , you can add- multiple tags to an item so you 're not limited to one category when describing what it is . <h> Let 's play Tag <p> To get going with Tags , open a new- Finder- window and browse to any file or folder on your Mac . With the item selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Finder toolbar . <p> Use the new Tags button to add a Tag to any item <p> A popup window then appears to add a new Tag , just start typing the name of the Tag that you want to create . In this example I 've created a new Tag called " Chriswrites " . Hit Enter to actually assign the Tag to the selected item . <p> Enter a name for your new Tag <p> You 'll notice that nothing much has changed in the Finder window because we have n't yet assigned a colour to the new tag . However , in the Finder sidebar , the new tag name you 've just created should now be visible in this case " Chriswrites " ( along with several other tags I 've already created and applied to items on my Mac and iCloud ) . <p> By default , new tags you create are not assigned any particular colour . To change that , with the Finder window still open , choose- Preferences from the Finder menu ( or just use Cmd-comma ) and then the Tags tab . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tag should be visible in the list ( with no colour assigned ) as well as a checkbox to indicate whether it will be displayed in the sidebar . The sidebar lists all recent tags automatically , but you can manually choose the ones you want to appear from this preferences panel. - You can also move tags into the desired order and assign a colour . <p> To change a Tags colour , right-click the Tag and then choose the desired colour as shown below in this case I 've made it yellow . Note that there are only 8 colours to choose from . <p> Assign a colour ( there are 8 to choose from ) to your Tag <p> You can repeat this process to add as many tags as you want , with any colour desired . In this case well create a new folder called " Important Docs " and assign both the Chriswrites and Important tags to the folder . While were at it , we may as well assign In Progress to the Images folder as well . <p> We now have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Images : tagged Chriswrites and In Progress <p> 2 . Important Docs : tagged Chriswrites and Important <p> The Finder window now looks like this : <p> Assign multiple Tags to an item <p> Every item that has been tagged is displayed with a small coloured circle corresponding to the Tag colour . <p> There 's also another way to assign Tags in Finder . Use Cmd-I open an Info window for any selected item . At the top you 'll see any Tags assigned to that item they can also be added / deleted here by clicking on the empty space ( where it says " Add Tags " when none have already been assigned at the top of the window . Just starting typing to add a new Tag or select from the pop-up list . <p> Add Tags in the Info window <p> Its also possible to right-click on any item in Finder to open the context-menu , and select any Tag from the Tags section . <p> Right-click on any item and choose a Tag from the context menu <p> In terms of adding Tags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac or iCloud . In Pages for example , when saving a new document , a Tag field is shown that let 's you assign a new Tag or choose from an existing one . <p> Tags can be added to any item saved in iWork apps <p> Having just two folders tagged is n't all that useful , so I 'm going to tag all the images in my special Chriswrites Images folder with the Chriswrites tag ( so I can find them easily later on ) . Once again , highlight all the items you want to select ( e.g. just left-click the mouse in the Finder window and drag to select all the items ) and then hit the Tags button . Now - choose any Tag from the list . <p> Drag-select multiple items then assign a tag to them all at once <p> Mavericks also allows you to create favourite Tags , that appear by default on Finder menus and within applications . Go back to the Finder Preferences under Tags , and you 'll notice an empty section at the bottom and some help about dragging Tags to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that list . <p> Drag tags from the list to your favourites <h> Finding your tagged files <p> Now that we 've got some items tagged , let 's use them to find some of the files on our Mac . <p> Next , simply click any of the Tags which are visible in the Finder sidebar to view only those items you 'll instantly see every item with the particular Tag you 've assigned . And if you 've assigned more than one Tag to an item , you 'll see all the relevant colours displayed just to the left of the file or folder as a small coloured circle . <p> Select a Tag from the sidebar to see relevant items <p> You can see in the screenshots that I already use several Tags day-to-day for things that are important or in progress , company documents , etc . The Tags feature really has become indispensable I no longer need to remember- exactly which folder I 've put things in , and while Spotlight also let 's you find documents quickly , sometimes it can be more convenient and useful to view them using Tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just become that little bit easier in Mavericks. 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 <h> 2 Comments <p> Ronald , I really like this article , lots of great info on tags .

The feature is already available on iOS for iPads and iPhones , but now that it will be available on the Mac it opens up lots of new possibilities . For example , showing Keynote presentations on a large TV , Safari web browsing , videos or even games . <p> One important point to realise is that there is a very- slight delay between what appears on your screen and what appears on the TV , because your Mac has to compress the picture and transmit wirelessly to the Apple TV box . This means that for real-time games such as car racing , it may not meet your expectations in terms of the frame rate and performance . For most applications though , AirPlay works fantastically well . <p> Given the low cost of the Apple TV box ( $99 in the US ) , Apple has created an excellent presentation tool for business and educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby ! <p> AirPlay requires an Apple TV set-top box and simply mirrors exactly what 's on the screen of your Mac .

This means that for presentations on the road , all you need to take with you is an Apple TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing to do is to setup your Apple TV box , if you have n't already done so . Full details can be found on the Apple website , otherwise follow these basic steps : <h> Setup and Configure Apple TV <p> You can stream your Macs screen wirelessly at up to 720p resolution , or the resolution of your screen if its lower than that . In future versions of the Apple TV , it should also be possible to stream higher resolution video ( 1080p ) . AirPlay also sends your Macs audio to the TV , so you can view high definition pictures and enjoy decent quality audio . <p> Connect your Apple TV to a HDTV using either the HDMI cable or component cables <p> Select the correct AV channel input on your TV that the Apple TV is connected to <p> Connect the Apple TV to your wireless network when prompted , use the Apple Remote to search for your network from the list and make sure you know the WiFi password <p> Just follow the onscreen instructions to enter the necessary configuration information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and setup a 5-digit password , so that Apple TV can access your media library <p> Note : its important to run the very latest Apple TV firmware for it to work with Mountain Lion , which is available on Apples iOS development portal .

Formatting posts on these websites , however , takes a while to get around and what if you 'd prefer to use your mobile device , instead of being tethered to the computer ? Webr has the answer , in the form of an easy-to-use iOS app . <h> What is Webr ? <p> Webr competes with mainstream blogging sites in its offer of free web hosting .

Speech bubbles pop up , instructing you where to press , and what will happen when you do managing , thankfully , to avoid a patronising tone . <p> There are three types of web page you can create : an image page , a text page and a blog entry . The website that Webr let 's you create for free can be a combination of any number of these three types , meaning that your finished creation can be quite impressive . <p> Once you 've had your fill of adding pictures and text , Webr let 's you choose the theme of your web page . Although there are around ten choices , we found them to be slightly samey , though professional-looking . For the fun ' website we were trying to create , there was n't really a theme to suit , and we ended up plumping for second best , a plain white look . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfully , do n't reappear every time you repeat the same step ) are helpful , Webr 's interface is in fact very intuitive .

If you 're one of those people that spends a lot of time surfing the web and reading all kinds of news , having the latest headlines in a special toolbar can provide a more immediate way to consume news , rather than using RSS readers or just going to the websites themselves . This article describes some of the news extensions available for Safari . Its important to note that most of these do n't  work in fullscreen mode ( at least in the latest version of Safari ) , so unfortunately you 'll need to run Safari in the normal way or just assign it to its own desktop for easier management .

The New York Times <p> The New York Times is one of the most popular American news providers and therefore a good choice to keep up to date with all that 's happening across the pond and around the world .

Simply click on the RSS button that appears in the title bar of Safari when a websites feed is detected , and your default news reader pops up and prompts you to subscribe . Its even possible to add news feeds in the Mail app , but many people prefer separate RSS readers because they tend to have much more functionality than Mail ( in Mountain Lion , Apple seems to have removed RSS functionality from Mail completely ) . <p> Dozens of third-party RSS news readers are available in the Mac App Store , many of which can also synchronise with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also synchronise with a Google Reader account head over to the Google website to set one up ( its free ! ) . <p> here 's a selection of the best and most highly rated RSS readers currently available in the Mac App Store , in alphabetical order <p> gss-content-boxUPDATE : Since this article was published a few of these apps have been discontinued .

Thanks ! /gss-content-box <p> Fresh Feed focuses on simplicity . The application sits in the Macs menu bar and is updated in real time .

The app is simply a Google Reader client so you need to have a Google account to use it , but it synchronises perfectly and has lots of sharing options such as posting to Twitter and Instapaper . There are multiple view layouts and you can even download full articles for specified feeds to read later . <p> NewsBar is a little unusual amongst the Mac RSS readers , because it shows the news in a semi-transparent sidebar on your desktop screen which is updated in real-time . There are dozens of useful features such as single-click to pop-up and read , or double-click to open the full story in the browser , as well as optional synchronisation with a Google Reader account , plus favourites , a customisable interface and much more . <p> NewsFire is quite old now and has n't  been updated for some time , but it has a very functionality and uncluttered interface that contains just the most essential features . You cant synchronise with Google Reader unfortunately , but as a very basic RSS - reader which does exactly what it says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honour of being many peoples favourite RSS reader and is consistently popular on the iPad , iPhone and Mac .

Select an article headline and you 're taken to the original story inside the app itself , or you can view the original in Safari . A great little news reader indeed , and one that 's become deservedly popular . <p> RSS Menu its quite unique because it does n't  have its own application window , but as the name suggests it uses a systemwide drop-down menu instead . This means its easily accessible from any screen on your Mac even in full-screen mode . Whilst some people might prefer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a handy news reading application . <p> RSS Ticker For Google Reader not only presents RSS news feeds and syncs with a Google Reader account , but it has a rather nice ticker that constantly scrolls feeds across the title bar in the chosen space , much like a rolling news channel .

@@22342942 @2342942/ <h> Spam Filtering Tools &amp; Plug-ins For OS X Mail <p> The spam filters in Mail already work pretty well at keeping out unsolicited junk mail from your precious inbox , but there are times when you might want some added protection . There 's nothing more annoying than receiving hundreds of mails that you did n't  ask for ( imagine if your postbox at home was deluged in the same way ! ) , so check out some of the spam plug-ins and proxies we 've described that are available for the Mac . Its worth remembering that Mails built-in junk mail filters are supposed to become more accurate over time , especially if you regularly help it by marking emails as junk or not junk . <p> We 've also included several email proxies in this list ( because there are surprisingly few actual spam filter plug-ins for Mail ) these are applications which receive mail directly from your email server and provide their own advanced filtering . Mail simply then connects to the proxy rather than the real mail server so they can be thought of as a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mail app. <h> 1 . SpamSieve <p> SpamSieves main attraction is that it learns to intelligently filter spam by learning your email habits .

You can whitelist any contacts so they 're never added to the spam folder , and also create your own rules and filters . <p> Intelligently filter junk email with SpamSieve <h> 2 . POPFile <p> POPFile is n't strictly a Mail plug-in either , as it runs on your machine between Mail and your email server .

As such , its a very useful accompaniment to Mail , and let 's you assign mails to any number of different buckets such as Personal , Spam , Fun , and Work .

Spamfire <p> Spamfire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of initial training , but after which quickly learns which messages are junk . Again , its not really a Mail plugin but it does automatically configure Mail to download the messages that Spamfire has already processed . The filters let you decide what to do with emails such as good emails , borderline good emails , probable spam and definite spam . For example , you might decide to delete spam messages immediately , or for borderline cases hold them until you 've had a chance to classify them as junk or not . <p> Placeholder <p> here 's an example of the user interface , which also has a rather unique and interesting feature built-in to spam the spammers ! <p> Placeholder <p> One consideration that you should be aware of is that the Spamfire developers claim free email services such as Google Mail provide spam filtering which is just as good , if not better than , applications such as this . So even though they will happily accept payment for the software , they concede that you might be just as satisfied with another solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Details : Spamato on Sourceforge <p> Price : - FREE <p> Spamato is also an email proxy which sits between your real email server and your Macs Mail application .

Personal Antispam <p> Personal Antispam is actually a subset of Integos Internet Security Barrier X6 product , and as such there 's also a lot of other features contained within the package .

And what will Apple maps bring to the table that Google does n't already offer ? <h> Flyover <p> A highly touted feature of Apple 's maps is Flyover , the name for an air-down view showing 3D buildings and landscapes . Impressive it certainly is , but is it as useful as Google 's Street View , which it seems to be replacing ? Perhaps so Flyover , with its aerial perspective , presents a view free from clutter you 'd find on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some getting used to identifying buildings and locations from a bird's-eye perspective , but thanks to the 3D presentation , this should n't be too difficult . In the end , it 's a matter of opinion as to whether Google or Apple wins in this area , but if nothing else , Flyover is a great way to show off the powers of your iDevice to friends . <h> Turn by turn directions <p> It is n't really fair to compare the old and new versions of Maps in this regard , as although Google has developed a satellite navigation system for Android , it purposefully withheld it from iOS one reason why Apple developed their own app . This feature , though , is one iOS users have been missing for a while , especially since it 's standard on every other major operating system . <h> A different look <p> Apple have tweaked colours , labels and who knows what else to give a more Apple-ified ' look to the new app . A wider palette is used , which is always nice to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to other screens , such as Samsung 's Super-AMOLED , which tend to give warmer-than-life colours ) . <h> Vector based maps <p> At last , some technical vocabulary creeps into Apple 's description of the new maps : the company are using vector , rather than Googles raster , graphics for their maps . This blog LONG ... does a good job at explaining the difference , but the ultimate outcome is that maps should load faster and display more detail , making the most of retina displays and cutting down the annoying wait previously experienced . <h> Traffic reports <p> Maps will , come iOS 6 , use live traffic reports to influence directions and ensure you get to your direction in the quickest time or at least the least annoying way possible . Again , Google has withheld this feature from iOS so far , so while iPhone owners rejoice , this ca n't be counted as an Apple victory . <p> The long and short of it is that , while Apple has n't stunned its user base this time with anything madly innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should see iDevice users given everything the other team ( namely Android ) has . Apple has ensured their app looks different , both with the colour scheme and with their substitute for Street View , but whether or not these changes are for the better comes down to a question of opinion . <p> Let 's not forget the last benefit that iOS users will receive from this transition : Apple have thrown down the gauntlet to Google in replacing them as default , meaning ( we hope ) that Google will strive to release an iOS app that goes one better and competition is always good for the market . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342948 @2342948/ <h> Get Unlimited Free Wi-Fi at any Airport on your Mac <p> There 's nothing quite as frustrating as being stuck in an airport with nothing to do , especially if your flight is delayed . Many airports offer complimentary Wi-Fi , but often this Wi-Fi is only free for a set amount of time . As soon as you hit that time limit , you may find yourself permanently locked out of the network unless you 're willing to hand over your credit card details ! <p> In this article I 'm going to show you how to turn limited free Wi-Fi into unlimited free Wi-Fi . By the end of this article , you 'll know how to trick any Wi-Fi network into viewing you as a brand new user , every time you disconnect and then re-connect to the network . By repeating these steps , you 'll be able to keep resetting the network countdown , potentially indefinitely . <p> Time limits are n't the only restrictions you may encounter when trying to connect to a public network , as it 's not unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be public . If an airport 's Wi-Fi network is protected by a password , then you can often get the password by asking at reception or by checking signs or posters around the area but why make connecting to the web harder than it needs to be ? In this article I 'll also be showing you how to use your iPad or iPhone to get instant access to over 100 million public Wi-Fi passwords , including the passwords for networks at airports across the globe . <p> Finally , I 'll be sharing some additional techniques you can use to get online when all else fails , including turning your smartphone into a portable Wi-Fi hotspot . <p> Although I 'm going to be talking about airport Wi-Fi , you can apply these techniques to any public network , so whether you 're sat in your local bar , cafe or restaurant , or in a hotel on the opposite side of the world , you 'll be able to side-step those frustrating restrictions and browse for free , potentially for however long you want . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for restricting your access to Wi-Fi . While it 's unlikely that anyone will notice you pushing the boundaries a little , just be careful not to push them too far . Extending your free browsing session by 10 minutes when you 're sat in the middle of a half-empty airport lounge is unlikely to cause problems , but hogging the last available table at your local cafe for an extra hour , just so you can continue to use their Wi-Fi , is a completely different story . <p> Basically , do n't abuse these techniques to the point where it starts to negatively impact other patrons , or the venue itself . <h> Spoofing your Mac Address <p> Restricted airport networks monitor how long you 've been online , by logging your device 's MAC ( Media Access Control ) address , a set of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your computer . <p> By default , this MAC address is the only way that a public Wi-Fi network can identify your computer , so you can extend your free trial by changing your MAC address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new MAC address , the network will view you as a new user , and will reset the timer . <p> MAC addresses are hard-coded , but you can change them temporarily either by issuing Terminal commands or by using spoofing software . <p> Since it 's the easiest option , let 's look at an app that enables you to change our MAC address with the click of a button . There are numerous MAC spoofing programs out there , but I 'm going to be using LinkLiar , so head over to its GitHub page and download the latest release of LinkLiar.app.zip . Once you 've downloaded this file , unzip and launch it . <p> If you encounter a message warning you that LinkLiar is from an unidentified developer , then complete the following steps : <p> Open your Mac 's System preferences ' <p> Select Security &amp; Privacy . ' <p> Find the LinkLiar was blocked . ' message and click its accompanying Open Anyway ' button . You should now be able to launch LinkLiar without any problems . <p> After launching LinkLiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your Mac toolbar . Click this icon and select Authorize LinkLiar ' from the dropdown menu . When prompted , enter your admin username and password . <p> This menu includes your current MAC address ; hover over this string of letters and numbers , to open a submenu . <p> Generate a new MAC address , by selecting Random . ' <p> Reconnect to the Wi-Fi and you should find that the timer has now been reset . If you exceed the time limit again , then simply repeat these steps to bring that timer back to zero . <p> If you do manually change your MAC address , then you do n't need to worry about losing your original address , as this information is embedded into your hardware and your computer will revert to its original settings the next time it restarts . If you do need to revert to your original address and do n't want to go to the trouble of restarting your computer , then you can always restore your original address via LinkLiar : <p> Launch the LinkLiar app and click its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAC address to open the submenu . <p> Select Reset to original . ' <h> Spoof your MAC Address from the Terminal <p> If you 're familiar with Terminal commands or you just do n't like the idea of installing yet another app , then you can also change your MAC address via the Terminal . <p> The major drawback to spoofing via the Terminal is that if you ever want to revert to your original address without restarting your computer , then you 'll need to enter your original MAC address into the Terminal . Therefore , it 's recommended that you make a note of your original address before generating a new one . To find your computer 's MAC address , hold down the Option ' key on you keyboard while clicking the Wi-Fi ' icon in the toolbar you 'll find this information towards the top of the menu . <p> Then , just press the Enter ' key on your keyboard and your computer will start using this new address . <p> To switch back to your original address without restarting your computer , enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the final bit of text with your original MAC address : <p> sudo ifconfig en0 ether yo:ur:ma:ca:dd:re:ss <h> Use the Airport Wi-Fi Password Map <p> Time limits are n't the only restriction that venues may place on their networks , as some public networks are also secured with a password . Most of the time they 'll be a way to get this password for free , for example by asking a member of staff , or checking signs and posters around the venue , but tracking down a Wi-Fi password is n't always easy . Maybe there 's no staff in the immediate area , or your flight may be boarding soon and you do n't particularly want to go wandering off in search of a Wi-Fi password . Whatever the situation , if you need a password for a public network then there 's numerous websites and apps that are dedicated to helping people share passwords they 've discovered for public networks , so you do n't have to go wandering around the airport looking for this information yourself . <p> The WiFox app is designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas WiFi Map has a huge database of over 100 million public Wi-Fi passwords spanning a wide range of venues , including airports . Download your chosen app to your iPhone or iPad , or even your Android device , and the next time you find yourself needing a password for a public network , simply launch your app and check whether someone has already uploaded this information . <h> Visit places that are likely to have free Wi-Fi <p> If you do find yourself at an airport that does n't have its own public Wi-Fi network , then you may find that the cafes , restaurants , bars and other establishments inside the airport do offer free Wi-Fi . <p> Depending on the venue , you may need to make a purchase in order to use their Wi-Fi network , but if you have a long wait ahead of you then this may feel like a small price to pay for all the entertainment the Internet has to offer ! And , if the establishment in question has placed a time restriction on their Wi-Fi , then you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this article . <p> In the event that you ca n't find a public Wi-Fi network anywhere inside the airport , then as a last resort you may want to check whether there 's any kind of VIP or executive lounge , as these areas typically offer lots of perks , including complimentary Wi-Fi . While a Wi-Fi signal is unlikely to stretch far beyond the confines of a VIP or executive lounge , you may get lucky and find yourself able to get a connection if you 're in the general area . <h> Turn your smartphone into a Wi-Fi hotspot <p> If you ca n't find a Wi-Fi network to connect to , then you may be able to turn your smartphone into its own Wi-Fi network . <p> Many modern smartphones allow you to share your mobile data with different devices , in a process known as tethering . When your smartphone 's tethering feature is enabled , it creates a small , localised wireless Internet connection that you can then connect to using any Wi-Fi enabled device . <p> The drawback is that tethering does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip where you suspect you might struggle to find an open Wi-Fi network , then you should do some research in advance . Firstly , the process of enabling tethering differs between devices so you should head over to your favourite search engine and look for the instructions for your particular device . <p> Secondly , some mobile providers may block tethering or charge considerably higher fees once you 've enabled this feature , so you should always check the fine print of your mobile contract before sharing your mobile data between devices . And just be aware that tethering can burn through your data allowance at an alarming rate , so it 's important to keep track of exactly how much data you 're using , to avoid racking up a huge bill . <h> Consider investing in a MiFi <p> If you regularly struggle to find a decent Wi-Fi connection then you may want to consider purchasing a MiFi , a wireless router that can turn a 3G or 4G mobile phone network into a localised Wi-Fi hotspot . This means that as long as you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create your own Wi-Fi network . <p> If you 're a regular traveller , then MiFi can help keep your roaming charges under control by allowing you to pay a single fixed-roaming fee for your MiFi device , rather than separate fees for all of your Internet-enabled devices . <p> If you do decide to purchase a MiFi , then it 's recommended that you shop around before making your purchase , as you can usually save yourself some money by purchasing the MiFi router first and then purchasing a data-only SIM separately , rather than signing up for an all-in-one bundle from a mobile operator . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

The Mac App Store is going to become a huge part of Lion ( You will even need it to buy Lion ) Apple is really starting to push digital distribution of software on the Mac after the huge success of the App Store for iOS . Its safe to assume retail boxed software will soon disappear from Apple Retail Stores as most developers start to opt to have there software titles included in the Mac App Store . The Mac App Store works just like on iOS offering all the best software titles available for the Mac , Downloading an App from the App Store is coupled with some really cool animations that pull ' the App from the store right into Launchpad. iOS users will find it a home from home , It really will become the only place you buy software from ! <p> All software is kept up-to date with the App @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest versions with ease . <p> Purchases information in Mac App Store <p> Tracking Apps you have purchased has been made easier with an easy to view page accessible directly from the Mac App Store UI unlike in iTunes were you have to log into your account and search through your purchase history receipts .

Your contacts are the focus and a lot of the interface clutter of earlier versions has been completely eradicated . FaceTime calling is now capable from Address Book so if you have a contact with FaceTime just a quick tap on there address and FaceTime will start the call , Apple has also taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your contacts social network profiles into Address Book so now seeing a persons Facebook page and photos or sending someone a tweet on Twitter is as easy as couple of clicks . <p> Quick Event and Reminders <p> iCal has had a major interface lift , At first it is a shock to see a completely different UI in comparison to the rest of Lion but you soon begin to understand that Apple has done it to unify there apps across iOS and Mac OS X it makes using applications on both platforms a very familiar experience no matter what device you are using this is especially going to be the case to new users who have not experience the Mac before but are familiar with the iPad . Day view has seen some improvements now the mini month calendar is always visible and you can scroll through all your events in the future without switching to week or month view . A year view has also been added to , This will come in handy when you are wanting to jump between months quickly . There is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now enter an event using phrases such as Birthday Drinks at 9PM ' and iCal will know what you mean and add Birthday Drinks ' as an event at 9PM , This will save time when you want to quickly add an appointment on the go . A feature also now in Lion that has long been requested in iCal is Reminders ( todo 's ) will soon be able to sync with iOS devices once iOS 5 is released . <h> What 's New in Safari : <h> Downloads List <p> New Download List drop down in Safari <p> Tucked away next to the search box on the toolbar in Safari is the new downloads list button , Now instead of having the Downloads Window ' when you download something in Safari it jumps ' off the page and onto the Downloads button where a tiny progress bar will appear and clicking on it will pop up a drop down list of all previous downloads . This a great little improvement that really gives a clutter free feel to Safari . <h> Reading Lists <p> Reading List draw in Safari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature called Reading List ' this feature allows you to bookmark stories or links that you want store to read later , This feature aims to improve on services like Instapaper by integrating the bookmarking features right into the browser , Reading list will even be making its way to the iPhone and iPad in iOS 5 so you can keep all your bookmarked read laters ' synced across all your devices . <h> Finder Inhancements <p> The Finder in Lion brings some minor but well thought out ' improvements and a much more intuitive UI . <p> New Icon Drag UI <p> The tweaked UI will be the first thing you notice it has been polished and feels a lot nicer to use ( long time Mac users should really appreciate this ) Dragging multiple files has also seen a slight UI improvement , All files being dragged are now grouped together into a collection to make a single icon which is then overlaid with a bold red number indicator displaying how many files you are dragging this just makes for a cleaner and clearer look and view when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All My Files Finder Sidebar Favorite <p> A new favorite has also been added to the sidebar called All My Files ' which is exactly what its name suggests a Finder window containing all your files sorted by file type this makes finding all files of a certain kind on your system really easy . <p> Lion also brings a feature that has been much needed for some time . If you attempt to add a file to a folder with the same name you no longer get told you ca n't now you get presented with the copy window and instead of getting presented with just Stop ' and Replace ' you now have a new option called Keep Both Files ' clicking this option adds the file to the folder and renames it automatically for you so you can keep both files without having to manually change the name of the file . <h> QuickLook <p> QuickLook has been improved in Lion it is now far more reliable and is not just limited to the Finder anymore , You can now QuickLook a file in any app that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link or attachment within any message without having to open it first to see what it is . Another much welcome improvement is that you can now QuickLook a file in a stack this one has been long in the waiting but has made its way into Lion . System wide QuickLook integration is such a logical improvement to this time saving feature . <p> QuickLook dictionary definition in Spotlight <p> Apple have even managed to squeeze it into spotlight type your search , then hover over a result and you will get an on the fly preview bubble ' of its content . <h> System wide interface changes <h> Scrolling <p> Lion introduces iOS style scrolling across the entire system , This makes navigation so much more intuitive , At first you might find it a bit tricky because scrolling is reversed , Content moves in the direction your fingers move but it make so much sense once you get used it and will be second nature if you have an iPad or iPhone . Scrollbars are now only there when you need them they overlay the content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them this make for a much cleaner looking and clutter free interface . <h> Resize <p> This is not the biggest of features but one that has been in the making for years for the Mac its a feature Microsoft Windows has had for years and now its finally on the Mac ! No longer do you have the re-sizer tab in the bottom right hand corner of each window now you can resize a window from any edge just float your mouse over the edge of a window and you will see a double ended arrow just click and drag to resize with ease . <h> Spell Check <p> Since iOS first arrived into the world it had the ability to suggest alternative words when you made a spelling mistake well now that has made its way over to the desktop , Instead of just getting a red line under a word highlighting a mistake Lion will provide an iOS style character picker allowing you to choose an alternative and if you keep typing OS X will try to automatically guess what you mea n't and change the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Full Screen Apps <p> The familiar full screen button is now integrated into nearly every built in Mac OS X application located in each windows title bar on the right hand side , Clicking this button will transform the window into a full screen space ' when you first read this you will be thinking every single full screen window becomes a space ' I felt the same trust me once you use it it makes so much sense coupled with gestures switching between full screen apps is so simple just a quick swipe and your there . <p> Is there anything we have missed that your excited to get you hands on in Lion ?

In these scenarios , you can use the following workaround : <p> Open a Finder ' window . <p> Select Go &gt; Go to Folder ' from the toolbar . <p> Enter the following text /Library/Caches , and then click Go . ' <p> The Caches ' folder should contain a com.apple.desktop.admin file . To make sure you can switch back to this default at any point , make a copy of this file and then store it somewhere safe . <p> Open the com.apple.desktop.admin file in any image-editing program . <p> Open the image you want to use as your login background , in any image-editing program . Copy this image . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your login screen , however note that this image will be displayed on the login screen only . If you lock your Mac rather than logging out completely , then you may still see your original background although this behaviour seems to vary depending on the version of macOS you have installed . <p> If you want to switch back to your original wallpaper at any point , then simply drag the original com.apple.desktop.admin image file back into the /Library/Caches folder , and select Replace ' when prompted . <h> Add text to your login screen <p> To create a message that 'll be displayed on your login screen : <p> Open your Mac 's System preferences ' <p> Click Security &amp; Privacy .

If you opt to remove these items , then the login screen will replace them with two text boxes : one where you can enter your username , and another where you can enter your password . <p> While this customisation may appeal if you 're after a more minimalistic look , removing the usernames also adds an extra layer of security to your Mac , as anyone who 's trying to break into your computer will have to know your username , rather than having this information handed to them on the login screen . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

It exploits Java vulnerabilities in non-updated versions OS X to infect the Mac . Luckily there are very simple ways you can find out firstly if you have it , and then how to protect yourself from it . wpadcamp2 <p> If this appears , - " The domain/default pair of ( **30;751;TOOLONG , DYLDINSERTLIBRARIES ) does not exist " , you do n't  have it . <p> Now , if at any of the above stages something was different , chances are you 're infected .

One is for Snow Leopard and Lion users and the other is for users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Lion/Snow Leopard : <p> It could not be simpler . A Java update has already been released which fixes the problem , which you can either get via Software Update or here ( Snow Leopard ) or here ( Lion ) . If you do that , you will be completely safe to the Flashback malware . <h> For Leopard , Tiger and older systems : <p> This is still dead easy to do . All you need is a specific piece of anti-virus software . The malware is programmed to not install when in detects certain pieces of software , one of them being ClamXAV , a great open source anti-virus which I highly recommend . Its completely free , and you do n't  even have to use it to protect yourself . Just have it installed and even if you unwittingly download the Flashback trojan , it will auto-delete itself after detecting ClamXAV . <p> So that 's it ! If you follow the above steps , you should n't have any problems whatsoever with it , and it really is that easy to deal with . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US , so your chances of actually having it if you live in Europe or elsewhere is fairly film . Still better safe than sorry . <p> Even though this is by no means funny , there is a strong irony attached to this . 274 of the bots responsible for this are running from , wait for it , Cupertino !

Unsurprisingly , Apple has now also released a Mac OS X version that comes preinstalled with Mavericks with pretty much the same functionality , but of course perhaps even more useful on the big screen . <p> The nice thing about OS X Maps is that its used by all the built-in apps such as Calendar , so anywhere you see a map link , it should now launch the Maps app . <p> Maps has a stunning flyover mode with highly detailed 3D renderings <h> Launch Maps <p> To launch Maps , click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ) or just type Maps into Spotlight ( Cmd-Spacebar ) to find it . <p> Click on the new Maps icon in your Dock to launch <p> Its always better to view the app fullscreen , so if its not already maximised , tap Ctrl-Cmd-F to enter fullscreen mode . The view should be immediately familiar you 'll notice a clean interface and the map shown at your current location . <p> Open Maps and you 'll see the default view , centred on where you are <h> Navigation <p> The beauty of Maps on the Mac is that , just like the iOS version , navigation is a doddle if you have a trackpad then it will be very familiar to those used to iOS 2 fingers moves the map around ( or click and hold to drag ) , the pinch gesture can be used to zoom in/out and rotate , and there 's also a double-click option to zoom in on the point where your cursor is . <p> At the lower right , there are also zoom in/out buttons and compass showing your orientation . <p> Use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation <p> And just like iOS Maps , there 's the three de facto viewing modes Standard , Hybrid , and Satellite : <p> Standard mode looks like this : <p> The default view shows flat topography with roads <p> Hybrid mode adds roads and other markings combined with the satellite view : <p> This should already be fairly familiar to anyone ( and that 's just about everyone these days ) who 's ever used a mapping app , but its nice to see it implemented so well and graphically rich ( with intuitive navigation ) on the Mac . <h> 3D Flyover Mode <p> Flyover mode is one of the great new features of Maps . By using the small blue Building icon at the upper left , if you 're close enough to a feature and are viewing in Satellite mode , you 'll see a proper 3D render of the place in question : <p> Maps has a stunning flyover mode with highly detailed 3D renderings <h> Search <p> Finding nearby places and points of interest is a breeze in Maps just place your cursor in the Search field in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you type , any matches ( such as landmarks , addresses and businesses ) are automatically shown .

To view all your current bookmarks , just click on the Bookmark icon to bring up the current list . There 's also a search bar at the top if you have a lot in the list . <p> Selecting any of the bookmarks will take you straight to the relevant location on the map . <p> Select the bookmarks icon to view all your saved places <p> Adding bookmarks in the first place is just as easy : <p> 1 .

When a tab has been left inactive for a while Safari may start reloading each tab as you switch to them . It turns out that this is actually a new feature in Safari 5 ( and Webkit 2 ) called " multi-process windows " which separates the UI processes from web/content processes meaning that in theory a problem with one wont affect the other causing the entire application to quit . However for some reason the recent release of Safari web processes seem to crash quite often , which forces Safari to refresh each tab seemingly randomly . <p> If you finding this a real issue there is a workaround , unfortunately it means sacrificing some of Lions new gestures ( two finger back &amp; forward , pinch to zoom and the two finger tap smart zoom gesture ) and may cause problems with the newer extensions you have installed . <p> The first step is to enable Safaris debug menu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 <p> Relaunch Safari now and you should see the Debug menu appear beside the Help menu .

From now on all windows will have SP as a suffix to the page title , which stands for Single Process . <p> If you do miss using any gestures or extensions all you need to reselect the Use Multi Process Windows option and to remove debug menu from Safari reopen the Terminal and this time enter : <p> defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 
@@22342956 @2342956/ <h> What 's New in iTunes 12 <p> iTunes 12 was released as a beta earlier in the- year for OS X Yosemite , and is now available for new users and also as an update to iTunes 11 . There are n't  a whole host of improvements , but there are some subtle changes- which are definitely welcome over iTunes 11 . <p> The last version of iTunes was completely redesigned and updated at the end of 2012 , bringing with it quite a radical overhaul compared to iTunes 10 . Since then , we 've seen various improvements and updates , but not everything- that it has been criticised for has been fixed in iTunes 12 . <p> This guide briefly- describes the new look and features that- made it into iTunes 12 . <h> What 's new in iTunes 12 <p> The first thing you 'll notice about iTunes 12 is the slightly updated design- there 's a " flatter " look- that fits in more with the iOS 7 and iOS 8 style- ( as well as Yosemite in general ) . <p> For starters , just like every application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and close have all been updated and function exactly as you 'd expect . <p> iTunes 12 also uses transparency to achieve quite a nice effect , just like many of the built-in Yosemite apps . <p> When you open iTunes , you will notice that the main interface has been tweaked- and there 's much more emphasis- on the iTunes store not surprising considering Apple obviously wants to encourage you to buy content . <p> iTunes 12 also includes support for Family Sharing that- feature must be setup- on iOS and links to your nominated iTunes accounts . We will cover Family Sharing in a separate post . <h> Icons and menus <p> In the main menu bar there are- several icons- such as My Music , Playlists , and iTunes Store- which replaces the old Songs , Albums , Artists , Genres , Videos , Playlists and Radio links . It looks much cleaner , and also allows you to edit which icons you want to display ( click the Edit button on the dropdown , tick the items you want to use , then clock Done as indicated below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main menu bar . <h> Recently Added items <p> Any content that you 've added to iTunes recently now appears at the top of the main window- as shown in the screenshot below . This does make it a little quicker to access items that youve recently purchased ( they are also still available in the Playlists section however ) . <p> A row of icons and a central menu bar makes it easier to navigate your content and the iTunes store <h> Playlist view <p> Another welcome change is- that Playlists- can now be viewed in the sidebar on the left , while simultaneously viewing music in the main window . This makes it easy to drag and drop songs into your- playlists . The Playlists themselves function exactly as before . You can read our previous- tips on creating custom- playlists here . <p> Playlists can now be viewed alongside your music library , making it easier to organise . <h> Account information <p> iTunes 12 has a tweaked dropdown menu that shows links to your iTunes account . From here , you can also go to- your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift code or go to your main account information page ( or sign out completely ) . <p> Account information is now quicker to access in iTunes 12 . <h> New- item view and icons <p> Another small change- is that the album view ( or any item for that matter , such as movies ) now has slightly different action- icons- that appear when you hover over an item , and expands to reveal appropriate actions ( such as- Play Next , Start Genius , or go to the iTunes Store ) . <p> Lots of small graphical improvements bring the iTunes 12 user interface up to date . <h> New devices view <p> In iTunes 12 , each- iOS devices you own- now shows up in the main toolbar as an icon , which makes it- fairly quick to see- if your iPhone or iPad is connected . They must be on the same WiFi network and logged into iCloud/iTunes before they appear in the menu . Click any devices icon- to open the device manager view , which let 's you synchronise and manage- its content- pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your iOS devices appear as an icon in the main menu bar . <h> What 's still missing in iTunes 12 ? <p> Unfortunately for- those of us using the UK iTunes store , iTunes Radio is still not- available . Let 's hope this service is rolled out soon ( as its been available in the US for some time ) . - Since the Apple acquisition of Beats Audio earlier this year , the rumours are that Apple has something more radical planned for radio and streaming music , so we might see some major changes in iTunes 13 next year . <p> There are still plenty of other items on our wish list that did n't  make it into iTunes 12 . <p> Some of these include : <p> iTunes DJ . This feature is still missing in iTunes 12 , and is one that many people have complained about . We 'd definitely like to see this return in a future version . <p> Cover flow. - The ability to view your media library in- as a cover flow was n't necessarily that useful , but again would be welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iTunes has so many different sections and does so many things , that in future it might make more sense to split out some of the functionality into distinct applications , just- like iBooks has its own app . <p> Common folders. - With multiple user accounts , your iTunes content is duplicated across folders for each user , which obviously wastes previous hard disk space . It would be great if you could share the same content across multiple users . <h> Summary <p> iTunes 12 is a definite improvement over iTunes 11 in terms of the user interface . However , there are n't  really that many new features besides minor user interface tweaks and a fresh look . <p> iTunes 13 will no doubt be a more dramatic overhaul , - and is expected to introduce features such as a subscription-based music streaming service thanks to- the Beats Music deal . <p> On the whole iTunes 12 is a solid release- and is definitely worth upgrading to .

@@22342960 @2342960/ <h> What 's new in Safari for OS X Mavericks <p> With every new release of OS X comes a new and improved version of Safari . Its already one of the best and fastest browsers available today , and Safari 7 brings a host of new features such as plug-in management , a new Top Sites , and some under-the-hood performance improvements that make your browsing experience that much smoother and more seamless . For example , every tab now runs in its own system process , which means that any website that might cause Safari to crash will be self-contained and wont affect the application as a whole . Its also snappier and seems much quicker likely due to Javascript performance improvements in the new version of WebKit the underlying engine used by Safari . here 's a brief rundown of the new features and improvements you can expect to see in the latest version : <h> 1 . New Sidebar <p> There 's a new look sidebar in Safari , which is much more convenient and easy to use than previous versions . Clicking on the Sidebar button ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in from the left . There are now 3 sections , which can be selected by the relevant icon at the top of the sidebar : <p> Bookmarks <p> Reading List <p> Shared Links <p> The Bookmarks section lists any bookmarks that you 've added ( via Cmd-D or from the Bookmarks menu ) in a hierarchical folder structure . You can also move and re-organise them any way you want simply by dragging and moving into the correct place . The old bookmarks view is still accessible however ( choose Edit Bookmarks from the Bookmark menu or just use Alt-Cmd-B ) . <p> With everything accessible all in one place , the new Sidebar is slicker and easier to use , but the bookmarks themselves act just like you 'd expect . <p> Bookmarks can be accessed from the new Sidebar <h> 2 . Reading List <p> Reading list itself is not a new feature , but it now benefits from being more accessible under the Sidebar menu next to bookmarks . When adding a bookmark , they automatically get added to your reading list in chronological order . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to filter by All or Unread , as well as a search box to filter them even further . <p> Reading List now appears in the Sidebar <p> Perhaps the nicest feature about the new Reading List however , is the continuous scroll feature . Simply choose any item in the list ( which then appears in the main page ) , then scroll to the bottom of the website . Keep scrolling and you 'll notice that the next article in your reading list automatically comes into view . This really makes using it that much easier , saving the need to keep going back to the list all the time . <p> Scroll seamlessly between items in your Reading List <h> 3 . New Top Sites <p> There is a new Top Sites page ( accessible via the grid icon on the Favourites Bar ) with a slightly tweaked look . Gone is the old curved style and in comes a rigid grid that looks a whole lot smarter . You can drag the items around , pin them or delete them as top sites forever . <p> Top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item takes you right to the page , but you can also control how many items are displayed in the grid from Safaris Preferences under the General tab as shown below . <p> Choose how many sites are shown in Top Sites <h> 4 . Plug-in Management <p> Safari 7 also gives you a bit more control over plug-ins , such as the ability to decide which websites can use them . This is particularly handy for Flash whereas previously many Safari users installed plug-ins to block Flash , in the new version that functionality is built in automatically . <p> To manage Safaris plug-ins : <p> Open Preferences from the Safari menu ( or use Cmd-comma ) <p> Click on the Security tab and then hit the Manage Website Settings button <p> Manage all your plug-ins from Preferences <p> You can select any plug-in from the list in the left hand pane . On the right , for each website listed are several options Ask , Block , Allow , and Allow Always , as well as an " unsafe mode " which gives open access ( not recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed with the same choices . In the case of Flash , its a particularly handy feature to block on most sites , except perhaps those like YouTube where Flash is an integral part of the experience . <p> Control plug-in settings on a site-by-site basis <h> 5 . Integration with iCloud Keychain <p> Besides web form and password autofill , Safari is now more integrated with iCloud keychain ( a new Mavericks feature which will be covered in a separate article ) . One benefit of this is that passwords and credit card information can be synced across all your devices , and automatically filled in when visiting websites . Its a small but very handy feature , saving you time instead of fumbling around for the relevant details . <p> Automatically fill in information such as credit card details <h> 6 . Shared Links <p> Shared Links is a brand new feature in Safari 7 . If you have signed into a Twitter or LinkedIn account ( in the Internet Accounts setting in System Preferences ) you 'll see the Shared Links button appear in the Sidebar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you quickly see all your LinkedIn and Twitter notifications and feeds in a single place , directly in Safari . <p> View your Twitter and LinkedIn feeds in Safari <h> 7 . Website Alerts &amp; Notifications <p> Safari also allows you to receive notifications from websites for example suppose you wanted to follow a particular site , you can opt in to receive notifications in the same way you would receive them from other apps such as Mail , Calendar and so on . There is a new Notifications- tab in Safaris preferences that let you manage which sites you want to receive notifications from .

The best photo apps usually give sufficient manual control over all the tools , but should come with an automatic mode as well for near-instant results <p> Importing- it should of course be possible to open images on your Macs hard disk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your digital camera or a scanner ? The list of image formats supported is usually more greater with the better apps , which will allow you to manipulate some of the more obscure image formats <p> Exporting- every photo app should be able to export to common formats such as GIF , JPG and PNG , but additional format support can be a benefit as you wont need to rely on additional converters . The majority of image editing apps support an extensive array of formats , but can be handy if they allow a more control over the export options such as being able to set the amount of compression ( which affects the picture quality ) on JPG files <p> Sharing- built-in photo sharing options can save you the hassle of exporting photos and attaching them to emails when you want to share your best snaps with friends .

Many people prefer to use iPhoto however ( and even its simple editing tools ) , but its certainly an added bonus if there are some kind of cataloguing , tagging and organisational tools in the app <p> Help and tutorials every decent photo app should provide built-in ( or online ) help files and tutorials , and its an added bonus if there 's a help section or forum on their website , and email details so they can be contacted for any support queries <h> 1 . Pixelmator <p> Pixelmator has proven to be one of the very best and most popular image editing apps on the Mac since the App Store was launched . The price is quite irresistible considering what you get in the package . There are all the usual tools such as cropping , paintbrushes , text , shapes and so on , plus the ability to create multiple layers and work on them individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as various blurring and sharpening tools to stylisations and tile functions . The user interface is fairly intuitive the tools are all floating menus which can be moved around or hidden , and its fully compatible with Lions fullscreen mode so you can work on a photo without other distractions . I personally use Pixelmator for the majority of my image manipulation and have found that its a very capable software package indeed . <p> Pixelmator has a superb selection of built-in photo manipulation tools <h> 2 . Acorn <p> Acorn emphasises simplicity , because as the developers quite rightly point out , not everyone has the time to learn to use some of the more complicated image editing programs . Acorn keeps it simple with just one palette visible that keeps things uncluttered and easy to navigate . They have n't skimped on features though because you can create multiple layers each with its own objects and images . Layers are definitely one of the most useful features in any photo editing app . <p> There are also a good selection of text and drawing tools , and lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also use vector shapes ( e.g. squares , circles and lines ) and your final masterpiece can be exported into multiple formats . The export to web option is a rather convenient way to save pictures at the best size and format to view on the Internet . <p> Acorn includes lots of of tutorials and online documentation ( as well as a forum ) you probably wont need to use them but its an invaluable resource if you need help . <p> Acorn 's strength is its simplicity and ease of use <h> 3 . Aperture 3 <p> Aperture is unashamedly aimed mainly at professionals and keen amateurs who want to import and organise photos , as well as touch-ups and editing . The latest release has much more powerful photo editing and organising tools , and runs fully in 64-bit mode for optimum performance . Previous versions of Aperture were considered to be quite challenging to learn especially for novices , but this version is thankfully considerably easier to use . <p> Just like iPhoto , Aperture can recognise faces , places ( if you took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pics to websites like Facebook and Flickr ( almost de riguer functionality these days ! ) . The toolset is quite extensive , but Aperture can also organise and manage very large numbers of pictures and store them in specific albums the photo management side of things is definitely one of Apertures key strengths compared to most photo apps . Apple has n't  forgotten about filters and effects either there are lots of preset image effects included as standard. - Aperture can import , organise and playback video too , either video camera footage or video from regular still cameras recorded in HD . Unsurprisingly , there are masses of videos , tutorials and online help in case you get stuck . <p> In summary , Aperture is one of the very best photo and image editing apps on the Mac , and if the price and relative complexity does n't  put you off its worth spending the time and effort to learn how to use it properly . <p> Aperture has extensive management and editing capabilities <h> 4 . FX Photo Studio Pro <p> FX Photo Studio Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of editing tools that you can use to manipulate your photos in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways . As the name suggests , its aim is to let you apply all sorts of interesting effects to your shots , but there are also sufficient image editing tools and advanced colour controls to make this app stand out from the crowd . <p> However , the effects are where FX Photo Studio Pro really excels try out Grunge , Hollywood FX and Lo-Fi for a start . The editing tools themselves are as expected ; the usual controls are available such as those to adjust exposure , brightness , contrast , shadows , highlights and colour levels. - In terms of import and export capabilities , you can import directly from Aperture or your existing iPhoto library , and your Macs hard disk or digital camera . Export formats supported include iPhoto , Lightroom , Aperture and Photoshop , plus all the usual web ones . And just like the other apps mentioned , the ability to share and upload photos to Facebook , Tumblr , Flickr and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FX Photo Studio Pro has a dazzling array of filters to play with <h> 5. iMage Tools <p> iMage Tools is intended for less experienced users who do n't  have sufficient time to grapple with complicated menus and confusing terminology , and best of all its completely free ! Currently one of the most popular photo editing apps in the App Store , iMage Tools can in fact do what most of the paid-for apps charge for . <p> You can work with most common image types ( such as JPG , PNG , TIFF , BMP and PSD ) , resize them , rotate and flip , insert watermarks , and add text to name just a few of its features . Some considerable thought has gone into the attractive interface , which should appeal to anyone that wants to get the job done without wading through masses of user manuals . Despite being free , some of the features can only be unlocked by in-app purchases for example watermarks , strokes and shadows are all priced at a reasonable 69 pence . <p> If you 're relatively new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could do a lot worse than download this very capable free app . <p> iMage Tools is one of the most popular free photo editing apps wpadcamp4 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625 
@@22342963 @2342963/ <h> Turn your Old Mac or MacBook into a File Server <p> If you 've been a Mac fan for a while , then you may have an old Mac lying around somewhere , gathering dust . Maybe you 've told yourself that you 're going to get around to selling or donating it one day ( perhaps as soon as you 've found the time to wipe all your personal data from it ) but these are n't the only options available to you . <p> Why not give your old Mac a new lease of life , by repurposing it as a file server ? <p> With just a bit of setup , you 'll be able to access your Mac 's contents and storage wirelessly from any other computer on the same network , in exactly the same way you 'd access a regular folder or hard drive . <p> This can give you access to lots of additional storage , as well as a place to backup your Mac 's most important content . Plus , if your streaming experiences are n't as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing large media files , such as HD movies , videos and music with other Macs on your network . Streaming large media files that are stored locally tends to be much faster than trying to stream the same content directly from the Internet so you can finally enjoy your favourite HD movies without them constantly stopping to buffer ! <p> In this article I 'm going to show you how to transform your old Mac into a file server that you can connect to from any other device on your local network . <h> Why should I use my Mac as a file server ? <p> Macs are far from the only devices you can use as a server . Most modern operating systems can function as file servers , and you can also purchase a device that 's designed to act as a file server , such as a NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) hard drive based system . <p> However , there are a number of benefits to using your old Mac as a file server . The most obvious benefit is cost why bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have an old Mac that can fulfil the same purpose ? Your MacBook may not necessarily boast the same amount of storage as a device that was designed to function as a file server , but if you start struggling for space then you can always increase your Mac 's storage by connecting an external hard drive . <p> Another major benefit to using an old Mac , is that you 'll already be familiar with its hardware and software . This familiarity can make the process of configuring and using your file server much more straightforward , and if you do encounter issues with your server then you 'll be able to use your existing Mac knowledge to help you diagnose and fix the problem . <p> Finally , Apple products are designed to play nicely with one another , so you 'll be able to connect your Mac , MacBook , Apple TV , iOS device , and other Apple products to your server , with very little configuration . In fact , most of the time your Apple devices should be able to detect your Mac-server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to it with a single mouse click . <p> The major downside to using a Mac as a file server , is that there 's really no such thing as a cheap Mac , so if you do n't have an old Mac lying around then it usually wo n't make financial sense to purchase a Mac simply to use as a file server . Chances are that even an old , second-hand Mac purchased at a reasonable price is going to be more expensive than a NAS with similar specifications . <h> What you 'll need <p> In order to complete this tutorial you 'll need a Mac or MacBook running macOS 10.5 or higher , as Leopard saw the introduction of some important file sharing features . <p> If you 're using a MacBook as your server , then for the best possible results it should be capable of supporting external hard drives , as once you start using a MacBook as a file server you 'll find that you burn through its internal memory much faster than you anticipated . <p> You should also be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file server , desktops do tend to have larger hard drives and more USB ports that you can attach external storage devices to , which tend to make them more effective as file servers . Desktop computers are also less susceptible to overheating , which may become an issue if you 're running your server 24/7 . <h> Setup your Mac for remote access <p> To setup your Mac as a file server : <p> Select the Apple ' logo from the toolbar , followed by System preferences ' <p> Select Sharing .

Most of this information is beneficial , helping your web browser provide a better user experience , for example by making it easier to access your favourite websites or allowing Safari to auto-complete forms for you . However , Safari and Apple may not be the only ones who have access to this information . <p> Whether it 's advertisers placing cookies on your computer , third parties tracking your online movements , or even your friends and family- snooping through your web history , your typical web browser has the potential to provide a lot of people with a lot of information about you . <p> If you do n't like the idea of other scrutinising- your online movements , then the good news is that Safari has lots of built-in security features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have access to , including third-parties who may be recording your browsing sessions without your consent . <p> In this article , we 're going to be looking- at a number of Safari features that can help you ensure that your browsing sessions remain private , including a feature that sends a Do Not Track request to every single website you visit . <h> Do Not Track <p> Out of everyone who may be trying to access your browsing history and data , the one that tends to worry people the most , is third-parties . Third-party tracking allows organisations to record your online movements and compile information about you , even if you 've never even visited that organisation 's website before . Third-parties typically gather this information via adverts that are hosted on the websites you do visit , and then use this data to display adverts that are specifically targeted at you . If you 've ever searched for a product online , only to find adverts for that product suddenly popping up on completely unrelated websites , then you 've seen third-party tracking in action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern web browsers include a Do Not Track feature and Safari is no exception .

This can be a problem if you share your Mac with other people , as even if you trust them not to go poking around in your web history , they may still stumble across some trace of your previous browsing sessions by accident . For example , when they 're typing into the address bar , Safari may display some suggested search terms based on your previous browsing history . <p> Even if you 're the only person who uses your Mac , you may still want to employ some of the following techniques , as the less information stored in your web browser , the less data organisations and third parties could potentially gain access to . <p> In this section , I 'm going to share a few ways that you can reduce the personal data and Internet history stored in your browser , including how to ensure this information is never even recorded in the first place . <h> 1 . Get into the habit of cleaning your history and cache <p> Clearing your cache and deleting your web history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping your browsing sessions private , and is particularly important if you share your Mac with other people . Just be aware that clearing this data will log you out of any websites you 're currently logged into . <p> To clear Safari 's cache : <p> Open Safari 's Preferences . ' <p> Select the Privacy ' tab . <p> Click the Manage Website Data ' button . <p> In the subsequent window , click Remove all . ' <p> To clear you browser history , select History &gt; Clear History ' from the Safari toolbar . You can then decide whether you want to delete your entire history , or just the websites you 've looked at within a particular timeframe , such as within the last day or hour . <h> 2 . Consider disabling Autofill <p> Safari 's Autofill feature remembers the text you enter into online forms , so Safari can complete these fields for you automatically the next time you visit this website . This can be a time-saver when it comes to logging into your favourite websites or making online purchases , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be thrilled about your credit card details popping up every time- they try to make a purchase on your Mac ! <p> To change the information that Autofill records , or even disable Autofill completely , open Safari 's Preferences ' menu and then select the Autofill ' tab <p> At this point , you 'll see the different categories of Autofill information : <p> Using info from my contacts . <p> User names and passwords . <p> Credit cards . <p> Other forms . <p> To stop Autofill from recording and using information that falls into a certain category , simply deselect that categorys accompanying checkbox . For example , if you do n't want Autofill to enter your payment details whenever someone tries to make a purchase on your Mac , then deselect the Credit cards ' checkbox. <h> 3 . Exclude browsing history from Spotlight Searches <p> You may have noticed that web pages you 've previously visited are sometimes included in your Spotlight Search results . <p> If you 'd prefer your browser history to not pop up in your Spotlight Searches , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo in the menu bar , followed by System Preferences ' <p> Select Spotlight ' and make sure the Search results ' tab is selected . <p> De-select Books &amp; History .

To remove this information , select Bookmarks ' from the Safari toolbar , and then deselect Show Frequently Visited in Favorites. ' <h> 5 . Use Private Browsing <p> If you really want to make sure that your browsing history remains private , then you should use Safari 's Private Browsing mode . When you open a window or tab in Private Browsing mode , Safari will automatically discard all the data associated with that session ( including cookies , history , cache , Autofill information , and website data ) as soon as you close that tab or window .

Consider using a browser extension <p> Although Safari has a number of built-in settings that can make it more difficult for other people and organisations to access your browsing history and personal information , you may want to add another layer of security by installing a browser extension . <p> Disconnect is a privacy-minded Safari extension that displays the total number of tracking requests Safari receives every time you visit a website . You can then use Disconnect to see exactly where these requests are originating from , and can even block them , if desired . <p> You can download the Basic version of the Disconnect Private Browsing extension for free . Once the extension is installed , you 'll notice a new button has been added to your Safari toolbar . Try visiting a few different websites , and this button will update to display the total number of requests it 's receiving . To find out more about these requests , click the button to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analytics , Social and Content . Click any of these categories , to see the individual tracking requests and where they originate from . <p> To deny a tracking request , simply deselect its accompanying checkbox. <h> 7 . Consider switching search engines <p> If you 've ever started typing into your favourite search engine only for it to display a dropdown of suggestions based on your previous searches , then you 'll already be aware that the majority of search engines record all of your search queries . <p> Although clearing your cache and your web history will remove all this information , you can prevent this data from being recorded in the first place , by switching to a non-tracking search engine such as DuckDuckGo . <p> If you 're in the habit of entering your search queries into Safari 's address bar , rather than visiting the search engine itself , then you 'll need to tell Safari to use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine : <p> Open Safari 's Preferences ' window . <p> Select the Search ' tab . <p> Open the Search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this point onwards , any search queries you type into the Safari address bar will be completed via DuckDuckGo , and therefore wo n't be recorded . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

The fact that the Bretford wall mount does n't look like much is more of a positive here than a negative : the iMac 's fixtures can disappear from your field of vision , leaving only the screen in optimum position for your viewing pleasure . <h> 6 . Ergotron MX- ( $149.95 ) <p> Not only does this device have an awesome-sounding name ( reminiscent of a certain eighties cult movie ) , but it 's a huge step forward in ergonomics . For those who complain that Apple 's default stand does n't make for enough screen adjustment , this is the mount for you . Adjustable in just about every direction several times the Ergotron also brings the screen a lot closer to you . Your 21.5 incher will feel almost like a 27 ! <h> 5 . Sanus Swivel column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix is what makes this mount interesting . It 's now easy to change the height of your monitor by sliding the arm up or down the steel column but once you 've chosen the right height for you , better hope those clasps hold ! <h> 4 . KONTOUR dynamic column ( -249.95 ) <p> This desk mount wants to stand out from the competition that much is obvious just from looking at the excitedly capitalised title . The stand itself , coiled like a crouching leopard ( clever Mac reference , designers ) , goes for the aesthetic aluminium look which has won Apple so many converts . The stand will blend right in with your machine , making itself noticed only when you need it to pull the screen closer or tilt it dramatically . <h> 3 . KONTOUR dual monitor ( -399.95 ) <p> This stand is identical in design to its brother , with the addition of an extra arm . Suddenly looking a lot more humanoid and a lot more exciting the desk mount is able to carry two monitors , in portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up another screen to their all-in-ones , this stand , keeping the same industrial look as before , is an option not to be passed by . <h> 2 . Bretford MobilePro ( $169.95 ) <p> While another model in this line featured earlier on in our line-up , this MobilePro desk mount has made it to this late stage due to improved looks and aesthetic appeal . Once more touting the brushed-aluminium look , this column makes no attempt to hide away , confident in the unspoken claim that it will add to the coolness of your iMac setup . Looks have n't impeded functionality , either : the monitor can be tilted effortlessly between landscape and portrait formats , and height is just as easy to adjust . <h> 1 . Bretford MobilePro combo ( $229.95 ) <p> While perhaps better suited to those wanting a second display for their MacBook Pro , it is certainly possible to use this stand to hold both your desktop and notebook . If you 're in that privileged position , consider the MobilePro dual mount . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

However , which model is more conformed to your style ? There are many types of users out there all with different needs when it comes to a Mac so which Air is the one for you ? Let 's take a closer look and find out . <h> MacBook Air Overall <p> Let 's begin with the overall selling points of a MacBook Air . I have already mentioned above some of the key elements but let 's review them in detail . <p> Flash Storage " The new standard in the MacBook is a lighter and thinner design , but what is Flash Storage ? Flash chips are more compact ways to store data allowing for more mobility and less bulk . Flash is also a solid state ; this means there are no moving parts this allows more room for a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option . In addition to making the MacBook Air lighter , Flash also runs more quietly , and let 's not forget about the speed . Flash ups the anty in accessing data so you can perform tasks at a much faster pace . <p> Battery Life " Thanks to the Flash Storage there is now more room for a more durable long lasting battery . You can milk about 5-7 hours out of a MacBook Air browsing the web and up to a full month when in standby mode . Battery life is the most important aspect of any mobile user and with MacBook Air you get the best . <p> Light-Weight " This is what makes the MacBook Air so desirable . No one wants to lug around a heavy bulky laptop through the airport or for hours through meeting after meeting . At around 2-3 pounds the MacBook Air is one of the lightest laptops on the market and even keyed the name " Ultrabooks " . <h> 11-inch MacBook Air vs. 13-inch MacBook Air <p> The first thing we are going to look at is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.6 diagonally with a resolution of 1366 by 768 . The 13-inch MacBook Air is at 13.3 diagonally with a native resolution of 1440 by 900 . As you can see the resolution does n't differ by too much . <p> MacBook Air 11-inch <p> MacBook Air 13-inch <h> Flash Storage <p> Second we look at the Flash Storage , which is very important to moviemakers , music producers and gamers . Both models offer two different sets of memory size with a price increase in-between . The 11-inch model offers 64GB at $900.00 or 128GB at $1,099.00. - Alternatively you can upgrade the 11-inch 128GB to either 256GB or a whopping 512GB . <p> The 13-inch MacBook Air provides 128GB for $1,199.00 or 256GB at $1,499.00 . The 13-inch MacBook Air 256GB can be upgraded to 512GB . <h> Speed <p> Next is speed and when we talk about speed we are talking about GHz . The 11-inch has 1.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 while the 13-inch has a 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 . <p> Now the difference between the " native " GHz is not that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two when performing mediocre tasks . With the Turbo Boost however you 're going to get a lot more bang for your buck in both models , for the 11-inch the Turbo Boost will bump the 1.7GHz up to 2.6GHz . The 13-inch will be boosted to a nice 2.8 GHz . <h> Battery <p> Battery life is important to any user from the most basic to the hardcore , we want to be untethered as long as possible . You will be able to stay mobile for up to 5 hours on the 11-inch and 30 days whilst in standby mode . The 13-inch only offers a few more hours with up to 7 hours wireless web and 30 days standby . Remember the more powerful the program you 're running the faster your battery will drain . <p> MacBook Air 11-inch ( 5 Hours ) <p> MacBook Air 13-inch ( 7 hours ) <h> Bottom line <p> The MacBook Air 11-inch is ideal for your common tasks like web surfing , word processors and flash games , if you do opt for the 13-inch only to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations from the 11-inch . Now let 's say you 're wanting to multitask , make movies , edit music or play more games then the 13-inch 256GB MacBook Air will be more fitting . <p> I am a gamer myself and the 13-inch runs relatively smooth playing games such as World of Warcraft but you 're going to find yourself sacrificing graphic detail to get your FPS to a more playable level . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624

@@22342984 @2342984/ <h> Best Mac VPNs Compared and Reviewed <p> For anyone concerned about security on the Internet , a VPN can ensure your browsing , emails , web banking and app usage stays private . Simply put , a VPN- acts like a secure private network that encrypts your Internet traffic and makes it extremely hard for anyone ( even your Internet Service Provider ) to snoop on your online habits . And most- VPNs allow you to choose your virtual nationality with just a few clicks . <p> But what 's the difference between a VPN and a proxy ? A- VPN encrypts all of your traffic and routes it via- the VPN server , whereas a proxy acts more like a web filter and only works with applications ( such as your browser ) that use your proxy . This means that- a VPN is inherently more powerful and secure . <h> Why use VPN Software ? <p> Besides enhanced security , when travelling- to other countries you might find that particular websites ( such as those that provide streamed or downloadable movies ) are blocked due to restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome these restrictions , and surf the Internet more or less unrestricted in a more secure manner . <p> A- VPN helps you limit- exposing- your digital footprint to the outside world , but also fancy- accessing- UK-only video like the BBC iPlayer ? Then a VPN will allow you to do just that , and because they can be connected and disconnected at the touch of a button , there 's no real reason- not to use one . <h> How to Choose a VPN <p> There are countless- companies that provide VPN services . But before you select- one , you might want to consider- some of the factors below . As long as you do a little research beforehand , you 'll be able to choose a VPN provider that offers everything you need . Its also worth checking how long each company has been around- after all , - a startup that 's just been in operation a few months might not be as good a choice as one that 's been around for the past 10 years ! <p> Bear these factors in mind before you sign up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is the VPN company a well known and established company ? Are there any- negative reviews online ? You 're trusting them with your Internet security , so it pays to be diligent . <h> Price <p> Besides the- subscription costs , do they provide convenient- payment options- such as monthly instalments , and how flexible is the- cancellation policy ? While it can be- tempting to go for the cheapest provider , remember that- the cheapest is n't always the best ! <h> Security Protocols and Device <p> What levels of security do they provide and specifically which protocols do they offer ( some are more secure than others ) . Also , - it may depend on whether you want to use a VPN with your Mac and also on iOS devices or media boxes and games consoles . <h> Speed / Bandwidth <p> Because your Internet traffic will be routed via- the VPN providers servers , its a good idea to check- that they do n't  suffer from poor network performance or congestion .

If the VPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to sign up first and try it for a few days . <h> Number of Servers- / Location <p> How many countries do they have servers in ? This is important because you need to choose a server based on where you want to appear to the outside world , and also hopefully one that is n't too far away from your physical location . The VPN companies listed below let you flexibly choose your location and also check their speed . <h> Ease of Use / Configuration <p> Many VPN companies provide an app that you can install on one or more devices , making installation and configuration much simpler ( rather than having to manually configure your computer ) . <h> Support /- Customer Service <p> It goes without saying , but- if you get stuck you 'll need a company that has 24 hour support and perhaps even online forums where you can check the solutions to common problems . <h> 5 Best Mac VPNs <p> Weve rounded up some of the best VPNs for the Mac below . In no particular order , here 's the lowdown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extremely easy to use system that can be installed as an application ( for Mac , PC , iOS and even Android ) or configured manually . Once you 've signed up you 'll receive the relevant details such as a user name and password , which can be entered into the app or just setup manually ( which is a very easy process on the Mac ) . They also have a dedicated support page ( where you can raise a help desk ticket if you get stuck , and a very comprehensive setup guide to get you online securely in minutes ) . <p> Furthermore , they definitely have one of the better websites with- a great customer support section . <p> We manually setup Express VPN in minutes to prove just how easy it is <h> Price <p> ExpressVPN currently provides- several payment options , as shown below . And the- longer you sign up for , the cheaper it becomes : <p> $12.95 per month for 1 month only <p> $9.99 per month for 6 months ( billed every 6 months ) <p> $8.32 per month for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support all major credit cards , plus PayPal and even Bitcoin , and there 's also a 30-day money back guarantee should you need it . <h> Security &amp; Protocols <p> Express VPN supports 3 main security protocols : - OpenVPN , L2TP-IPsec , SSTP , and PPTP protocols . There is some flexibility in which ones you can choose , for example if your ISP blocks them . <h> Speed <p> The website states that the bandwidth and speed is unlimited . In practice , this is also affected by where you are in the world , but its good to know that there are no restrictions artificially imposed . <h> Servers / Locations <p> Express VPN has more than 72 locations in 46 countries more than enough to provide quite a lot of flexibility . You can view their full country list here . <h> Ease of Use / Installation <p> Applications are available for the most common platforms , which means that you wont have any trouble setting everything up . We reviewed ExpressVPN recently and also tested the manual configuration which on the Mac takes a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can definitely recommend ExpressVPN as being- easy to setup- and use . <h> Hide My Ass <p> Despite the unusual name , Hide My Ass ( sometimes known simply as HMA ) is a very capable VPN solution . Like the others mentioned here , - the simplest approach- is to download and install their " HMA ! Pro VPN " app but bear in mind that the Mac version is a- beta version ( i.e. there may be the occasional glitch ) and requires that you join their community on Google+ to get started . However , the app itself has a wealth of configuration options and even displays your billing and account information , as well as allowing you to select the country where you want to appear , - plus other useful features such as- the speed achievable available at each- location . <p> HMA has also been recommended- by an impressive- list of companies such as- Forbes , Guardian , Yahoo ! , Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal , which might give you extra peace of mind about using it . <p> The Hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price <p> Just like the other VPNs mentioned , one subscription covers all devices and allows you to use it on several simultaneously . <p> They also provide a 30 day money-back guarantee , and the prices are currently a tiny bit cheaper than ExpressVPN : <p> $11.52 per month for 1 month only <p> $8.33 per month for 6 months ( billed every 6 months ) <p> $6.55 per month for 12 months ( billed every 12 months ) <h> Security &amp; Protocols <p> In terms of protocols , Hide My Ass supports- OpenVPN and- PPTP protocols they recommend OpenVPN . However , there is no mention of other protocols such as SSTP. - Therefore , its wise to check if your ISP blocks any of them though if it does n't  work you could always- request a refund ! <h> Speed <p> In the- Speed Guide section of the VPN application , there 's a list of servers along with the distance away ( usually the further away the more of an issue speed may be ) . However , there 's also a very useful speed test capability via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full Test ( which gives you the most accurate measurements ) . <p> The speed guide is a very useful part of the Hide My Ass application <h> Servers / Locations <p> Hide My Ass- has an impressive 189- server locations in 91 countries , one of the best among the VPNs we reviewed . Their complete server list can be found- here . Even though more servers- is generally a good thing , make sure they have one in the country that you want to use ! <h> Ease of Use / Installation <p> Because Hide My Ass recommends an application for installation , like the others its very easy to setup it- keeps an icon in your menu bar that you can use to launch the app . There has been a lot of thought and effort gone into the application which is packed with features , giving plenty of opportunity to check each server location , bandwidth , as well as your account information . <h> StrongVPN <p> StrongVPN is a US company ( based in San Francisco ) that 's been going since 1994 they make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see why trusting a VPN provider is extremely important . Their- website is a little more fussy than for example Hide My Ass and ExpressVPN , but there 's also lots more information on there to digest , as well as some excellent forums and blogs . In terms of support , they also provide round-the-clock service , and the support pages are extremely detailed with tonnes of useful information ( though hopefully you wont need to use it ) . We found that StrongVPN was the best in terms of explaining the difference between all the different protocols and technologies , and advising which solution you need ( e.g. if you want it for mobile devices or computers , and other information such as all about their security protocols and encryption ) . <h> Price <p> StrongVPN has what might initially look like a- confusing pricing structure ( compared to the others ) , - and unfortunately there 's no month-by-month option ( minimum sign-up is 3 months ) . However , - their website automatically identifies your current geographical location- and presents a simple list of price and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available in the- country you 're in ( as well as user feedback- from customers in that- area ) . 3 month packages cost- around $21 ( equivalent to $7 a month ) or $55 for one year which is excellent value indeed . Note that there is currently no free trial period on offer . <p> Choosing your package based on location is simple with StrongVPN <h> Security &amp; Protocols <p> As shown below , StrongVPN offers packages- based on security with both- PPTP or OpenVPN- available . OpenVPN packages provide the best security and are likewise more expensive . But in terms of configurability , if you want the maximum flexibility and security you 're best off going with the OpenVPN packages . <p> StrongVPN has quite an array of different packages <h> Speed <p> StrongVPN advertises the fact that network speeds are unrestricted ( like the others on here ) and not throttled , but there are n't  any tools in the Mac application to check the actual speed available or do speed tests you can check speeds via an interactive map on the- website however here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , you 'll have to take their word for it- until youve- had a chance to install the software and check real-world performance . <h> Servers / Locations <p> Just like the other VPN companies , StrongVPN has a broad presence with server locations dotted around the world claiming hundreds of servers in up to 20 countries ( though this depends on the package ) , so while- it- doesnt- the most we 've seen , it should certainly be enough choice for the majority of uses . <h> Ease of Use / Installation <p> StrongVPN provides a bespoke Mac client application ( the basic UI is- shown below ) , which let 's you quickly switch between servers and locations , as well as choose the security protocol ( PPTP or OpenVPN if you have the right package ) .

PureVPN- provides its Mac services via a desktop- application ( or an iOS app ) , in addition to various business-oriented plans and even corporate branded apps . There are also lots of add-ons available such as firewalls , a stealth browser , dedicated IP address and speed boosts up to 20 Mbps for streaming. - And in terms of customer support- and global footprint , they certainly appear to have good credentials as far as being- responsive and providing good service . <h> Price <p> For many people , price may be the key factor , but its worth noting that PureVPN offers a try before you buy trial , in addition to a very clear pricing policy ( and a- 3 day money back guarantee ) <p> Current prices are as follows : <p> $9.95 per month for 1- month <p> $7.47 per month for 6 months <p> $4.16 per month for 12 months <p> When we checked , there were even greater discounts available if you sign up within minutes ( a countdown timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to check them out first on another computer and then sign up afresh to get the best price . An added bonus is that if you refer friends , you 'll also get a bit of cash back . <p> PureVPN also has by far the widest- choice of payment methods , - giving added convenience for many users . <h> Security &amp; Protocols <p> PureVPN lists- PPTP , L2TP/IPSec , SSTP , OpenVPN , and IKEv2 security protocols ( more than any other we looked at ) . Remember that the benefit here is that if you ISP blocks one or more , then you can easily switch to another one . <p> Additionally , - 256-bit encryption is supported this means it- would take quite a concerted effort in order to actually snoop on your traffic ( and would require some serious supercomputer power ) . In effect , 256-bit encryption- is- extremely secure and makes it almost impossible to break the code <h> Speed <p> As is the norm , the VPN speed is not restricted in any way . The desktop app also makes it simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  need to spend hours checking them all . Its quite hard to really say definitively how quick each VPN is without weeks of extended use , but they all promise unrestricted speed and gigabit switches , so its fair to say that in terms of what they claim , they 're all fairly similar . PureVPN does however , claim its the worlds fastest <h> Servers / Location <p> With 335 server locations in 53 countries and unlimited switching ( i.e. you choose a server ) between servers , there 's not much to differentiate PureVPN from the other contenders in our list . Europe , Asia and the Americas are particularly well covered . <h> Ease of Use / Installation <p> For the- manual setup option , there are step-by-step tutorials on the website in addition to the custom desktop software , that has one of the best interfaces we 've seen . For iOS , the- app is available on the App Store here . One nice touch is the Dashboard option which provides a quick overview of the protocol and country , as well as the connection status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to billing information . Overall , its very easy to use and has a plethora of options and configuration options . <p> The PureVPN Mac application gives you all the information at a glance <h> CyberGhost VPN <p> CyberGhost is unique among the VPNs we reviewed , because- besides the standard edition there 's also a completely free version that let 's you get online anonymously without having to pay a penny . There are however some differences between the free and paid-for versions for example the free one- does n't  have very- many servers around the world , which may be an issue if you need to use a server in a specific country . Also , note that the- free- service is ad-funded , so you will be subjected to adverts about other CyberGhost products . <p> The latest edition ( CyberGhost 5 ) comes in 3 flavours : Free , Premium , and Premium Plus . Besides server locations ( and speed ) , only the Premium Plus version gives you access on more than 1 device . More details and a comparison table can be found on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols , the server locations , the bandwidth and the number of devices you can use . The Premium- version supports only 1 device , while the Premium Plus support 5 ( with no other discernible difference to the Premium version ) . At the time of writing , they are also offering a special one-off " Snowden Edition " which is great value at- -9.99- prepaid for 1 year ( but still limited- to only 1 device ) . <h> Security &amp; Protocols <p> All versions of CyberGhost use military grade 256-bit encryption , but in terms of protocols , all paid subscriptions offer- OpenVPN , L2TP/IPSec and PPTP . The Free Service requires- the CyberGhost OS X application- which uses OpenVPN only ( which is also generally regarded as one of the most secure ) . <h> Speed <p> For Premium customers there are no bandwidth restrictions , so you should be able to get the maximum possible on your home Internet connection . CyberGhost states that they try to provide 6 Mbps , but the free service is limited to a fairly slow 1 Mbps this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as video streaming ) , its not sufficient . <h> Servers / Locations <p> The free version allows you to choose- from servers in only 15 countries , whereas the Premium and Premium Plus products give access to around 24 countries , as well- as no adverts and more bandwidth . While 24 countries does n't  sound like that many in comparison to the other VPNs reviewed , all the major regions are covered and CyberGhost- claims- that there are no waiting times ( i.e. to log on ) , which is not the case with the free service , especially likely during- busy periods . <h> Ease of Use / Installation <p> The best way to use CyberGhost is to download the OS X- application installation is simply a case of dragging the CyberGhost icon into your applications folder ( which also makes it easy to remove by simply deleting it ) . <p> Installation is as simple as dragging the CyberGhost icon to your Applications folder <p> Using the application itself is very intuitive , as its just a case of choosing a server location and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app from a drop-down list <p> Finally , CyberGhost certainly offers a useful service- for free despite the limitations . And its a recommended solution especially if you just want browsing access on a single device and do n't  intend to do anything more demanding . Upgrade to the paid versions and you 'll get a lot more out of it , plus the ability to view Internet video without annoying pauses and interruptions caused by bandwidth limitations . 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

The recent spread of the Flashback trojan proves that the Mac is n't necessarily as invulnerable as we Mac users may think . Therefore , its probably a good idea to have some kind of anti-virus software on your Mac , even if you do n't  have it running in real-time mode at least you can run a scan occasionally to check for any infections . Arguably , using a Mac is somewhat safer than a PC , perhaps because virus writers target the much larger installed user based of PCs , or perhaps due to better security on the Mac .

@@22342987 @2342987/ <h> New Activity Monitor Features in OS X Mavericks <p> Mac OS X Mavericks still has many of the same applications already used in Mountain Lion . Some have had major overhauls , whereas others have just had minor tweaks in functionality or appearance . One of the most useful applications built into Mac OS X is Activity Monitor , as it shows how your Mac is performing and the status of various processes and apps that may be running . It can be an incredibly useful tool , especially when your Mac slows down , as it let 's you see if you 're running low on memory and identify and processes that might be consuming too much CPU resource . Activity Monitor also allows you to inspect every process running , and terminate them if necessary . <p> here 's a quick run down of the features of Activity Monitor , with some highlights of the latest version in Mavericks . <h> Activity Monitor Features <p> Top open Activity Monitor , just type its name into Spotlight and the application should be shown in the results . Otherwise , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just click on the icon to open . <p> Activity Monitor lives in the Utilities folder under Applications <p> The first thing you 'll notice is a list of all the processes running , along with various options at the top : <p> CPU <p> Memory <p> Energy <p> Disk <p> Network <h> CPU <p> The main screen of Activity Monitor <p> Click on the CPU button to see details about your Macs processing activities . By default , there are 7 columns shown such as the Process Name , %CPU used and time , number of threads , idle wake ups , the process I 'd and the user that is running that process . Note that its possible to add more columns to this particular view just select View -&gt; Columns from the menu and choose which columns you want to see the entire list is displayed and it can be customised any way you like . <p> It can also be useful to change the view to show processed hierarchically that is , organised by application and every sub-process . From the View menu choose All processes , hierarchically. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little grey arrow next to the application name ) to view more details about every process used by every application . <p> Customise the columns shown from the View menu <p> There is also a nice CPU usage window ( accessibly from Window -&gt; CPU History ) that launches a mini window that shows the activity of each CPU core . Even if you close the Activity Monitor window ( but not Quit ) , you can keep this little window open to monitor the workload on your Mac . If you then click Zoom from the Window menu , you can see a fullscreen version of the CPU History window . <p> View your CPU history fullscreen <p> In terms of Mavericks , there 's not really that much new in the CPU section , but it does give you the ability to see how loaded your system is . <h> Memory <p> View details about memory used on your Mac <p> The memory section quickly let 's you see what applications are consuming the most memory you can order the Memory column in ascending or descending order . This section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nice summary at the bottom which shows all the different categories of memory ( physical , virtual , app memory used and file cache size ) . The most notable feature is perhaps the new concept of " memory pressure " which is a chart that shows just how much strain the system is in , in terms of memory use . If you have limited memory and your Mac is continually using virtual memory ( hard disk space it treats as RAM ) , then this graph will clearly show that . <p> There is also the new " compressed memory " heading basically when your Mac is running out of memory , it will compress some of that memory thus freeing up some of the space to use for other processes . This is a completely new Mavericks feature and can really help to speed things up and keep everything snappy . <p> If you double click any process from the Process Name list , it will open a window that shows more details about that process ( or just click the " i " button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about memory usage , some general statistics such as CPU % , and a list of open files and ports . <p> View more details about each process ( e.g. memory and statistics ) <h> Energy <p> In Mavericks , Activity Monitor has gained a new Energy section . With increased focus on saving energy ( and thus extending battery life ) , Mavericks really helps you find out which applications and processes are using the most energy . This tab shows you energy used over the last 8 hours or so , as well as which apps are " napping " this is a unique new feature that is designed to put apps to sleep for periods of time when they do not need to run . Applications such as Safari do n't  really need to be doing much when they are not visible recall the great demo in the last Apple keynote that showed Safari having a nap when another window covered it ? <p> A new option in the power meter shows energy impact <p> There 's also a handy little feature that shows the energy impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon in the menu bar . Just click on your battery icon to view the information any apps using significant energy will be shown here . Likewise , if all apps are using nominal energy , this will be shown in the menu . <h> Disk <p> The Disk tab shows items related to disk uses , such as the number of bytes written and read by each application . There 's nothing really new here , but this section does allow you to pinpoint any applications reading a lot of data , such as Skype or Safari . The graph can be made to show Data or IO , using the drop down arrows above the chart . <p> Disk statistics such as bytes written and read , organised by process name <h> Network <p> The Network tab predictably shows everything you might want to know about network usage per application , such as the bytes ( or packets ) sent and received . The graph at the bottom shows a general view for everything ( sent and received ) , whereas the columns show detailed information for each process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Dock Icon <p> There is a lot more than Activity Monitor than those items mentioned above . For example , you can set its Dock icon to show CPU usage or- history , by selecting- View- -&gt;- Dock Icon- and choose from the list . <p> Show your CPU usage on the Activity Monitor Dock icon <p> It can be useful for example to show the CPU activity , if you do n't  already have a separate application installed that does exactly that . One curious omission in Mavericks ( that was present in Mountain Lion ) is the ability to show the memory usage pie chart as the Dock icon perhaps this will be reinstated in the final version . <p> Change the Activity Monitor Dock icon to a CPU meter <h> Update Frequency <p> Its all very well having all this information at your fingertips , however the standard update frequency of the graphs and columns is rather too slow for my liking . You can increase the update frequency from the View -&gt; Update Frequency menu and choose Normally ( 5 sec ) , Often ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Setting it to Very often will of course use a bit more CPU , but it should be negligible . In fact , you can even scroll through the list and see how much resources Activity Monitor itself is using ! <h> Miscellaneous Features <p> Activity Monitor is also a useful tool if you want to terminate a process just click the " X " button on the main window to kill a process ( force it to quit ) . A warning dialog box will pop up asking whether you want to confirm . There 's not really any difference killing a process this way rather than using Cmd + Alt + Esc , however you can do it at the- process level , rather than the application level . <p> If you want to run system diagnostics on your Mac ( to check whether everything is working properly ) you can do that here from the View menu and select Run Diagnostics . You might be prompted to enter the administration password . When the procedure has finished you 'll see a Finder window called tmp that contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see a folder containing all kinds of diagnostics information in dozens of files not really that useful to most people , but if you 're having serious computer problems this is just the kind of information that you could use to send to Apple . However , you might be able to glean something useful from these files ( especially if you are technically-minded ) for example , the file called disks.txt shows you disk information like the amount of free space , whereas errorlog.txt shows information about any errors that have occurred . <p> All in all , its worth playing around with Activity Monitor . You could even keep it open all the time in its own desktop space , so that you can see at a glance what your Mac is really doing ! 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

@@22342993 @2342993/ <h> Three Flight Simulators For Mac OS X and iOS Compared <p> While the classic flight simulator is perhaps slightly less mainstream today than it was several years ago , there is still a huge audience for them . What 's more , with the appearance of iOS , this category of game has been transitioned to mobile devices , with considerable success . Let 's take a look at one of the best for each platform , Flightgear ( Mac ) , X-Plane ( iPhone ) and F-Sim Space Shuttle ( iPad/iPhone ) . <h> Flightgear <p> The main reason this is so great is that it is completely open source . It is infinitely expandable , with many different aircraft available to download from the official site , as well as terrain and airports . Rather like a pizza , you download the base , and then you can add whatever toppings you want to suit your fancy . <p> Performance wise , as with everything , the faster your Mac the better . While it does run on my 2007 Macbook , it is pretty sluggish at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and processor . <p> What 's more , because it is open source , it is completely free , which is awesome . For Mac at least , there is no need to spend hundreds on a flight simulator when there is great free one on offer . Instead , better spend your money on a good joystick ( as I did ) , so you can get the best flying experience possible . <h> X-Plane <p> Out of the three , this is the most disappointing one by a clear mile . I know you cant expect as much performance from an iPhone , but nevertheless , I feel they could have done better . You take off with no clear indication of where to go , the controls are limited , and if its your first time , its incredibly difficult to keep the plane in the air . <p> While the detail on the planes is good , there are a very limited number of choices . More planes would have been much better , as if its this type of flight sim , you really want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you can take off from , and the scenery gets pretty boring after a while . <p> On the plus side , even though the controls are limited , they are easy to use , so you cant really fault it in that regard . Its not really that its a bad flight sim , its just very very limited compared to others . <h> F-Sim Space Shuttle <p> This is a slightly different type of flight sim to the other two . Instead of having to take off , you only have to land , and instead of being in a place , you 're in a space shuttle . But performance and realism wise , its phenomenal . <p> All the audio and scenery is like the real thing , and you can even see the inside of the cockpit with all the details . <p> In terms of ease of landing , this one is also the pick of the bunch .

For lazy summer days in the park , business trips away and many other situations , being able to crank up the volume enhances your listening pleasure . <p> These days , portable speakers neednt cost the earth and can produce more than acceptable sound that really shows off the quality that 's possible certainly good enough for most people . Portable speakers can be connected to your iPhone in a variety of ways such as with a 3.55 mm audio cable , or wirelessly using Bluetooth on the slightly more expensive systems ( some high-end speakers even use AirPlay ) . The portable speakers listed below are some of the best " budget " iPhone portable speakers , that cost anywhere up to around -150. <h> 1 .

Jawbone JAMBOX <p> Even though it can only just be considered a budget model , the JAMBOX has been very highly rated as one of the best sounding portable speakers on the market . The design is funky retro ( it comes in four colours Black Diamond , Blue Wave , Grey Hex and Red Dot ) - and has a tactile rubber coating , but its the sound where the JAMBOX really excels . Like many of the other iPhone speakers , it can be connected by Bluetooth with a range of around 33 feet . There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its plugged into your computer .

Theyre available in black and silver colours and generate a surprising amount of sound when you consider their compact size . They have a magnetic base so they can be attached to each other into a convenient pod shape when travelling , but with a simple twist can be extended to full size when in use . Connection to an iPhone is by the 3.5 mm jack ( Bluetooth is not supported , unfortunately ) , and there 's a USB connector to charge them up . Considering the price , they 're pretty hard to beat and should satisfy all but the most critical of audiophiles . <p> The diminutive iHM79 speakers pack quite a punch <h> 4 . SoundMatters FoxL v2 Bluetooth <p> The FoxL is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sound quality and size they 're well made and are easily one of the most compact options in our list at just 5.6 x 2.2 x 1.4 inches- .

Connection to your phone is via Bluetooth ( though there 's also a wired version available which retails for just $169 ) , and it comes with a wall charger , USB charging cable , wrist strap and travel pouch . <p> If you want even better sound quality , spend an extra $30 for the PLATINUM edition which has superior audio quality . Apparently , the unique sound and technologies were developed by- Dr. Godehard Guenther a physicist and former NASA engineer ! <p> The FoxL v2 Bluetooth speakers ' sound defies their size <h> 5 .

It has a built in rechargeable battery that provides up to 20 hours of playback . It can be connected to an iPhone or any other device that has a 3.5 mm audio jack . The WOWee can be placed on virtually any surface as it has a very grippy rubber pad on the underside which let 's you place it on vertical surfaces such as windows or walls ! <p> The only downside is that when the volume is turned right up the sound suffers quite noticeably , so you 're better off using it at lower levels . For the price however , the WOWee ONE Classic is a great piece of kit which comes in many colours , and there 's also a newer slim model at -79.99 . <p> The innovative WOWee ONE speakers 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 <h> You may also like 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625

The Mac is an ideal platform because independent developers can control the entire process and release apps to the mass market through the app store . This article describes some of the most popular tools available today . So what are you waiting for turn your ideas into reality with these 8 brilliant apps . <h> 1 . BBEdit <p> BBEdit is one of the most consistently popular text , code and markup editors . Website developers will especially love it , as it boasts some excellent features to manipulate HTML and other XML-based markup languages . BBEdit is particularly good with text editing but also features handy tools such as grep pattern matching , and search-and-replace across multiple files . <p> Lots of different programming languages are supported , and the code syntax is highlighted with different colours depending on the language used . AppleScript , Automator and UNIX scripting are also included . <p> Create and edit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <p> Coda 2 is a very popular web development tool and editors for the Mac , and with good reason . What was already a very powerful package has undergone a major overhaul in the latest version , with more features than you could possibly imagine . Coda 2 combines a HTML , PHP and Javascript editor with a built-in terminal ( so you do n't  need multiple terminal windows open ) , cascading style sheets ( CSS ) , file management and version control ( SVN ) . <p> The user interface has had a major revamp there 's a customisable sidebar where you can add your favourite Coda tools , and the ability to go full screen when you want to concentrate without any distractions . The text editor provides autocomplete , and will even close HTML tags for you automatically . Besides SVN , Coda 2 now supports GIT ( a popular file management and versioning system ) , and the ability to preview your website on the iPhone and iPad . <p> There 's a MySQL editor built-in for anybody that needs to interface with a database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra screen for a live preview of the site you 're working on ( note that this requires the iPad app Diet Coda ) . - The list of features is impressive , making Coda 2 an essential tool in any developers arsenal . <p> Coda 2 is a great tool for web development <h> 3 . CodeRunner <p> Not everyone wants to shell out lots of cash for development tools , and this is perhaps where CodeRunner is the best option . CodeRunner let 's you edit and run code in just about any programming language ( such as AppleScript , C , C++ , Java , JavaScript , Lua , Object-C , Perl , PHP , Python and Ruby ) . There 's a powerful code editor that automatically highlights syntax for you and completes code , as well as automatic bracket matching to make sure that you can quickly see each block of code . <p> On Lion , CodeRunner makes use of the autosave , versions and fullscreen capabilities , and there 's a built-in file browser so you can easily view all your most important source files . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you 're just starting out and want an inexpensive but powerful development environment . <p> Write code in multiple languages using CodeRunner <h> 4 . Gitbox <p> Anyone that works on projects with several developers will know that its essential to have a proper solution to store the code and the ability to check it in and out . This is where Gitbox comes in its basically an interface on top of the very popular Git tool that manages repositories of code. - Git itself is an open source system protected by the GNU General Public License , so the source code is free and available for anyone to use . <p> Gitbox makes it easy to check out files , and there 's even the ability to give you a visual overview of the difference between various branches of code . And when you commit an update to a piece of source code , comments can be added to indicate what changes you 've made . If you 're involved with software development in any way , Git and a tool like Gitbox are highly recommended . <p> Gitbox is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Icons <p> For application developers , Icons can save you oodles of time by allowing you to generate any icon imaginable . The list of features is impressive for example if you need to generate an icon with rounded corners , or add a shine , or perhaps overlay text on the icon with different fonts , colours and sizes . Just about every aspect of an icon can be altered using this app , and you can export your new creation especially for the iPhone , iPad , Android or OS X. <p> Icons even let 's you create Favicons ( in 3 different sizes up to 48 x 48 pixels ) , iTunes artwork ( 512 x 512 ) or any custom size you desire . The nice thing about the app is that its incredibly easy to use just drag an image file into the app and it will loads all the icon previews so you can immediately see how theyll look in each different . Image formats supported include PSD , PNG , TIFF , BMP , JPEG and more . There 's no excuse now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Create visually stunning icons with Icons <h> 6 . PaintCode <p> PaintCode enables you to create resolution-independent vector-based graphics for iOS and Mac apps that use Objective-C . Many developers make their interfaces in the code itself , but that 's not an easy tasks instead , an app such as PaintCode is a much more intuitive and efficient way to achieve great-looking results . PaintCode can be used by graphic designers for example , that have never even written a line of code , and the results can be easily exported into other tools such as Apples Xcode . <p> You can switch PaintCode into Retina Display mode to produce even higher resolution graphics , and it includes a whole raft of shapes ( simple ones such as rectangles , ovals , polygons , stars and texts , as well as more complex dynamic shapes , colours , shadows and gradients ) . The app then generates the final code that can then be used in other development tools . <p> Why code up a user interface manually when you can design it in PaintCode <h> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free text and code editor especially focused on manipulation , editing and searching of text . Multiple programming languages are supported with automatic syntax colouring , as well as other useful features such as FTP ( plus Secure FTP ) , AppleScript , and UNIX scripting support . <p> You might be wondering what the difference is between TextWrangler and BBEdit the latter has a wider set of professional development and web authoring tools , but TextWrangler is definitely a good place to start especially if you 're new to software development and want to pic up something for free . <p> TextWrangler specialises in manipulating all kinds of text <h> 8 . Xcode <p> Apple has done a great job in getting powerful tools into the hands of the development community . Xcode is the main development environment on the Mac and its also free . It can be used to develop apps for the Mac , iPhone and the iPad , covering the entire software development lifecycle such as UI design , coding , testing and debugging all within a single application . <p> For iOS developers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your code will look like on the target device . There 's a very capable interface builder to design and layout UI elements , and support for the programming languages Objective-C , C and C++ . The list of features is endless , but one of the more interesting ones is Apples LLVM technology which can actually help to find and fix bugs for you by analysing the code , in addition to code completion and automatic highlighting of mistakes . <p> Another of Xcodes highlights are the suite of instruments that can visually analyse your apps performance . For example , to view the CPU , disk , memory and OpenGL graphics performance over time in order to identify any performance bottlenecks . If you want to actually deploy an iOS app , you 'll need to sign up to the Apple Developer Program- which costs just $99 per year . Xcode is perhaps the only tool that you 'll ever need to create amazing apps for the Mac and iOS . <p> Perhaps the only development tool you 'll need for the Mac and iOS 6622 @qwx206622 6626 @qwx206626 6624 @qwx206624 6621 @qwx206621 6623 @qwx206623 6625 @qwx206625
