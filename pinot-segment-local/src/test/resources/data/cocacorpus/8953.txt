" Today , Chairman Pai helped wake our country from a bizarre , two-year fever dream of a policy detour governed entirely by fear and misinformation . <p> Nothing about the Internet was broken when the prior FCC leadership caved to intense political pressure to " save the Internet " by imposing regulations written during the Great Depression . <p> From the internet 's earliest days , President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress saw the abundance that might come if we worked together to stoke an American-led century of innovation .

And , this progressive and modern approach has had truly transformative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop now . <p> Our common task is to craft policies that dare to envision once again a U.S. innovation future that focuses on abundance rather than austerity " a future where competition is thriving , jobs are growing and American consumers continue to have both the net neutrality we demand and the thriving , innovative broadband experience we deserve . <p> Chairman Pai started from the right place , asking " what policies will give the American people what they want ? " He should be commended for standing with so many great U.S. policymakers , innovators and consumers for the modern , bipartisan principles that have made American broadband the envy of the world . <h> 5 things to know about Congress ' rejection of FCC privacy rules <p> The House on Tuesday voted to block implementation of new online privacy rules rushed through the FCC in the final days of former chairman Tom Wheeler 's tenure . In a vacuum of information , this sent pockets of the internet into a panic . But consumers wake up today to the same online world and digital protections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data " financial , Social Security , about your kids " remains fully protected . There are strict and enforceable protections under existing law safeguarding consumers ' most sensitive information . These remain wholly in force . For example , the Children 's Online Privacy Protection Rule has been in place since the days of dial-up . <p> No one is buying anyone 's individual browser history and putting it online . Step away from the Kickstarter campaigns . Such activity remains patently illegal . <p> Your browser history is already being aggregated and sold to advertising networks " by virtually every site you visit on the internet . Consumers ' browsing history is bought and sold across massive online advertising networks every day . This is the reason so many popular online destinations and services are " free . " And , it 's why the ads you see on your favorite sites " large and small " always seem so relevant to what you 've recently been shopping for online . Of note , internet service providers are relative bit players in the $83 billion digital ad market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect . <p> Consumers expect and deserve one standard for online privacy . According to a national survey conducted last May by Public Opinion Strategies , 94% of consumers believe all companies should be held to the same online privacy rules " whether it 's Apple , Amazon , AT&amp;T , Comcast , Verizon , Facebook , T-Mobile , Google or Twitter . Congress agreed . <p> This action makes way for a unified approach . The Federal Trade Commission has long been the cop on the beat protecting consumers ' online privacy . This includes bringing more than 150 privacy and data security enforcement actions against not only ISPs but other major players in online search , content and e-commerce . Two years ago , the FCC stripped the FTC of its jurisdiction over broadband providers and began down this bifurcated path . Fortunately , in advance of Congress ' vote , FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen rejected this approach and jointly expressed their support for " a comprehensive and consistent framework . " <p> Congress did not vote down consumer privacy protections . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unequal regulatory regime . Lawmakers were right to take this stand for better public policy , and consumers are better off for it . <h> Save the internet , skip Title II <p> Everyone in this country passionately supports an open internet . Free speech " online and off " is at the center of our democratic way of life . For this reason , Americans have always enjoyed an open internet " long before regulators decided they had to " save the internet " by turning it into a utility . <p> In many respects , the so-called Title II debate reflects everything voters most resent about Washington : Fear-mongering , Armageddon-style arguments with a dubious connection to the facts . <p> The central fact of this debate is its true subject : This policy battle is not about whether we safeguard an open internet . It 's about how we go about doing so . <p> Title II regulations were written in the rotary phone era . They were put on the books when FDR was president and Frank Capra 's black-and-white classic " It Happened One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 1934 Academy Awards . <p> The application of these retro rules to our modern internet is the policy equivalent of using a sledgehammer to deal with a mosquito on your arm . Technically , it may get the job done . But everything breaks in the process . <p> Among the collateral damage : Investment in ever stronger , faster and more capable broadband networks . As FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has noted , last year saw the first dip in private-sector broadband investment outside of a recession . Unlike other essential national infrastructure , U.S. broadband networks are built on private investment " more than $1.1 trillion and counting over the past 15 years . Abruptly shifting gears to a nearly century-old regulatory regime caused these essential investments to slow at a time when U.S. competitiveness demands they speed ahead . <p> While consumer groups aggressively fundraise to " Save the Internet , " they are actively working against some of the most wildly popular consumer innovations .

It 's not all good . It 's not all bad . But not once has someone said : I wish my internet company behaved more like the gas company . <p> There is a better , cleaner and more straightforward path to the outcome we all want to achieve . <p> If we do n't want to continue what our nation has long enjoyed " an open , innovating , strong , dynamic , pro-consumer internet , then by all means let 's keep Title II .

That anxiety underlies the cratering of trust in government and all-but every other institution . <p> With this crisis in mind , we have taken apart the economic story , sector by sector , for clues where jobs definitely are vanishing , and where they may reappear .

In short , he 's not drawing any firm lines in the sand and remains open to striking a deal . <p> So you came out in your press conference a few weeks ago " you were pretty clear about what the bill did n't do , about which expectations of yours it did n't meet . Can you tell me now where you stand ? What are your expectations as of now , and where do you see the movement towards what you 're looking for ? <p> " I do n't have an answer to that question . I truly do n't have an answer to that question , because things are changing so quickly ... And it 's not because I 'm undecided " all I 'm trying to do is get all the information I possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there " with coverage numbers , could any Nevadans lose coverage ? Or is there kind of like a threshold that you have set for yourself ? <p> " See , I 'm not going to talk about that . Yeah , that 's not the discussion I want to have . The discussion I want to have is to see what the options are , so that we can make the best decision and choice for the state of Nevada . And if that 's a no vote , that 's a no vote . I 'm not saying I 'm a no vote but I 'm just saying , I want to have all the information that I can have and continue to gather this information to the point that I can actually make a decision . I 'm not at the point I can make a decision . " <p> Similar question on premiums " if premiums do not decrease , is that something " have you made a hard line " <p> " That 's one of the variables in this process . " <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know if that would kill your vote . <p> " Well , you know , all the scoring and everything , I want to see it . Read it . I want to understand it . And if I have questions , I want to be able to go to people that can answer those questions . " <p> You sound pretty flexible . <p> " I hope so . I hope to be . And I think , frankly , that 's what I should be doing . " <p> So like a voter from Nevada was coming up to you and said , ' What wo n't you support ? ' What would you tell them ? <p> " It just depends on the individual . We 'll sit down and talk about what their concerns are , what their problems , then we 'll address those specifically .

Schmelter/Chattanooga Times Free Press via AP <p> A watchdog group is suing the Trump administration to force the release of a letter to the House Freedom Caucus that might have outlined the regulatory steps the administration can take to loosen the Affordable Care Act 's insurance rules . The lawsuit , to be filed by American Oversight in federal district court this afternoon , seeks the release of a March 23 letter administration officials reportedly gave to the Freedom Caucus to win its support for the House 's health care bill , one day before leadership pulled that bill from the floor . <p> Why it matters : If the letter does exist " and if the group wins its release under the Freedom of Information Act " it could she 'd light on what kind of regulatory flexibility the Department of Health and Human Services thinks it can provide without any legislative changes .

That number would rise to 22 million by 2026 . Those numbers have n't changed since the Senate took its first crack at this . <p> Today 's bill would save the federal government roughly $420 billion over the next 10 years . <p> CBO said the latest bill would lead to higher premiums until 2020 , but after that , premiums would be lower than under current law . Premiums would fall , in large part , because insurance plans would be less generous . <p> Deductibles would rise sharply . By 2026 , the average deductible for a typical plan , covering just one person , would be roughly $13,000 per year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen. Ted Cruz 's proposal to let insurers offer health plans that do n't comply with all the Affordable Care Act 's regulations , as long as they also offer plans that do . But that does n't mean Cruz 's amendment is off the table . <p> Most of that is consistent with CBO 's estimates of earlier versions of the bill " and the bill itself is also pretty similar to previous iterations , as well . <p> What this is : There are a lot of health care bills and a lot of CBO scores floating around lately , and it 's getting confusing for everybody . Here 's what 's what : <p> Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the first version of his repeal-and-replace bill in June . He did n't have the votes to pass it , so he started working on a revised proposal . <p> In that process , Republicans actually sent in two sets of revisions for CBO to analyze . <p> Today 's bill is one of those two options " the less ambitious one . It 's very similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance markets and some tax changes , too . That 's why today 's CBO numbers might sound familiar . <p> GOP leaders released the other option " the one with Cruz 's " consumer choice " proposal " last week . But CBO probably wo n't have time to score Cruz 's proposal before the Senate votes . <p> If and when senators actually votes on a health care bill , they could vote on either of these options " the one released today , or the one with Cruz 's proposal . It 's also possible both bills could get a vote . It 's also possible neither of them will get a vote . No one knows what they 're going to vote on , only that they will vote . <p> There 's a third option : an updated version of the 2015 bill that repealed most of the Affordable Care Act without attempting to replace it . That 's the bill CBO scored yesterday , saying it would create about 32 million newly uninsured people . <h> Most Americans support higher insurance rates for smokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher insurance rates for smokers would be justified , per a new Gallup poll . That number was 63% among non-smokers , and 42% for smokers . By contrast , only 37% of Americans say it 's justified to charge very overweight or obese people more . <p> Why it matters : The percentage of smokers in the U.S. population is declining , but the obesity rate is climbing . Still , Americans have supported higher premiums for smokers and opposed such measures for obese individuals since 2004 , according to Gallup 's data . <h> Internet unleashes . health domain names <p> Pixabay / Creative Commons <p> The health care industry now has its own domain name on the internet , just like universities have . edu and not-for-profits have . org .

It shows debt-to-equity multiples hit a whopping 6.2x in Q1 , compared to 5.4x for the entirety of last year and a 5.19x average between 2011 and 2016 . <p> What happened : For a while , most everyone played by these rules largely because banks were scared of crossing the Fed . Then a bunch of one-off transactions began breaching the threshold , particularly in tech . Then " baskets " of deals began to breach . All the while , the Fed did little more than send the occasional letter of reprimand . The takeaway for banks was : You can do it , just do n't flout it . <p> Should the Fed care more ? It 's tough to argue that companies benefit from being over-leveraged but , from a public policy standpoint , private equity-backed deals do n't pose a systemic risk . Namely because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes of another PE portfolio company , even if held in the same fund . <p> Caveat : It can be very difficult for data providers like PitchBook to accurately gauge market-wide leverage multiples , given that so many LBO values and debt breakdowns are kept private . Thus the average is prone to being weighted toward take-private transactions , which tend to be larger ( and , historically , have higher leverage multiples ) . It 's also worth noting that PitchBook also reported a mark in excess of 6x for Q1 2016 , but the overall year settled much lower . <p> Speaking of debt : White House budget director Mick Mulvaney gave an interview yesterday to CNBC , in which the headline was that we were n't supposed to take Candidate Trump seriously when he promised to eliminate the national debt during his time in office . Apparently that was " hyperbole . " <p> He also suggested that there could be a $200 billion federal outlay for infrastructure , Mulvaney thinks would be matched 5:1 by the private sector : " Gary Cohn and I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sachs guys credit . They know how to lever up . " <p> Still no word on how the infrastructure plan would address the countless roads , bridges and tunnels that do n't have any prospect of having revenue attached ... <p> New firm alert : Riot Ventures , a new Boston-based firm led by serial entrepreneur and angel investor Stephen Marcus , is out raising $25 million for its debut fund , per an SEC filing .

The common link is Katerra executive chairman Michael Marks , who faced similar supply chain skepticism in his early days of leading Flextronics . Marks also has spent time in private equity ( KKR and Riverwood Equity ) and as interim CEO of Tesla Motors . <p> Bottom line : " Although several companies compete with Katerra in different areas " Prescient builds frames and panels for developers in its own manufacturing plant while Rhumbix sells software to track construction costs " Marks said Katerra stands out for wanting to do everything .

Indeed , if the labor force participation rate of 2008 were in effect today , the unemployment rate would be 9.6% rather than 4.8% . <p> What bulls say : They expect higher wages and higher inflation because the pool of actually available workers is quite small .

Just a quick reminder that Generate , our daily download on the energy sector , began publishing this morning . You can subscribe to Generate , and all the other Axios newsletters , by going here . Okay , on to the business of business ... <h> Top of the Morning <p> Source : Giphy <p> Pen to paper : Time Inc. is expecting to receive takeover bids this week , for either all or part of its magazine publishing empire . In preparation of a possible sale , the company recently approved a new compensation plan that basically guarantees bonuses and extends severance to top executives if they get fired after a change of control . Such guarantees are not extended to editors of the company 's nearly two dozen titles , nor to any of their reporters , researchers or assistants . Also out of luck are salespeople , designers , technologists , back-office administrators , security guards or anyone else who could well receive a pink slip in the event of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to make such changes to exec comp in the midst of an auction , but that does n't make it any less greedy or inconsistent . And since I have a personal interest in this one ( Dan Primack : senior editor at Fortune 2010-2016 ) , I 've written an open letter to the company 's board . Read it here . <p> Debt data : American companies have issued nearly twice as much high-yield debt ( i.e. , junk bonds ) so far in 2017 than they had at the same point in 2016 , according to Thomson Reuters . But the 96% U.S. boost is actually well below the 195% increase in worldwide high-yield issuance , driven by whopping bumps in non-Japan Asia ( +627% ) and Europe ( +433% ) . <p> High-yield issuance actually declined for the past four years , but the early 2017 boost seems partially reflective of a global increase in leveraged buyouts . For example , while overall U.S. M&amp;A activity is flat from 2016 , private equity deals for U.S. targets are up 71% . Private equity is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% . The big exception to this trend in non-Japan Asia , where private equity activity is actually down 31% from 2016 . One explanation for that region 's junk bond binge is buyside demand for diversification , particularly at a time when asset manager inflows are being buoyed by record-high equity markets . Within the Asia number , Chinese issuers have a 56.5% market share . <p> Slump pricing : Uber 's PR pros must feel a bit like rodeo clowns right now . They know something bad is coming most every day , but they just do n't know from which direction or quite how much it will hurt . Kia has a quick roundup of its most recent terrible , horrible , no good , very bad week . <p> There also was a weekend report from The Information that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is seeking to hire an official " second in command , " which is n't anything he 's ever really had .

That was incorrect . He and Snap co-founder Bobby Murphy did an exclusive with the LA Times . From Spiegel : <p> " We built our business on creativity .

@@13013289 @1613289/ <h> Axios AM <h> Axios AM <h> 1 big thing : Wins and losses <p> Tourists at Washington Monument at sunset last night / AP 's J. David Ake <p> The Trump presidency is one month old " 47 ( or 95 ) more months to go . So what has President Trump gotten most right and most wrong ? After talking to dozens of officials inside and out of the White House , VandeHei and I came up with this list : <p> Most right : <p> In policy promises and rhetoric , he has created a fairly strong climate for economic growth , an essential ingredient for first-term success . Voters are more forgiving when they have jobs , wage growth and optimism . Business hates uncertainty , but stock prices are rising and consumer confidence is growing . Hard to see tax cuts , lighter regulations and infrastructure spending doing anything but helping . <p> Forcing U.S. companies to think harder about creating U.S. jobs . We can argue all day whether most big jobs announcements " starting with Carrier " were overhyped . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to showcase job creation in America , a good short-term trend for U.S. workers . And very good long-term politics for Trump . <p> Keeping his promises . Trump , for better or worse , has done precisely what he said he would do in terms of pulling out of trade deals , clamping down on illegal immigration and banning travel from Muslim-majority nations . While it 's been sloppy , it has been similar to what was promised . And his Supreme Court pick , Neil Gorsuch , was on the list Trump shared as a candidate , and looks like a virtual lock to win approval . This has kept Republicans solidly in his corner . <p> Most wrong : <p> Scaring off talent . Others will argue for what they see as greater sins . But Trump 's paranoid , chaotic way of leading has spooked some of the smartest , most capable Republicans who wanted or were willing to work for him ( especially in intelligence and defense positions ) . We know : We 've talked to them . We have heard from scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are treated by the existing team " and witnessing the far reach of Steve Bannon and the White House oligarchy . You ca n't run a great business with mediocrity " or retreads or yes-men . This is a big , long-term risk on many fronts . <p> Delegitimizing people he will one day need . Mark our word : The moment will come when Trump needs the public or world to believe something " fake news " journalists are reporting , or needs " so-called " judges to give his idea a fair hearing , or needs the intelligence community to have his back in a tense moment , or needs allies such as Germany or Australia to support him , or needs establishment Republicans to take a tough vote . All five groups could hurt him badly on the Russia investigation ( a topic that could easily be #1 on this entire list ) . Revenge is a human instinct not confined to Trump . <p> Being consumed with small-ball grievances . This has been a hallmark of Trump going back decades . He allows petty slights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his team and decision-making . This has slowed action on Capitol Hill and obscured the genuine accomplishments listed above . <p> " At a time when Mr. Trump 's ties to Russia , and the people connected to him , are under heightened scrutiny ... some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into Russia-related efforts behind the scenes . <p> " While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts , a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms . " <h> 3 . The click graveyard @qwx197458 <p> For a decade , everything in online media was about clicks . But Sara Fischer , Axios ' media-trends reporter , says the click referral is becoming an idea of the past . The new-new thing : " content exposure , " which drives you to click something , instead of the click itself . <p> The past : Most publishers designed their websites to measure user interaction through clicks , not scroll rates or time spent on stories . As the industry moves away from click-through rates ( CTR 's ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a difficult time justifying the effectiveness of their platforms for marketers . <p> Who 's to blame ? Click referrals as the most successful marketing metric was driven by a free click referral measuring tool created in 2005 ... Google Analytics. <h> 4 . Tops in tech : An explosive blog post <p> Another tale of sexism and unacceptable workplace behavior in Silicon Valley , Axios ' Kia Kokalitcheva writes . This time it 's at Uber , according to an explosive blog post yesterday by former company engine Susan Fowler Riggetti , who accuses Uber of ignoring multiple complaints of sexual harassment . Her attempts to use emails to document bad behavior were turned against her , she says . <p> Reached for comment , Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told Axios first : " I have just read Susan Fowler 's blog .

Bill Gates ' robot tax <p> Financial Times second front , " Bill Gates calls for income tax on robots : Microsoft co-founder suggests money should be used to retrain people replaced by robots , " by Richard Waters in S.F. : " It is an idea that until now has been associated more with European socialists than tech industry leaders , and puts him in the unusual position of explicitly arguing for taxes to slow the adoption of new technology . " <p> Gates told Quartz : " It is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm ... That means they wo n't shape it for the positive things it can do . And , you know , taxation is certainly a better way to handle it than just banning some elements of it . " <h> 6 .

@@13013293 @1613293/ <h> Axios Pro Rata <h> Pro Rata <h> Top of the Morning <p> Earlier this week , the American Bar Association announced that it was putting Arizona Summit Law School on probation , due to egregiously low bar exam passage rates . This made ASLS only the second law school in the country to be put on probation by the ABA the first of which , Charlotte School of Law , subsequently was shut off from the federal student loan spigot by the U.S. Department of Education . <p> The connection ? These are two of three for-profit law schools owned and operated by Infilaw , which in turn is owned by private equity firms Sterling Partners and ABRY Partners , alongside a bit of debt and equity co-invest from Ares Capital Corp . <p> How bad is it ? Last year , ASLS students taking the bar exam for the first time passed at just a 24.6% rate . The national average was 64.2% , while local rival Arizona State University came in at 78.8% . In Charlotte , things got so bad that the school secretly paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam until after taking a third-party prep course . And before you think this is some cut-rate program , one year of attendance at ASLS runs over $67,000 . <p> What went wrong ? Who knows ? Seriously , I mean that . A spokeswoman for Sterling Partners said that the Chicago-based firm does " not comment on matters related to InfiLaw . " When I pointed out that Sterling has actually commented plenty in the past , extolling the virtues of for-profit education , she said she 'd get back to me . Never happened . I also called the Sterling managing director currently responsible for Infilaw , but his EA said he 'd need " permission " to speak with me . Permission from whom ? No comment , and apparently it was n't forthcoming since he never called back . Also silent was minority equity-holder ABRY Partners , which actually wiped all references to Infilaw from its website last summer . As for Infilaw itself or Ares Capital .... well , you guessed it . <p> What now : The big question going forward will be if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same treatment that it gave Charlotte . It seems like a fairly cut-and-dry case , but new Ed Sec Betsy DeVos is a well-known proponent of for-profit ed , to the point that she even hired an advisor whose last job was as a lawyer for a for-profit ed company under federal investigation . It 's also worth noting that DeVos has personal exposure to some Ares-related CLOs , but there is no indication that they are invested in InfiLaw . <p> Diaper pail : Amazon yesterday announced plans to shut down Quidsi ( a.k.a .

We have heard from numerous , anguished people in Clinton-land blaming Obama -- more than Putin , FBI Director James Comey or , um , Hillary herself -- for the defeat . <p> The reason : Clintonites feel that if Obama had come out early and forcefully with evidence of Russian interference in the campaign , and perhaps quicker sanctions , she might be president today . His caution , they argue , allowed the public to have a foggy sense of clear , calculated , consistent Russian meddling in the campaign . We ca n't stress enough how upset some Democrats are . It 's testing relationships between Clinton and Obama loyalists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition harder . <p> A Clinton campaign official told us : " The White House was like everyone else : They thought she 'd win anyway . ...

The Russia thing was like a spy novel , and anything he said or did would have helped get people to believe it was real . " <p> On the flip side , Obama has let it be know he remains befuddled how she missed what to him was an easy layup of a win , given his own popularity on Election Day and Trump 's vulgarity : <p> A top Obama aide told us the White House was very deliberate about not being seen as politicizing the hacks . The aide said the first priority was making sure that the actual voting was untainted , and coordination with Republican state officials would have collapsed if Obama was seen as grandstanding . <p> Obama acknowledged the issue at his year-end news conference : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that somehow if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff , that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians ...

" That could mean replacing the current lottery system with one that prioritizes visas for jobs promising the highest salaries . <p> The salary range : According to Labor Department data , the largest users of H-1B visas " India-based IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy , Wipro and Infosys " tend to pay visa-holding staff lower salaries . Tech companies such as Google , Microsoft , Intel and Cisco tend to promise higher wages for the foreign engineers they hire with H-1Bs . <p> Data caveat : When companies hire workers with an H-1B visa , they have to provide notice , through a government filing , of the H-1B workers ' wages and work locations . While the Labor Department filings do n't directly correlate with number of visas ultimately awarded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting to fill slots with H-1B-holders . <p> The backdrop : Tech companies such as Microsoft , Google and Facebook say the visas are crucial for specialized jobs they ca n't fill with American workers . India-based companies that staff corporate IT departments file the largest numbers of visa requests , triggering criticism that the visas are used to fill lower-paid , entry-level IT jobs ( which Trump and his supporters would prefer to see go to Americans ) instead of higher-paying , more senior engineering jobs . <p> Tensions over U.S. worker displacement escalated with the 2015 layoffs at Disney , where IT workers were let go after bringing in an offshore contracting firm that largely relies on H-1B visas . Trump seized on the incident during the campaign and said he was " totally committed to eliminating rampant , widespread H-1B abuse . " This was a defining incident in shaping the thinking of key White House advisors Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller . <p> The draft EO does n't order immediate changes to the H-1B allocation process . Tech industry insiders expect Trump will direct DHS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule-making to re-prioritize the visa allocation to give preference to higher-paying firms . This pits tech firms against the Indian IT-staffing firms . <p> What it means for tech : In theory , prioritizing by salaries means visas for more senior , higher-paying jobs will be granted first , and visas for lower-paying jobs ( such as those being filled by Indian IT services firms ) would fall to the back of line , perhaps not getting allocated at all if demand for the high-wage job visas is strong . <p> IEEE , one of the largest groups representing U.S. technical workers , in a memo to Miller proposed giving priority to companies that are not H-1B dependent ( meaning less then 15% of their workforce is H-1B holders ) and pay the highest salaries . <p> California House members Darrell Issa , a Republican , and Zoe Lofgren , a Democrat , are pushing bills that would raise salary requirements for H-1B visa holders . Tech companies generally support those efforts to de-prioritize Indian outsourcers that they claim " clog up " the oversubscribed lottery system with bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring means companies may miss out on mid-level workers they still have trouble filling with qualified Americans . For example , software engineering jobs will be filled quickly , but jobs for network engineers or tech support that tend to skew lower on the pay scale could be tough to fill without H-1B visas . " The demand in the job market is not always captured by the highest salary , " said one tech lobbyist . So tech companies are advocating for worker skill-set to be taken into account in addition to salary alone . <p> The irony : Some of the biggest tech companies also use India-based IT staff to supplement their own corporate IT departments . So they 'll also feel the pinch if those jobs are harder to fill with visas . <p> What it means for India-based IT firms : Since they 're more dependent on H-1B workers , so-called outsourcing firms will be hit hard if changes to the lottery system move them to the back of the line or cut them out altogether .

What was n't reported , however , was the key role that investor Alibaba Group played in the " deep-linking " company 's ultimate demise . <p> Neither the Silicon Valley-based company nor its backers are publicly discussing what went wrong , but we 've put together a timeline after speaking with multiple sources : <p> October 2013 : Quixey raises $50 million in Series C funding at around a $130 million pre-money valuation , led by Alibaba . Existing investors like Atlantic Bridge Capital and U.S. Venture Partners also participated . Several months later , Quixey signed a separate $100 million commercial contract with Alibaba ( which could have grown larger depending on implementation with Alibaba partners ) . <p> September 2014 : Alibaba goes public , in the largest tech IPO of all time .

Quixey finds the changes disruptive and does n't believe Alibaba is holding up its end of the monetization bargain . <p> March 2015 : Quixey raises $60 million in Series C-1 funding at a reported pre-money valuation of $540 million . Alibaba again is the lead investor , bringing its total investment in the company to around $80 million . Other new shareholders include Goldman Sachs and SoftBank . <p> April 2016 : Quixey founder Tomer Kagen is replaced as CEO by serial chief executive Mark Lazar ( LoopNet , etc ) , but remains on the board of directors . It appears that Quixey 's displeasure with Alibaba is now mutual , particularly as the burn rate continues to soar and the tech is behind schedule . <p> Summer 2016 : Quixey believes it is owed around $37 million from Alibaba on the commercial contract . Alibaba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agreement have been met . <p> The two sides reach a private settlement whereby Alibaba pays Quixey $10 million in cash and agrees to provide a $30 million secured loan ( the latter of which gets reported , but without specific mention of Alibaba ) . The loan terms include 18-month repayment , a 2.2x liquidation preference and effectively gives Alibaba veto power over future equity investments into Quixey . Alibaba also switched up its board representative , replacing chief strategy officer Zeng Ming with a U.S.-based investment officer named Peter Stern . <p> November 2016 : Mark Lazar is fired as Quixey CEO , and replaced by John Foster ( ex-CEO of Zed USA ) . The company also begins fundraising again . <p> February 2017 : Insiders , led by Atlantic Bridge Capital , agree to effectively recap the company with around $10 million of new equity .

Medicaid " work requirements " are likely to be an element of many of those waiver requests , possibly from Republican-led states now looking to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act . <p> During the Obama administration , HHS rejected mandatory work requirements as inconsistent with the purposes of the Medicaid statute , spurning requests from Arizona , Indiana , and Pennsylvania under a previous governor . Under the Trump presidency , HHS is expected to approve them . <p> Medicaid " work requirements " are not requirements to work in a literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : <p> Able-bodied beneficiaries " people who can work " would have to look for a job , participate in a job training program or go to school , or work full time or part time . <p> People who would be exempt : anyone who can document that they are too sick or disabled to work , have to take care of a sick child or family member , or do not have adequate child care . <p> Liberals find Medicaid work requirements repugnant because they believe that Medicaid beneficiaries want to work if they can , and that providing health coverage to people who can not afford it is an obligation of any moral nation . Conservatives who favor work requirements see Medicaid coverage as another form of government welfare benefit , like cash assistance , requiring reciprocal obligations from beneficiaries , and a disincentive to work . <p> The reality , though , is that most Medicaid beneficiaries are working already , and the vast majority of those who are not working are likely to be exempted from all but the most draconian Medicaid work requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart shows : <p> 59% of all Medicaid beneficiaries who were not on Supplemental Security Income " the program for low-income people with disabilities " were working full time ( 41% ) or part time ( 18% ) in 2015 . <p> That leaves 41% who were not working .

( Lynne Sladky / AP ) <p> Florida Blue , the dominant health insurance company in the state , is still reaping huge profits from its Obamacare plans " a stark difference from the doom and gloom portrayed by other insurers . <p> Florida Blue sits in one of the most competitive Obamacare exchanges and made money on those plans in 2015 . And last year , Florida Blue more than doubled its bottom line by registering a gross profit ( before taxes and other expenses ) of almost $1.1 billion just on its Obamacare plans sold on and off the exchanges , according to financial documents analyzed by Axios . <p> Why this matters : President Trump and Republicans , snakebit after their failed health care reform , keep insisting Obamacare is exploding .

Many insurers like Aetna and UnitedHealth Group have lost money selling Obamacare plans and either have left or are considering leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling marketplace in Arizona has no bearing on what goes on in Florida . <p> Here is how Florida Blue 's finances break down : The company has two main subsidiaries , one that sells plans with broader networks of hospitals and doctors ( the " PPO subsidiary " ) and another that sells products with limited provider networks ( the " HMO subsidiary " ) . These numbers are for 2016 and only represent each subsidiary 's individual-market products : <p> Worth noting : The gross profit represents the premiums minus the medical expenses , and does not include administrative costs , employee compensation or taxes .

In addition , semi-trucks are responsible for an estimated 20% of U.S. carbon emissions in the transportation sector . <p> Gerbrand Ceder , a materials scientist at Cal Berkeley , says in a back-of-the-envelope calculation that a battery capable of powering a long-haul semi-truck for 500 miles on a single charge would cost roughly $70,000 and weigh around three tons . If fast-charging standards are upgraded to account for the trucks , an hour could replenish about 300 miles of range , he said . Fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Math seems to work out . So not as crazy as people claim , " Ceder said in an email exchange . He added , " But it really requires a serious charging network along the interstates . " <p> Here is the breakdown : The lithium-ion battery in an electric Tesla S weighs about 1,200 pounds , a quarter of the car 's 5,000-pound total . But , according to one estimate , the battery in an average 40-ton American semi-truck would have to weigh 23 tons . Consequently , Siemens has suggested powering such a vehicle with overhead wires , not batteries . <p> I emailed Ceder , one of the country 's leading battery materials experts , asking whether Musk could really be serious . <p> He started with an estimate of how much lithium-ion battery capacity would be required to power a truck a single mile . He figured that at 1 mile per kWh , meaning that a 500-mile driving range would require a 500 kWh battery ( a basic Tesla S has a 60 kWh battery ) . ( Note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mpg , when the average truck gets only 6.5 ) . " At 6 kg/kWh , that comes to three thousand kg for the pack , " he said . " So three tons seems a reasonable and conservative estimate for this range . " <p> But what would it cost ? At the cell level , the cost of such batteries currently is about $120 per kWh , he figured , and could drop to $100 . If there are about 70 cells in a battery pack , it would cost $70,000 . <p> As for fuel savings : If a trucker drives 100,000 miles a year and pays about $2.50 a gallon for diesel , fuel costs for a conventional truck would be $25,000 . The electrical equivalent for 100,000 miles is 100,000 kWh .

The SEC disapproved a request to allow the BATS stock exchange to list the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF , which was founded back in 2013 by the Winklevoss Brothers of Facebook ( and The Social Network ) fame .

Many of these sites were instrumental in spreading pro-Trump news during the 2016 elections . Among the findings : <p> Why it matters : Digital technology has made it easier to exploit the political divisions that have always existed . <p> How they profit : Google and Facebook 's algorithmically-driven news distribution platforms have created an environment in which : a ) partisan news sites can easily reach fringe audiences , and b ) news sites are financially incentivized to tilt one way or another . <p> Facebook , in particular , algorithmically favors content that appeals to user bias and interest . According to comScore Vice President Andrew Lipsman , to elicit high engagement and repeat visitation , " sites must usually speak to a very specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit motive that created and helped sustain ideological news sites led to the creation of fake news sites .

And blue-collar unions , including construction and building trades , can be expected to favor of the package , driving a wedge into the Democratic base . <p> What this shows : Trump officials , who originally wanted to flood the Capitol zone with their massive asks , are learning the rhythms of Washington -- playing what White House counselor Kellyanne Conway last night called on Fox News " long ball , long haul .

Ivanka spotlights human trafficking <p> President Trump this afternoon will hold a listening session on domestic and international human trafficking , including women and girls who are sexually exploited for profit . <p> We 're told that the sudden West Wing attention to the issue was driven by Ivanka Trump , the president 's daughter and a huge West Wing force despite her decision not to take an official title at first . <p> Why it matters : White House support for legislation on the issue could emerge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with three senators who 're attending . The effects will also be immediate : Trump is bringing the biggest spotlight in the world to a vital issue that 's too often given short shrift . <p> How the meeting came about : Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell , White House senior counselor for economic initiatives , had a few meetings with some of the groups attending today 's 2:30 p.m. session in the Roosevelt Room . " Ivanka recommended the meeting to the president and he immediately agreed , given what a horrible issue it is in the U.S. and internationally , " a source said . <p> Who 's coming from the Hill : Three Republicans senators who have been longtime advocates on the issue : Rob Portman of Ohio , Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Corker of Tennessee . <p> Who 's coming from the administration : The meeting is likely to include Vice President Pence , who has had a longtime focus on the issue ; representatives of the Justice Department ; plus policy guru Stephen Miller , Dina Powell and Hope Hicks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day <p> " Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever .

" <p> " Even when I found non-Trump news , ... much of it was interleaved with Trump news , so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts . " <p> " It is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now . " <p> Per mediaQuant , " Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together .

There must be something wrong , or there must be something negative . <p> " About 5 percent of what I 'm being asked to do in this White House counselor role is TV . And I think that 's about right .

And it 's a good reminder that the debate over the future of Obamacare has to do with insurance to cover the costs of an industry that operates in a kind of alternate universe compared to the rest of the American economy . <p> That 's why , to help Axios kick off its coverage of the health care economy , I 've done the first research that allows us to see how much the CEOs of the biggest hospital systems got paid for each day a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that let 's us see not just how much they 're making , but how much they 're costing their patients . <p> ( Roth actually was CEO only for the last nine months of the fiscal year 2015 , which ended in September . We 're assuming his salary did n't increase after that . ) <p> Another way to look at Roth 's earnings : It was more than twice the $1,187,000 paid to Peter Salovey , the president of Yale University , which is affiliated with Yale New Haven Health . ( Salovey 's salary reflects a fiscal year ending in June 2015 . ) <p> Salovey is responsible for an organization that has more than 12,000 students spread across its college , graduate schools , research centers and foreign study programs . The university had roughly 10 times the revenue of Greenwich Hospital " and 43% more than the entire Yale New Haven Health System . <p> Roth declined to be interviewed . Dana Marnane , the hospital 's vice president for public relations , said that Roth 's earnings in the report for 2015 fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of longevity bonuses and deferred compensation . But many CEOs enjoy those same bonuses , which is why the IRS , and the SEC for publicly-held corporations , require disclosure of total annual compensation . <p> Marnane also declined to put the " big chunk " in perspective by revealing what Roth 's total earnings were for 2016 , which does not yet have to be publicly reported . In the year before Roth took the job , his predecessor earned $1,421,000 , or $27.51 for every night someone stayed in his hospital , which is still the highest per-patient-day payout I have ever seen other than Roth 's . <p> I first noticed Roth 's outsized pay when I started looking at the alternate universe that is the American health care economy , in which everyone from executives to equipment sales people to PR teams gets paid much more than those in other sectors for jobs of seemingly commensurate responsibility . <p> For example , as at Yale , most major university presidents , their chief fundraising officers , and other executives -- who work in a non-profit sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees down -- are paid substantially less than chief executives and other key executives at the hospital they are affiliated with . <p> The exceptions are those who actually provide the health care . In 2015 , physician incomes increased just 3.1% at the same time that hospital CEO salaries increased an average of 8.2% , according to the trade publication Modern Healthcare . <p> How we did this study : So I 've put together a chart that I 've always wanted to see . I 've merged data about hospital operations , including patient beds and total patient days , from the American Hospital Directory with information filed with the IRS on what non-profit hospitals pay their bosses . The result is a list of the reported annual payouts to the CEOs of the 20 largest hospital systems ( ranked by number of hospitals in their systems ) divided by the annual number of patient days recorded at each hospital . <p> In other words , we can see how much the CEOs of the biggest hospital systems got paid for each day a patient spent in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative scope of responsibilities of each CEO , because it 's basically a measure of the number of patients served in each hospital and the extent of that service . <p> You 'll see that the numbers for the big hospital systems vary widely , although none match Mr. Roth 's payout . <p> The sweepstakes winner among the CEOs of the 20 largest hospital systems is Patrick Fry , of giant Northern California-based Sutter Health . He was paid $6.88 per patient day . <p> That 's multiples less than Roth 's $56.40 , which reflects the fact that Fry 's organization served so many more patients " it provided 18 times as many patient days . But it 's well above the average or median for the CEOs of the top 20 . <p> Fry retired as CEO at the end of 2015 . Sutter spokeswoman Kami Lloyd declined to tell me how he could be reached for comment , or to make the new CEO , Sarah Krevans , available . <p> Another spokesperson , Karen Garner , pointed out that some of Fry 's pay included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " The use of patient days , alone , is not a solid basis for comparison . We are working hard to reduce patient days . " <p> She 's right . No metric provides a perfect measure for comparing CEO responsibilities . But total patient days provided in a year seems to be a good way to compare the relative scope of responsibilities of each CEO because it 's basically a measure of the number of patients served in each hospital and the extent of that service . <p> Still , it does n't account for the fact that all of these hospital systems have vast and rapidly expanding outpatient services and other operations , including walk-in clinics , labs , and physician practices . To the extent that some systems do relatively more outpatient work than others , using patient days will yield a skewed result . <p> Indeed , a CEO at a hospital that is effective in economizing by substituting outpatient treatments for overnight admissions , or by getting patients released sooner , will be " penalized " by these measures . <p> Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . <p> A second caveat : The years in this chart often do not match exactly because the American Hospital Directory patient day data is typically more current ( for 2015 ) than the CEO salary filings . Because of lags in the hospitals ' public filings with the IRS , many of the salaries are for 2014 ( or in the case of Dignity Health , 2013 ) , or for a fiscal year that is midway through 2015 . <p> But , if anything , that lag in salary data probably understates the chief executives ' pay for each patient day , because he or she would likely have gotten a raise the following year . <p> Sensitive subject : In many places , the CEO of these tax-exempt non-profits is the highest paid executive in town . And as hospital CEO salaries have continued to rise , they have become a touchy subject even for those whose relative earnings are the least generous . <p> One example : Richard Gilfillan , who runs Livonia , Michigan-based Trinity Health , earns 75 cents per patient day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity spokeswoman Eve Pidgeon said her boss would also decline comment " although she added that his reaction when she told him he was lowest on the totem pole was , " That 's great . " <p> The other hospitals : It 's also worth a look at a few of the hospitals that are n't in the top 20 " including Greenwich , since Roth 's pay is so high , and some of the country 's most well-known medical centers . <p> Despite these inconsistencies , the boards of major hospitals and hospital systems always offer the same explanation in their IRS filing of how they determine executive compensation . They say they examine a variety of financial and quality of care metrics , which are then used by one of the small network of compensation consulting firms that work for hospitals to recommend salaries by comparing the executive to his or her peer group . It 's always about the peer group . <p> Yet , as Berkshire Hathaway 's Warren Buffet has frequently complained , compensation consultants more often seem to be used to rationalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How else could these wide variations be explained ? <p> Why would John Noseworthy , who runs the acclaimed Mayo Clinic Health System , be paid only $3.01 per patient day , while Steven Sayfer , who runs the Bronx-based Montefiore system gets $7.14 ? And why does Toby Cosgrove , the revered CEO of the Cleveland Clinic , get $4.26 while Thomas Priselac of Los Angeles-based Cedars Sinai earns $13.99 ? <p> Are Noseworthy and Cosgrove not Priselac 's peers ? <p> Through a spokesperson , Priselac declined an interview request . Cedars ' only explanation for the huge variation in salaries : After being told about where her boss ranked compared to Noseworthy and Cosgrove , spokesperson Sally Stewart said the hospital board determines compensation based on " a rigorous review of each position 's responsibilities and comparisons with other organizations for positions with similar responsibilities " and that " this review goes well beyond @qwx197533 @qwx197445 @qwx197475 @qwx197515 @qwx197505

The whole point of the amendment is to let states write their own rules on those . <p> The amendment does have limits : people with pre-existing conditions could n't be denied coverage , they 'd just be charged more , but only if they lived in states that got waivers and they did n't keep themselves insured , plus the state has to have a high-risk pool . Try explaining that at the next town hall . <p> But if moderates reject the compromise , they 'll be the target of conservative groups that have already accused them of standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this is Rep.

It 's Centene , which has about 1.2 million ACA customers . That 's not as many as Anthem , but it 's close . If Centene had left , 90,000 people in Mississippi would have had no insurers providing ACA coverage , as Bob reported last month . <p> What 's next : Will Anthem stay ? They 're the big one right now " if they go , 255,000 people in Colorado , Kentucky , Missouri and Ohio wo n't have any options for ACA coverage .

@@13013439 @1613439/ <h> The recent explosion of right-wing news sites <p> Axios mapped the launch date of 89 news websites over the past quarter century . The data shows there has been an explosion of right-leaning news sites , coinciding with the rise of the Tea Party and alt-right movements beginning in 2010 . Many of these sites , in turn , were instrumental in spreading pro-Trump news during the 2016 elections . <p> The data also shows a similar rise in left-leaning news sites during the Bush Administration and the launch of the Iraq war in 2003 . Overall , while there has been a large increase in the number of new news sites over the past 20 years , almost all of them have a partisan angle . <p> Why it matters : According to experts , digital technology has made it easier to exploit the political divisions that have always existed .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one in which this is profitable , and profit is the driving force .

According to comScore Vice President Andrew Lipsman , to elicit high engagement and repeat visitation , " sites must usually speak to a very specific audience .

Vince Coglianese , editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller , which launched in 2010 , said the founders , Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel , started the site because they saw a tremendous market opportunity where a conservative news site could report on news with a different form of selection bias .

But their next chance is the short-term spending bill due at the end of April " which is already almost certain to be mired in a fight over Planned Parenthood funding and money to build a wall along the southern border . The subsidies could get added to that spending bill , but " only if insurers agree not to abandon the market in the next couple weeks , " a senior GOP aide told me . And the payments could lead to a fight among Republicans , in addition to their likely battles over Planned Parenthood and the wall . <p> This is all the legacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running Obamacare " long before the White House changed hands . <p> Oops : Even before Trumpcare 's failure , GOP aides acknowledged that the lawsuit seemed like a better idea at the time than it does now .

These are payments made to insurers to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income enrollees . <p> While insurers clearly must pass along the help to enrollees by law , Republicans have argued Congress never actually gave the Obama administration the money for the program that 's being used to pay insurers . A district court judge has sided with them , but the Obama administration appealed the case . It was delayed in February and is currently on hold , with an update due in May . <p> What this all comes down to : If the Trump administration stops fighting the case and the payments stop , insurers will lose $10 billion next year , according to a recent Congressional Budget Office report . Insurers are already having a hard time on the individual market , and a $10 billion loss could easily be enough to convince those still participating to leave at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural flaws in Obamacare , and insurers made errors in setting premiums .

But this is politically risky : People have a tendency to blame their problems on those in charge , and many people would surely lose coverage or see massive premium increases if the GOP goes this route . <p> The problem : Conservatives want to keep trying to repeal Obamacare , and appropriating the money could be dubbed as giving up .

There was a mistaken report that Khosla Ventures had invested , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account ( that said , a source tells me that KV did submit a term sheet , but got beaten out by eventual deal lead Initialized Capital ) . Other Rippling investors include SV Angel and Y Combinator . <p> The case for Conrad : The pro-Parker argument is essentially that he has learned from his mistakes , and that the mistakes actually were n't as awful as they were made out to be . On that latter point , one sympathetic source says that the so-called " macro " software , which let brokers-to-be basically sleep through some of their required licensing " hours , " did not allow such individuals to skip or cheat on the actual quizzes or examinations . It would be like sleeping through driver 's ed , certifying that you were awake and then taking/passing the driving test .

That may not be a problem , given the interest in this round , but a lot of VCs may think twice . It 's one thing to invest in a founder who later does something problematic .

That way , consumers would have more options , including cheaper plans . <p> Between the lines : It 's not clear how seriously the new idea has been vetted , we 're told , especially with insurers .

After years of attacking Obamacare 's industry taxes and other funding sources , the GOP is running out of ways to pay for their replacement plan without using the options they 've criticized so heavily in the past . <p> The first red flag came last week , when key committee chairmen threw their support behind repealing the Obamacare taxes along with the law 's subsidies and mandates . This would immediately gut revenue that could be used later to pay for a replacement plan . <p> Now , powerful lobbyists are trying to knock out another big source of money : the GOP plan to limit the tax break for employer health coverage . If both funding sources go , there 's not much money left for an Obamacare replacement . <p> The lobbying behemoth opposing Obamacare 's " Cadillac tax , " which is aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit the tax breaks for employer-sponsored insurance benefits . The group , the Alliance to Fight the 40 , says the two ideas are essentially the same except for one key difference : The tax would only indirectly be paid by employees , while the limit on the tax breaks would come directly out of their pockets . <p> If those lobbyists are successful , it could be a problem , budget wonks say " because Republicans wo n't have any money left for a replacement plan if they lose all of the Obamacare taxes and do n't generate any new ones . " This is a big deal , " said Ed Lorenzen , a senior adviser at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . <p> Quick refresher : <p> Obamacare taxes are paid by insurers , medical device manufacturers and drug companies . There 's also a tax on high-income households . Together , these would bring in about $680 billion over ten years , according to the Brookings Institution . <p> Obamacare 's " Cadillac tax " is aimed at unusually generous employer health plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets passed on to employees . <p> A cap on tax-exempt employer benefits effectively means that the tax break only covers up to a certain amount , and then the employees pay taxes on the rest . <p> In both cases , the goal is the same : increase federal revenue and control health care costs . <p> Why the cap is in trouble : The Alliance is unquestionably effective . Two years ago , it fought hard against the Cadillac tax and won a two-year delay : Congress pushed back its implementation from 2018 to 2020 . Almost every Republican in Congress came out in opposition to the tax , and many Democrats also had issues with it . The group is now going to make the case that a vote against the Cadillac tax should be a vote against a cap . <p> The employer benefit cap is a large source of revenue in a Republican replacement plan , although how much it saves depends on where the threshold is set . Yet even Paul Ryan , who has included a cap in his own health reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP health plan last week : " Where Congress goes on this is an open question , " he said during his weekly press conference . <p> The link to the populism that elected Trump is pretty obvious . Taxing premiums will increase deductibles and cost-sharing for workers , the Alliance says , which is something polling has shown is the opposite of what Americans want . <p> Why the Obamacare taxes are in trouble : While some Republicans have said they 're nervous about repealing the taxes because of the budgetary issues down the road , they may be on the losing side of the battle . Sen. Orrin Hatch , chairman of the powerful Finance Committee , said in a Chamber of Commerce address last week that " all of the Obamacare taxes need to go as part of the repeal process . " <p> Why it matters : If a GOP plan has no taxes or limit on tax breaks for those insured by their employer , then only about 40 percent of the funding for Obamacare 's coverage expansion would be available for the replacement plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to significantly reduce the amount of people covered or the benefits offered , unless they find a different way to pay for it . <p> Wonks are n't the only ones pointing this out ; Democrats are too .

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state-run news agency Sputnik that president Putin regards the attacks on Syria as " an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of the norms of international law , and under a trumped-up pretext at that .

Aides quit trying to show him tapes of previous debates while getting ready for the next one , because he would only focus on himself " and always applauded what he saw . Chuck Todd , moderator of " Meet The Press , " noted that Trump used to replay his appearances on the Sunday shows " without sound " like a quarterback reviewing game film .

" We hear that women who worked in Trump 's campaign field offices " folks who spend more time knocking on doors than attending glitzy events " felt pressure to wear dresses to impress Trump . <p> Staff knew Trump would be hacked off at press secretary Sean Spicer for not dressing fancy enough for his first briefing-room appearance .

These two people occupy opposite sides of the president 's brain and impulses . Bannon is the guy goading Trump to go scorched Earth on the media and reminding him of his hardline campaign promises . Ivanka pushes gentler tones and more liberal lines . Caught in the middle of this war for bandwith is the president . <p> Tuesday night 's speech was the first time Trump 's Yin and Yang was on full display . The core of the speech was the issues on which Trump built his campaign : trade , immigration and national security . On these the Trump-Bannon worldview remains unchanged and is being pursued almost to the letter . <p> But the speech also had a softer side : the environment , childcare , women 's health and female entrepreneurship . These are Ivanka 's projects . The President has encouraged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his image . <p> The praise heaped on Tuesday 's speech shows the power of these two sides working together , the Bannon agenda packaged with Ivanka polish . If over time Trump can stick to that ( and that 's a huge if ) , Trump 's upside might be higher than people think . But if he ca n't , the perception and reality of herky-jerky chaos will reign . <p> Why it might work : Bannon has been able to stay personally close to Ivanka Trump while being in her father 's orbit because their influences on the president " Bannon 's hardline , Ivanka 's moderation " have n't collided on the issues . The reality is that for the time being Bannon and Ivanka are n't clashing . They 're personally close and their differences are more tonal than substantive . As a nationalist , Bannon believes it 's the duty of nation states to look after their people . He loves her childcare plan and could care less about her stance on LGBT issues . And on the issues where Bannon is uncompromising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't especially engaged . <p> Some key issues : <p> The media : Trump loves fighting with the press , so he hardly needs much encouragement here , and Bannon has helped put a framework " an extreme one " around the President 's hostility . Bannon calls the media the " opposition party " and both he and Trump embrace the " enemy " language that makes so many other Republicans uncomfortable . Ivanka has been silent on the issue . <p> LGBT rights:According to Politico , Jared and Ivanka " helped lead the charge to scuttle a draft executive order that would have overturned Obama-era enforcements of LGBT rights in the workplace . " In doing so , they irritated some influential people on the Christian Right . Bannon is n't interested in this issue . <p> China : Few in America noticed this move , but it was all over Chinese social media . Ivanka took her 5-year-old daughter Arabella , who is learning to speak Mandarin , to the Chinese embassy in Washington to celebrate the Lunar New Year . Bannon 's economic nationalism sees China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to square social calls on China with planning for economic conflict with them . <p> Environment : Bannon is behind the Trump budget 's gutting of the regulatory state , in particular the EPA . Trump has already signed executive orders rolling back environmental rules . Ivanka encouraged and helped arrange Trump 's meeting with Al Gore and , according to the Wall Street Journal , she and her husband Jared Kushner pushed to remove language critical of the 2015 global climate deal from an upcoming executive order . This might be the starkest point of contention between the two . <p> What this creates : A quiet , constant wrestle for the tone of the presidency , if not its substance .

But one thing has become clear since Obamacare 's exchanges and Medicaid expansion went into effect in 2014 : the health care industry has hired a lot of people to care for those populations and the aging baby boomers , and hospitals accounted for a lot of those new jobs . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 259,200 jobs in 2014 <p> 438,800 jobs in 2015 <p> 296,400 jobs in 2016 <p> The problem : The new hires have started to take a financial toll on the hospitals .

Even GOP aides acknowledge that . <p> Which means yes , the Republican bill is making major spending and revenue reforms within the existing Obamacare regulatory system . And that 's what has conservatives so upset .

They ca n't touch the regulatory policies that have conservatives so up in arms . <p> The backlash : " The challenge is the regulatory system is the heart of Obamacare , " Dan Holler , a vice president of Heritage Action for America , told me . " The rest was , how can you support this regulatory regime and make sure people can afford coverage ? " <p> With the regulatory provisions still in place , Holler said , Republicans are now the ones in " the position of figuring out how you get subsidies flowing out the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health wonks agree with the far-right .

Behind the scenes , he 's confronting , and in some cases succumbing ( slightly ) to , the hard truths of governing and leading a world that hangs on his every word . <p> When we went to interview him in his office in Trump Tower on Tuesday , 72 hours before he takes office , we expected the emphatic showman who was on display through the campaign , and as recently as last week 's press conference . <p> Instead we found the incoming president unusually subdued : lowering expectations , acknowledging some of the messy realities of governing , and walking back some of the more provocative statements he had made only days before . A top adviser told us the sober tone reflects a bumpy few days inside Trump Tower " and the realization that he 's days away from truly running the nation . <p> Trump said health care is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with President Obama again on Monday about the topic . He back-tracked a bit from his promise of insurance for everybody , saying he wanted to find a mechanism " Medicaid block grants , perhaps " to help the poorest get insurance .

We ca n't have that , " he said . <p> On Friday , he told The Wall Street Journal that border-adjustment , a vital part of the House Republicans ' corporate tax-reform plan , was " too complicated .

While Pai and Republicans in Congress have long argued the Lifeline program needs reform to cut waste and fraud , they have n't yet laid out a roadmap for how they 'll change it . <p> Adding a budget cap : In 2015 , as the FCC headed toward expanding the program to cover internet service , Pai said the agency should have considered placing a cap on the program 's budget of $1.6 billion to align with spending on the subsidies that year .

That 's echoed in Congress . Marsha Blackburn , who now chairs the House subcommittee on Communications issues , wrote with O'Rielly in 2015 that " the program must be better targeted to eligible low-income individuals who would not otherwise sign up for service . " <p> The counterpoint : Jessica Gonzalez , Deputy Director and Senior Counsel at advocacy group Free Press , said that restricting subsidies could cause trouble for poor people who are stretched thin financially . " When you 're right on that line , you 're making hard decisions , " she said . <p> Asking subscribers to contribute : Pai floated the idea in 2015 of " requiring Lifeline subscribers to pitch in as a condition of getting service . " ( It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the commission voted to expand the subsidy to broadband . ) O'Reilly has also backed the idea of a minimum contribution . <p> The counterpoint : Gonzalez said that requiring even a small contribution would push some Lifeline recipients into making tough spending choices .

But he 's also been vocal about the need to lower deductibles and out of pocket spending , echoing the populist outcry over health care costs . <p> But health savings accounts are tied to high-deductible plans " and that 's deliberate , because the idea is to make consumers take more responsibility for their health care spending . Greater use of the savings accounts " runs counter to Trump 's talk about lower deductibles and out of pocket expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Responsible Federal Budget , tells Axios . <p> In fact , Lanhee Chen , a conservative health care expert and a member of the Axios board of outside experts , said he did n't believe lower out of pocket costs will be a focus of any of the Obamacare replacement plans . " They all look to create greater incentives around consumer cost containment " and that , by nature , generally means lower-premium , higher deductible plans , " he said . <p> What they are : Health savings accounts are special , tax-preferred accounts to be used for health care spending . They 're always tied to a high-deductible insurance plan . There 's a limit on how much people can put into them , but that amount is tax deductible . <p> Republican proposals generally raise the contribution limit , make it easier to have and contribute to the accounts , and loosen the rules about what the accounts can be used for .

But no president has been more obsessed with every form of it , from traditional cable shows to , of course , Twitter . Trump 's tactics could serve as clues as to how his administration will oversee and influence different forms of media over the next four years . <p> Social Media : Trump learned early that his feisty comments spread like wildfire on Facebook and he could reach millions directly on Twitter . He arguably benefited from conservative criticism of Facebook 's editorial leanings and the fake news controversy that the company is scrambling to address . Son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner reportedly told a crowd of business executives that Google and Facebook are now much more powerful than outlets like CNN and The New York Times . <p> What to expect : The government does n't oversee online content " that 's called the First Amendment " and Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media ( 42 million followers and growing ) to push his agenda . Google and Facebook are taking steps to reduce the amount of fake news swirling on their platforms , and lawmakers have so far left it to the companies to sort out . But the controversy is far from over . <p> Tech companies are wary of Trump 's policies , from possible changes to the high-skilled worker visa program and corporate tax laws to interference with mergers and data-related requirements . <p> Trump 's camp is aware of Silicon Valley 's disdain for him , and they have n't forgotten how hard some tech execs worked to defeat him in November . He 's acknowledged some giants ' dominance and has hinted he 'd like to see more competition . <p> There is a faction inside the White House , including chief strategist Steve Bannon , who do not have a romantic view of Silicon Valley and want to find ways to punish companies that create wealth , not jobs , or move too many jobs overseas . <p> Cable : He 's addicted to MSNBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his sharp criticism of its coverage , and enjoys frequent Fox News appearances . He 's proven to be deft at exploiting these relationships to shape the news , and he has plenty of experience striking deals with media executives . But that also gives him power to influence media merger outcomes . A major test will be AT&amp;T 's $85 billion proposed takeover of Time Warner , which Trump has vowed to block . <p> What to expect : Some industry insiders chalked up the hostility as retribution for CNN 's campaign coverage . But a personal grudge against CNN wo n't stand as sound rationale for blocking the deal . Trump 's antitrust advisors on the transition team " Joshua Wright and David Higbee " both have business-friendly views on competition policy and told AT&amp;T the deal would get a fair shake from regulators . And Attorney General nominee Sen.

( This may be tricky , as the FCC is an independent agency . ) <p> TV Stations : Trump 's fond of shaming outlets over unfavorable press . To get better media coverage during the campaign , Trump 's camp reportedly struck a deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group to give its stations more access in exchange for more even coverage . Local TV stations are a crucial avenue to swing-state markets that helped him get elected , and he 'll want to make sure he can get his message to these viewers . <p> What to expect : TV stations have to abide by certain standards to maintain their broadcasting license from the FCC . Trump 's FCC is unlikely to have the grounds to revoke licenses , but can use its bully pulpit to try to shape broadcaster 's behavior . That alone would get a lot of attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , broadcasters have deep relationships with Washington Republicans " incoming House Energy &amp; Commerce Chairman Greg Walden used to be one " so they can breathe easy in other areas ( like restrictions on joint sales agreements and cross-ownership ) where the FCC is likely to take a de-regulatory approach . <p> Newspapers : Trump is a tabloid junkie , a master at pitting papers against each other and bad-mouthing coverage he does n't like . On the campaign trail , he threatened to " open up libel laws so when publications write purposely negative and horrible and false articles , we can sue them and win lots of money . " And , if his transparency record this far is any indication ( Exhibit A : tax returns ) , Trump will likely be hostile to the Freedom of Information Act , the most powerful tool for accessing government documents . <p> What to expect : Chances of Trump blowing up libel or FOIA laws are slim . Loosening libel laws and its protections for press writing about public figures would require overturning a 1964 Supreme Court decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be repealed by Congress , and there is little appetite for that . <p> Still , Trump can keep using his bag of tricks : threaten to sue publications that are critical of him and find ways around releasing information -- all the while getting more coverage and , ironically driving big newspaper subscriptions in the process . <p> He 'll continue to call out reporters he feels are trying to undermine him , calling coverage " fake news " when it suits him .

Lemme know what 's on your mind . And please urge your friends , family and colleagues to join the breakfast conversation by hitting this one-click sign-up . <p> 1 . The 1 thing <p> Pause for a second : The past year has been so absurd , so blow-your-mind unpredictable that we are almost numb to tectonic shifts in our politics and behavior . <p> Think about the half day of madness that started when BuzzFeed posted , in full , an unsubstantiated , one-source memo , funded by partisans , that claimed acts -- too disgusting to print -- by the man a week from the Oval Office : <p> This sets Twitter afire and prompts an all-caps Trump tweet about FAKE NEWS . Then , in a scene unprecedented in U.S. history , the incoming president starts his first press conference in 24 weeks with his incoming White House press secretary unloading on reporters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then , with stage props and clapping staff , the president charges CNN , which DID N'T post the memo , with purveying " Fake News , " prompting CNN correspondent Jim Acosta to shout question after question ( while NPR 's Mara Liasson , who had been called on , tried to talk ) in a manner never seen under the last two presidents . <p> Reporters arrived as early as 7 a.m. to get seats at the 11 o'clock presser . By 9:30 , when Maggie Haberman and I got there , it was standing room only . A Russian reporter taped a standup from the seats down front , and a Russian behind me kept hollering at Trump even after the elevator doors had closed behind him . <p> Trump , rhetorically more measured than during his campaign , went on to explain he was turning his business over to his sons , bucking a decades-old tradition of cutting all biz ties . <p> " I hope at the end of eight years ! , " Trump said as his closing line , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a good job . ' Otherwise , if they do a bad job , I 'll say , ' You 're fired . ' " <p> Be smart : The show overshadowed the substance . Trump admitted Russia hacked Dems , announced his V.A . secretary , endorsed repeal-and-replace , and said Supreme Court nominee " probably within two weeks " of inauguration . <p> 2 . The power of Trump 's words <p> At one point the NINE fastest-falling stocks on the S&amp;P 500 were drug companies after he said he wants to " create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they 're getting away with murder . " <p> Trump previously moved markets with attacks on auto and defense companies . <p> After he said the government will " save billions of dollars " by forcing drug companies to bid for government business , he added : " And we 're going to do that with a lot of other industries . " <p> Jon Steinberg , founder and CEO of Cheddar TV , told me that going into the day , he thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the presser weighed on the index . It still closed up 98 points . You have to imagine that without the pharma comment we would have gotten the 50 more points to break the 20k level . " <p> 3 . A story that will never go away <p> Trump 's decision to keep his global empire under the full control of his sons promises to spark controversy throughout his presidency . No doubt , he threw up some walls : There will be no foreign deals by his son , an ethics adviser to monitor any fishy deals , and no formal or informal role for DJT . But he 's not doing what those before have by fully divesting or simply tossing his assets into a blind trust . <p> The Wall Street Journal has a smart example of the many possible conflicts this will present : " Trump 's financial disclosures said he received $1 million to $5 million from his licensing deal with the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Panama .

It 's achieving this not because it 's a better place to do business than New York and San Francisco , but because it 's cheaper and more livable . Read on to learn why Chattanooga is the quintessential " Red America " success story , and why it will be a constant struggle to maintain : <p> Manufacturing Renaissance : Manufacturing employment has grown in Chattanooga by 19.2% since 2010 , vs. 8% for the nation as a whole .

Jed Kolko , an economist with Indeed.com , finds that Chattanooga has the third-largest share of jobs that are threatened by automation , defined as " those that can be accomplished by following explicit rules . " These include both manual routine occupations like metalworking and service-related jobs such as cashiers . <p> Government handouts : Chattanooga has attracted employers like Volkswagen in part with generous subsidies like tax abatements and free land .

Ken McElrath , CEO of enterprise software firm Skuid , says the fiber optic network is one reason he moved his company there from Phoenix , Arizona . <p> Cheap housing , livable cities : Chattanooga is also part of a southeast region that is growing rapidly at the expense of the northeast and California . Despite the popular narrative that America is going through an urban renaissance , it 's actually small cities , particularly in the southeast , and the outer suburbs of larger cities that are growing the fastest . That 's in part because these places offer affordable housing for young , first-time homebuyers . <p> Unchanging demographics : Chattanooga also happens to look a lot like America did demographically in the 1950s " that is , younger , @qwx197533 @qwx197445 @qwx197475 @qwx197515 @qwx197505
