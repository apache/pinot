Counting everyday objects ( stairs , blocks , snacks ) is a fun beginning . Some toddlers may even repeat a few numbers or memorize a sequence of numbers , though this is usually by rote , rather than a true understanding of numbers or counting . This is the numerical equivalent of singing the ABCs and can be boosted by learning a counting song .

Their father had taken the day off for back-to-school shopping , having loved this ritual as a kid , and he just assumed his kids would , likewise . He was shocked when they turned him down . Abby : " I just do n't want to get ready yet , Dad . If you think it 's so fun , you can go yourself . " <h> What 's the Worry ? <p> Your kids are balancing a seesaw of emotions right now . If they 've had a typical summer , they 've grown both physically and emotionally , mastered new skills , thrived from summer 's freedom and space , and taken some risks that earned them bruises , self-regard , or both . But as Abby and Kirk vividly demonstrated , feelings also can be mixed about heading back . <p> They 're excited about the new leaf/fresh start , new teacher/new friend combos . But they are also worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them across the Labor Day divide . Academic stuff that does n't come quite as easily as it seems to for others , social pecking-order scars , and worries that mom and dad will be watching like hawks ( vultures ? ) again . Still , most kids keep their balance nicely with the help of childhood 's inherent hope and fresh confidence that this will be a good year . <h> Parents Need to Prepare , Too . <p> Parents are often surprised by the intensity of what they themselves feel about this mass migration . Bittersweet seems to be the taste of it . We are pleased " even proud " that our kids can still scrub up pretty good , and reassured that their optimism still peeks out for some fresh air . But we , too , worry that success will not quite be their brass ring this year . Yes , our kids are growing like weeds , and they need us less every year at the gate of the schoolyard . Yet as they seek less reassurance from us , we begin to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important thing we 'll ever do in this world , and that can sting . We might even feel a twinge of envy as they step into a new chapter of their lives ; in comparison , our plans for fall seem threadbare . <p> Their worries , added to ours , can be a powerful mix . Typically these just stay worries , and a little worry can be useful . It mobilizes our wits , skills , and cunning . Research into motivation and problem-solving abilities tells us that it is not the size or nature of the problem faced by a child , nor her age , gender , or family history that predicts how she 'll do when faced with a challenge . The most important single predictor of mastery is the child 's belief that she can handle it , whatever it is . So a little worry about whether she can handle school this year is a healthy form of worry , as long as it stays a worry and not an avalanche . And that is exactly where parents come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the " stuff " in her to do okay ; and <p> 2 ) reminding her of past challenges she 's faced and mastered . <p> The child 's own belief that it will work out gets a strong assist from these reassurances . <h> How Parents Can Ease the Return to School <p> Gradually reinstate the rituals of everyday school life ( bedtime , TV schedules , quiet time , self-care ) over the week before and the first weeks after the start of school ; this is a transition , not a collision . <p> Talk to your kids about what they are feeling about heading back , and listen , do n't simply wait for your turn at the pulpit . If you have some similar mixed memories of school-return , share them as part of a conversation , not a scripture reading . If not , learn from their experience . <p> Be honest with yourself about turning up the heat under your child 's own internal pressure cooker . Talk this out with other adults . It 's not your kid 's problem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own experience of school . <p> Meet your child 's teacher early and often . Research shows that good collaboration between parent and teacher helps kids at every turn of this road trip . If you 've got ideas or concerns , teachers usually want to hear them sooner rather than later , so they can do something proactive to help . <p> Renew your mind and spirit through some intellectual or creative interest that you 've always wanted to do ( or get back to ) . Even in small doses , this can be revitalizing . It 's also a great thing to model for your children .

Establishing a regular reading routine gives your child a special time to look forward to each day . <p> Let your child set the pace . The best way to foster a love of reading is to focus on the parts of the book that are most interesting for your child . Sometimes your child will want to go slow , and other times fast . Sometimes your child may want to start in the middle of the book , or just look at favorite pages . Other times your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds and sights on a single page . <p> Keep your childs attention span in mind . At this age , your baby can pay attention for only a short time , so she may not listen to a story from beginning to end without interruption .

Do n't  worry very much about how you read . The idea is to share the story and enjoy the experience together . Just being close to you and hearing your voice creates a comforting environment for your child . <p> Be a role model . In the early months , your child communicates by imitating you .

When your child latches on to a favorite story , you 'll know it . Repeating the same story over and over again provides your child with more chances to learn the words , understand the story and develop long-term memory skills . Read that all-too-familiar book with enthusiasm , and pay attention to how much more your child knows each time you do .

A bit shy by nature , he waited until my older daughters were elsewhere , and I was in the water to catch him . On his first attempt , he threw his arms around my neck and whispered into my ear , " Hold me tighter ! " When I later related this story to our assembled family , my nephew chastised me : " Uncle Kyle , I told you not to tell ! " Although he actually had n't , the message was clear : do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My heart sank . Here was a wonderful young boy ashamed that he feels or needs something perfectly okay to need and feel .

Is it because boys are naturally tougher ? The reason is precisely the opposite . Boys are more vulnerable from the beginning to the end of life . The male fetus is at greater risk of death , infection and medical complication at birth . By six weeks of age , boys have begun to fall behind girls developmentally . During their early years , they are more susceptible to poor parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and boys are four times more likely to die by suicide .

I suspect a growing causative link between boys ' stronger potential for violence , paternal abandonment and the way we as parents , teachers and society collude with our boys ' " need to be boys " before they become fully socialized . <h> Suggestions to parents of boys of all ages : <p> Talk to your son about the connection between feelings and behavior . Teach him that he is more out of control when he is upset and that it is more comfortable when he feels understood or close to people he loves and likes . This gives him permission to have a living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Give him opportunities to be physically active . Using large muscles is how boys work out their action potential , and it settles them to bounce off the walls , ground and each other . Sports can be an effective outlet provided they are well-coached and socially responsible about participation and competition . <p> Start early to encourage and model as much physical and emotional affection as you can . This helps boys feel better about their less aggressive interpersonal needs . <p> Do n't let your son slip into silent mode without supportive and regular challenge to this behavior . Make him talk to you rather than allowing him to slip into the " fortress of solitude " as described in Raising Cain by Dan Kindlon and Mike Thompson ( Ballantine Books , 2000 ) . <p> Maintain high expectations that your son will continue to develop the inborn abilities in empathy that he demonstrated as a toddler .

In order for your child to learn how to brush properly , it helps for parents or siblings to act as role models . Try brushing your teeth alongside your little one , or enlisting the help of your older children , to demonstrate the proper order of brushing , rinsing , and spitting . The spitting part may not come as naturally to young children as swallowing . That 's why we recommend starting off with a smear of fluoride toothpaste for children less than 3 years of age , followed by a pea-size amount for those 3-6 years old . This will help ensure that your child does not swallow too much fluoride .

Some toddlers are too busy to sit and eat and instead like to graze ; they will pick up finger foods if you leave them accessible near where you are playing together .

She loves to cook , bake , garden , sew , quilt , teach and simply spend time with her family . She strives to find art in everyday things . <p> The good news about building Vocabulary &amp; Oral Language skills in preparation for kindergarten is it 's really FUN ! Two of the best things you can do are to allow time for free play and to spend time talking and reading with your child . <h> Play-based learning <p> Children build vocabulary and oral language skills doing many of the things they love to do : drawing , playding with dolls and stuffed animals , playing with cars , building with blocks , dressing up , and playing pretend in a kitchen or home center . The language and conversation kids use during these play times provide a strong literacy base for a child entering kindergarten . The type of dialog that children use while playing in a home center will be very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so having a variety of activities for your child to choose from will encourage a broad range of vocabulary words incorporated into their daily play . As you are playing with your child , or observing their play , use language and vocabulary that will help them grow . Identify and explain the uses for different objects in the kitchen and use interesting language when playing with stuffed animals and dolls . Young children are like sponges , ready to soak up the language around them ! <h> Conversations count <p> Spending time engaged in conversation during your shared experiences will also help build vocabulary and oral language . Taking walks , going for bike rides , heading to the park , flying a kite , cooking together , visiting a farm or petting zoo , and even raising pets at home can all be terrific experiences for kids and give you lots to talk about . Be sure to talk to your child throughout these day-to-day experiences , using language that helps them grow in their vocabulary development . Too often parents , teachers , and caregivers will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain things to your child , using words within their developmental level , it 's also important to remember that kids can handle a lot more than we give them credit for . When you 're cooking with your child , ask them to get the measuring cup instead of calling it a scooper . They may have never heard that term before , but suddenly it becomes part of their vocabulary . <h> Thematic explorations <p> Exploring passion topics such as gardening , studying rocks , planets , trees or animals can be incredibly engaging for young children . By simply finding something they are interested in , and setting up some learning experiences , children may be naturally drawn to explore and learn more . Do the birds come back to your yard when the weather warms up ? Set up a basket with binoculars , books about birds , and pictures of birds that live in your area . If your child is truly interested in this topic , the questions will start flowing and it becomes another great opportunity for vocabulary development . <h> Poetry &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engaging for young children , but they also contribute to the foundational skills young children need in their oral language development . They will begin to hear rhyming words and be able to predict the words that are coming next in a song . When singing songs , children will learn how to articulate words and will practice pronouncing words over and over while having fun . Nursery Rhymes also provide a great opportunity for conversation with your child . Talk about how Jack and Jill might have been feeling and ask what they think happened after Jack and Jill tumbled down the hill . Spending time acting out different songs and rhymes will also help children internalize the meanings of different words they are hearing . While a child may be new to the word tumbled , they will certainly remember the meaning after playing around and tumbling across some pillows ( an imaginary hill ) in their living room .

But when we note every step as a remarkable one , do the really important ones become a bit less special for the child ? <p> In my own kindergarten classroom , we do n't have a kindergarten graduation . We have a celebration on the last day of school and we spend time reflecting on the accomplishments we 've made throughout the year . I send home special scrapbooks for families as keepsakes , but I do n't expect working families to take a day off of work to celebrate with us . Kids have time to sign yearbooks of their friends , but I keep things simple and never require parents to pay additional fees for yearbooks , cap and gown , or party foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or funds , that many just do n't have . <p> So is an actual graduation ceremony necessary ?

We can make it a special day for kids with creative projects and keepsakes , without a ceremony for completing each grade level . Kids will remember their teacher , friends , and special projects before they will remember a ceremony . <p> Then again , it 's important to recognize that the milestone may be just as much for mom , dad , and other family members , as it is for junior .

Although children may initially seem to have a smaller vocabulary , in reality , each word counts . So , if your child refers to his pet as both " dog " and " perro , " for developmental purposes that is really two words . There may also be some " mixing " of words in both languages .

Infancy is an especially good time for sound recognition " babies easily differentiate between sounds and will retain memory of even brief introductions to unique sounds in other languages . If you are an adult language learner , however , do not despair ! Teens and adults can still learn another language and will pick up the grammatical rules and memorize vocabulary more quickly .

And if you find a recording , the native-speaker artist will improve your accent . <p> Toys : A number of toy companies , including LeapFrog , have introduced some bilingual toys , especially in Spanish and French . Because these toys are designed for interactive play based around developmentally appropriate vocabulary , including numbers , shapes , and colors , they will make learning another language fun for you and your baby . <p> Videos/DVDs : Personally , I save the videos for ages 2 and older .

In other words , if you feel that something is wrong with your child , or suspect that he is having problems in school , watch your child and talk with the professionals at school . The earlier we can identify special needs , and the earlier we can begin to provide specially designed services and instruction , the better the results for children with special needs . Do n't wait too long to talk to the professionals at school if your observations suggest that something is wrong . <h> Parents are Researchers <p> In your efforts to help your child with special needs , keep looking for resources and help . Stay informed of current research exploring what works for children with special needs . Use online resources to learn about how school staff can help your child learn to the best of her ability . Go to the local library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college or university to learn more about your child . Remember that the schools must provide training opportunities for parents , and can pay for you to attend workshops and other professional development activities . <h> Parents are Supports <p> As a parent of a child with special needs , you are not alone . You should seek out the support of other parents who are having similar experiences . The newspapers in your community offer daily announcements of different support groups , including groups that support parents of children with special needs . Every state has at least one federally funded Parent Training and Information Center ( PTI ) , which offers support and information to parents of children with special needs . Ask the Special Education Director at your school about parent support groups and parent resources in your local area . Be willing to offer support to other parents who are meeting the unique challenges of parenting a child with special needs .
