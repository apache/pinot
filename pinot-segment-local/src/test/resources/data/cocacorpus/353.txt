@@11459700 @59700/ <h> I Discovering the Tactical Situation ( SITAC ) of Rafale <p> We were able to obtain valuable information drivers allowing us to present the main display used by the pilots of Rafale . We limit ourselves of course the publication of information that is not confidential . <p> The main advantages of a combat aircraft are rarely visible . Fight , electronic systems , radar , against-measures , and all associated systems are all elements which are not comparable , unquantifiable , but which really make the difference ... In many ways , the tactical situation of the Rafale , called SITAC , something quite unique . It presents the pilot with tactical situation integrating elements of all the aircraft sensors , merged and filtered by the system . It is , somehow , the visible part of a huge iceberg called data fusion . <p> Enthroned in the middle of the cockpit , and advanced to the pilot 's eyes , the SITAC is displayed on the viewing screen called medium head ( VTM ) . Certainly this mask , a first glance , the display on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral movement .

With this system , the eye of the driver does not have to focus when the gaze moves from inside to outside and vice versa . <p> What is the point of this tactical situation ? It 's very simple . A combat mission has become something extremely complex . The days of the drivers , knights of the sky , only had to have good eyes to look their enemies in the sky and a good skill to dominate in aerial combat . Today we must manage systems , a tactical environment , and in a fight where one draws lethal ammunition to several tens of kilometers away , you better be sure you do not shoot a friend ... To add to this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio , and ... the enemies , whether on the ground or in flight . <p> At the beginning of the era of electronic equipment , the end of World War II , each system was connected to a screen .

In combat , the pilot had to constantly juggle between different displays in his mind and synthesize what is happening around him . <p> While combat aircraft fit now much automation that release of the engine management ( through FADEC ) or loss of control of the aircraft with electric flight controls , cockpit screens display everything again each different information in each of these monitors . This is the case of a Mirage 2000-5F , an F-22 Raptor , or an F-16 to the last standard .

In the image below , taken from the website Defesanet , we did not manage to get more high definition looks like this this famous SITAC on the Rafale . <p> Here is the main tool of a Rafale pilot . For readability , and in the absence of an image in high definition , this one is a recreation alike , through digital tools . The picture may seem a little confusing .

@@11459717 @59717/ <p> Chin-Chin is a dark Lycra god who controls the many realms of the Filthy Frank universe . The simple fact that he exists makes mortals shudder at the mere concept . For now , his exuding nature of anguish and suffering will bring torment to all mortals , but he will be forever known as That , the thing that roams.Story of Chin-ChinOrigins : ( speculations ) Chin-Chin was born to Dade and an unknown mother long before the beginning of time in Realm 6.2 . He grew to be a healthy child and mastered sports like chess and curling , without any signs of the cancer and evil that would later corrupt him . On his 21st birthday , Chin hosted a little birthday party and invited the almighty Based God . Dade noticed that Chin did not really have much of a wiener to speak of , while Lil B 's was intergalactic , and argued with him about his manliness . Dade , disappointed by Chins incredibly tiny pecker , decided to sew Chins eyelids completely shut , as a form of punishment . Dade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back when he was a real man . Chin , traveling across many realms to find his hidden manliness , went by many different identities to hide the shame of his extremely tiny penis . <p> Young Chin Chin in his college days being bullied by a young Prometheus.Enraged and saddened , Chin roamed the realms looking for a way to impress his Dad again . He went to Men 's College for Men where he met and was furiously bullied by Prometheus for being a total pusi . After graduating from his college , Chin could not find a single job to give him money to pay for his penis surgery . Furious , Chin became completely insane and brutally injured all those who bullied him during his youth . This left his former bullies like Prometheus almost dead , with Chin stealing many of Prometheus 's chromosomes . This made Chin extremely rich with power , making his penis incredibly big . Prometheus would later gain his immense power back , due to winning the Chromosome Lottery . Chin traveled to the realms he once grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Chins disappointment , Dade no longer lived in that realm and was believed to be dead . This made Chin very upset and angered . Chin Chin died 6,000CH before " Chin Chin ( A Serious Video ) " , so about in the -50,000CH and he inexplicably resurrected about in the 0CH , so we can assume then the Chromosome time measure is based on the Chin-Chin Resurrection . Chin , now calling himself Chin-Chin , used his extensive power to travel across realms , inflicting fear among the people.Realm 6.2 ( Canon ) : Chin-Chin is now known as The Dark Lord in Realm 6.2 . He demands chromic sacrifices from the mortal inhabitants , both human and Lycra , and is known and feared by all.Filthy Frank thought that Chin-Chin was dead for good , when , after a warning from Santa 's Brother , he appeared in his apartment chanting " ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo " . After the visit , Frank was forced to sacrifice some of the Chromosome Kid 's chromosomes each day.Chin 's corruptionOne day , Frank was carried away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time he realized , Chromosome Kid had escaped . Enraged , Chin-Chin sucked Salamander Man with him to The Rock Paper Scissors Arena ( after a short brawl with Lemon'sLemonjutsu ) where he put a curse on him.Frank traveled with Red Dick to the arena where he showed sacrifices performed by fans of the show to Chin-Chin , who was pleased enough . But when Senpai forgot his sacrifice again , Chin-Chin was ready to take Salamander Man to Jacksonville , Florida when he started playing his assflute . Touched , Chin-Chin let him go and has since almost stopped bothering Franku 's crew.Months later , Joji returned to Frank 's home and it pissed Chin-Chin off . He demanded monthly sacrifices from all who worshiped him . Even though his loyal minions had been sacrificing for him , Chin-Chin was still pissed and disappeared .

Although Frank would eventually make his way back to Pink Guy and Red Dick after many chromosomes , Chin-Chin has not been seen since banishing Frank . In the beginning , the gods sewed his eyelids shut in a desperate attempt to stunt chin-chin 's rapid power growth .

You may be wondering which one to choose . Indeed there are many options available and each is a compromise between complexity , quality and size . This guide is aimed at helping you narrow down your options since it contains a list to consider when making your first telescope purchase followed by our recommendations . Strength and Size : Each and every telescope has its own strengths . For instance , a small Alt-Azimuth Mount models are the best choice for a quick trip to the backyard looking at Planets and the Moon . Some are lighter to carry and move around while others such as large computer controlled models are heavy and will take a few trips in order to get everything outside . Consider carefully when deciding the size of your first Konus telescope , is it too big to store in the house ? Is it too heavy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , in time if Astronomy is something you wish to pursue you will then have some experience of using a telescope before making your next purchase . The size of the Aperture : The larger the aperture , the more light you will gather and generally objects will be sharper and brighter through the viewfinder . If you are planning to look at deep space objects such as nebula and distant galaxies which are more difficult to observe , then its best to consider a scope that has a large aperture . Again consider size and weight , also most large aperture scopes are Reflectors and not as robust as a Refractor telescopes.Focal Ratio : This is known as the ' speed ' of a telescope 's optics , by dividing the focal length by the aperture . The smaller the f/number the lower the magnification and the wider the field of view thus the brighter the image through the eyepiece . Most Konus Telescopes except for the Motormax-90 have medium focal lengths ideal for general night sky observation . <p> Please find below our list of recommended telescopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konuspace-4 Junior/Beginner : For youngsters ages 11-14 Konuspace-6 Adult/Beginner : Konuspace-700 Adult/Enthusiast : Konusmotor-130 Adult/Intermediate : Motormax-90 Adult/Advanced : Konusky-200 If you have any question or if you need help in choosing the right Konus Telescope , please do n't hesitate to contact us via email : email protected Alternatively you can fill out our contact form available on the website. http : **25;0;TOOLONG

The full name is Jorge Andres Montoya and Cornejo was born on September 17 , 1997 in Ecuador , Guayas , Guayaquil . <p> What is special about Jorge Cornejo , so that people will enter the game at the news of his arrival ? Jorge Cornejo , is recognized as the current leader of special forces team LSV , which is called by many as the best group of Snipers planet , within the prestigious Call of Duty . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEO , we can deduce that Jorge Cornejo , has a number of followers considered within the world Gamer .

How could the participants " real kill Call of Duty " face " Ecuador - X " , if they are exclusive and do not fight any player ? An interview with a participant in the " Real kill Call of Duty " revealed that played the weekend with people out of the tournament , ridiculing easily to all external players who had nothing to do with competition , even defeated groups considered strong out of the game , but that ended when they met " Ecuador - X " .

Why the best group of " Real kill " lost against a group like the LSV ? THE ANSWER IS VERY EASY , the victory earned the LSV , as they had to Campero Legendary Ecuador in combat , is not a common Campero said the interviewee , it is a jeep able to beat the best , because it has the so coveted and only love , BLUE SKY , a weapon SS sniper class . <p> What happened after 3 battles ?

This was because all members were defeated easily to the " Real kill " , with the exception of " Ecuador - X " .

The Nenets depend heavily on their reindeer herds , using them for food , clothing , tools , transportation , and more as they migrate more than a thousand kilometers across the tundra every year . Photographer Steve Morgan recently traveled to the Yamal Peninsula to document the Nenets and their threatened way of life . Here is a selection of his photos , with captions by Joanna Eede of Survival International . <p> 1 . Nenets herders move seasonally with their reindeer , traveling along ancient migration routes . During the winter , when temperatures can plummet to -50C , most Nenets graze their reindeer on moss and lichen pastures in the southern forests , or taiga . In the summer months , when the midnight sun turns night into day , they leave the larch and willow trees behind to migrate north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ob River and reached the treeless tundra on the shores of the Kara Sea , they might have traveled up to 1,000 km . <p> 2 . The Yamal Peninsula : a stretch of peatland that extends from northern Siberia into the Kara Sea , far above the Arctic Circle . To the east lie the shallow waters of the Gulf of Ob ; to the west , the Baydaratskaya Bay , which is ice-covered for most of the year . Yamal in the language of the indigenous Nenets means " the end of the world . " It is a remote , wind-blasted place of permafrost , serpentine rivers and dwarf shrubs , and has been home to the reindeer-herding Nenets people for over a thousand years . Today , the Nenets ' nomadic way of life is under threat from the effects of climate change , making the tundra increasingly unpredictable , and from the discovery that the peninsula contains the largest gas reserves on the planet . <p> 3 . The Nenets ' migration routes are now affected by the infrastructure associated with resource extraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say pollution threatens the quality of the pastures . <p> 4 . Under Stalin , Nenets communities were split into groups known as brigades , and forced to live on collective farms and villages called kolkhozy . Each brigade was obliged to pay reindeer meat as taxes . Children were separated from their families and sent to government-run boarding schools , where they were forbidden to speak their own language . <p> 5 . The covers of the Nenets ' conical-shaped tents , called choom or mya , are fabricated from reindeer hide and mounted on heavy poles . <p> 7 . Every Nenets has a sacred reindeer , which must not be harnessed or slaughtered until it is no longer able to walk . <p> 8 . Reindeer meat is the most important part of the Nenets ' diet . It is eaten raw , frozen or boiled , together with the blood of a freshly slaughtered reindeer , which is rich in vitamins . They also eat fish such as white salmon and muksun , a silvery-colored whitefish and gather mountain cranberry during the summer months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults began to leave their villages for cities , a trend which continues today . In urban environments they find it almost impossible to adapt to life away from the cyclical rhythms of the tundra , and suffer from high levels of alcoholism , unemployment and mental health problems . <p> 10 . Under a leaden grey sky , a Nenets family is on the move : women pack the sleds used to carry their belongings . At night , the sleds are arranged in half-circles around the choom . <p> 11 . The Arctic is changing fast . As temperatures rise and the tundra 's permafrost thaws , it releases carbon dioxide and methane , greenhouse gases , into the atmosphere . With the ice melting earlier in the spring and not freezing until much later in the autumn , the herders are being forced to change centuries-old migration patterns , as the reindeer find it difficult to walk over a snowless tundra . The rising temperatures also affect the tundra 's vegetation , the only source of food for the reindeer . <p> 12 . Melting permafrost has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will lead to a decline in the Nenets ' supply of fish . As the sea ice around the peninsula also melts , the ocean opens to maritime traffic . Arctic sea lanes act as potential gateways for trade between Asia , Europe and North America . In 2011 , the tanker Vladimir Tikhonov became the largest vessel ever to sail the Northeast Passage . <p> 13 . Preparations for what is known as the Yamal Megaproject ( a long term project to exploit the peninsula 's gas , developed by the Russian corporation Gazprom ) were initiated in the 1990s . In May 2012 , the first of its gas supplies from the vast Bovanenkovo field will be produced . Every year , billions of cubic meters will be piped to western Europe . " What happens to the land is very important to us , " Nenets herder Sergei Hudi told Survival International recently . " We are afraid that with all these new industries , we will not be able to migrate anymore . And if we can not migrate anymore , our people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipelines , drilling towers and tarmac roads are transforming the tundra . The 325-mile Obskaya-Bovanenkovo railway line -- the world 's most northerly -- was opened in early 2011 . " We ask that companies take our perspective into consideration when they are prospecting , " said Sergei Hudi . " And it is important that gas pipelines do not interfere with our access to reindeer pastures . " Sophie Grig , senior campaigner at Survival International , said , " Gazprom 's website calls the Yamal Peninsula a strategic oil and gas bearing region of Russia . This sums up how they view the Nenets ' ancestral homelands . " <p> 15 . A few years ago , a Nenets herder discovered the perfectly preserved remains of a six-month old baby woolly mammoth , buried in the permafrost of the Yamal peninsula . It is thought to have died 42,000 years ago . Scientists fear that if billions of tons of gases are released from the permafrost as it melts , it could prove to be a dangerous tipping point for the world 's climate system . <p> 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tundra 's fragile ecology for hundreds of years " said Sophie Grig of Survival International . " No developments should take place on their land without their consent , and they need to receive fair compensation for any damages caused . " With countries and corporations clamoring for a piece of the Arctic , scientists scrambling to study the changing environment and Gazprom 's announcement that additional gas fields on the peninsula will be ready for production in 2019 , their concerns are ever more urgent . <p> 17 . The Nenets have endured the challenges of colonial intrusions , civil war , revolution and forced collectivization . Today , their herding way of life is again seriously threatened . To survive as a people , the Nenets need unobstructed access to their pastures and an environment untouched by industrial waste . To the Nenets , the tundra is home , and the reindeer are life itself . " The reindeer is our life and the future . " said one Nenets woman . 
@@11459760 @59760/ <p> At first sight one may think this movie is just the same as many other horror movies . I 'm talking about all those which focus on some element of the world , and use it as a mere tool to provoke fear in the viewer . Movies such as " Jaws " , " Saw " , " Scream " , " The ring " , " Hostel " , etcetera . The symbol is just an excuse for terror . <p> Bearing this in mind one may think " The Dentist " belongs to that kind of movie . This is not strange at all , considering the fear that may , and does cause to many an appointment to the dentist . This is explained both because of the feeling of lose of control , and therefore being " at mercy " of the dentist ; and because of how sensible to pain our mouth , tongue and teeth are . <p> Dentistry can be very nasty sometimes ... <p> However , that is not the case . Just one fact to point that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is specially worried of making the patient feel comfortable during the check-up . He has even decorated each examination room in his dental office in order to achieve that . So instead of showing dentistry as something horrible , the movie does the exact opposite . <p> Now , it 's also truth the movie presents a series of cliches and phrases insinuating the dentistry theme way too obviously . Some statements of the cop , the oral sex Alan 's wife , Brooke , makes to Matt , etcetera . <p> However , the film has a lot more to offer ; both cover sensory content and cover meaning . To expose such hidden narrative , that is the propose of this analysis . <p> 2- Hallucinations <p> Throughout the movie , Dr. Feinstone suffers several hallucinations . Despite it may appear that they are a mere symptom of the dentist 's psychopathy , I see another pattern in them . <p> Do n't forget to brush your teeth after each meal ! <p> Let 's begin with the hallucination of the teeth full of cavities . Though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually occurs just twice . First with the kid , and later with the girl of the braces , Sara . The meaning , as it will be more clear soon , is the unavoidable fate Alan sees in purity , a future of decay . The child is assumed pure because it 's a child , and the innocence and goodness of Sara is proven scene after scene . <p> Just look at her . She 's ADORABLE ! ! <p> The other main kind of hallucinations has to do with Brooke . Instead of seen the actual appearances of some women , Alan sees his wife . Alan has this vision three times , every time with a different woman . First with the model , later with Sara , and finally with an opera singer . However , unlike the decayed teeth vision , the wife vision has a different meaning each time , so more on this later on . <p> THAT is what I call a hallucination ! <p> 3. - Marriage <p> So , what is the relationship between Dr. Feinstone and Brooke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan , so I 'd say his love towards her was sincere . Why did he marry Brooke ? Because Alan is in love of perfection . He would do anything to have her , and preserve her . For her alone he built the pool , and given her whatever she wanted . Until Matt , the pool guy , interferes . <p> And here is where we must pay a lot of attention . It 's truth that the torture , when Alan removes Brooke 's teeth , has a big deal of just pure revenge . However , this is not all the story . Dr. Feinstone , instead of acknowledging this emotion as a natural human reaction , he makes a ( twisted , if you like ) rationalization and isolates what he thinks is wrong with his wife , the decay she has been infected with from " the rest " of the world , from Brooke " herself " , i.e. the fine woman he married with . He deceives himself about his feelings , as he will do over and over again throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all what you 've done to me " . <p> " Death is too good for you " . <p> And the following scene is utterly relevant , a detail I did n't notice until the forth or fifth time I watched the film . The two times the policemen go to Dr. Feinstone 's house , we can see over the kitchen table a glass , pills and some little empty plastic containers . What are they ? Why are they there ? What do they mean ? All these questions are answered by the movie itself . First , the containers had soft baby food or something alike . Detective Gibbs ( the black cop ) taste it , and when he goes upstairs and discovers the mutilated Brooke , we see in the table next to the bed a spoon with the baby food on it , besides another such container , some yellow pills and a comb . <p> It is obvious Dr. Feinstone feed his now toothless wife . Now , the pills might not have been for her , but for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes them frequently . In fact , in a previous scene we saw him taking those same yellow pills , surely tranquilizers ( we can say so based on the situation when he uses them and the effect they have on him ) . However , here the movie is also clear . While the first time we see the glass is clean , the second time it has blood on the edge . Thus , Alan gave the pills to Brooke . The comb may suggest he even combed Brooke 's hair before going to the office . <p> " How many pills did you take ? " <p> Always it 's a good time for some yellow pills ... <p> So , what 's the point ? The point is that the analysed scene proves Alan does n't pretend to keep torturing his wife . The reason he does n't kill her is not because we wants her to " live and suffer " , but because the extraction performed has " purified " her . If this does n't make any sense yet , keep reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Besides the obvious references to the theme of teeth and dentistry , there are also other , more subtle ways the movie speaks to us . <p> a ) The dog bites Alan . b ) Sara said that she bit her dentist the first time she went to one , and that 's what she later does while trying to escape from Alan . c ) The dental office , with its hallway , its symmetrical lateral doors , and its pink walls , looks like the interior of a mouth , with its tongue , gum and inner chicks . A mouth Dr. Feinstone " cleans up " , getting rid of the corrupted subjects that go inside it . d ) The smiley toy . e ) The white background with some red on it repeats constantly throughout the movie , probably making allusion to teeth with blood on it . It may also just represent the colors of the mouth , but that 's kinda unlikely since the mouth has more red than white . Anyway , we see this visual theme in : i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The introductory title . iii ) Dr. Feinstone surgical mask being splattered with Marv 's blood . iv ) The blood on Alan 's house terrace . v ) The T-shirt Sara is wearing the second day . vi ) The T-shirt of the patient ( later hostage ) against the white sheet and the student 's pants . vii ) The blood being washed off from Dr. Feinstone hands under the dental sink . f ) After we hear Dr. Feinstone saying " pain is an abstract emotion . It has to be managed , shaped and disregarded as a distraction " we can see the word " PAIN ! " written on the chalkboard at the background of the room . g ) Marvin and Alan look alike , but in the sense Marvin would be the corrupted form of Allan ( more on this later ) . h ) When Dr. Feinstone 's gun is shown in the floor close to a pair of dental pliers , they look as if they where from the same " surgical kit " . It is even possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs both objects in the very same way , despite it is an odd way to hold a gun . What that this mean ? It means that Dr. Feinstone uses his gun as a tool , therefore , he does n't use it just to fulfill his whims , but to do his job : to fight against decay and corruption . Not only dental corruption , but " human " corruption . " Decay it 's out of control . It 's gone right through your soul " . This might also explain why Dr. Feinstone is so reckless , being a smart guy : he does n't think his deeds are crimes , but rather part of his crusade for perfection and hygiene . i ) The model , April Reign , is subliminally related to Brooke even before Alan see her as his wife because of his hallucinations . This is done by emphasizing the legs of both women . <p> 5. - Dr. Feinstone and the other male characters . <p> Let 's get started with Alan 's more evident antagonist : Matt . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things in common . Yeah , besides both having screwed Brooke , you dirty minded -- <p> For instance , they both are independent workers , and both of them work on cleaning stuff up . As crazy as it sounds , Matt is also a " enemy of filth " , a " defender of hygiene " . They have even similar looking cars , both white , a symbol of hygiene . <p> And let 's also notice that both for Matt and " for Alan " she 's wearing a bathrobe . And what Brooke-April says to Alan : " Just like Matt " . <p> Alan also gets stained by filth , the pool-sludge-looking kind of filth , when April touches him between the legs . <p> Furthermore , Steve would come to represent Alan himself , being April 's " husband " . In fact , Steve is a model manager , hence a seeker of beauty , of perfection , just like Alan . <p> So , again , what 's the fucking point of the strong parallelism between Dr. Feinstone and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Alan has this hallucination about his wife , he subconsciously fantasizes with taking the place of Matt , but when Brooke-vision makes this explicit , by saying " Just like Matt " , then Alan gets mad ... but not because he 's jealous , but because he is ashamed , since he can not accept to be compared with a " filthy peace of shit " he thinks Matt is . That 's why he emphasizes so much his " higher rank " . " DOCTOR ! , doctor Feinstone . I am a dentist , and this is my wife . " <p> Beware of dentists , they have guns ... <p> So , putting all the shit together , he hates Matt not only because he fucked his wife , but rather , and most importantly , because it reminds him his own lower instincts and desires . But Dr. Feinstone can not deal with this , so he just denies it , which manifests in the " physical " elimination of Matt . <p> It may be thought Marv is nothing else but a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think instead he comes to represent Alan 's conscience ... i.e. someone who reminds him his faults . Proof of this relationship is the deep knowledge Marvin has about Alan . <p> But , again , just as he proceed with Matt , our dear friend prefers " radical measures " . So , instead of learning to deal with the cost of his mistakes , whether accepting the blackmail or refusing it and facing Justice , he just decide to get rid of him . <p> Now , before going any further , there is yet another parallelism in the plot . And I must admit is a tricky one , one I was n't convinced completely until I found enough evidence . It 's about the relationship between Marvin ... and Brooke ! First , in order to convince you as well , let 's appreciate some pictures ... <p> And other " hard evidences " of the mirroring between the two characters , is they both try to help another person from being a victim of Alan ( Matt and Sara ) , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the similar instructions from Alan regarding their tongues : " Shhh , we would n't want to cut out your tongue , would you ? " and " Get your tongue out of the way ! Get it out of the way , goddammit ! " . <p> All right , but what is the meaning of this parallelism ? The meaning has to do with the actual , practical reasons that make Dr. Feinstone torture them , and the way he deceives himself about his real motivations and feelings , telling to himself he 's doing it in the name of noble values , such as perfection and hygiene . <p> The actual reason Alan tortures his wife is plain vengeance . At first he plans to just kick her out to the street , after he discovers Brooke 's affair . But later he realizes that if he does so , " she 'll take everything , every penny I 've ever made . " So he hates her , but he ca n't just kick her out , therefore he tortures her and keep her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filth speech ( " I 've been watching what you 've become . Filth , just like the rest " ) and the forever together speech ( " Let 's swim together . That 's the way it was meant to be . Forever . Together " ) . <p> And the actual reason Alan tortures Marvin is because he fears the blackmail will last forever ( " you 've never been satisfied , would you ? " ) , but immediately after that , he starts with another speech about soul corruption . <p> In few words , Alan 's state of denial is so severe , he even denies his own " dirty " feelings , and replaces them with " pure " causes . I guess is some kind of what the psychologist call " mechanisms of defense " . Alan 's protecting the image the image he was of himself through this delusions . <p> By the way , the reason why Alan focus on Brooke 's and Marvin 's tongues , is because both of them uses it in " filthy " ways : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Aaaand , finally , to end this section , I introduce you who I think is the real opposite of Dr. Feinstone : Detective Gibbs . As usual , the movie provides us of several visual and speech hints : a ) Unlike Dr. Feinstone , who uses gloves even to drive or touch his patients tits , he does n't wear them , even when he supposedly should . b ) He speaks in a much more relaxed , informal way . c ) And , most relevant , he knows the world is not , nor is going to ever be , a perfects place , and deals with it . i ) " The world is full of wrong " ii ) " I 'd rather live with the pain " iii ) " Are you a dentist , right ? A little like a cop . A necessary evil " . ( He does n't put himself ( nor Dr. Feinstone ) in a pedestal ) . <p> 6. - Conclusions <p> Based on what I 've presented , I believe I 'm able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a man , an idealist , maybe a romantic , that as such lives in a constant state of denial . He just can not accept the inherent corruption of the world . That 's why he has " a beautiful wife , a beautiful home " . But , as he discovers by his own , decay 's everywhere and " nothing , no matter how good , how pure , is free of decay . Once decay get 's started , it can only lead to rot , filth , corruption " . What really matters though is how he faces the " ugly side " of reality . How he faces infidelity , con , aging , chaos . The answer he comes up with is deletion or , in dentistry jargon , " extraction " . As sick as it might sound , when Allan extracts Brooke 's teeth , he extracts corruption out from her . <p> But then he goes one step further , and he does n't want just to get rid of current decay , but also of the decay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Sara as well . " So sad . Now it can only be ruined . The rest of your life can only , spoil . Believe me . The idea that every second ... they 're just , rotting away . Can you live with that ? I do n't think you can . " " So young . So ... innocent . Still , decay is just knocking at your door . Open wide Sara ! . Let me in ! . Do you understand . It 's the way it is . I 'm sorry . " When he aims at her with his gun the first time , the vision of his wife ( with teeth ) screaming is what prevents him from killing Sara . And when he 's just about to kill her a little later , she swears him she will brush her teeth three times a day and wo n't eat candy . The hope that maybe she will able to withstand corruption , is the reason why Dr. Feinstone let 's her live . <p> But when he arrives to the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the cure to the virus of evil is letting it without a host , so he encourages his students to extract all the teeth from their patients . But the climax is about to come . In the final scene , while Alan slowly approaches to a singer from behind , while she sings opera , he sees her with the body of her wife , but when he touches her shoulder and she turns around , he sees the toothless face of Brooke . He falls to his knees , crying , and seeing his wife ( now with teeth ) laughing out loud . <p> So , whether he realizes what he had done ( destroying perfection instead of preserving it ) , meaning that the laugh represents the beauty he has destroyed ; or he realizes decay is invincible , and Brooke 's laugh is corruption mocking him . I go for the first one , because you can not laugh like that if you do n't have teeth nor tongue , I guess ( ? ) , but of course , it 's open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> a ) Further research : according to Wikipedia , the film was inspired by the story of real life dentist/serial killer Nick Rex . I could n't confirm nor refute this using other sources , so if you can , please let me know . <p> b ) Acknowledgments to Rob Ager , who runs the RobAg88 youtube account , and the collative learning website . All I know about film analysis I owe it to him . Please check out his work ( ) , and , if you appreciate it , please buy any of his stuff , you cheap bastard ! <p> d ) There 's another " valid " way to analyze this movie . As the trailer suggests , this movie could be about an upper middle class professional who has lived beyond his means , and because of one shocking event ( realizing his wife is cheating on him ) , all his life collapses and he goes nuts . There are many pieces of evidence that support this interpretation , such as : - The IRS agent harassment , in a kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control ! " which Dr. Feinstone repeats a couple of times . - The financial problems Dr. Feinstone has . - The fact Dr. Feinstone is over stressed ( he has two jobs , he has an issue with pills , he works hard , he exploits his employees ) . - The phrase " This is MY business . I can not afford to have a bad day " , which means he was on the limit . - The phrase " A man over the edge " detective Gibbs says . - The crowded waiting room . - Alan 's addiction to tranquilizers. - And so on ... So why did n't I pay more attention to this interpretation ? Well , just because it is less interesting to me , and it was way more obvious that the hidden narrative I exposed . <p> e ) Regarding to the act of analyzing or reviewing itself , what is the point of doing it , I quote Oscar Wilde 's Preface of his " Picture of Dorian Gray " . <p> The artist is the creator of beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art 's aim .

@@11459785 @59785/ <h> Queen - 1977 - News Of The World ( Bonus Track ) <p> Few bands embodied the pure excess of the ' 70s like Queen . Embracing the exaggerated pomp of prog rock and heavy metal , as well as vaudevillian music hall , the British quartet delved deeply into camp and bombast , creating a huge , mock-operatic sound with layered guitars and overdubbed vocals . Queen 's music was a bizarre yet highly accessible fusion of the macho and the fey . For years , their albums boasted the motto " no synthesizers were used on this record , " signaling their allegiance with the legions of post-Led Zeppelin hard rock bands . But vocalist Freddie Mercury brought an extravagant sense of camp to the band , pushing them toward kitschy humor and pseudo-classical arrangements , as epitomized on their best-known song , " Bohemian Rhapsody . " Mercury , it must be said , was a flamboyant bisexual who managed to keep his sexuality in the closet until his death from AIDS in 1991 . Nevertheless , his sexuality was apparent throughout Queen 's music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was truly bizarre to hear gay anthems like " We Are the Champions " turn into celebrations of sports victories . That would have been impossible without Mercury , one of the most dynamic and charismatic frontmen in rock history . Through his legendary theatrical performances , Queen became one of the most popular bands in the world in the mid- ' 70s ; in England , they remained second only to the Beatles in popularity and collectibility in the ' 90s . Despite their enormous popularity , Queen were never taken seriously by rock critics -- an infamous Rolling Stone review labeled their 1979 album Jazz as " fascist . " In spite of such harsh criticism , the band 's popularity rarely waned ; even in the late ' 80s , the group retained a fanatical following except in America . In the States , their popularity peaked in the early ' 80s , just as they finished nearly a decade 's worth of extraordinarily popular records . And while those records were never praised , they sold in enormous numbers , and traces of Queen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and metal bands in the next two decades , from Metallica to Smashing Pumpkins . <p> The origins of Queen lay in the hard rock psychedelic group Smile , which guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor joined in 1967 . Following the departure of Smile 's lead vocalist , Tim Staffell , in 1971 , May and Taylor formed a group with Freddie Mercury , the former lead singer for Wreckage . Within a few months , bassist John Deacon joined them , and they began rehearsing . Over the next two years , as all four members completed college , they simply rehearsed , playing just a handful of gigs . By 1973 , they had begun to concentrate on their career , releasing the Roy Thomas Baker-produced Queen that year and setting out on their first tour . Queen was more or less a straight metal album and failed to receive much acclaim , but Queen II became an unexpected British breakthrough early in 1974 . Before its release , the band played Top of the Pops , performing " Seven Seas of Rhye . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the single rocketed into the Top Ten , setting the stage for Queen II to reach number five . Following its release , the group embarked on its first American tour , supporting Mott the Hoople . On the strength of their campily dramatic performances , the album climbed to number 43 in the States . <p> Queen released their third album , Sheer Heart Attack , before the end of 1974 . The music hall meets Zeppelin " Killer Queen " climbed to number two on the U.K. charts , taking the album to number two as well . Sheer Heart Attack made some inroads in America as well , setting the stage for the breakthrough of 1975 's A Night at the Opera . Queen labored long and hard over the record ; according to many reports , it was the most expensive rock record ever made at the time of its release . The first single from the record , " Bohemian Rhapsody , " became Queen 's signature song , and with its bombastic , mock-operatic structure punctuated by heavy metal riffing , it encapsulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical excesses -- the song took three weeks to record , and there were so many vocal overdubs on the record that it was possible see through the tape at certain points . To support " Bohemian Rhapsody , " Queen shot one of the first conceptual music videos , and the gamble paid off as the single spent nine weeks at number one in the England , breaking the record for the longest run at number one . The song and A Night at the Opera were equally successful in America , as the album climbed into the Top Ten and quickly went platinum . <p> Following A Night at the Opera , Queen were established as superstars , and they quickly took advantage of all their status had to offer . Their parties and indulgence quickly became legend in the rock world , yet the band continued to work at a rapid rate . In the summer of 1976 , they performed a free concert at London 's Hyde Park that broke attendance records , and they released the hit single " Somebody to Love " a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Races , which was essentially a scaled-down version of A Night at the Opera that reached number one in the U.K. and number five in the U.S. They continued to pile up hit singles in both Britain and America over the next five years , as each of their albums went into the Top Ten , always going gold and usually platinum in the process . Because Queen embraced such mass success and adoration , they were scorned by the rock press , especially when they came to represent all of the worst tendencies of the old guard in the wake of punk . Nevertheless , the public continued to buy Queen records . Featuring the Top Five double-A-sided single " We Are the Champions " / " We Will Rock You , " News of the World became a Top Ten hit in 1977 . The following year , Jazz nearly replicated that success , with the single " Fat Bottomed Girls " / " Bicycle Race " becoming an international hit despite the massive bad publicity surrounding their media stunt of staging a nude female bicycle race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they entered the ' 80s , releasing The Game , their most diverse album to date , in 1980 . On the strength of two number one singles -- the campy rockabilly " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " and the disco-fied " Another One Bites the Dust " -- The Game became the group 's first American number one album . However , the bottom fell out of the group 's popularity , particularly in the U.S. , shortly afterward . Their largely instrumental soundtrack to Flash Gordon was coldly received later in 1980 . With the help of David Bowie , Queen were able to successfully compete with new wave with 1981 's hit single " Under Pressure " -- their first U.K. number one since " Bohemian Rhapsody " -- which was included both on their 1981 Greatest Hits and 1982 's Hot Space . Instead of proving the group 's vitality , " Under Pressure " was a last gasp . Hot Space was only a moderate hit , and the more rock-oriented The Works ( 1984 ) also was a minor hit , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly afterward , they left Elektra and signed with Capitol . <p> Faced with their decreased popularity in the U.S. and waning popularity in Britain , Queen began touring foreign markets , cultivating a large , dedicated fan base in Latin America , Asia , and Africa , continents that most rock groups ignored . In 1985 , they returned to popularity in Britain in the wake of their show-stopping performance at Live Aid . The following year , they released A Kind of Magic to strong European sales , but they failed to make headway in the States . The same fate befell 1989 's The Miracle , yet 1991 's Innuendo was greeted more favorably , going gold and peaking at number 30 in the U.S. Nevertheless , it still was a far bigger success in Europe , entering the U.K. charts at number one . <p> By 1991 , Queen had drastically scaled back their activity , causing many rumors to circulate about Freddie Mercury 's health . On November 23 , he issued a statement confirming that he was stricken with AIDS ; he died the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Queen held a memorial concert at Wembley Stadium , which was broadcast to an international audience of more than one billion . Featuring such guest artists as David Bowie , Elton John , Annie Lennox , Def Leppard , and Guns N ' Roses , the concert raised millions for the Mercury Phoenix Trust , which was established for AIDS awareness . The concert coincided with a revival of interest in " Bohemian Rhapsody , " which climbed to number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K. in the wake of its appearance in the Mike Myers comedy Wayne 's World . Following Mercury 's death , the remaining members of Queen were fairly quiet . Brian May released his second solo album , Back to the Light , in 1993 , ten years after the release of his first record . Roger Taylor cut a few records with the Cross , which he had been playing with since 1987 , while Deacon essentially retired . The three reunited in 1994 to record backing tapes for vocal tracks Mercury recorded on his death bed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 to mixed reviews and strong sales , particularly in Europe .

In 2005 the Queen name was revived but this time with " + Paul Rodgers " appended to it . Rodgers , the former lead singer of Free and Bad Company , joined Brian May and Roger Taylor -- John Deacon remained retired -- for some live shows , one of which was documented on 2005 's Return of the Champions , a double disc on the Hollywood label . <p> **28;27;TOOLONG <p> If Day at the Races was a sleek , streamlined album , its 1977 successor , News of the World , was its polar opposite , an explosion of styles that did n't seem to hold to any particular center .

" Then there 's the neo-disco of " Fight from the Inside , " which is eclipsed by the mechanical funk of " Get Down , Make Love , " a dirty grind that 's stripped of sensuality . That cold streak on " Get Down , Make Love " runs through the album as a whole .

On November 20 , 1985 , a small software company named Microsoft released an operating system called Windows 1.0 . Nobody would 've ever guessed how iconic this OS would become . Today , Windows is the most popular operating system in the world . Here 's a look back at 25 years of Windows screenshots . How many of these do you remember ? <p> 1985 : Windows 1.0 " This is the OS that started it all . Running on top of DOS , it was Microsoft 's first 16-bit GUI-based OS . <p> 1986 : Windows 1.02 " This was essentially the international release of Windows 1.0 . These early versions had very little adoption . <p> 1987 : Windows 2.0 " This version was the next logical step in the Windows evolution , but it was still far behind Mac OS at the time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intel 's 80286 and 80386 processors. , but not much else . <p> 1990 : Windows 3.0 " Though still significantly less intuitive than Apple 's GUI environment , this was the first Windows incarnation that worked plausibly well . <p> 1991 : Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions " This release added support for sound cards and other multimedia goodies . A new concept at the time . <p> 1992 : Windows 3.1 " Windows 3.1 cleaned up a lot of bugs and made the OS a little more user friendly . It saw a lot more users than earlier versions . <p> 1993 : Windows NT 3.1 " The NT moniker marked an important point in the Windows evolution . This is where the camps were split , so to speak , into Windows ( later to be called 9x ) and Windows NT . <p> 1994 : Windows NT 3.5 " This was the next step in the Windows NT evolution . It was also the first OS to bear different workstation ( NT 3.5 Workstation ) and server ( NT 3.5 Server ) variations . It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years later sealed its fate . <p> 1995 : Windows 95 " This 32-bit OS was not only the next step in the Windows ( 9x ) progression , it was also the OS that put Microsoft on the map . This was the first Windows release to resemble the modern version . <p> 1996 : Windows NT 4.0 " Windows NT grew up a little in this version . It was widely adopted by enterprises , but still very under done . However , NT 4.0 marked an important milestone with Microsoft 's business presence . <p> 1997 : Windows CE 2.0 : As mobile devices started becoming popular , so did Windows CE ( a stripped down variant of Windows different from both NT and 9x ) . Version 2 made a lot of improvements to the initial release . <p> 1998 : Windows 98 : Windows 95 led to Windows 98 . This proved to be one of Microsoft 's biggest successes .

A year later , Windows ME would be released . This marked the end of the 9x ( non-NT ) legacy . <p> 2001 : Windows XP : This version became wildly popular . It marked another important change in the Windows evolution . It continued with the NT/2000 code base , but now the server and workstation versions would have different names . <p> 2002 : Windows XP Tablet PC " About the same time Windows XP arrived , so did Tablet PCs . Microsoft supplied an OS specifically designed for these devices , complete with an OSK ( on screen keyboard ) and handwriting recognition . <p> 2003 : Windows Server 2003 : This was essentially the server version of Windows XP. 2003 boasted dramatic stability improvements over 200o Server . It was ( and is still ) a popular enterprise server platform . <p> 2004 : Windows CE 5.0 " Microsoft continued to develop Windows CE , and version 5 made a lot of improvements . It was becoming clear that mobile computing was a viable alternative to desktop computing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phone 7 . <p> 2005 : Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 : As digital media became more and more popular , Microsoft released a Media Center version of Windows XP .

Needless to say it was not received well . <p> 2007 : Windows Mobile 6 : Building on the Windows CE platform , Microsoft released Windows Mobile . Version 6 proved to be the last major release as Windows Phone 7 is its replacement . <p> 2008 : Windows Server 2008 : This one picked up where Windows Server 2003 left off . It was essentially the server version of Vista , but it borrowed a lot of features from the upcoming Windows 7 .

" I had been notified by a close friend who had seen me in a porn site ad , " Varona said . " I spent the whole summer trying to take down all the pictures , but it was virtually impossible to track down who hacked me . I felt like crap knowing my life was going down the drain .

" In reality , school was the least of her worries . " I began getting real stalkers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my address and took pictures of my house . They threatened to rape me .

I cant even have my real name . I 've had like six Facebooks now . " Her initial action of taking pictures for her boyfriend evolved into something she could n't imagine . Although her parents were supportive , they were disappointed at her for taking such sexual pictures and having them in the incapable hands of the Internet . This popular trend of posting nude or sexual pictures has been practiced since cellphone cameras came on the scene . " Its everywhere , even where you least expect it like on your teens computer , cellphone and game device , " Parry Aftab , a pioneering Internet law lawyer , said on her website . " Forty-four percent of boys in coed high schools we polled reported seeing at least one image of a fellow female classmate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey . " Most saw images of more than just one girl . And many saw multiple images of each girl . Your daughter may be among them . " A survey conducted by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy reveals that nearly one in five young people have sent nude pictures electronically or online . " They 're posting these pictures trying to look older , cooler , " Aftab said . " They 're posing in their bras before they 're old enough to wear them . Now , when they 're passing the pictures from kid to kid afterwards , the kids that are passing them are being charged with child pornography . " Because federal law does n't  make any distinction about who creates the child porn , teens who take nude photos of themselves and child pornographers who abuse and exploit children can receive the same punishment . That means that a child could spend up to five years in federal prison for simply possessing their own naked picture . Sending it out to others , however , can get a 15-year term . Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hollywood Police Department , has received many calls from parents who also do n't  realize the consequences . " Parents do n't  understand that their daughter or their son is the one who started the crime by taking the picture of themselves and posting them on the Internet , " Roussell said . " If a kid has a bunch of stored nude images of minors on his computer , hell be arrested for that and hell have to go through the judicial system like anybody else , whether he s an adult or a child . " Also , in many states , like Florida , if a person is convicted of a crime against children , it automatically registers him/her with the sex offender registry , a lifelong curse . What really perturbs authorities and parents is why adolescents take these pictures . Therapist Ana M. Moreno , a licensed mental health counselor in Miami , believes self-esteem plays a role in these behaviors . " The cases I have worked with that have engaged in this behavior are looking for outside validation . These teen girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Moreno said . " They may not feel good about their decision to share sexual pictures ; however , if positive validation is received , they tend to feel content and sometimes elated with the feedback .

" Those pictures are going to get out and you know how it is in school . Everyone will call these kids names . Now she becomes a slut and shes going to have to deal with that social issue , " Roussell said . The trend is affecting people at all levels . Even celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Vanessa Hudges have been caught in the act of " sexting " and sending nude photos to people in confidence .

Then the images end up getting posted to the Internet and they go viral . " According to a survey Willard conducted , when minors were asked what theyd do if they were asked to send a nude picture , 94 percent of the group said " No way , never , goodbye . " " The problem is that the hot , amazing junior boy is asking for nudes from the cute , little freshman girl , and all the while saying everyone does it all the time , its a normal thing , I 'd never send it to anyone , itll just be between you and me.

Stocks , bonds and currencies across the developing world were plummeting , as they had 16 years earlier when Russia surprised investors by defaulting on its debt . On Dec. 15 , a Bloomberg index tracking 20 big emerging-markets currencies fell to its lowest level in a decade . The Russian ruble fell past 64 to the dollar for the first time ever , as the price of oil sank and international sanctions took hold . Bonds issued by Brazilian oil giant Petrobras Brasileiro SA nosedived amid a massive corruption probe . In December alone , investors pulled more than $4 billion from emerging-markets exchange-traded funds , erasing 48 percent of the inflow for the year , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . <p> As the tumult continued into 2015 , discerning emerging-markets investors saw opportunity , Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its March issue . They 're bullish on China , South Korea and , despite a 50-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf nations . South Korea tops Bloomberg Markets ' fourth annual ranking of the most-promising emerging nations in which to invest in 2015 , with Qatar No. 2 , China No. 3 and the United Arab Emirates No. 4 . Saudi Arabia heads the list of the most-promising frontier markets . <p> Both Korea and China look attractive at this stage , " says Mark Mobius , who oversees $40 billion as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group . Noting that China and South Korea are oil importers , Mobius says , " Both markets will benefit from low oil prices and relatively high economic growth . " More than half of the market capitalization of South Korea 's Kospi Index of stocks consists of exporters , says Hartmut Issel , head of Asia-Pacific investment at UBS Wealth Management . Samsung Electronics Co. alone accounts for 17 percent of the market . " The fate of Korean stocks is thus largely determined by how big customers such as the U.S. are doing , " Issel says . Optimism about Korea is tempered by its competitive weakness against rival Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative value of the won versus the yen , " says Jim O'Neill , retired head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . The yen fell 11 percent against the won in the 12 months through Feb. 2 . A weak currency makes exported goods cheaper . The South Korean economy grew at an anemic 0.4 percent pace in the three months through December from the previous quarter , according to the Bank of Korea . China 's markets were unaffected by the emerging-markets crisis , with the Shanghai Composite Index rising 58 percent in 2014 , including reinvested dividends , after slumping 3.9 percent in 2013 . " I do n't understand why people are so negative about China , " says O'Neill , who coined the term BRICs in 2001 to highlight the rising economic power of Brazil , Russia , India and China . " I assumed China would grow by 7.5 percent a year this decade , " he says . " So far , it will have averaged 7.9 from 2011 to 2014 . " The Bloomberg Markets emerging and frontier markets rankings are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gross domestic product growth for the next two years to the ease of doing business . MSCI Inc. , a New Yorkbased publisher of equity indexes , designates countries as emerging or frontier based on a variety of criteria , including trading volumes , restrictions on foreign investors , corporate governance , and currency and political stability .
