Then a Replicoid ( a Celestial-created clone of Thor ) makes sure there are no hard feelings by using advanced , god-like tech to heal Thors wounds and repair Mjolnir . <p> " Thor " vol. 2 #10 ( 1999 ) <p> In the 1990s , Thor found out that there were these beings known as the Dark Gods who were similar to Asgardians and Olympians but way evil . One of them , Perrikus , spent centuries in a cell hidden by Odin . Which was fine- but then he gets out in the modern day , does some damage , and uses a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then attempts to pick up the remaining half of the hammer by the handle , only to discover nope , the spell that it would only be lifted by the worthy is still intact . <p> The pieces of the hammer crackle with energy until its true owner returns and puts the two pieces back together in " Thor " vol. 2 #11 . The energies then immediately heal the hammer and boom , Thors back in action . Definitely the easiest repair job Mjolnir has ever had , and the only time Thor did n't  need someones help or a Pittsburgh steel mill . He then promptly beat Perrikus , as we all knew he would . <p> " Thor " vol. 2 #80 ( 2004 ) <p> In Marvel Comics , as in Norse mythology , the- gods of Asgard are fated to die in a great battle known as Ragnarok . In Marvel Comics , this has actually happened a couple of times already , and each time Asgard and its inhabitants were reborn afterward , in slightly different forms and sometimes with different relationships to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead lives that would lead to another Ragnarok . This idea came about as a means to explain some differences between comic and myth , such as why Thor is redheaded in the original myth while blonde in the Marvel Universe , and why Loki is a brother to Odin in mythology but a brother to Thor in the Marvel Universe . In 2004 , that time was happening again , in the story arc " Ragnarok " by Michael Avon Oeming , with art by Andre di Vito and Laura Villari . <p> As in mythology , the comic book story- " Ragnarok " really kicks off when Loki attacks Asgard . In this story , he has used the forge of the great fire demon Surtur to create uru hammers that mirror Thors own Mjolnir , arming himself and his main troops with them . In the battle , Thor slams Mjolnir against the uru hammer of Lokis son Fenris Wolf and the uru gauntlets of Ulik the troll . The combined might of so many uru weapons slamming into each other at once causes an explosion so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust settles , Thor sees that all the uru weapons , including Mjolnir , are now shattered . <p> Several battles happen afterward , leading to the destruction of Asgard . By storys end , Thor sacrifices himself to ensure that if Asgard is- reborn in the future , it and its inhabitants will no longer be slaves to fate but may- live out their own choices in life , choices that may- not necessarily lead to Ragnarok again . In 2006 , Mjolnir reforms itself somehow and falls to Earth in the pages of " Fantastic Four " #536 , signaling that the time for the Asgardians to return is near. - At the same time , Thors human incarnation Donald Blake is reborn on Earth and soon afterward reunites with the mighty uru mallet , allowing the god of thunder to return in a new comic book series in 2007 . <p> " Thor " #600 ( 2009 ) <p> Bor is one of the elder Norse gods , - father to Odin , grandfather to Thor . In a story penned by J. Michael Straczynski , readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trapped by sorcery , by Loki from the future , all as part of a long game . In the present day , Loki returns Bor to physical form and sets him loose in New York City , casting illusions so the elder Asgardian thinks he is in a Hellish landscape and surrounded by demons . Thor arrives to see why this man is causing havoc ( not knowing its his grandfather ) and the two fight . The fight is so intense that Thor winds up shattering Mjolnir as he delivers the killing blow against Bor , only learning moments later that the man was his grandfather , turning his victory into tragedy and trauma . <p> Thor considered that this time it would be more difficult to fix Mjolnir . In the past , god-like energies had ripped it apart and usually been responsible for restoring it . Since it was in several pieces and not just split in two , he could n't reforge it himself as he had done in Pittsburgh or when he confronted Perrikus . He gets aid from- Doctor Strange , Earths great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only by uniting it with Thors own life force . It works , but Thor now knows that if Mjolnir is so damaged again in the future , he will share the damage and may die in the process . <p> And that wraps up our list , folks . It seems that Dr. Strange is set to appear in Thor : Ragnarok , so maybe hell be the one to fix Mjolnir there as well . Well just have to wait and see !

@@108166696 @3566696/ <p> Let 's face it , in many regards Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash have been running the same race this season , preserve the present and stop the bad guys from creating a dystopian future . However , where Flash has stumbled a few times along the way ( Flashpoint , Savitars identity , etc ) , Legends of Tomorrow has really taken a substantial lead . This is no more apparent than this weeks penultimate episode " Doomworld " . <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> " Doomworld " was what a lot of fans were hoping from Flashpoint , a world- radically different than our own and in this case , a world where the bad guys run the board with the power to bend reality . So what does a Legion of Doom do with infinite power ? They torture their adversaries of course . Every- Legend was molded into this reality and of course it was completely humiliating . <p> Sara and Amaya were turned into classic 60s henchmen replete with maniacal giggles . - Robbed of any agency , the dynamic duo were Thawnes guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission was to track down ( and ultimately kill ) Felicity Smoak . It was pretty shocking but a wonderful way to set the stage as the rest of the Legends began to pop up . Jax and Stein worked in Thawnes lab wrapped up in a pretty abusive dynamic where Jax tortured his former friend . Ray went from mild mannered astrophysicist to a spacey janitor that cleaned " a lot of toilets " . Nate became a hippie historian that lived in his mothers basement , though he did pay rent and worst of all Rip was trapped inside of a miniaturized Waverider where he spent the better part of a year baking cakes . Yes that 's right , in the face of overwhelming defeat , Rip Hunter became a baker . <p> This , like all good alternate universe tales , is to show the viewers why a character/team- is so important to the story . Without them , the world can fall apart in weird and unusual ways . It just so happens that the Legends writing team knows how to do this and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun little nods . The biggest squee this week has to be the premiere of the Legion of Doom Headquarters . Straight from the cell shaded Super Friends cartoon , it was fully realized and amazing . Seriously , it was so pitch perfect , the rest of the episode could have been horrific and I would have still called " Doomworld " - a win . <p> However , despite the funny little homages and twisted character archetypes , the story was still able to explore some pretty dark spaces . The irony is , because the Legends staff have become so adept at juggling multiple emotions , they were able to get really grimdark without making the audience feel overwhelmed with despair . Its a wonderful magic trick that the folks over at Arrow and Flash should pay attention to . <p> In fact , the reason why the dark turn works so well is because its centered on one of our most conflicted characters in the Legends pantheon , Mick Rory . In the last few weeks Mick began to regret becoming a Legend and flipped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad call and Mick had to make up for his world altering mistake . This led to a hilarious recurring bit where each character , as they regained their memories , would punch Mick in the face . It was a perfect blend of humor and darkness . <p> Even better , Dominic Purcell delivered an amazing performance as he had to adjust to- each change up , weighing the pros and cons of his choices and accepting the anger of his friends . - You got ta feel bad for Mick , you really do . No mater which way he turns , he feels trapped . This was really brought home when Snart killed Amaya , shattering her into a million pieces of ice . I have to be honest , I do n't  know how Mick is going to react to this , or if he can recover from the fallout . What I do know is that this finally places Mick and Snart on opposite sides of the fence permanently . Even if Mick returns to a life of crime , hell always see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all leads to the gigantic showdown between the Legends and the Legion . With Amaya temporarily ( we hope ) dead , and the Spear of Destiny destroyed , the Legends have to go back in time and change an event they had direct contact with .

The World is running out of food because our population wont stop growing .

She is the horribly insincere regarding her prized project and cares about the external . We see a representation of this with later on in the film after- Okja- is taken to the States .

There is a nuanced performance from each member of the cast . <p> Credit : Netflix Okja <p> But I think the true star of this film is newcomer Seo-Hyun Ahn .

The movie is accessible to audiences in a way that has n't  been done in mainstream media in awhile . There is enough sweetness and purity to make the pill easier to swallow but , like an onion , there are enough layers to peel back to leave audiences contemplating the topics Bong Joon Ho presents to us. 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

@@108166770 @3566770/ <p> For this episodes recap , I am going to focusing on the two primary things that were discussed just to keep it short and sweet . Like the episodes title name Chapter Six : The Monster , we get some more theories that surround the general existence and behavior of the monster present in the world of- Stranger Things . We also get some more insight into who Eleven is and how she is connected to the monsters ability to traipse between its dimension and what we perceive as our " regular " dimension . <p> First , well deal with the monster <p> Last we left off , Nancy was being chased by the monster in its dimension after trying to find where a dying deer had been dragged to . Jonathan was frantically trying to find her and discovers the slowly closing tree where Nancy had crawled into . Nancy , in the meantime , is trying to escape from the monster . In the last episode we figured out that sudden sounds can catch it off guard , but the sound of Nancys breathing does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual volume or pitch of the breathing , were not sure . However , even as its right near her , she managed to run a good 20 feet or so to the tree portal without it noticing her . Luckily , Nancy survives this encounter with the - monster . Will the next time be her last ? <p> When Jonathan and Nancy go back to her house , Nancy is the one to start connecting the dots behind the monsters behavior . She compares the monster to a shark due to its appearance whenever blood is spilled , which allowed me to give myself a pat on the back since I had theorized that after viewing the second episode . However , this further confirms the theory that Barb is probably pretty dead since her blood was what drew the monster to her . Nancy also notices that the monster only really seems to attack at night , suggesting that its possibly a nocturnal predator . This makes sense since we have yet to see someone during the day get mysteriously whisked off into the Upside Down yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trap to bring the monster to them by using fresh blood as a lure . Two scenarios come to mind as a result of this plan . 1 ) The plan confirms that the monster has a love affair with blood and they both die . 2 ) The monster does n't  show up and they will wallow in their own outlandish embarrassment . I 'm thinking the first scenario is the most plausible . Regardless , we have more clues to help us figure out how to take down the monster <p> Stranger Things <p> Now , well focus on Eleven <p> This episode we began to get more of an idea of the volatility and power behind Eleven and her abilities . We also get an explanation as to how she came to develop these powers once Hopper and Joyce discover that the clues theyve been following to find Will actually connect to Eleven . <p> We start off this venture in Joyces living room where she is lightly drilling him for information regarding what he had seen in the lab . It comes out that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , Hopper puts two-and-two together that the child may be connected to a woman Terry Ives he had read about in his research on Dr. Brenner . Hopper and Joyce come to a consensus that they need to find Terry to determine what actually happened to her missing child . <p> However , as they soon discover , Terry Ives is mentally gone . When they arrive to the Ives residence , her sister answers for her and tells them that it is a lost cause . As we see in this scene , Terry Ives is catatonic due to paid experiments she did with Dr. Brenner in the 1950s in order to make some quick cash . These experiments involved taking different types of drugs like LSD and being placed inside a tank full of water that amplifies the feeling of nothingness , the same type of tank that Eleven is placed in when Dr. Brenner wants her to hunt people down with her mind . It is revealed by Terrys sister that she had been pregnant during these experiments , showing us that the drugs may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more surprising , we learn that Eleven has a name Jane . Although Terry believes her daughter is alive , her sister admits that Terry had miscarried . Whether or not this is information she received from Dr. Brenner and his laboratory or whether this is something she actually witnessed is another story . <p> Stranger Things <p> These two factors the monster and Eleven come together when we are taken back into a flashback where Dr. Brenner has Eleven go into the isolation chamber full of water to go find the monster she ran away from in the previous session . He assures her that she is safe , however , he knows nothing . He s making empty promises to her in order to take advantage of her abilities for his own personal gain . She returns to the pitch black terrain we saw her in last episode and she is a tiny white blip in a sea of darkness . Eleven focuses and soon , in the distance , we make out the monster feasting on something . It does n't  appear to hear her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't until she touches it that it registers shes there and it roars . She screams . <p> And then the opening between worlds is born . We see Eleven and how her fear creates the rift between worlds , cracking the walls of the laboratory . This leads us to her admitting to Mike that it is all her fault . She had opened the gate and that she was the monster . Mike , being the sensible person that he is , tells her that this is not true . And , in fact , the monsters in Stranger Things- are just under our noses , blending into the scenery unlike Eleven or the monster lurking in the Upside Down . <p> That , I believe , is the lesson behind this episode . <p> GENERAL THOUGHTS &amp; MUSINGS <p> I did not really touch upon it , but Steve is probably my least liked character of this series . I also think he personified the monster title that this episode emphasized . Within the past couple of years and the rise of awareness surrounding rape culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his behavior towards Nancy rubbed me the wrong way , especially since he was the one spying on her and refusing to take her words into account . His wounded pride couldnt take the thought that she had chosen someone lesser than him and so , as is pretty typical at this point , he and his friends decide to slander her character in a public forum . I am sincerely hoping that he either gets a major attitude change or that he gets killed off because he s been irking me since the first episode . <p> I 'm still hoping that they find a way to develop Nancys character a bit more . I want to like her , but she still feels incomplete . <p> The more info we get on Eleven , the more she is appearing like Charlie from Firestarter . She is being groomed and kept isolated by someone interested in her powers . She is volatile and powerful . Her origin stories with a mother being experimented on are almost the same . Can I just re-name her Charlie please ? <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up more . This episode was slow . 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

@@108166789 @3566789/ <h> Iron Fist Ep . 5 Recap &amp; Review <p> CREDIT : David Giesbrecht/Netflix <p> Just when I think the writing may be getting better , Iron Fist tells me otherwise . <p> This episode has a heavy mixture of both good and bad elements . The weakest elements primarily have to do with Claire Temple ( Rosario Dawson ) making her appearance in the series as well as the continuation of the weak character drivel that are the Meachum siblings . The strongest elements pertain to a weird , date that was n't a date between Colleen and Danny and a rather awesome pier fight scene . <p> I love Rosario Dawsons Claire Temple . However , her appearance in Iron Fist seems rather redundant . We are finally re-introduced to her when we discover that she is a student at Colleen Wings dojo . Considering all the fighting shenanigans she gets dragged into , taking up self defense is a realistic and smart idea . Even more so when you realize she gets awfully chummy with superheroes that keep meeting the wrong people . Aside from this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitive fashion by having her sit and bear witness to whatever storytelling is happening i.e. the awkward faux date between Colleen and Danny or by stitching up a persons wounds because she is literally the only one that appears to know how to stitch things . If the writers do n't  figure out a way to give her more to do , then I will eat them . I will do it . I WILL EAT THEM . <p> Then there are the Meachum siblings . Ward is self destructing while Joy is , once again , trying to patch up someone elses mistake when presented with a lawsuit against Rand Enterprises . Although we continue to get glimpses of character development indicating that they are n't  one-note characters , the writers struggle to make these two fully formed . There 's only so much Tom Pelphrey and Jessica Stroup can do to salvage the writing that they are given . I keep hoping that , by the end of the series , they may be more interesting . We can only wait and see . <p> Credit : Netflix <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mysterious pier property and the fight scene that we got to witness . While ignoring the women with roller bags being involved with the heroin trade , Colleen and Danny did some great super sleuthing that ended up with a great battle sequence . And when I say great , I mean , great in the sense that the show has set the bar rather low . The end result of the fight leads to Claire Temple having to swoop in and try to save the heroin chemist guy from a life-threatening injury . If there 's a moment when Claire is not saving someone from a life threatening injury this season , I will be super pleased . Give that woman a vacay ! <p> All in all , the episode was just okay . We finally got the answer to the pier subplot that was introduced at the beginning of the season . It does confirm a theory of mine as to when Madame Gao was going to resume her heroin trade ( because she took a break back in Daredevil Season 2 ? Or maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my wondering when the series will improve past the point of okay . Weve gone from mediocre to a meh-worthy okay , but I need more than that to maintain my interest . <p> RANDOM MUSINGS <p> I am a bit confused , but understanding as to why Madame Gao was like , " IRON FIST IS HERE ? " Its easy to lump her into the " Shes a part of The Hand . She should know all " crowd , but people forget that the Meachums did n't  even think Danny Rand was Danny Rand . <p> Please , for the love of God , give Rosario Dawson more to do . <p> Colleen Wing , do not date Danny . It is a trap . <p> Is anyone else wondering if Danny is still a virgin ? You know , since he took that vow of chastity ? 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

Hasbros official Twitter account just tweeted at her saying this : " We love your passion for Rey , and are happy to share that we will be including her in the Monopoly : Star Wars game , available later this year . " You can check out Carries post here . <p> Huh . I guess talking about things works ! Sometimes , anyway . <p> ORIGINAL POST <p> Earlier today , our writer Katherine Sangiorgio- wrote an article about the fact that Rey wasnt included in the- Star Wars Monopoly set from- Hasbro . You have the option to play as Finn , Kylo Ren , Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader , but not Rey . In fact , the number of pieces are smaller than most other Monopoly games . Since then , the article has been making its way around the Internet , drawing the ire of fans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant feeling that toy companies do n't  care about female fans . Its egregious because Rey- is the star of the film . <p> I emailed Hasbro as well as tweeting at them for a statement . Well , they gave me one . Apparently they left Rey out because it spoils a plot point in- Star Wars : The Force Awakens . Yeah , the thing is , that 's not how Monopoly works . The top hat and the thimble werent plot points either . For the record , that plot point they did n't  want to spoil ? Its in the statement below . Be warned . <p> Hasbro , thanks for thinking of female fans eventually . Nice to know were getting more Rey toys from your statement , but you may notice how many more male character Star Wars- toys there are out there . Oh , and then there was leaving Rey out of the Target set that lead me to start the- #WheresRey hashtag to begin with . 150957 @qwx1010957 150959 @qwx1010959 <p> What bothers me is there is still plenty of Rey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like its nonexistent . I bought my little cousin a Rey action figure for Christmas ( the one with the jet pack ) and I was delighted last month to see right after film release to find for sale " Reys Lightsaber . " Not Finns , not Lukes . Reys . Wandering the Disney Store , every figurine pack of Force Awakens characters has included her and she 's been on clothing , book covers , posters , action figures , dress up costumes , etc . There 's certainly more of her than Finn and Poe , the films other two protagonists . I 'd say only Ren and BB-8 have more stuff than her and those two were expected to be the merchandise workhorses . <p> That 's a pathetically lame response . How does featuring the main character-the Luke of this new series-give away the plot ? Traditionally Monopoly has ten pieces to play with . Hasbro needs to stop being such cheap bastards and include Luke , Rey , Finn , Kylo Ren , Vader , Leia , Captain Phasma ( or Boba Fett ) BB-8 , R2-D2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint off to keep the price point down if need be , but this is ridiculous . <p> I call shinanigans . I know it is probably Monday morning quarterbacking to say that . Maybe I do n't  know the full story , but come on ! They did n't  want to spoil the film ? ? ? How does a game piece spoil a movie ? <p> At best , this is mysogonist irresponsibility . At worst , its a ploy by marketing to drum up a twisted publicity gimmick . Strictly my opinion , I am probably wrong . I do n't  know how toy companies work . But I would hope they will correct it by maybe selling an updated version of the game ( Unless , of course , that was their scheme all along ) <p> Ok , so having young Luke and his deceased father is ok , having Finn in that jacket is ok as well , but having Rey , the scavenger , is plot revealing and ca n't be used ? What a lame , lame officially response . I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can upgrade their Monopolys . <p> Just a week before the movie opened , Disney set off a bizarre chain of C&amp;D orders against Star Wars Action News , for posting a picture of a new Rey figure that had just been purchased at a Walmart in Iowa . The figure featured her in her " Resistance " outfit and included a lightsaber . They were THAT adamant about keeping Reys true nature a secret , and it was reported by several news sites , including Forbes : <p> And yes , Rey figures ARE out there , but they sell out the moment they hit the shelves . If you see 6 ? Black Series Finn , TIE Pilot , Resistance Soldier , Stormtrooper , or Chewbacca figures in a store , that means Rey ( who has now shipped in two separate case assortments , ) was also there , and was already sold . <p> Incidentally , that 6 ? Rey comes with a scale BB-8 figure , which instantly made her a must-have back in September when the line launched . Should you alter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #wheres where the hell is the Han Solo merchandise ? You know , the character who owns the freighter that Rey ends up piloting ? The one whos arguably the co-star of the movie ? The one portrayed by an actor who received top billing on the movie poster ? <p> Another thing : If Hasbro is supposedly slighting female fans because you cant find a Rey figure , I 'd suggest you walk one aisle over in your local store to the Marvel figures section . There , you 'll find 3-6 different female characters in the 6 ? Avengers , Ant-Man , and Spider-Man Legends lines . You 'll most likely find multiples of each , which begs the question : Is the issue a lack of female action figures , or is it the perceived lack of the specific female action figure that you want ? <p> This response makes no sense . Nothing about the figures existence would reveal anything about the plot . You know what DOES make sense though ? That they never saw the movie and ASSUMED Finn was the protagonist , based on how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R2-D2 , BB-8 , and C-3PO in an expansion pack ? Maybe with unique expansion cards included . I would n't be hard and everyones already used to in-app purchases and video game upgrades . Why would n't board games do something similar ? <p> What about Han Solo ? He was pretty close to being the main supporting actor , if not right at the top and certainly in the film more than Luke ( no spoiler ) . <p> Since both Rey and Finn were prominently featured in the trailer ( as was Han ) , it would not have been a spoiler to include her in the game , any more than it would be Finn . Darth Vader is n't even IN this movie .

After inspiring George Lucas to create Star Wars and create the circumstances that gave life to the legend of King Arthur , youd think the Legends would take a knee and let history unfold naturally .

That 's right , this weeks episode " Fellowship of the Spear " takes right into the heart of WW1 and next the myth himself , J.R.R. Tolkien . <p> **SPOILERS AHEAD** <p> While the " Fellowship of the Spear " may have a B plot that centers around the inspiration of Tolkien , the A plot is all about what to do with the Spear of Destiny . After a fun jaunt into the Reverse Flashs secret lair at the Vanishing Point , the Legends wind up with a restored Spear .

The sheer devastation , even on a small scale , conveyed over the course of an hour as the Legends , with all of their massive powers , could do little to abate the sheer volume of death . <p> This was an easy tie in to Amayas story line as she witnessed the specter of death awaiting the people of Zambezi in the future .

This is n't a " Rip Hunter has been brainwashed moment " , but rather someone who put his chips in with a new family and was betrayed .

With no reason to stay with a band of Hypocrites , Mick betrays them at the climax of our story and joins the Legion of Doom . <p> It was a perfect double cross that rang the bell of Leonard Snarts official return .

@@108166821 @3566821/ <h> Iron Fist Ep . 2 Recap &amp; Review <p> Credit : Netflix <p> In the premiere episode , Marvels Iron Fist left off on a bit of a cliff hanger where we saw Danny Rand ( Finn Jones ) had been drugged and involuntarily committed to a mental hospital . The majority of the second episode takes place in the mental facility in what turned out to be a rather disjointed episode . What stands out the most from this episode is that the show still has n't  quite figured out its purpose or its heart within the story and the characters . Although there were a couple of moments that stood out in the episode , the overall episode was relatively lackluster . <p> During this episode we focus on Danny Rand who 's been confined to a mental hospital . Although he still claims that he is Danny Rand , it is repeatedly pointed out to him that he has no proof . The hospital staff , particularily Rands psychiatrist Dr. Paul Edmonds , refers to Rand as Joey Anderson . Why ? That 's the name on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edmonds in this episode , unfortunately , is to provide more background on Danny Rand through a trial and error round of questioning . At one point it seems like , perhaps , Danny may not be who he says he is until Dr. Edmonds shows Danny an old Rand Enterprises commercial . Danny , of course , remembers the day of that commercial vividly because he was bribed with a visit to the circus after they were done filming . Curious , Dr. Edmonds calls up Joy Meachum to confirm the story and she does . Towards the end of the episode , Dr. Edmonds is convinced that Danny is who he says he is . <p> However , Dr. Edmonds is not convinced that Danny is sane . Dannys claims that he is the Iron Fist and was trained by monks in an alternative dimension . From a non superhero perspective and from the perspective of someone who 's apparently seen an uptick in people claiming to be superpowered beings since " The Incident " , Dr. Edmonds concern regarding Dannys sanity makes sense . Even more so since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Edmonds decides to keep Danny at the hospital and begin treatment for an anxiety disorder . Mind you , the man is n't 100% that its an anxiety disorder , but that is an entirely different cluster of a subject . <p> Meanwhile , Ward Meachums not-so-dead father Harold has determined that Danny is who he says he is by using the mental hospitals camera system to spy on the poor would-be superhero . He s even more convinced when he gets ballsy and goes to visit Danny in the hospital , knowing that Danny would be in a weakened state . Here is where we hear our first mention of Iron Fist and his connection to the Hand ( please consult Daredevil for reference ) . <p> Convinced that Danny is who he says he is , Harold orders Ward to take Danny and move him to a secure location due to his connection to the Hand . Given how influential the Hand was in Season 2 of Daredevil , it would be safe to assume interesting plot points are going to be surrounding them later on in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sends men to go beat the crap out of a strapped up Danny instead . <p> This leads to the arguably , frustrating moment at the end of the episode . <p> Given the caliber of previous Marvel TV shows , it is frustrating to me that we 've had to wait until the end of episode 2 to see a AH-HA ! superhero worthy moment . The moment I 'm referring to is when Dannys Iron Fist is triggered while having the crap beaten out of him by Wards men . He beats them up and proceeds to escape . With his Iron Fist fully activated , he punches his way to freedom from the psych ward and runs away . This is how the episode ends . <p> As of now , the show still has n't  quite found its footing and the series feels hollow without knowing which direction its going . The characters still feel somewhat lost or one-note . The only really interesting characters so far are Colleen Wing followed by Harold Meachum due to the fact that he is a mysteriously reborn being . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well see .

If I only knew that Future Barry would go full on dark clothes with long , dark hair swooping in front of his face , I would have never proclaimed Emo Barry . Its almost like Bane talking to Batman where he declares that Batman merely adopted the dark whilst he was molded by it . Our Barry merely dabbled in the dark , while Future Barry fully embraced the darkness , roots and all . <p> Then we have Caitlins Killer Frost persona locked up in Iron Heights , fully turned to the dark side . It was nice to see Danielle Panabaker glob onto this role and make it her own . Her journey from season one has been fairly nuanced and to see Caitlin go full on villain is a welcome reward . Julian on the other hand earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedicated to finding a cure , Julian has dedicated his life to Caitlin and to see him still picking away at a problem that may never heal really conveyed how much she means to him . <p> Then we have Joe and Wally West . Man , did their family get put through the ringer . Not only did Iris die at the hands of Savitar , but Wally was turned into a paraplegic with serious mental damage at the hands of the God of Speed . To make matters worse - Barry shut everyone out , which essentially isolated Joe . And that is what broke this superhuman father figure : the loss of his entire family . It was brutal , it was hard , and it set up exactly what was at stake for everyone in Team Flash . <p> Fortunately there 's a silver lining in every cloud and our bright spot is called H.R. Wells . After the dissolution of Team Flash H.R. , moved onto his real passion of storytelling . Not just any stories mind you , a Nicholas Sparks style of meta-human romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads from his latest work is absolutely hysterical as numerous women in the crowd start texting him lewd and obscene messages . Did I mention he bought Jitters ? Yeah , he did . Basically the future for H.R. is the stuff of adolescent male fantasies , and good on him . <p> Regardless , the grimdark of Season 4 seemed to turn back to hope as Barry tried to get the band back together . After a rather rousing speech , Team Flash kicked off the dust , found the drum sticks and got back to work . It certainly felt like a victory for the fans , and quite frankly was sorely needed . It reminded us how much hope Barry Allen carries with him and how important it is to keep that hope front and center even when the world is falling apart . It was also a huge nod to the enduring status between Cisco and Barry as BFFs . We needed to see it go on , no matter what and that made the journey feel far more positive than it may have been otherwise. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there seems to be a sense that no matter what happens , the family will survive . <p> Also , can we talk about the new Flash costume ? Bright red , bolder golds , and a slightly more sculpted suit made Barry seem far more sleeker and movie ready than ever before . Its definitely still in a prototype stage that needs work with fitting , but I hope we see Barry go in this direction soon ( Season 4 perhaps ? ) as he really popped- off screen . <p> Sonext week is it the reveal of Savitar . Its about time . We all know the thoeries , we all know the facts , but who will it turn out to be ? I 'm still laying even money on Barry or Wally , though I hope its the former . Finding out you are your own worst enemy is just too juicy to pass up and will finally kick Barry in the pants to go back and fix the events of Flashpoint .

@@108166823 @3566823/ <h> Overwatch Reveals Symmetra is on Autism Spectrum <p> Credit : Overwatch <p> It was revealed today by Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan in his response in a fans letter on Tumblr , which you can read here , that Symmetra is on the autism spectrum.The comic that prompted this initial fan letter can be found in its entirety here . <p> In a direct quote from the letter , Kaplan responds : <p> It was very astute of you to notice that she mentioned the spectrum in our comic. - Symmetra is autistic . She is one of our most beloved heroes and we think she does a great job of representing just how awesome someone with autism can be . <p> via Tumblr <p> Credit : Blizzard <p> I 'm going to get this out of the way now before I continue speaking somewhat intelligently . Holy shit ! And FINALLY ! This is unbelievable and awesome and , just , so many things that my brain is shutting down while trying to process all of the emotions that are currently hitting me right at this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one with an autism diagnosis to look up to in pop culture media . I 'm not sure about anyone else , but I really could only relate to Spock growing up and he was n't even autistic . If there were representations of people with autism , they were usually portrayed as a white male with unfortunately awkward behavioral patterns and oftentimes are utilized as comedic relief . I point to the Forrest Gump movie as an example . I do n't  recall any female autistic characters in media growing up . It was n't until the Temple Grandin movie was released a few years ago that I could really see someone like me onscreen . <p> Kaplans focus on diversity in Overwatch has been one of the most exciting things to watch unfold before our eyes . He had announced at the 2017 Gamers Conference the purpose behind the development teams focus on open mindedness and diversity : <p> " We wanted there to be heroes that felt approachable to each person , " Kaplan said at the conference . " We all like different things , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about humanity and making a game on planet Earth : how awesome the differences are . " <p> For a girl who was always made to feel different because of societys distaste and fear towards Autism , hearing and seeing a female character on the spectrum in one of the most arguably popular games out there makes my heart soar. - I think the part that really gets me is that this character represents two minorities within the spectrum a woman of color . Women are frequently underdiagnosed with Autism and , as a result , do n't  get the proper help that theyd need . Another thing is both women and people of color on the spectrum are underrepresented in research studies and , as a result , in our mainstream society . <p> Before I allow myself to get overly emotional , which I 'm completely failing at right now , by announcing that this character is on the Autism Spectrum , Jeff Kaplan and the development team of Overwatch have provided the current and next generation of autistic individuals with role models that they can look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to see ourselves represented in a way that does n't  make us out to be fools or monsters . We finally can see ourselves in a positive role model , in a character that is incredibly badass and amazing .

" <p> One other issue plaguing Star Wars collectors young and old is the hard-to-find women from the Rebels toy line . Sabine Wren will be much easier to find in 2016 , as she 's being included in the 6 ? Black Series line , as well as a brand new 3.75 ? figure based on her Season Two look .

And Hasbro does have plans to release him , following up on the Han Solo available now and General Leia figure coming later this Spring . One fun way to release Luke would be a throwback to the 80s toy line , offering him as a mail-order exclusive , a concept Hasbro has n't  ruled out . <p> " Were going to do Luke Skywalker , were just deciding what the right time is , because Luke got so little screen time , and there 's still so many Force Awakens characters and Classics we have n't gotten to I cant tell you for sure when he s coming , but he is coming , but it may very well be later down the line .

We 've got Farmboy Luke , we 've got Bespin , we 've got Hoth and Jedi we 've done him a lot , he s obviously a major character , so were just trying to figure out when the time is right . We think he might be too big to do as a mail-away exclusive , we 'd want to put him in a retail release line .

While Hasbro did not reveal a follow-up vehicle in this scale at Toy Fair , they did share what vehicle they want to see get the toy treatment most . <p> " I 'd say Lukes Landspeeder .

@@108166826 @3566826/ <p> Sunday March 8th is International Womens Day . In celebration of this day , I thought it would be fun to talk about 10 roles in movies and television that not only defied stereotypical depiction of women , but have also become icons in their own right . Of course this is n't a comprehensive list and there are still plenty of examples not featured here , but this is a great starting point . For the purposes of this list , one of the main components I 'll be discussing is a characters sense or purpose and motivation , also known as agency . Each character is not listed because they are " badass " though some of theme certainly are but instead are measured by how much they take control of their own actions and are defined by their choices . <p> If you have n't checked out each of these roles/movies/shows , I highly encourage you to take the time to do so . <h> 10 . The Bride ( portrayed by Uma Thurman ) <p> If you have n't seen the Kill Bill Duology , you 're really missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Bride " ; a woman , eight months pregnant , shot in the head at her wedding dress rehearsal by her ex , the titular Bill . Surprisingly , The Bride survives and wakes up years later from a coma bent on revenge against Bill and his accomplices . The story is as they say a roaring rampage of revenge , and its a lot of fun . That 's not what qualifies The Bride for this list though . During the story director Quentin Tarantino peels back the layers , revealing the Bride and how she became the lioness hellbent on getting revenge . While the action is top notch , its the quiet moments that really make you feel for this woman and how she had been brainwashed into becoming an instrument of death . When the inevitable plot twist is revealed , the tone of the movie is not that of a righteous battle between two sworn enemies but rather a long conversation as to why they have reached this point . Its not loud and its certainly not bloody . Its a moment that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you believe it . <h> 9 . Donna Noble ( portrayed by Catherine Tate ) <p> Some of you might be saying " Donna Noble , why her ? " Well let me explain . I 'm a huge fan of Doctor Who and I have always enjoyed the dynamic of the companion accompanying the titular Doctor across the cosmos on adventures and hijinks . That 's all they are though , accompaniment . Some of the greatest companions have merely been- someone to act as the eyes and ears of the audience To ask the questions we need to- understand what the heck is going onand that 's great . But that 's not Donna Noble . In fact , what made Donna so different from other companions is her ability to challenge the Doctor . In her first appearance Noble stops the Doctor from committing genocide and grounds him back to earth . She also rejected his first offer to become a companion . Donna did n't  want to be someone who was merely a passenger , she wanted to be an equal . A year later when she finally became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors assumptions and made him question decisions and rediscover his humanity . In the end , she even gained the powers of a Time Lord become the " Doctor Donna " , which is still one of the best moments in the history of the modern show . No matter how you slice it , Donna was different . She was n't a love interest and she was n't smitten with a crush . She was the Doctors Best Friend and that 's a title no other companion has ever been given . <h> 8 . Katniss Everdean ( portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence ) <p> Its so awesome that currently , the biggest box office franchise in the world is The Hunger Games , spearheaded by the main character of Katniss Everdrean . What makes her so memorable is that she refuses to play by the rules . I do n't  mean an anarchist but rather someone who refuses to be a pawn in other peoples games . The entire story of the Hunger Games is the evolution of Katniss from a young woman who is willing to give up her life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon that throws a nation into a civil war . Katniss inherent independence and ability to find her own way when things seem hopeless have made her a role model for millions of women across the world . The best part is Hollywood has taken notice . <h> 7 . Hermione Granger ( portrayed by Emma Watson ) <p> While she may not be the main character in the Harry Potter series we can all agree that without Ms. Grangers help , Harry would have died halfway through the first book . There are entire corners of the internet lauding the awesomeness of the uber powerful witch and why shouldnt they ? Throughout the story , Hermione is made fun of for being smart and tenacious , yet she never gives into peer pressure . She never loses sight on becoming the best she can be and to hell with anyone who does n't  believe in her . What 's more telling about the character is how she challenges- her friends constantly and their preconceived notions . By the final installment , its not Hermione who has changed but her closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal , moreover someone to be respected in a crisis and not one to be teased . She vanquishes a much greater evil than that of Voldermort , she vanquishes sexism amongst those near and dear to her heart . Take that , Harry . <h> 6 . Mary Poppins ( portrayed by Julie Andrews ) <p> Seriously , its Mary-freaking-Poppins . Julie Andrews portrays the lovable " nanny " of the Banks family . During her tenure there she teaches the children to be independent , resourceful , creative and proper . While she may seem like an odd choice , I would like to point out that at no point does Mary Poppins have to be saved by a hero , become distressed , or even have a real love interest ( all calling cards for " classic " female roles ) . Instead she drives to the heart of problems , finds solutions , and still has time to make sure the children are in bed on time . She is stern , yet caring . An obedient employee and yet finds a way to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle who flies . Do you need anything more ? How about this : this was all in a movie made in 1964 . Mary Poppins was " badass " without ever resorting to violence . She was- strong in motivations and yet- never sacrificed- her femininity . Modern movies wish they could be as awesome as Mary Poppins . <h> 5 . Buffy Summers ( portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar ) <p> Look , I could have said " pick a Joss Whedon role " and that would have been fair . I decided on the legendary Vampire Slayer because there 's something about Buffy that makes her infinitely relatable . In the story , Buffy is the " Slayer " , a chosen girl who has the power to defend the world against the forces of darkness . When she dies , another girl is called and so on and so forth . First , the fact that the chosen one happened to be female was a revolutionary concept when the show premiered . What made it even more intriguing was the metaphor of being a Slayer and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the show we experience first loves , heartbreak , drug use , sexual orientation , coping with death , and the onslaught of responsibility . That 's what made Buffy work so well , each episode built on a concept about what it was like to be a teenager , regardless of gender and took you through a journey . Buffy- made you forget stupid stereotypes and allowed you to get the message : " were all screwed up and were all trying to survive " . Its powerful stuff and changed how we looked at what could be accomplished with a TV show about growing up . <h> 4 . Lt. Nyota Uhura ( portrayed by Nichelle Nichols ) <p> Ive been rewatching the original Star Trek series for the first time in years and it never fails to impress upon me how amazing Nichelle Nichols was as Lt. Uhura . Not only was she a headliner on an uber popular franchise in the 60s but she was also black . While this wasnt uncommon , the fact she was part of the senior staff and an equal makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people of all backgrounds and ethnicities . In fact Whoopi Goldberg has said when she first saw Uhura on TV : " I just saw a black woman on television ; and she ai n't  no maid ! " Moreover , on a show that frequently depicted women as rank of " Yoemen " - or Stewarts/Secretaries Uhura was a full fledged member of the crew . As Communications Officer she was trained in the translation of code , interpreting strange languages and oftentimes would jump on helm control in a crisis . While she did occasionally take the role of the damsel in distress , Uhura would also take the role as the ships constant ever vigilant at her station . <h> 3 . Sarah Connor ( as portrayed by Linda Hamilton ) <p> You 're the mother of the free world . Machines from the future travel to the past to kill you so you can never give birth to the man who will ultimately defeat them . You are the crux in which humanity will either be saved or doomed . This is Sarah Connor . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see something that happens rarely in female roles of the era : an evolution of scope . In the first movie , Sarah is simply a waitress living her life and enjoying being a 20 something looking to settle down . After meeting Kyle Reese , she would not only be told of the impending doom of the world but also her role in it . From that point , we see a character change onscreen unlike any before its time . She went from a regular everyday person to a hard , relentless tool that had one purpose : train her son to survive by any means necessary . She became a literal badass , trained in all forms of combat and guerrilla warfare , but so many forget why this was important . It was n't because she was " so cool " . Instead , we see that Sarah becomes what she hates the most : a machine . Hellbent on saving humanity she nearly loses her own in order to protect the future and when presented with that cold hard reality , she backs down . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice and still be vulnerable , and that is unique . Sarah Connor is the 100% perfect depiction of what we want from an action star , but what makes her defy stereotypes is that when she reached that precipice , she backed away . It takes guts to fight the fight but it takes true courage to stop yourself from becoming the thing you hate most . <h> 2 . Ellen Ripley ( portrayed by Sigourney Weaver ) <p> Whereas Sarah Connor might be the ultimate badass , Ellen Ripley is the ultimate survivor . Third in command of the ship Nostromo , Ripley encounters the " Alien " and struggles to escape its unending pursuit of her and her comrades . What made Ripley so much of a landmark role is that according to legend , she was originally written for a man . When no actor was nailing the role , a creative casting director brought in Sigourney Weaver to read for the character and that 's all she wrote . It was one of the first cases I know of that character was put in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing that women were just as engaging in lead roles as men could be in genre/sci-fi/action films . In fact , when writing roles , gender should almost be an afterthought . Through this role Ripley would become an icon in sci-fi and for millions around the world . When she took the mantle back up in the 80s for " Aliens " well that just cemented what we already knew . You do n't  mess with a lady who considers planetary nuclear bombardment a viable option for survival , cause chances are you 're gon na lose . <h> 1 . Princess Leia Organa ( portrayed by Carrie Fisher ) <p> Did you really expect anyone else to claim the top spot on a site called Legion of Leia ? Princess Leia became an absolute game changer for women around the world the moment she was rescued from the Death Star . While she may have the dubious origin of getting captured by the villainous Darth Vader , as soon as she escaped her cell with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker , Leia took control . Ca n't find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage chute ! Need plans for a super-weapon of planetary destruction ? Gim me a week , my summer ship and my trusty droids to get the job done .

The inclusion of Mary Poppins took me by surprise , but you are right . she used chaos and imagination as weapons of order and love , and brought the Banks family together . ( I would put Nanny McPhee in the same category . ) <p> In terms of Joss Whedons work , I 'd like to add the women of Firefly as roles that defied stereotypes , especially if you regard " Firefly " as a western , and not a space opera . Youve got the fast-shooting first officer , the ships engineer both women . Your mystery guest / target is a frail little thing who is not helpless by any means . And your " working woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , really . But so often , especially in space it seems gender is just besides the point . Survival first . Something to eat , fuel for the ship . Then we worry about gender politics . Refreshing ! ! <p> Actually , the LAST thing Katniss cares about is who she is dating . Shes really just trying to survive . But everyone else cares about who she is dating and she 's forced into dealing with it . She cares about both Gale and Peeta , but she does n't  want to date either of them . She just wants to protect her family and live her life <p> She did n't  care about dating at all she did what she had to do to survive its one of the things that made her a refreshing character . <p> I do n't  think she should be on the list either though Mostly because for the majority of the books/movies she is only reacting to situations she is put into vs so many female characters that are proactive and drive the plot . <p> Hi . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being put here . Not because I disagree with the fact that she was awesome ( which she is ) but because she 's part of the revived DW series , meaning that the women portrayed in the newer series will obviously have a larger ( and subsequently , better ) role to play . <p> If she was a companion in the 70s , I 'd have lauded your choice , but she 's a character from just a few years ago . Of COURSE shed be strong and independent . In the last 5-6 years itself we have had better female role models who have broken numerous stereotypes . <p> Donna was an awesome companion , no doubt . But she was n't good enough to be put in this list of iconic characters . Olivia Dunham deserved that spot a lot more than Donna , that 's for sure . <p> Fantastic list ! Also agree that having Mary Poppins in there is brilliant . Of course , slaying vampires , fighting Lord Voldemort , saving Newt from the Queen Alien , helping to defeat the T-1000 , etc , is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Mary tackles daily toil and strife , like looking after your neighbour who ca n't stop laughing on the ceiling or confronting the problem of absent parents with discretion and care whilst singing lessons about dealing your problems head on and learning to see past the end of your nose . Mary never feels the need to explain herself and brings a family back to life again . Practically perfect in every way ( as are all the other people who are the same height as Julie Andrews whilst wearing those shoes ) <p> My dearest Husband is Shaun , I argued with him to include Vasquez over Ripley . We all respect Ripley , but when as a badA$$ big gun carrying hispanic ( well on screen anyway ) woman seen before ? &lt;3 you Shaun , had to have my say ! ! = <p> Obviously , the list was geared to " tough-surviving " women . Adding Mary Poppins was a joke , right ? Use her in a Different Top 10 list along with Donna Reed , June Cleaver and all those other hard-working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the list , but would have put Uma Thurman The Bride near the top . Honorable Mention : Cher &amp; Meryl Streep in Silkwood and Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs . <p> Very good list . Leia definitely deserves to be first as she WAS the first ( I know Mary Poppins came earlier in time , but she was a proper lady and Leia was NOT a stereotypical princess ) . Hermione Granger , though , deserves to be higher . While your comments are complimentary , Shaun , the truth is she SHOULD have been the hero of the story . The only reason she was n't is because western society is not ready YET for an epic hero who is female . Hermione had the brains and the ability . I do n't  agree that Harry would have died halfway through had it not been for Hermione ; he would have died in the first book .

@@108166831 @3566831/ <h> Review : Goosebumps <p> Although common wisdom ( and the MPAA ) dictates that we shield our children from horror imagery , I can say from experience " and I think many of you will agree " that young kids can already grasp the thrill of being scared . Indeed , I think children might like being scared more than they let on . As children , we tend to be drawn to horror movies and scary stories , seeking the verboten , taboo thrill of monsters and death , so vivid in our imaginations , so cleverly hidden by the adults in our lives . I am too old to be in the demographic for R.L. Stines Goosebumps books ( published from 1992 to 1997 , my high school and college years ) , but I can appreciate their appeal and understand their function . Goosebumps gave children a chance to indulge in horror fantasies without having to worry about violence and death , getting the full thrill of a monster with only half the threat levels . It was just scary enough for the tykes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film by bland family director Rob Letterman ( Gullivers Travels ) , and it is a sweet , gentle thriller that makes up in wit and visual appeal what it lacks in grit and , well , actual scares . The story " conceived by celebrity screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski " pits R.L. Stine himself ( played by Jack Black ) , as well as a trio of teenagers ( Dylan Minnette , Odeya Rush , and Ryan Lee ) against every single monster from Stines series , which have been magically kept prisoner inside the original Goosebumps manuscripts , and who are being wrangled and led by the vengeful living ventriloquist dummy Slappy ( also Black ) . <p> Heroes of kids movies " especially those played by vaguely handsome white teenage boys " tend to be bland avatars , their dialogue rarely pushing beyond mere description . Goosebumps is mercifully possessed of a small amount of wit , and surrounds its central hero ( Minnette ) with flip , witty people . His mother ( Amy Ryan ) , for instance , does more than wring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . His love interest ( Rush ) is more than a prize to be won , and his best friend is an amusing coward in the Shaggy mould . Jillian Bell from 22 Jump Street is a powerful comedienne to keep an eye on , and , as Minnttes boy-crazy aunt , she steals every scene she 's in . <p> The meta-narrative is perhaps the cleverest approach one can bring to an adaptation like this , and Goosebumps takes a lot of cues from the meta-horror cult fave The Cabin in the Woods ( as well as the 1991 John Candy comedy Delirious ) . Goosebumps , however , has no highfalutin pretensions of trying to dissect fiction , and no ambitious to explode narrative norms . It merely wants to poke its fingers at the fourth wall , testing its surface tension , while still including familiar nostalgia imagery from the original books . I imagine that fans of the original series will be clapping their hands in delight to see some of their favorite childhood monsters finally brought to life . <p> I just wish that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarier . Aside from a towering praying mantis , and , to a lesser degree , a snarling werewolf , there is n't too much that is genuinely creepy about Goosebumps ; for a film that is ostensibly horror for kids , its disappointingly low on fright . This is a movie that makes feints at fear , but only ends up being about as scary as The Monster Mash . Not that little kids need to see something dark and hard-edged " they can get enough of that accidentally catching scenes from The Walking Dead at home " but they can handle more than what Goosebumps gives them ; picture something like Coraline or ParaNorman or Frankenweenie . Those films had a more appealing aesthetic , and some genuinely off-putting moments . Goosebumps is more a candy-coated Halloween confection . An adventure with monsters . A few moments of actual horror would have been nice . Although , perhaps I 'm just a weird horror junkie who read Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark too often . <p> Children deserve good horror stories , and every 7-year-old on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colorful , energetic , enjoyable , stop-gap for them until they 're ready for a PG-13 rating . <p> Witney Seibold has been- a film critic for nearly 20- years , and is currently the co-host of The B-Movies Podcast on CraveOnline .

@@108166843 @3566843/ <p> I got a chance to chat with Anne about the new site , the book , which came out of a series of tweets by Wil , a big event they 're hosting in Pasadena ( check out the info here ) and how it all came about . Check out what she has to say below ! <p> Legion of Leia : - First of all , " Increase Awesome " is a fantastic name ! <p> Anne Wheaton : - Its so funny ! You can name a charity anything you want , as long as the name is available . And we tried four different ways of something being awesome and they were all taken . Which is great . I think that 's a really great thing . Most of the information about why were doing this is in the- " Our Mission " - section of the site , but well raise funds to help these organizations . One of the things that came up with doing the Wiggle Waggle Walk note : Anne and Wil created two celebrity pet calendars to raise funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site. is that people loved the idea of having a place for donation and getting this cool calendar . But it was almost like they felt guilty for basically supporting Pasadena Humane Society when they should it felt like , if they were going to support a Humane Society , they should do it in their home town . So this way , its just about supporting a charity and not any sort of specific " it should be in my hometown " thing . No matter what it is . ACLU and Planned Parenthood are national organizations . I believe NAMI is , also . For Ronald McDonald House , we support the one that is in Pasadena CA by Huntington Hospital . <p> Also , when Wils gotten a bunch of games to test for Tabletop , whatever they end up not using , we donate to the Ronald McDonald House or Five Acres , which is a home in Altadena CA for abused kids and to abused women and children shelters . Its just a cool way for our foundation to do cool things to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are project specific , like this book . <p> Legion of Leia : - Ooh , tell me about the book ! It looks adorable ! <p> Anne Wheaton : - I think that , probably a year ago , Wil started writing these little tidbits of dog advice from Seamus , like he was teaching Marlowe how to be a dog . They were so funny to me , and he just started calling them " The Guide to Being a Dog " by Seamus Wheaton and they were so funny that several of our friends and people on Twitter said , " You should make this into a book . " As I realized that he had actually written enough to make a small book , I said , I really want to do this . Lar deSouza has done silly little drawings for our pets before and I love his style of drawing them because he just gets their personalities and faces so well . So when I decided to do this through Twitter , you can request an archive of your tweets , and since Wil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , it took almost two weeks to get his Twitter archives ! laughs And then we had to do a phrase search , so we searched for " a guide to being a dog " and we collected , I think , about 50 tweets . Then I decided to have it that Seamus was giving Marlowe the advice because Marlowe is the younger dog that is newer to our house . And Lar , oh my gosh , there are so many cute pictures in there ! <p> He did it where Seamus has a blue pen and he s chewing it up on a rug . And he says , basically , when you chew up a pen , do it on a white rug , because art is important . And Seamus is just going to town and there 's this ink all over the place and Marlowe is looking at him like , " Oh yes , I understand . " Shes very curious and intently listening to all of his advice , so its all totally ridiculous . Silly things like , if you bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same thing with helicopters . There are multiple ones about digging holes , because the project of digging a hole is never complete . If they fill the hole , its your job to go back and recreate the hole . Lots of silly ones . and the thing that I love that Lar did is that he included the cats . Theres Watson or Luna or both in every picture . With Luna , you do n't  see her face because she has her back to you . Shes always pissed off . In the beginning of the book , we had them do it so it looks like little framed portraits that are caricatures of each person , each character in the book . Seamus : the Teacher . Marlowe : the Student . Watson : the Sidekick . Luna : the Cranky One , and even in that frame , her back is to us ! laughs Its so cute ! I think Wil and I are listed as : the Parents . I just love it . He just captured everything perfectly . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the very first page is in memory Riley " I 'm a dog ! " Wheaton . And he got her happy face and how she would sit and her legs would go out to the side he drew it perfectly . Its so cute . <p> Legion of Leia : And you guys have actions that you 're doing as well ? <p> Anne Wheaton : We have been doing them throughout the year ! We got an entire set of games that were played on Tabletop and each person that was a guest that played that game signed it themselves . With that we 've been collecting funds . That 's going into our foundation also , and we do financial contributions to the Ronald McDonald house . We do them as an eBay auction . Since they 've been signed , we have to list them as " used , " but theyve never been played . Wil has a good rating with eBay , so even though its listed as " used , " we can write out that its just new with the plastic off . But anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be auctioned off , we can do that . I would just write a letter , so whoever is donating can just write a value if they , say , books to donate , and then we will write them a letter for their tax deductible donation and the value , and then we turn around and auction them off . <p> Legion of Leia : - You have a cool event coming up , right ? <p> Anne Wheaton : - Yes ! Our friends Patrick and Stephanie Kirchen own a restaurant called Crossings in South Pasadena and its in an historic building on Mission and its called Crossings because its right by the Gold Line station and they 've got this really amazing place . So I wanted to do some sort of fund raising event there . Stone Brewing Co. - has given us a few cases of Woot Stout created by Wil 2.0 , and they said , when you do an event , then serve the beer . So its been in the fridge . The best thing about that beer is that it ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Crossings for a year , waiting for us to do something . Were calling it Burgers , Beer and a Book ! Its $100 per person and its limited space . Were only doing this for 100 people , maximum . They 're doing multiple flavors of super yummy Kobe beef sliders and fries and you get a tasting of Woot Stout and a full bar . But , if anyone drinks a whole pint of Woot Stout , they wont be able to feel their face ! laughs They get to take the glass home , too . And they 're doing ice cream slider for dessert !

@@108166846 @3566846/ <p> At a recent Moana press day- Legion of Leia sat down with Eric Goldberg , - one of- Disneys- Renaissance animators , to chat about his latest work on the upcoming film .

We got a chance to hear stories about how the actors he s worked with over the years , including the late great- Robin Williams , are a part of his inspiration in an unexpected way when animating . <p> Legion of Leia : - Coming on board for- Moana what was it that drew you to the project and inspired the creation of Mini Maui as a character ? <p> Eric Goldberg : Every now and again us 2D animators will do a rough pencil test as kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maui and I animated some scenes on toddler Moana and the ocean . To get the discussion going so to speak . As the story process progressed Mini Maui ( a sentient tattoo of Maui on Maui ) started to emerge as a character in his own right . Everyone responded to not only the notion of moving tattoos but that Maui and Mini Maui had this relationship together and that was fun to explore . On of the things John Lasseter wanted to explore was not only that Mini Maui was Mauis conscience but also can give it back to him a little bit . He turns the screws on Maui ! That 's what he does once in a while . Its a fun aspect of the character . They all love and support one another ultimately and that 's part of the heart of what a Disney movie is . <p> Legion : Does he get some musical number action in the film ? <p> Goldberg : ( laughs ) All I can tell you is he s not a bad dancer . <p> Legion : - As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicality of the characters are reflected by the moves of the real life actors portraying them ? In this case Dwayne Johnson voicing this larger than life demi-god . <p> Goldberg : - ( Mauis ) the sun and everybody else is the solar system . ( Laughs ) You cant just imitate what the actors do . Its never going to become a character in his own right . He s never going to be that character of Maui . So you take your influences from all sorts of things . Even though Dwayne is a huge part of who this character is , there 's a physicality to Maui and his movements that comes from all sorts of sources . One of them is we had Polynesian dancers come in and show us traditional dance steps which they incorporated into the Maui animation . I think that 's great ! I do n't  know if Dwayne can dance like that or not . That 's where you pull aspects from all sort of the things culturally and attitudes that help not only inform who the voice actor is but inform this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Genie is n't just Robin Williams in animated form but there are aspects of him there . <p> Goldberg : One of the things that people ask me is if I referred to reference of Robin ( Williams ) a lot ( on Genie ) and I did n't  refer to it a lot . The reason is I was a huge fan of Robin but if you watched Robin act , he had arm lock a lot of the time . I wanted the Genie to have more movement , I wanted Genie to be as expansive as Robins vocal cords . So it was a different style of movement than Robin had . Are there aspects of Robin in the Genie ? Sure but in terms of the style of movement he was a larger character visually than Robin was as a person . <p> Legion : It was also cool to see winks to the Rocks mannerisms in Maui like the eyebrow too ! <p> Goldberg : Sometimes its something as small as a mouth shape . When I was doing Phil in Hercules , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips did this really weird shape did a really weird shape every time he did and s or ch sound and I started putting that on Phil and his lip synch really improved .

Fans of the Iron Fist comic character will be able to recognize Danny Rands mentor Lei Kung , who makes his live-action appearance in this series . One of the more interesting parts of this episode , Lei Kung mentors Danny mostly through voiceover that only he can hear . However , we do get to physically see him . <p> Lei Kungs mentorship serves a dual purpose . His words serve to strengthen Danny , but they also serve as a great distraction for a young man who is full of so much doubt as he battles between being the Iron Fist and reassuming the identity of Danny Rand . We learn that the Iron Fist must singlemindedly pursue The Hand . It does n't  matter if a civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bay . When Danny Rand makes a decision to save a womans life after Madame Gao changes the rules of her duel , the apparition of Lei Kung walks away from Danny with silent <p> The strongest parts of this episode centered on the duel between Madame Gaos best fighters and Danny Rand . This is where we were introduced to lesser known comic book characters : Scythe , the Bride of Nine Spiders , and the Veznikov brothers . Scythe and the Bride stole the fight for me personality-wise and fighting-wise . Dannys moves , althought brilliant , are predictable . And , considering Dannys immature personality , hearing his opponents point out his character flaws and trying to lure him to his death was just very appealing . The Veznikov brothers , although verbally entertaining , were the weakest fighters to watch . Blood circle of sorcery and all . <p> Credit : Netflix <p> The weakest part of this episode was , again , the Meachums . Although I think the signs of Wards inevitable breakdown were in place prior to this episode , the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then leading him to breaking his hand in order to get more drugs were a bit out of character . If there had been a better lead up to this particular path for Ward , I would find it more easy to follow . That being said , I do feel sorry for him due to him having seen a decapitated head and him , as any person would do if they had never seen a dead person before , reasonably freaking out while under extreme stress . <p> My only note for Joy is that I 'm preparing to eat the writers for not doing more with her . Theres been no character progression for about three episodes now and so , at this point , she 's just there as filler . Do something else with her please .

@@108166859 @3566859/ <h> Game of Thrones Finale Review Mothers Mercy Why I Hated It <p> Hey Legion ! Our Christina Janke will be posting her recap and review later today , but I had to weigh in on last nights- Game of Thrones finale . Ive been talking about it on social media , and I posted a place for you to post- your opinions , which I 'm dying to hear . Obviously there are going to be SPOILERS for last nights Season 5 finale Mothers Mercy , so consider yourself warned . In addition , there will be spoilers in the comments . Please mark BOOK SPOILERS if you 're putting any in there . <p> Okay , here- goes my rant . I hated last nights finale . It undid all the brilliant work of the first four seasons . If you 've been reading my work for any amount of time , you know how much Ive loved the show and how disappointed I was in this season . First of all , the scene with Jon Snow was n't what upset me last night . That is in the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harington cut his hair a bit shorter , so it was kind of expected by book readers . You could see it coming when Sam left with Gilly and the baby . Sure , he could be resurrected by Melisandre ( ooh , I want to see someone take her out ) . Maybe the Nights King who gave him the skunk eye two weeks ago will make him part of the icy army . Does n't  matter . Not saying I loved seeing him go , but I feel like they earned it . Theyve been hinting for some time . ( By the way , Harington said he is n't coming back . ) <p> Daenerys is off in some plains area with her injured dragon and no food and the Dothraki just show up ? What ? Did Drogon mentally call them in ? " Hey guys , mom totally locked up my brothers , so come get her . " And that ring that she dropped in the middle of a huge area of course it will be magically found by her pursuers because plot ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He s just too full of ouchies to come get her now ? <p> Cerseis walk of shame was in the books and expected as well . But did we have to spend half the episode on it ? That 's one of my issues this season . It was completely uneven . This should have been the third episode . They dragged the hell out of every story , and the things they- should have showed us ( Brienne of Tarth ! Tyrion ! ) got short shrift . It felt like overkill and a way to keep showing us naked Cersei . I have zero issues with nudity , by the way . This just felt like it went on forever and ever . I got the point 3 minutes in . That 's the other issue . They 're beating us over the head with things this season . Yes , Ramsays awful . We get it . Things are dire . We get it . The earlier seasons were balanced with some hope , whether or not we knew it was futile . This is pretty much sorrow porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't every other scene . We got more Tyrion . It was n't all pure misery . Cersei is not a character you 're really going to feel for , even after her seven hour walk of shame . She had Ned killed . She encouraged Joffreys monstrous behavior . Shes screwing her brother . She killed the king . A little gook and bloody feet do n't  matter in the face of that . ( For the record , in the books , Cersei contemplates others who have taken this walk and thinks about how , passing the spot Ned was killed in , her actions started it all . Far more interesting than what we saw . ) <p> Arya I love this character . I loved watching her take down Meryn Trant . However , there was no reason to put those other little girls in there to be beaten . Again , we know he s awful . Just having Arya in there with another face would have worked . It was established what a pig he was last week . The whole House of Black and White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so slow . I loved the story in the books . It moved faster . Yes , a- book moved faster than a TV show . Should I be able to say that ? In addition , the scenes ( as were the ones on the wall ) were so dark that it gave me a headache to watch . Did you spend too much on the dragon ? Couldnt afford lights ? What ? <p> Next , let 's talk about Dorne . Not a great story in the books , but it was torture to watch . Terribly written characters and what the hell was with the Bronn story ? Did you put that in there for a reason ? The stupid bad pussy line . None of this makes any sense . I do n't  buy the attraction . I do n't  buy any of it . The lipstick plot was pretty obvious to anyone who has ever read a fantasy novel . Or watched- Firefly . If a kiss makes little sense or lasts too long , its poison . I liked the Myrcella/Jamie scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that and Tyrion and Varys . So about 1/16th of the show . <p> Stannis death by Brienne he deserved it , but it felt like a cop out . Ive been waiting to see this woman all season and we 've gotten dribs and drabs . She misses the candle by a few seconds ? Really ? Too pat . Too easy . Just lazy . Then she gets to kill him , but it all falls flat . Of course , she would n't have been able to get to Sansa before the stupid leap off the building anyway . <p> And there there 's Sansa . First of all , she steals a corkscrew and picks a lock ? Which she , what , learned in thief school ? She clearly did n't  learn not to drop it on the floor. - Reek kills Miranda by pushing her over a balcony ( yay ) , then they- jump off the freaking building ? Unless you bring her back as LSH next season , that was awful . You just invalidated everything you did with her character . THAT was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all- Thelma and Louise , then her entire story is sorrow porn . Also , the showrunners talked about that jump as brave and going forward with life . So , does that mean shell survive the jump- that is way higher than the one that killed Miranda ? Right , because plot . Also , for the record , if Sansa has just gotten to the point where shell risk everything to get that candle up there so someone can help her , I do n't  buy the suicide idea . I also do n't  buy that they 're both stupid enough to think they could survive that . Which they will because what was it again ? Oh right . Plot . <p> Let me say this . I 'm not bitching about all the death and killing off main characters . I read the books when they first came out . I knew what I was going to watch .

That journey changed Snart in a number of fundamental ways and seeing that reflected this week was a pretty awesome treat . <p> The other notable appearance this week was the gnarly King Shark . His inclusion could have been really weird but once events unfolded , it made a perfect kind of sense . A.R.G.U.S . had control of some Dominator tech that Barry needed to stop Savitar . Unfortunately they were unwilling to give it up so Barry recruited Snart , the master thief , to help him nick the oversize bauble from the military installation . Unfortunately for them , - A.R.G.U.S . also has a tendency to keep dangerous metahumans at the same facility ( should out to- the Suicide Squad , Grodd and Cheetah ) so it only makes sense that King Shark would be guarding the doohicky . <p> Even better , the battle with King Shark allowed Snart to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing the problems of- featuring a shark on a small budget . The smooth nod to JAWS explained away any camera tricks used and injected some levity in an episode that was fairly dark . Seriously , the fact that they got away with a shark attack battle in the middle of a jail cell , on dry land no less , was kind of a narrative miracle . It was the height of creative writing and I loved every second of it . <p> The only real downside to Captain Colds appearance was the reminder that Snart is effectively dead in the DCW- and this may be the last time we see the fan favorite . However , if this is the final farewell to Snart , its a worthy goodbye to a beloved character . Since his introduction Barry has always tried to show Snart there are different paths in life . So it makes all the sense in the world that Snart was able to repay Barry by helping our hero avoid his descent into darkness . The dynamic between these two have always been amazing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no strings on me , indeed . <p> Even with all of this awesome Captain Cold action going on , it still played second fiddle to the Savitar/Iris story . The showdown on Infantino Street loomed over the entire episode and it created fantastic drama between our cast of characters . Nowhere was it more apparent than with Jesse L. Martin protecting Iris . After a brief jaunt to Earth 2 ( Hi Harry ! ) the father and daughter had a sweet moment that slowly turned sour as the duo realized what was just over the horizon . It was touching and a tour de force moment for Jesse L. Martin who sung his heart out , even though it was breaking . <p> Candice Patton also delivered a stellar performance as a woman who comes face to face with her fate . From the beginning of the episode where she asks for a ridiculous last meal ( caviar now , please ) to her faltering duet with Jesse L. Martin , Candice Patton gave Iris some much needed pathos leading up to her inevitable fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment . <p> Did anyone else notice how much mileage we got out of every one of our characters this week ? Not only did the main cast all get a bump but our villains also had some nice moments that fleshed out their motivations . I really wish the writers did n't  wait so long to do it , but man have these last few weeks been making up for lost time . I think Savitars reveal really changed the game as its obvious that the man inside the armor is a pitiful creature , desperate to save his own existence . <p> This is a far cry from the God of Speed persona he tries to assert . Even so , outside of the armor , Savitar is far more fragile than one might expect . Ditto for Killer Frost , who continues to fight her inner Caitlin . Over the last two weeks its become obvious that the original personality of Caitlin- is trying to reassert herself and Frost is losing the fight . My guess is that no matter how next weeks finale plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a central figure in taking down Savitar . <p> Redemption may come to late for Caitlin as Iris finally caught up with her future this week . No matter what Team Flash tried to accomplish , they could n't stop Savitar from executing her on the now notorious- " Infantino Street " . It sets up a pretty dark season finale as the tone will definitely shift towards revenge . Even so , I do n't  think we- have all the info . <p> For one , where is H.R. ? After a pretty sincere and unflattering breakdown of his failure to protect Iris , H.R. just vanished . Did he somehow find a way to save Iris ? Maybe by using his holographic disguise ? It ca n't be a coincidence that his piece of face changing tech popped up again this week . Also consider that Iris was thrown aside for a solid few minutes before Savitar finally killed her . Could H.R. have pulled a switch ? Maybe he was in the sewer ? I do n't  know . But if The Flash is going to continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.R. certainly has to be removed from the board . <p> However , you might be thinking that 's a bit of a cop out , and I think I would agree . While a last minute switch up of H.R. for Iris would be a cool twist , I think that the writing staff is still playing a long game . They want to make Flashpoint really mean something , and having Barry go back in time one last time to undo all the pain and suffering he s caused this year would be apropos . Sacrificing his mother , taking that burden and ensuring the world is fixed because of it would certainly be a fitting sacrifice to save the woman he loves . <p> Regardless , we only have a week to wait before all is revealed .

@@108166881 @3566881/ <h> Weighing In On The Tilda Swinton Doctor Strange Whitewashing Controversy <p> Buckle-up , this one is a Friday morning heavy . So , a friend of mine emailed me this article from the Herald Scotland earlier this week and asked how I felt about it . The article talks about the controversy surrounding- Tilda Swintons- casting as The Ancient One in Marvels Doctor Strange. - The Ancient One mentors Dr. Strange ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) , - training the latter hero- to be the new Sorcerer Supreme . In the comics , The Ancient One is a man . He s also born in Tibet . Tilda Swinton is a woman . Shes also very white . Ive been sitting on this " controversy " for some time now , trying to gather together my thoughts . I 've gathered them as best I could . A couple things , before I begin : <p> These are my thoughts . I do n't  speak for all Asians or Asian-Americans or Women . <p> You are welcome to disagree with me if you feel like . You can even comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you think so . Just remember not to INTERNET at me : <p> ME : I enjoyed this movie INTERNET : No , you 're wrong to have that opinion , and furthermore you do n't deserve to live <p> When we talk about- gender diversity , we are almost always talking about gender diversity for white women . And when we talk about racial diversity , we are almost always talking about racial diversity for non-white men . Non-white women are left almost entirely out of the equation . So when something like this kind of whitewashing happens , we have to decide how we feel about it . There 's something here to cheer fora woman ! yay ! But there 's also something to feel uncomfortable aboutwhitewashing ! crap ! <p> Feiges comments regarding Swintons casting are what bother me the more than Swintons casting itself : <p> We are always looking for ways to change . I think if you look at some of the early incarnations of the Ancient One in the comics , they are what we would consider today to be quite , sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what would work today . Also , within the storyline of the comics , and our movie , the Ancient One ' is a title that many people have had . <p> We hit very early on on , What if the Ancient One was a woman ? What if the title had been passed and the current Ancient One is a woman ? " <p> here 's the thing . As soon as Feige thought , " What if the Ancient One is a woman , " any question of the character being Asian was gone. - I doubt anyone entertained the idea . The Ancient One may potentially have been an Asian Man . ( or a Black Man , or a Hispanic Man , because for some reason studios think all people of color are interchangeable in these kinds of roles . See : Chiwetel Ejiofor- in- The Martian , Oscar Isaac- in- X-Men Apocalypse ) . So to Feige and director Scott Derrickson and the casting team , - if the Ancient One was going to be a woman , there was no question she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This puts non-white women in a tough place . We want to see ourselves represented . Were slowly getting therebut were in this weird middle ground where we have to take what we can get . I 'm not saying we should n't complain about having to do thatwe absolutely- should- complain our hearts outits kind of our only recourse right now. - Studios want to cast people who " bring in the numbers , " but they 're unwilling to give- women of color- the kind of roles that will allow them to bring in the numbers- so that they can be cast in roles in bigger films. - Its a real Catch-22 , and if we do n't  complain , we have no way of letting them know what they 're up to is bull . <p> All of that- said , I 'm still excited to see- Tilda in this role , just as I 'm uncomfortable to see her in it . How do I hold these two conflicting feelings ? These is where I hit a brain bump . Part of me is like , well , each step towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will make the next step easier . At least someone thought , " hey , this could be a woman ! " instead of going the normal dick-and-balls route . Then another part of me is like , well , but what if the pathway only clears for white women and then we decide we 've achieved it and were done ? What if the pathway only clears for non-white men , and we feel the quota- has been filled ? <p> I 've enjoyed pretty much every character- Ive seen Tilda Swinton- play , and I 'm glad Marvel is taking steps to gender-diversify its films . I 'm not enraged that she has been cast , and I 'm not calling for Kevin Feige and team to recast her with an Asian actor , and honestly , I think shell do a great job . My energy could be better spent than picking apart an actress I like , and I do n't  want to work myself into a frenzy over something that is , at this point in time , out of my control . But I do want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when were talking about diversity , non-white women- are part of the equation . <p> It was awesome to see- Daisy Ridley and- John Boyega lead- The Force Awakens . But the one non-white woman of significance in the film was mo-capped into an alien , her face was n't even on screen ( as was the case with Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy ) . So- when we applaud the positively changing landscape for female- and non-white actors in filma landscape that even for white women and non-white men , still is n't where it should bewe forget that a whole group of people is routinely being glossed over . And we deserve to be included . <p> The problem is when they change the gender and race of an already established character to try to add diversity . This is almost always a sign of script by cometty and executive medaling resulting in a horrible script . The latest fantastic four is a prime example of how that fails . Why not make Strange a women then as well . The way you get diversity is using already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or make original characters . How is a asian wise man a negative thing it is a traditional story element in many Asian tales and culture ? Now until black countries , and countries with larger percentages of dark skinned people start having the resources and develop a movie going public in enough numbers there is not going to be the fan base to drive to much success . On the other hand Chinas market is making more Asians more likely to make money . Otherwise in white dominated countries blacks are a small part of the population and can not expect to be over represented . Now women are the majority so we defiantly need more women films , but do n't  rip up the old story characters , hey you can even point out prior discrimination there if you want to instead of pretending everything has always been ok , instead more new female characters , women lead movies and bringing minor existing female characters more to the center . Dr Strange has many powerful females you could add to the tale without trashing a existing character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still happens in the East . We just ludicrously change the character to white , creating another example of the white Asian motif ala white ras al ghul in batman or the white last samurai . No wise Asian sage and no evil Asian boss ( see mandarin white-washing in iron man ) . All we have now are white roles . Its almost like saying . If we cant stereotype you , no roles for you . White Movie Nazi <p> No , they just perpetuated ALL the stereotypes . Your example of white Asian motif is literally a joke . Ras Al Ghul has never been white , but that was an excellent example of whitewashing in the Hollywood comic book movie industry . I 'm not sure you even watched Iron Man 3 as the Mandarin was actually a critique on orientalism and subversive use of traditional Asian tropes ( The Mandarin was a FAKE ROLE acted by an actor ; there was no whitewashing there . ) <p> Casting white people in the role of Asians is the most stereotypical thing you could do in Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Asian character is going to be a stereotype is a flat-out excuse . Its 2016 , let 's stop pretending there 's any a reason for whitewashing other than racism . <p> I am an Asian American male , and Hollywood knows exactly what they are doing here . <p> Kevin Feige is going " People are talking about Doctor Strange around the world . Our **31;157;TOOLONG WORKED ! " <p> People in Asia watch Hollywood films because " They are worldwide popular . " They do not protest like this , because they can ALWAYS have the luxury of watching their own countrymen as leading men and leading women up on the big screen . <p> It is the majority of Asian Americans who grew-up in the United States who protest like this , and even then this group makes up only a narrow subset of all American minorities out there . <p> Not all Asian Americans are going to boycott this particular film . Also , Asian Americans are in the extreme minority in the American South and the American Midwest . <p> Ticket sales are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , controversies like this actually boosts up ticket sales nationwide and worldwide " due to that insatiable curiosity factor .

@@108166903 @3566903/ <p> Let 's just say it , The Flash took way too long to reveal Savitars true identity . In delaying the God of Speeds identity , the creative staff sapped some much needed momentum from the story . So of course it makes sense that tonights episode " I Know Who You Are " would wait until the very last minute before giving us an answer that 's approximately two months late . <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> I know it sounds harsh ; after all we were just delivered the identity of Savitar and the stakes were thoroughly raised . However , I really feel that this was a missed opportunity . Let 's but Savitars identity to the side for a moment and focus on what happened in the other 41 minutes of the episode leading up to this moment . Quite frankly , a lot of it was filler . <p> For instance , while the Caitlin moments were spot on , the majority of this episode did n't  feel focused on our newly minted Killer Frost and her diabolical master . Instead we had a lot of filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and Cisco having a bit of an anxiety attack . This is n't to say that these subplots werent engaging they just felt misplaced . <p> Speaking of Killer Frost , I think its safe to say that the slow burn of Caitlins descent into villainy is the perfect counterpoint to Savitars secret identity . Whereas hint and conjecture was the name of the game when it came to our dark speedster Caitlins change was gradual and foreshadowed . It felt completely earned and when she finally went " White Witch " . The resulting betrayal landed massive emotional dividends and shows just how important Caitlin has become this season . <p> In fact , I 'd say that if Captain Cold is permanently removed from the equation , she could easily fill in as the Rogues new leader . In fact , let 's make that happen . Killer Frost as the leader of the Rogues in Season 4. - Just imagine a group of Rogues led by a former member of Team Flash who has borrowed her playbook from Marvels Iceman . Sliding around on an improbable ice slide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trickster , Mirror Master , Top and Weather Wizard- securing the score . Its a wonderful visual and would certainly break up the monotony of all speedsters all the time . <p> Killer Frost also capitalized on the one subplot that deserved some screen time this week : the bond between Caitlin and Team Flash , specifically Cisco . These characters are like family and to watch Cisco grapple with the fact that he may have to kill Caitlin was pitch perfect . There was some real pathos there between the two actors as they were put on opposite sides of the proverbial table . The result was a nuanced encounter that revealed that there might be a piece of Caitlin Snow buried deep inside the glacier that is Killer Frost , waiting to be thawed out . <p> That takes us to the other subplots this week . Namely the adorable ( but completely out of place ) bond between H.R. and scientist Tracy Brand . While it feels a little weird adding someone new to the fold this late in the season , Anne Dudek did an admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist who learns how to trap Savitar . <p> In that same vein we have Joe and Cecile who decided to up their drama this week becausereasons ? The long and the short is Joes angst over telling Cecile the truth about Barry and the rest of his extended family in Team Flash . Unfortunately all of this felt forced as Joe is literally the guy telling everyone else to " just be honest " with whomever their love interest is . To have Joe fall into this same trap feels like a- plot line that ca n't be described as anything else than- filler . Now do n't  get me wrong , I 'm all about romantic entanglements and emotional journeys , but sometimes people can just exist in a great place without it suffering the " CW effect " . Would it have been so bad to have this wait until next season before unsealing this can of worms ? Probably not . <p> That brings us to the Savitar reveal . I admit , I have been yelling " its Barry " since the early episodes of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you might have been in the Wally camp , but Barry is the most plausible choice . It also saves us from two major things that have been bugging me this season . First : another speedster ? Three speedster villains in a row was pushing it , and diffuses my second point . Second : how can Barry claim to be " the fastest man alive " if these other guys are always faster than him ? Wellthe label fits , albeit from a future point of view . <p> More to the point though , it makes Barry his own worse enemy and brings something back that Ive been yelling since the very first episode this season : were not done with Flashpoint . I believe that the reveal of Savitar has ultimately shown Barry that he made some changes that can not be fixed by " being faster " or " smarter . " In fact , I believe in an episode or two , were going to see Iris die . My prediction is that through a series of flashbacks were going to see Barrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going realize that his greatest mistake was not stopping Savitar . <p> In fact hell realize that his tampering with the timeline and saving Nora Allen was his greatest folly. - As I 've said a dozen times this season , we have still not the Season One Finale scene from future Barrys perspective . Through this , hell understand that he has to go back and make things right , one last time. - - I think this is the event that spurns that change . I think were about to close the loop on Barrys time travel for the near future , and I think were about to experience a massive reset , that may change the entire board once again . I think that , if the writers pull this off , they- will have taken a season that felt very hit or miss- and made it something worthy of the name Flashpoint . <p> Now as we close in on the season finale , we need to just sit back and hope that there are no more drawn out moments only exhilarating stakes . <h> Shaun Rosado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geek podcast called " Shauncastic ! , " where he and a rotating cast discuss everything geeky , nerdy and pop culture-y as well as the creator of " Meet At The Tavern , " a blog dedicated to RPGs .

Its dark and the atmosphere is freaky ; the sound of growling is prominent . Barb tries to escape from the pool and , while this is happening , we are offered glimpses of Nancy and Steven within each others embrace before Barb gets dragged back into the pool .

We are shown what is at stake for Will and for any potential future kidnap victims who find themselves being dragged back into whatever realm this is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears to be an almost exact replica of the world we know it , except dark and foreboding like Silent Hill .

Initially , when we are first introduced to her , we get a sense of an overly worked woman with a slight anxiety issue . Now as we enter Episode 3 we see , through the eyes of the people around her and through- Winona Ryders- performance , a woman on the brink of madness . She shows no signs of having slept , catching a couple of winks here and there by the phone while waiting for any sign of Will calling her . However , this apparent madness is connected with her motherly intuition and her belief that her son is still out there despite all evidence pointing to the contrary . <p> While everyone is dismissing her as a woman in mourning , she is beginning to connect the dots to how to communicate with Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and setting up a plethora of lamps in Wills bedroom , she waits as she tries to figure out a pattern to how the lights light up .

Holly sneaks off and stares as the lights in Wills room glow like a beacon before the wall reaches out to grab the poor toddler . Joyce rushes in and kicks both of them out of the house , indicating to me that she knows what 's up . <p> Towards the end of the episode , Joyce figures out a better way to communicate with Will instead of their system of blinking lights to yes or no questions .

She runs hysterically into Jonathans car and embraces him before seeing cop cars approaching . Why ? Because it turns out Wills body has been found . <p> The cops finding Wills body will be important later , but how did they discover it ? I think it had a lot to do with Sheriff Hopper poking around and searching for information after a hard conversation with Joyce . After discovering a tunnel near the diner where the owner " killed " himself , they find that it leads to Dr. Brenners laboratory at the edge of the town . They try to get into the lab through the proper channels i.e. the front gate , but are denied access . Eventually , Hopper finds his way into the laboratory through his wits and charm and is shown the lab footage discounts Hoppers theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , Hopper and his cops conclude that the footage is false since the footage lacked the rain that was occurring when they were searching for Will that night . <p> This leads Hopper to the library to search up anything he can about Dr. Brenners laboratory now that he has been shown their sleight of hand . He finds article clippings detailing rumors about kidnapping , cruel experiments , and the peculiarities that have been brought up regarding Brenners character . Hopper , before he can even think about what to do with this information , receives a troubling call . This leads us to Wills body being found in the quarry . <p> Netflix <p> One final thing I 'll touch upon is the flashbacks we 've been getting to provide us more details into Eleven and her life prior to her escape . While watching a Coca Cola commercial inside Mikes house , she triggers a flashback to when she was made to crush a can with her mind while being watched by Dr. Brenner and his men . Another flashback is shown to us when a stray cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike and his gang . We are shown her refusal to kill a cat as a result of an experiment to see her kill with her mind . She is dragged away to her room as a result of her refusal , but she kills the orderlies with her mind out of retaliation . Dr. Brenner comes in and comforts her , giving her the comfort that she craves in this cold environment . <p> This episode , while stuffed with lots of information , started strongly and ended spectacularly . It gave us answers to questions that we had , but also gave us more to ponder while we wait for the next episode . <p> GENERAL MUSINGS AND FINAL THOUGHTS <p> I really feel for Barb , especially after seeing the cuts between her struggles and Nancys canoodling fest . That is not the way I wanted her to go ( cause the scene hinted at nothing less ) . <p> I have never been so fearful of Christmas lights everI do n't  do the whole Poltergeist shenanigans/message system crap . <p> Why do people give casseroles when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood this . <p> Honestly , I prefer the creature over the thought of the Poltergeist clown making a sudden appearance . <p> Still no sign of any evidence to indicate to us that the government should be trusted . 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960 <p> Barbs death was really messed up . When the episode started , I was expecting that the show was switching focus from Nancy to Barb , which I kinda liked because you never really get to see the perspective of the loyal best friend in old teen movies . Then she just dies , and in a horrible way . Shes crying for her best friend to help her while Nancy is with Steve , pretty much forgetting about her . The part where in cuts between he holding on for dear life and Nancy holding Steves hand was really uncomfortable . I know that Nancy couldnt have possible known what was happening to Barb , but it still took me a while to like Nancy again after that scene . It makes me think that it was done a little too well . Loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening because people who are going through stuff are terrible about self care and frequently forget to eat , go grocery shopping , and cook for themselves . Casseroles are easy to store and cook , and can also provide several meals , relieving the people who are going through stuff to work through their stuff with their physical needs taken care of . I never really understood it either until my coworkers brought me casseroles while I was on paternity leave and had trouble managing for myself . <p> There is paying homage which is obvious on so many frontsand while I am certainly in the minority , I have just watched the first three episodes and there is nothing original . Totally lacking in creativity.disappointed. 
@@108166912 @3566912/ <p> We last left off with Hopper sneaking into the lab . Considering all the cameras they have set up , you would think that this would not have been so easy . When he breaches the biohazard area and runs across a locked door , this is when he is finally confronted by armed guards . After knocking one out and stealing a key from the other guard , he is able to enter into a forbidden part of the lab . Along the way he finds a childs bedroom . Artwork on the wall reveals that the bedroom belonged to Eleven before she ran away . <p> Meanwhile , we are brought back to the gang whore now discussing Will being alive . This is the first time we are given a name for the alternative dimension the Upside Down . El had previously demonstrated this by flipping the Dungeons and Dragons board upside down to demonstrate where Will was and what was chasing him . Dustins explanation of the Vale of Shadows as a place of decay and death is given while we observe what Hopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab where the creature has appeared from . Hopper encounters the lab that has been embraced and taken in by the Upside Down dimension ; the lighting is dark , giving off a greenish tint . He comes across the strange tree that we 've seen in the lab in a couple of episodes . When he hears something skitter across , he turns around and is incapacitated by by scientists in hazmat suits . <p> We are then brought Joyces house . Lonny , Joyces ex , re-enters her life and tells her she needs help . He s decided to come in and take charge and starts ordering Jonathan around . He is quick to dismiss Joyce as crazy . However , given the state he finds her in , its not too hard to dismiss her . He proclaims that everything will be alright now that he s back but , given what we 've seen in flashbacks and through dialogue , I do n't  think that will be the case . <p> The day of Wills funeral we see everyone getting ready . Joyce has the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of shock . All throughout the funeral , we see her stare off as if she 's mentally shut down . As Lonny talks to people and receives condolences , she is left to the side with people purposely walking around her as if to avoid her . We are taken into a memory of her spending time with Will while she 's doing the dish . He s drawing a picture of his character Will the Wise . She wonders why a wise man would need to shoot fireballs and he explains that sometimes the bad guys are smarter , thus needing weapons to defend themselves . This feels too obvious to be foreshadowing , but I ca n't help but not shrug it off . <p> Meanwhile , Hopper wakes up suddenly to find himself back in his home surrounded by drugs and alcohol . After checking himself out in the mirror , he starts checking around his house for anything indicating a government presence in his home . He tears apart his house , at one point literally ripping fabric , and finds a bug in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that this government facility has the whole town bugged . Dr. Brenner makes a brief appearance in order to listen to the conversation Will had with his mother and the one that was overheard by the gang when Eleven made the connection with Will in the Upside Down . This is how he discovers where Eleven is located . <p> Jonathan and Nancy meet up together after the funeral to discuss the creature . We learn some information about how far the creatures reach is . Jonathan has mapped out the sightings of where the creature has been found . They realize that it has only really traveled within a miles radius , indicating to us that it has a limited scope of travel between the Upside Down and the real world . We are given even more insight into how the creature can possibly cross dimensions when our favorite boy gang ask their science teacher questions about how one would travel through dimensions . The teacher , bless his heart , gives a rather earnest explanation using an analogy ( the acrobat and the flea ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules that govern each dimension . With this information , the gang start devising plans to go rescue Will . <p> While our boys are plotting , we are brought back to Lonnie repairing Joyces home from her anxiety ridden destruction . While he s repairing it , his true motivation for why he s there starts coming out . Given the sue-happy society that we live in , it was pretty obvious what he was going for when he started talking about making the quarry owners pay for their sons " death " . Thank goodness Joyce picks up on this bs quickly and promptly kicks him out despite his hemming and hawing . Good for you , Joyce . Further into the show Hopper comes and visits her , carrying a sign that blatantly states , " Do n't  Say Anything " . After promptly checking the house for bugs , he confirms what Joyce already knew . Will is out there and he is alive . <p> Netflix <p> Back with the boys , Dustin has figured out that something is going wibbly wobbly with their compasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the gate to the Upside Down is and , despite how anxious Eleven is , they all venture out . It does n't  take long for them to figure out that something is not right , especially after Dustin points out the setting sun . Eleven has been manipulating the magnetic distortion around the compasses this entire time , claiming that it is not safe for them to find the gate . Lucas realizes this and starts going off on her . Mike and Lucas start duking it out until Eleven , overwhelmed with fear and emotion , uses her powers to knock Lucas back and knock him unconscious . <p> This high emotional state and the mentioning of this whole thing being her fault triggers a flashback . We see her submerged in a water tank in order to locate a Russian man for Dr. Brenner . While in there she hears a growling , which may be linked to the monster that 's wrecking havoc in the show . We see her running away , begging for help . After the flashback , we see that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy are hunting down the monster . Personally , I think this is the most stupid part of the shows plot so far . After a brief argument , they run across a dying deer that has been hit by a car . Just as they are about to shoot it and put it out of its misery , its dragged back by the monster . They freak out and try to follow where they think the monster has gone . At first , it seems hopeless until Nancy finds a gooey tree trunk . She proceeds to climb in and walk into the Upside Down . It does n't  take her long to find the monster nomming on the deer and , in one of the most cliched moments of all monster films ever , she alerts it to her presence by snapping a tree branch . The episode ends with Jonathan hearing her screams and not being able to find her while we are given a shot of the tree trunk slowly closing up . 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

Also , be warned . Potential- SPOILERS ! - I repeat with flashing neon lights " - SPOILERSSSS ! ! ! <p> This episode deals with the aftermath of the discovery of Wills body . We start off with Joyce frantically trying to explain to Sheriff Hopper and her eldest Jonathan that she had been communicating with Will before a creature had started to climb out of the wall to chase her . She insists that Will is alive and that there is no way that he s dead . There is some serious tension between Hopper and Joyce as they banter back and forth .

It is n't until Joyce pleads with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is going to make in following the clues leading to her son . <p> Meanwhile , Mike is upset with Eleven , blaming her for providing false hope when she had said to him and his friends that Will was alive . They had , instead , been there when the police were called in to pull Wills body from the quarry . Eleven uses her powers to connect to Will in the other dimension in order to prove to Mike that his friend is alive . Note : we get to see quite a bit of Eleven and her abilities this episode , giving us a much better insight into what she can do . They lose the signal to Will , but Mike thinks that they can get a better signal from their school if they use the AV club radio . In order to sneak Eleven in , the boys band together to create a feminine disguise that is very reminiscent of E.T.- Mike seemed to take particular care of dressing up Eleven as he helped her with her makeup and gave her an approving glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passable , the gang set out to school . <p> At the school , they head to an assembly that is being held by the school in Wills honor .

As one of the bullies goes into beat on Mike , Eleven freezes him and makes him urinate and embarrass himself in front of his peers . The gang head to the AV lab where Eleven is able to connect them to Will . This triggers a flashback where we get to see how Dr. Brenner trained Eleven to track people in order to extract information from them . <p> Netflix <p> Joyce is able to connect to Will at the same time as the gang , hearing a pounding sound and hearing her son call out to her . Frantically , she locates the pounding and starts peeling back the wallpaper to reveal a distorted surface underneath with Wills head pressed against the wall .

The gang quickly escape , carrying a weak and bloodied nose Eleven with them . <p> While the kids and Joyce are trying to locate Will , Nancy is trying her damnedest to find Barb . She cant get any help from Steven because he s more focused on his parents kicking his ass for hosting a party . The cops are n't  any use either , lowkey slut shaming her for having sex with Steven in front of her mom .

They go to the photography lab to have Jonathan blow up the photo he took with Barb sitting at the pool . When done they both see the image of the creature behind Barb , lurking in the shadows .

It also proves that Nancy was n't just seeing things when she went back to Stevens place to look for Barb . <p> Meanwhile , Hopper cant shake the feeling that something is fishy , especially once the state police have taken over the morgue that houses Wills body . After hearing Joyce denounce the body as not belonging to her son and after hunting down the state trooper that called the body and beating the crap out of him to get information , Hopper sneaks into the morgue to figure out what 's going on .

@@108166941 @3566941/ <h> Iron Fist Ep . 3 Recap &amp; Review <p> Credit : Sarah Shatz/Netflixn Jones <p> After an immensely boring and slow start to the series , we finally get some excitement in the third episode of Iron Fist . Mind you , this episode is not perfect . The parts that were good were parts that should have happened earlier on in the series i.e. the whole " Is this Danny Rand ? " storyline being solved . The pace was a lot better this time around and we got some relatively decent action scenes , though not from Danny Rand . <p> Now that the characters have been introduced to us , we finally got to see how drastic a divide has grown between the Meachum siblings and Danny since Danny disappeared 15 some years ago . In a defensive move in order for them to keep control over Rand Enterprises , the Meachums offer Danny a payout if he agrees to change his name . To Danny Rand , his name is the only connection he has left to his family , so this agreement infuriates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meachums prepare to engage with Danny legally until a mysterious fingerprinted item appears proving his identity . <p> We also get a better look into the Meachum siblings in this episode . Ward , surprisingly , is tired of the business world . He s jaded and cynical and wants to get away from the domineering presence of his father Harold . He also appears to have considerable pride issues that he s grappling with , which may be why he wants to leave the business world so badly . He s not cut out for it . Joy Meachum , who seems the kinder of the two , thrives in the business world and appears to have no problem manipulating the odds in order to secure deals like acquiring the rights for a mysterious pier . It may be too soon to theorize , but she may be the wild card to look out for as the series progresses . <p> Credit : Netflix <p> My secret bae , Colleen Wing , is probably the most interesting part character-wise in this episode . Every time Jessica Henwick is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . In this particular episode , we get to see the character apply what she has learned to future scenarios later on in the episode . After being defeated awkwardly by a condescending Danny Rand in her dojo , we see Colleen head over to her first cage fight match and apply what she learned from Danny against her opponent . I like how they have n't written her to be a one-sided strong female character and also like how they show her learning from her mistakes . Colleen is easily the best character so far on the show and I hope that she has more screen time as the series progresses . <p> The appearance of Jeri Hogarth in this episode made me smile . Having been a fan of Carrie Anne Mosss Hogarth since her introduction in Jessica Jones , I 've been aching to see when shed made a reappearance . Although she seems a lot less serious in this episode of Iron Fist , she has gone through a considerable amount since Jessica Jones . That amount of trauma is sure to change a persons attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier for Hogarth to accept information , especially information surrounding a persons identity , a lot easier to accept . When Danny Rand explains to her who he is , Hogarth takes a lot less convincing than the Meachums . <p> The biggest complaint I still have is how weak of a main character Danny Rand is . A substantial part of this has to do with Finn Jones performance . There is no heart in the character and the wide-eyed hero act that Danny puts on does n't  feel genuine . Then again , when Danny switches into his condescending mode , it reads as something that is forced . Perhaps the more his identity is accepted and the more the character assimilates to New York , the more his personality will shift into something more believable . I may be just grasping at straws here . <p> All in all , this was a better episode . There are still some kinks that need to be ironed out , but the series is slowly improving . The real question is whether or not it will improve fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a show that 's gotten a lot of flack for diversity , you would think the writers would have edited out or reconsidered having Danny Rand call a bunch of non-white students " chattering monkeys " . Did anyone else catch that ? Also , much inward flinching when Danny was a dick and lashed out at the black student . <p> The whole condescending bit between Danny and Colleen really irked me . All I can think of is the superior , appropriating white guy beating a master of a Dojo and all of connections to colonialismThat and the white guy acting like he knows more about her native culture than her . Ugh . Much irritation . <p> Also , guy questioning a womans skill and credentials because that totally happensallthetime . <p> MADAME GAO IS BACK ! YASSSS !

Thank you for any comment you have on this ! <p> Thank you for your article on the Xmen Apocalypse advertisement on the building off the 405fwy . As soon as I saw it I was appalled at the overpowering and domination of a woman by what looks like an angry man .. Out of all the scenes in this movie why did they choose this one ? Apparently men still think its OK to choke a woman . Not everyone is an Xmen fan so not everyone understands the context . So blatantly displaying violence against women ( especially as a marketing ploy ) is not acceptable in any context . <p> Jenna , you and my niece seemed very taken with Rouge One while I was left very unimpressed. i saw the first star wars movie when it was released and was left wondering what others saw to be in awe . Here we go again . The second group of movies were even worse than the first and my son-in-law was very upset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouge Ones use of CGI for Peter Cushing was appalling and thank you for including the androids that annoy ( they have , of course , been surpassed by the meeso whatso character in the second series ) . The huge 10-foot android in Rouge One merely followed the pattern of annoyance . The human characters were as follows : Lead female , half interesting and half annoying ; lead male all annoying ; blind Jedi-like ( he left a massive body count and actually sat one as he took a breather from massively killing how sensitive ) ; the big man with the big gun , just kill everybody wearing white plastic , black plastic and brown clothes . I could describe others but what 's the use they were all ill-conceived . They served there purpose , make money because people like you and my niece will watch it multiple times and wait for more to consume with time and money on hand . Please know there will be other movies following this one ( outside of the Star Wars main story ) and those will crank out additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first Jedi , and on and on . Disney will not rest until they squeeze every ounce of blood from this rock . That 's what they are doing to their Marvel property and then they will start doing the same to the Indiana Jones material . For decades Disney owned the world of girls and women and now that they have what boys and men drool over , they ai n't  stopping short . I guess I will barricade myself up and endure , bit it ai n't  gon na be easy . <p> Hello . Here is some big Star Wars news . In the book the Lucas Effect , it states that it was the art work of Maxfield Parrish that directly inspired the feel and look of Star Wars films . I filmed the awful demise of the Parrish estate art studio , it was an amazing place . Parrish created that huge art studio steeped in art and Star Wars history . Parrish painted the masterpieces there and that entire world Parrish created , provided all the elements for the masterpieces . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real story . I want to set Sue Lewin free . She was the model to Parrish and is in most of the art work . She was the real ( force ) behind Parrish and she went to her grave wrongly titled . My years of work revolve around Sue and her story , her sacrifices for the paintings her story ! maxfieldparrishmotif.com and maxfieldparrishmovie.com will provide u with fascinating info . *Theory one , is that Star Wars truly began in 1904 in that art studio of Maxfield Parrish and I have proof . Thank you , Robin Lee , Maine P.S. Parrish used the likeness of Sue Lewin as Princess Leia , Look up photos of Parrishs Sue Lewin ! Do it . <p> Note her long white gowns , hair-style and posses . Now look up , type in , Maxfield Parrish-Sue Lewin- flowers in her hair . You should see the photo of Sue looking all Princess Leia , , Sue Lewin is Princess Leia . I must get my project all over the world , maybe Lucas will see it . I know so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet for 20 years now . I have very powerful info and it is a great story . We must set Sue free .

@@108166958 @3566958/ <p> Before the mid-season hiatus- Fear The Walking Dead had split our nuclear family into three groups . Group A consisted of Madison , Strand , Ophelia and Alicia as they escaped from Celias burning compound in hopes of returning to the Abigail . Group B consisted of Travis and Chris as the father and son duo travel the Mexican countryside while trying to rehabilitate a fracturing Chris psyche . Group C was a pack of the undead shambling off into the night as Nick joined their ranks , not as a zombie , but as cover from his friends and family . So it should come as no surprise when- the mid-season premiere , " Grotesque " - decided to follow Nick and his band of undead buddies . <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> In one sense , this was a nice break from the non stop events of the past few episodes of- Fear The Walking Dead and it was a welcome change of pace . Unfortunately I felt that- since this kicked off the latter half of the season , part of that breather was lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daniel ( still not convinced he s dead yet ) or the fact that Travis , Chris and Nick are lost in the wild felt like a bit of a let down . <p> On the other hand though , the quiet reflection of this weeks episode made for a good reset that allowed the show to focus on Nick and his odd affinity with the walkers . In fact , if there was one negative that had been following- Fear The Walking Dead since its inception , I would say it had been the forced family narrative . Now , with the party thoroughly broken up , we can experience the apocalypse in a new way and build a concrete reason for these people to gravitate back towards one another. - In this case , the focus on Nick really worked to breathe some new life into the character . After his apparent naivete with Celia it was refreshing to to see part of Nicks backstory as he slowly started to shuffled off the mortal coil . <p> To say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely limited supplies nearly derailed before it began as he lost his supplies to a panicked mother trying to protect her daughter . Despite the loss of vital food and fluids , Nick continued to push into territory that was merely described as : a place built- for men whove been waiting for the end of the world . Of course that meant that Nick was going to inevitably encounter some of these post apocalyptic psychos and sure enough , no matter which direction he traveled , he continued to encounter the worst that humanity had to offer . <p> Between the unforgiving sun , brutal lack of water , starving dog attacks , walkers or sunglass wearing douchebags with guns , Nick was up against it . Over the days that followed , Nick simply fell in with the walkers and just gave up . This was beautifully displayed when the aforementioned sunglass wearing jerks with guns began mowing down Nicks horde . Not once during the entire experience did Nick flinch or call out . He just shambled ahead , one moment shy of being a full on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashbacks detailing a downward spiral of masochism brought on by the loss of his father , you have a picture that is far more fleshed out than anything we 've seen with Nick to date . So when mother nature intervenes and sends much needed rain to Nick , it feels like a real second chance . <p> Interestingly the flashbacks also provided us with an interesting dynamic . Nicks need to be in a group/family . He wants to be surrounded by people who get it . Will the inclusion of newly introduced Danay Garcia and her survivor community be the right fit ? Will this lead Nick to create his own nuclear family ? I do n't  know . What I do know is that this new thread is a welcome addition to the tapestry that is- Fear the Walking Dead that proves this show is stronger when we focus on individual characters versus forced communal conflicts . <h> The Learning Curve <p> If this is your first time reading my write-ups of- Fear The Walking Dead , let me introduce you to- The Learning Curve .

@@108166959 @3566959/ <h> Suicide Squad Trailer Breakdown : 20 Key Moments <h> " Were bad guys , its what we do ! " <p> The new trailer for Suicide Squad- dropped last night and people are already touting it as- DCs answer to- Guardians of the Galaxy. - In case you do n't  know the premise , - Amanda Waller head of the government agency A.R.G.U.S. , has proposed the creation of a task force comprised of the worst convicts in the system . In return for going on a mission that will likely get them killed , the survivors will have their records wiped clean and released , if they survive . Of course , that 's when everything goes wrong . <p> While this is a very simple analysis of the plot , it gets the job done : these are bad guys , forced- to do a good deed in order to obtain their freedom . Though this may seem to have echoes of a certain film with a talking Tree and Raccoon , that 's about where the similarities end . As this is one of my favorite comics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to sit down and go over some notable items . So let 's do a breakdown of 20 key moments from the- Suicide Squad trailer. <h> 20 . Bright Is The New Dark <p> Since the announcement of the film , - Warner Bros. - has touted- Suicide Squad as a movie that would feel drastically different than- Man of Steel- and- Batman v. Superman : Dawn of Justice . From the color palette alone , we can see that they are not exaggerating . Instead of a dark canvas with muted colors and a sepia environment , the- Suicide Squad is flush with a bright color palette that seems to embrace its comic roots . <h> 19 . Bohemian Rhapsody <p> The classic Queen- song " Bohemian Rhapsody " has been used in advertisements a lot lately . The resurgence of Freddy Mercury and Company in popular media seems like a double edged sword . While we like that- Queen- is getting some geek love from a new generation , over saturation can be a risk . Fortunately for us , this is n't the case for- Suicide Squad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man and is arrested for murder . The song weaves a tale of someone who is not necessarily sorry for the crime so much as the loss of youth and potentially their life . This has a stark resonance with the themes at work for the Squad who is offered a chance at freedom , something theyd never get otherwise . These are bad people from the dark underbelly of the world , given a chance to walk free . Tonally its perfect , plus the song is awesome and accompanies the visuals in a wonderful manner . <h> 18 . Shes Called The Wall <p> In the history of comic books , there has rarely been a figure more imposing or threatening than Amanda Waller . The reason for this is because she 's one of us : an average , everyday human , who is the mastermind behind- Task Force X. Through guile , heavy handed blackmail , and a little bit of government sanctioned murder , Amanda Waller has punched out Batman , threatened Superman with deportation and is a name that sends shivers down the collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , the leader of the- Suicide Squad- is someone you never want to meet unless you absolutely have to . <h> 17 . El Diablo Has Regrets <p> So here 's an interesting twist . El Diablo is one of the few penitent members of the Squad . His incarceration was a result of a local gang squabble . While trying to collect a debt , El Diablo burned down a local gang hideout . In the aftermath , it was discovered innocent people died in the fire . Racked with guilt , El Diablo turned himself into the local authorities and has been a pacifist ever since . Yeah , you heard me . He s a pacifist . Hows that going to work with a bunch of murdering maniacs and psychopaths ? I have no idea . <h> 16 . Souls Of The Damned <p> One of the weirder additions to the- Suicide Squad would be that of- Katana . Generally- Katana is depicted as a hero and ally of the caped crusader but here , she 's on the Squad . While we may not know why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword of immense power , each person she kills with it becomes trapped inside of the blade and gives her access to their memories and skills . She can literally call upon hundreds of lifetimes to help her out of- any situation . The impetus for taking up a mask though was the murder of her husband . After he was killed by his own blade , - Katana took up her husbands sword and swore revenge . Its a fair bet she got it , but she also earned a life sentence by getting caught . <h> 15 . Killer Croc Wants Dessert <p> One of the more esoteric- Batman- villains , - Killer Croc- is about as bad as they come . Suffering from a rare skin condition , Croc became an outcast who shuns the world . Hiding out in the sewers he sees humanity as a food source and hobos , criminals and other hapless- victims . Constantly angry over his isolation and continually hungry for more people to eat , you can bet- Killer Croc is going to be a difficult squad member to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control , it should be stated in no uncertain terms , that the- Suicide Squad- does- not- have a choice in the matter . You see , most of you might be thinking " why not just make a break for it the first chance they get ? " Well Waller thought of that . Each member of the Squad is implanted with a small explosive device that can be remotely detonated at any time . To make matters worse , they can also be set- on a timer , so if the villains take too long : boom goes the dynamite . The Squad is full of disposable assets , do n't  expect them all to survive . <h> 13 . Enter Rick Flagg <p> To be fair , explosive deterrents are a good way to keep- your band of misfits in line , but can you really trust them alone in the field ? The short answer is no . In the comics , the- Suicide Squad always had a liaison between the super powered villains and Waller . Enter- Rick Flagg . A military captain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep an eye on the Squad , bark orders and report back progress to home base . In the movie Flagg seems to be outfitted- with an attachment of soldiers and military hardware to help the Squad but we all know that just means things are going to get way worse before they get better . <h> 12 . Its Not All About Fancy Powers <p> While you have quite a few supernatural characters , over half of the- Suicide Squad consists of average humans such as Slipknot and Captain Boomerang . So yes , - they may have a- gimmick , but these are just regular guys with " a certain set of skills " and they 're anxious to use it . <h> 11 . Gunplay Is King <p> Bullets , bullets and more bullets . This trailer is covered in shell casings and gun fire , so of course you have to include- Deadshot . A master marksman , - Deadshot is a man looking for the next score . It does n't  matter who he has to kill , so long as you pay . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunslinger only makes sense if you want to ensure success . <h> 10 . Insanity is Queen <p> Part of what makes the- Suicide Squad- so much fun is that there 's always a dose of madness in the air . In the comics , this is- shown in a number of ways , but one of the more recent ( and popular ) choices was the inclusion of- Harley Quinn . A fan favorite , Harley is known for being mischievous , cunning , loyal and absolutely insane . So far it looks like they 've nailed that personality down in Margot Robbie. - You never know what you 're going to get with her , but its a sure bet the end result will entertaining . <h> 9 . Joker Isnt On The Squad <p> This is more conjecture than anything else , but I have a sneaky suspicion that- The Joker is n't actually on the Squad , but is in fact one of the objectives of the mission . In fact , it stands to reason that the Squad is assembled specifically to combat the Clown King of Crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission . <h> 8 . Mad Love <p> Its clear that the relationship between- Joker and- Harley Quinn will be one of the central themes of the movie . A lot of people are theorizing that the birth and death of " mad love " will a major plot point . To back this up , one of the more recent stories of the- Suicide Squad book has been- Harley Quinns liberation from- Joker . While she may enjoy the madness of chaos , his numerous attempts to murder her have snapped her out of her puppy love and made her realize how dangerous- Joker- really is . In fact , shes gone out of her way to find- Joker in order- to take him down and break his hold over her . While the end result is madman obsessed with a former lover , it shows that- Harley Quinn wont be defined by- Joker any more . I definitely think well see that played out here in glorious neon . The Birth of Harley , The Betrayal of Harley and The Rebirth of Harley ( sans Joker ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joker- is the reason why the- Suicide Squad- is formed , who created this carnage ? I mean , come on , - Joker- is crazy good at blowing things up and whacky death traps but this is some next age , full on super powers of doom , stuff here . <h> 6 . Meet- Enchantress <p> Enchantress- is a villain with a very strange power set . Gifted with the ability to tap into the primal magic of the universe , Julie Moon has extraordinary cosmic powers . Unfortunately magic is not to be trifled with and- can overwhelm- Julie easily which causes her to slip into a dark personality known as- Enchantress . Like- Joker , - Enchantress is all about chaos and madness . A true student of anarchy , this magically powered uber-witch can level cities . This has to be very tempting for someone like- Joker . Expect a team up of the most vicious kind . Unkempt cosmic powers being driven by a madman dressed like a clown . <h> 5 . Do n't  Forget The Funny <p> One of the key ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fiercely funny in that " gallows humor " kind of way . Take this moment for instance : Captain Boomerang ducks- behind a car in the middle of what we can only assume is a- massive- firefight to sneak a beer . This is pitch perfect- Suicide Squad. - The characters are self centered and amoral . They have no problem accomplishing the mission with as little effort as possible and if you happen to die in the process , who cares ? - Expect a lot of dark jokes as a result . <h> 4 . A Shadow This Way Falls <p> Speaking of dark , do n't  let the bright neon fool you . This stakes here are going to be high . My guess is that , despite the rampant chaos sewn in the streets , - Joker and Enchantress- have a plan . Something that possibly turns regular folks into mindless minions ? I 'm not sure , all I know is that these guys look like super charged lackeys of doom and I do n't  wan na be in their way . <h> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about using characters that are generally unfamiliar as a whole is that people- can take chances . Characters can change in big ways. , such as a certain pyrokenetic forsaking a vow of pacifism in order to redeem himself . That means that you should <h> 2 . Expect The Unexpected <p> This screen cap encapsulates a lot what I 'm feeling when it comes to- Suicide Squad. - There is some serious thought , awe at the scope , and giddiness at the potential. - There are no rules for these characters , they can do whatever they want so long as they get the job done and that means that were probably in for a wild and unpredictable ride . <h> 1 . Do n't  Forget , Theyre Bad Guys <p> The best part about this , and what will mark it as such a departure from other " hero " movies is that these are the bad guys . With one or two notable exceptions like- Katana- and- El Diablo , do n't  expect these characters to repent . Theyre bad guys . They like being bad guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what makes them so damn watchable . When you know these people are 100% irredeemable , you begin to root for them , see how far theyll go and ultimately , what it will take to bring them down . While it wont be as a nuanced as , say- Breaking Bad , it is fair to draw comparisons between these two projects . This is n't about the villain turning over a new leaf , this is about seeing just how bad things get before it ends . <h> Shaun Rosado <p> Shaun Rosado is creator and host of a weekly geek podcast called " Shauncastic ! , " where he and a rotating cast discuss everything geeky , nerdy and pop culture-y as well as the creator of " Meet At The Tavern , " a blog dedicated to RPGs .

Instead of leaving him to die at the hands of zombies or waste away in the wreckage of a downed aircraft , Chris did the humane thing and performed a mercy killing , which is certainly relevant to Travis recent killing of Liza . <p> Speaking of the downed aircraft , " Ouroboros " finally showed us- the fate of Flight 462 , a webisode series that would tie into- Fear The Walking Dead . In their final moments- aloft , Flight 462 broke up and crashed . In the aftermath Charlie ( Michelle Ang ) was protecting a severely hurt Jake , refusing to let anyone throw him off the tiny raft . In fact , the dispute became so heated that one survivor tried to kill Jake in the middle of the night , to which Charlie dispatched him with the ferocity of a lioness protecting her cubs . In an act of irony , their salvation would be the fact that said would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survivors to stall near the coast of the 462 accident. - While Travis was stuck fixing the yacht , Alicia- lead a team to the coast in order to salvage clothes , medicine and other possible supplies from the wreckage . <p> This provided us with a wonderful segue into Charlie . Just like Strand , Charlie is currently a blank slate , which makes her very engaging compared to the emotional turmoil of Madison and Travis struggle to keep their family together . Even so , its clear she can become a valuable member of the group as she 's obviously protective and compassionate , something this group values . If you add in her possible knowledge of " what 's going on " - with the Zombies , she could be a critical role in surviving long term . Regardless , Charlie made a big splash this week , as she was also responsible for bringing the zombie horde down on Daniel , Alicia , Nick and Chris and really it needed to happen . <p> As I said before , without Daniel , the LA Survivors have no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test themselves against the undead and that leaves them vulnerable . When the zombies crested that ridge , hunting Charlie and discovering an entire group of tasty viddles , it was up to the Survivors to stand together and fight back . It was wonderful that felt natural and completely earned as the kids began clubbing zombies and pushing back against the tide of the undead . It also gave us a chance to see Nicks lack of fear . Strand said it was one of- the reasons he wanted Nick by his side and sure enough , Nick faced down a wall of the undead covered in gore and completely unafraid . So needed , so awesome . <p> Back on the boat Madison , Travis and Strand come to a very shaky- armistice , agreeing to work together for the greater good than for their own selfish wants . This was put almost immediately to the test when Charlie arrived with a burned and battered Jake . Strand , always the pragmatist , refused to let them on board but Travis suggested a compromise : tow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ok until everyone had settled down . As soon as he had a moment , Strand took up a machete and cut the two loose on the open ocean . In the end , he was n't even willing to do the bare minimum to help out his fellow man and that decision may prove to be his downfall . With the " kids " learning to fight and the adults ready to mutiny , Strand may have finally pushed them one step too far . He may be right in many decisions but his lack of people skills is going to get him a one way ticket to his own life raft , if not a speedy ticket to the hereafter . <p> Regardless , the decisions been made and were off to Mexico . We have no idea what lies in wait down in Baja but its pretty clear that it wont be a good thing . The real question is , can Strand keep everyone in line long enough to get there , or will he find himself floating home , or worse ? <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my write-ups of- Fear The Walking Dead , let me introduce you to- The Learning Curve . This is a summation of each character as they learn how to navigate in the zombie apocalypse . Each week I 'll rate the casts chances of survival based on their actions up until this point . <p> Madison Clark : - 8 of 10 . While she was n't at the forefront of battle , Madison had her own war to wage . Life on the boat has gotten pretty tense especially between Madison , Travis and Strand . While Travis knows that Strand is correct intellectually , the guy just rubs him the wrong way , making it difficult to work together . Madison , ever the mediator , is trying to find a way to create common ground for the group . When she discovers that Strand has a hideout in Baja , she confronts him and declares that his business is now and forever " their " business as the ship is going to act as one . While it seems to have ultimately fallen on deaf ears , Madison has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together or we cut out anyone who endangers the group . Will she see Strands act of defiance as the final straw ? <p> Nick Clark : 8- of 10. - I 'm pretty sure I declared Nick the " yo-yo " of Season One . Every episode the guy was either falling a few spots or jumping up in rank . This year seems to be no difference . After a series of poor decisions last week and a pretty dumb stumble this week , I was prepared to put Nick in the 5 or less crowd , but his quick thinking and fearlessness in the face of impending doom turned me around . While he may not be the smartest kid in the room , or the one with the best hobbies ( do n't  do drugs , kids ) , you have to admit that Nick is certainly a survivor and will do whatever it takes in order to keep drawing breath . Now that he s discovered a way to stay invisible from the undead , it only makes him more durable . <p> Alicia Clark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alicia . After some pretty bad decision making skills last week ( and in the premiere ) , Alicia finally started to show some real understanding of the apocalypse . After spotting the wreckage ofFlight 462 , it was her idea to scavenge the beach and search for resources . It was Alicia who stayed near Daniel when they arrived and it was Alicia who really came into her own as she began scrambling for any heavy metal items that the group could use to defend themselves . All in all , this was a vast improvement and a welcome change of pace . She even picked up part of her moms compassion when helping others , which is still key for long term civilization rebuilding , not just the day to day work of survival . <p> Travis Manawa : 8- of 10. - Travis got a one point bump this week after going head to head with a Zombie underwater . I really though I should give him two points because , scuba zombies just seem to be more scary for some reason . Regardless , Travis pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system by hand . While his instincts could use a little work , the mans overall versatility keeps him at a high point on the scale . Even Strand knew to back off and give Travis some serious respect when he realized he overstepped ( even if it was in the best Pulp Fiction Winston Wolf impression Ive ever seen ) . The lesson here is simple : Travis keeps things running . You want him on your side . <p> Chris Manawa : 5- of 10. - Last week , Chris learned to kill Zombies . This week , Chris learned that sometimes you kill someone even though you want them to live . It was a somber moment and clearly changed Chris trajectory in the course of the series . Not only did he realize his Father was acting out of compassion , he realized that the rules of the old world simply do not apply any more . How this will ultimately affect Chris is still unknown but its great to see the most useless character on the show finally get a chance to grow a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ok , so before you all lose your minds because I dropped Daniel by a point , lemme explain my reasons . This is n't a reflection of Daniels importance to the group or even any mistakes that he s made . In fact , he s done such a good job protecting the group and- that theyve finally had a chance to grow as combatants . Daniel was able to keep the beach combers safe while the scrambled for weapons and he helped lead the charge when the Zombies got too close . Problem is , now that the group is becoming more and more capable , Daniel is going to have to go above and beyond to stand out as a 10 . I 'm sure he will . Regardless , he s the only 9 this week , so that should give you a good idea of his chances . <p> Ofelia Salazar : 7 of 10. - I dropped Ofelia this week on mere principal . We did n't  have any real scene of substance with Ofelia to judge her character one way or the other . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that gets stiffed week to week . It just so happens that Ofelia drew the short straw this time . Since the death of her mother , Ofelia has been quietly adjusting to the new worldits just a matter of time before we see how that affects her and the group . I 'm betting that we get a Carol , but we could also get a Governor . I honestly do n't  know . <p> Victor Strand : 5 of 10 : - Strand almost kept his score of 7 , but the final 30 seconds struck me as the exact wrong thing to do . Its clear Strand is used to getting his way and people jumping when he asks for something , but this is a world gone bye ( forgive the pun ) and he s not quite gotten the message . I do n't  know if the LA Survivors will string him up , throw him overboard , or simply kill him but its becoming clear that Strand is the odd man out and if there 's any " dead weight " to cut loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8- of 10 : During Flight 462 , Charlie was a quiet , together survivalist , possibly nurse or scientist , who knew how to handle a crisis situation . In the aftermath , Charlie proved herself to be fiercely loyal and protective over those she valued . Coupled with her no nonsense approach to problems and her considerable depths of compassion , Charlie may be the new Strand . I predict that if it comes down to a choice then Strand may find himself on the wrong side of the group .

@@108166974 @3566974/ <p> It almost feels redundant , but Legends of Tomorrow really has become the best show in the- DCW , and for good reason . After a lackluster first season with a lot of peaks and valleys , the creative team went to work on fixing issues and creating interesting new content . As you may recall , one of my biggest complaints of Legends of Tomorrow was the lack of a- scary villain . Compared to characters like the Reverse Flash , - Malcom Merlyn , - or- Damien Darhk , it was obvious that Vandal Savage just did n't  get the job done . So how ironic is it , that all three of the aforementioned characters have been brought into the fold to create " The Legion of Doom " ? <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> As the title suggests , this weeks episode focused on the titular Legion of Doom. - - The nefarious triad of Thawne , Merlyn and Darhk have become fan favorites over the last few years and their partnership has only made their dynamic even more entertaining . Their ability to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backstabbing , all in the name of self interest , of course . Secret machinations , long winded rants , innuendo , doubts and torture are their weapons of choice and on full display this week as Darhk and Merlyn make Thawne accept them as his equals . <p> The winding road to a balanced triad is a tricky thing though and in a very clever twist- Legends of Tomorrow was able to fix a dangling plot line that has bugged me since the start of- Flash season two : why has n't  the Paradox of non-existence killed the- Reverse Flash ? - I mean really , " speed force buffering " ? That seems flimsy , even by comic book standards . Thankfully we have experts on the case . Considering that this show focuses on time travel , we can finally come up with some pseudo-logical explanation . The answer was pretty simple and ties in another loose thread that needed tying off : The Black Flash . <p> In previous episodes , - Legends of Tomorrow has stated that time is a fluid concept and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , one of natures mechanisms is the Time Wraith , a being that hunts down time traveling speedsters as they bounce around various eras. - The Black Flash is the ultimate form of the Wraiths as one of their own merged with- Zoom in the second season finale of- The Flash . The result is a rotting speedster that races tirelessly after his prey . As a result , the- Reverse Flash cant stay in one spot too long lest he be found by the mindless force of nature . It creates a whole new dynamic for the biggest villain in the- Flashs lineup of Rogues while also answering those tiny questions that bug us . Time is trying to kill Eobard Thawne , and it will eventually catch him , unless he can change his timeline with the Spear of Destiny . Its a relentless pursuit that drives Thawnes existence and challenges him every time he stops . It also gives- Darhk and- Merlyn plenty of ammunition to stay on a level playing field with their faster-than-light buddy . <p> What made this all the more rewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on the story elements established in the- DCW. - Between- Merlyns fall from grace on- Arrow , or the multiple storylines from Barry Allens time traveling adventures on- The Flash , the Legion of Doom was able to create an organic tapestry that grew the established mythology in new and interesting ways . When you consider that the Legends are essentially the Justice League , - it makes sense that numerous individual stories would converge on this show , and the writers are taking full advantage of that possibility . <p> Another fun point of interest was the decided lack of involvement from the- Legends themselves . Relegated to the B plot this week , the team had to work out what the- Legion of Dooms plan . This resulted in a return to 2016 and another appearance of Jessica Stein .

Klaus , however , does not believe that , and even Freya has her doubts . <p> At the gym , we see Camille training with Vincent .

Klaus enters during the training and tells Camille that he needs to speak with her . <p> After a short scene between Kol and Davina where we learn that Kol has been brought back as a vampire , we are taken to Marcel 's loft where he finds the aftermath of a massive party .

I remember the moment that I realized that this put them in the same category as C-3PO and R2-D2 and the moral dilemma that caused for me .

I could n't imagine a time where Carrie Fisher was n't around or that of all the people in the world , I 'd be the one a news program called to discuss her life . I 'm still not sure I believe it happened . Heck , its still hard for me to believe that the first hero I had is gone . When those beautiful pictures came out yesterday , it was still a few minutes before I remembered. - Star- Wars- and Carrie Fisher ( as much as Princess Leia ) taught me that I did n't  have to be a girl the way the rest of the world saw them .

There was more to the world than the block I played on . <p> Its been 40 years and there is so much- Star Wars still to come . Now I can look up to General Organa , not that her Princess title was ever the important thing about her . Now my younger friends have Rey and Fin and Rose in the new film .

This may be a bit of a stretch , but Redditor- Baldrick1986- found a moment in- The Phantom Menace where there 's a statuette-toy-thing in the likeness of The Force Awakens character- Maz Kanata ( Lupita Nyongo ) .

Its when Anakin ( Jake Lloyd ) - brings Padme Amidala ( Natalie Portman ) - and Qui-Gon Jinn ( Liam Neeson ) back to his place during a sandstorm on Tatooine .

We learn Maz Kanata is something like 1,000 years old , definitely old enough to have known/been aware of Anakin- ( let 's not forget , she 's also the one who has Lukes/Anakins lightsaber in storage ) , or vice versa . Maybe she was famous enough to be a collectible figure in the galaxy far-far-away . <p> But- does this- figurine in The Phantom Menace- really mean anything ? Probably- not . Its certainly- possible that Maz Kanata ( otherwise touted as a new character ) was at the very least modeled after the thinga-ma-boob in this shot .

@@108166992 @3566992/ <p> If there was ever a story about second chances , its DCs Legends of Tomorrow . After a shockingly uneven first season , the pressure to deliver the goods on an ensemble superhero team for the DCW was pretty high . Fortunately the Legends production crew rose to the occasion and delivered one of the most enjoyable seasons of superhero TV from the last few years . Stuffed with inside jokes , crunchy science fiction , legitimate drama and a cast of heroes and villains that crackled with charisma , Legends of Tomorrow rode a wave that soared to some pretty fantastic heights . The only question that remained was if the Legends could land the season finale- " Aruba " . I 'm glad to say that they absolutely did ; and with aplomb . <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> So let 's set the scene . All season the Legends have been fighting the Legion of Doom over the incredibly powerful Spear of Destiny . In an unfortunate turn of events the Legends lost that battle and witnessed the birth of " Doomworld " , a dark twisted version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of their opposition . After a failed attempt to put things right , which incidentally killed Amaya , the Legends conclude that their only course of action was to return to WWI and steal the Spear of Destiny from their younger selves . <p> In a word , it was the " Hail Mary " pass of the season . Why ? Early in the Legends career it was made crystal clear that you can not revisit the same point in time over and over . Going back to events youve already influenced can cause a time paradox and this destructive force could not only wipe you out of existence , but destroy the world and a portion of the known galaxy . In short , you do n't  do it . So to even consider this option , you have to be pretty desperate . Fortunately for us the Legends did n't  have much of a choice , so that means- we get to see what happens when you break the cardinal rule of time travel . <p> Oh man did it get broken , a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , go for broke . On their way back- to the land of scorched earth and blasted craters the Legends have a wonderfully poignant moment where they realize that they are the time aberrations and if successful , they will cease to exist . It was pretty heady stuff that shined the spotlight on their heroism . <p> Once the Legends arrived in WWI it was clear that- this wasnt going to be an easy task . After a few scant moments on the battlefield , Ray was quickly dispatched by the Reverse Flash by ripping out our resident geeks heart with his bare hand . It was dark , and fairly gory for a show that tends to delight in the fun part of comics . The death of Ray was also the last trump card the Legends had as the rest of the team was de-powered , which certainly stacked the deck in the Legion of Dooms favor . <p> Even though this was pretty dark , I was surprised at how the show was able to bolster the viewers spirits despite the homicidal bad guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful balancing act that started with a miniaturized Waverider trying to kill Damien Darhk with a barrage of lasers that amounted to Calvin dressed up as Spaceman Spiff yelling " pew pew . " Simply . Hilarious . Another moment that was worth its weight in paradox was the Legends meeting their younger selves . Between Sara and Sara echoing one another at every step and the Rorys sizing one another up , the concept of dueling legends paid off in a big way as the older , de-powered heroes could help their younger selves . <p> Of course , once Thawne figured out that he faced two sets of Legends , the guy decided to get in on the action too by recruiting dozens of Thawnes throughout time . Needless to say , this set up for a pretty epic battle that absolutely destroyed any of that left over negativity from the first season . Vandal who ? Forget that guy , give me the Legion ! - They were absolutely vicious , killing off nearly every member of the Aberrant Legends in brutal fashion . It was absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than a group of narcissistic monologuers , they 're actually cold blooded killers . <p> In a pretty neat piece of writing all of these elements ( Aberrant Legends , Time Paradoxes and the cold blooded Legion ) came together to create an incredibly satisfying conclusion to a number of story lines that ran this season . The best example was Sara , who wound up with the Spear of Destiny and only a second to change the world . In that moment she faced the events that shaped her world : Damien Darhk , Laurels Death and Saras years at sea . These were critical moments that helped shape her entire life , but if they changed the world could be radically different . <p> So she allowed everything to unfold as it should , with one tiny change that would make Indiana Jones proud : she removed the Spears power . It was nothing more than an artifact that belonged in a museum , which nullified all the changes made by the Legion . Kudos to the team for giving Sara a chance to make everything perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfect . <p> Of course , this meant that Thawne had run out of time as the Black Flash finally caught up with his prey , erasing him from existence . It was a pretty big moment that made me more than a little sad . Matt Letscher was a great addition to the roster that brought more than a little pathos to such a despicable villain. - Chances are , this is n't the last we 've seen of Eobard Thawne ( he still has to kill Barrys mother after all ) but in the off chance that it is , what a way to go . <p> Of course that means that well probably never see this version of the Legion of Doom again . Darhk has a date with destiny in 2016 and Snart is going to die at the end of time . Its a bummer that dooms these baddies to their original deaths but it only makes sense . Honestly , I was hoping that Sara would have saved Leonard , a last second reprieve for saving all of existence from the Time Masters ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season was the fact that Snart and Rory did n't  go back to being a bromance in Central City . As much as I love Rory , his truest self is at odds with a certain Scarlet Speedster alongside the rest of the Rogues . I hope we see it one day , but I can live with having a lovable curmudgeon in the mix until then . <p> That takes us to the final seconds of the show where it becomes obvious that the Legends tampering with the time line has had some serious repercussions . It appears that time itself has begun to unravel , placing dinosaurs next to hyper futuristic skyscrapers . Its not a lot to go on , but it seems to me that the Legends have just become their own worst enemy . <h> Shaun Rosado <p> Shaun Rosado is creator and host of a weekly geek podcast called " Shauncastic ! , " where he and a rotating cast discuss everything geeky , nerdy and pop culture-y as well as the creator of " Meet At The Tavern , " a blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ( @Pneumaz ) .

@@108167003 @3567003/ <h> Review : Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales <p> The first thought that came to mind after viewing this film was how fun it was . It has been a long time since I 've been to a movie that was fun and distracted me completely for a couple of hours and the fifth installment of Pirates definitely kept me distracted . That being said , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales is not perfect by any means . However , it is better than On Stranger Tides , which I think can allow everyone to expel a sigh of relief . <p> The overall plot of Dead Men Tell No Tales seemed very familiar to the first film in the franchise in the sense that the cast went back to a more ensemble piece . One way that this was done was by relegating Jack Sparrows character to a secondary role . There has been some complaint , especially with the previous film , that Jack Sparrow was too much of the focus on screen . Directors Joachim R++nning and- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Sparrow as more of a supporting character because it allowed audience members to focus on the new characters that were introduced and flesh them out into real people rather than Jack Sparrows sidekicks . <p> The other way that Dead Men Tell No Tales was familiar to the first film was because the general structure of plot was very similar . We are reintroduced to Jack Sparrow who 's so down on his luck that he cant afford to keep the most loyal of crew members to stay with him . An old and , predictably , cursed nemesis of his , Captain Salazar ( Javier Bardem ) , is freed from his prison within the Devils Triangle when Jack accidentally sparks the trigger to free him . Now that Salazar is free , he is unleashing hell onto the seas and killing anything that resembles a pirate while he embarks on his quest to hunt down and get revenge on Jack Sparrow . Meanwhile , Jack Sparrow stumbles into Henry Turner ( Brenton Thwaites ) and Carina Smyth ( Kaya Scodelario ) and discover that they are all after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any curse connected to the sea can be lifted and , ultimately , can be used to defeat Salazar . <p> There were certain plot points that were either unnecessary or rather confusing taking into account everything that had transpired prior to this latest installment . I will not discuss specific plot points so as to keep this as spoiler-free as possible . I will mention that the inclusion of the evil British soldier ( David Wenham ) wanting to secure the Trident so that the British Empire could rule the seas was not only a waste of time due to the lack of payoff , but also wasted the use of a reasonably decent actor . <p> Despite the familiarity of the plot , the way that it was executed worked out in the films favor in terms of character development. - It was enjoyable to see how the newly introduced characters developed over the course of the film , more specifically Carina . Now , say what you will about the character , but Carina is not to be compared to Keira Knightleys Elizabeth Swann . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and- only wants to pursue education , but keeps being stopped due to the patriarchal systems in place . And her main goal involving the search for Poseidons Trident ? To discover her identity and her lineage . We are taken through her journey throughout the film and her journey is probably the most compelling . <p> The acting in Dead Men Tell No Tales is what we have come to expect with the franchise . Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp embody their characters once more . Javier Bardems Captain Salazar is a captivatingly terrifying addition to the cast . You can tell he s really having a good time as the prideful , sadistic Captain . He strikes a perfect balance between being frightening , but also making us entirely sympathetic towards his character and the reasons for why he is so desperately seeking revenge against Jack Sparrow . Brenton Thwaites Henry Turner took on the role of the straight arrow type with ease , but also played off the believer of the supernatural fairly well . His awkward flirtations with Kaya Scodelarios Carina were played quite believably if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the sea . <p> Although I had heard that this film was supposed to be the last one in the franchise , the ending was open ended enough that it could lead into another sequel . However , the films ending can also be interpreted as just the end of an era . Ultimately , itll be up to the powers that be and the audience to determine if we truly want to see more of Jack Sparrow . <p> Overall , if you are seeking out a film that is fun , fast-paced , and will keep you entertained for a couple of hours , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales is your Memorial Day weekend film this year . Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales will be out in theaters this Friday , May 26 , 2017. 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

On the flip side , the article sites Lukes temperance is more like Padme and a solid basis of choosing him over his sister . To be honest , I do n't  buy it . To be fair , were attributing- logic and reason to a movie that slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the choices were arbitrary at the time . That said , with the information at hand , I still think there is a better answer than Leia had anger issues . <p> So let 's get into it shall we ? <p> I think pointing to a few moments where Leia gets snarky is too easy of an out . Let 's be fair here , in the first example , where she pushes Chewie out of the way , we need to remember she had just survived days of torture at the hands of- Darth Vader and his rotating cast of interrogation-droids . I do n't  care who you are , that 's gon na make you a little on edge . Add on a trio of bumbling idiots ( and let 's be fair , the guys were like the Three Stooges here ) who nearly get her shot , recaptured and crushed by a trash compactor and I defy you to find a good mood three minutes later . The fact that she did n't  shoot Han , Luke and Chewie in the kneecaps and leave them as bait speaks- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count that against her though , Luke certainly was n't a better choice when measuring by this litmus . While its true that Luke had an intrinsic wanderlust , he was also incredibly whining and quick to emotion . <p> One of Yodas vehement objections to Lukes training was lack of control . From throwing a hissy fit about being unable to get power converters at Tosche Station down to his inability to yeild a fair market value for his speeder , Luke shows us time and again just how quick to anger he can be . Worse yet , its a " victims anger " . He constantly looks to other people for blame instead of how he can better himself . At the very least , Leia was shooting disposal bins and rallying the troops for survival . Heck , even when Luke started to understand the Force , he would still be prone to lashing out . <p> Check out The- Empire Strikes Back , when Luke rides his snowspeeder at the Battle of Hoth , he snaps at Dak when hit with flak from Imperial Walkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy certainly has anger issues . When Luke arrives on Dagobah , actively looking for Yoda , he is quick to snap at everyone in his path . So let 's go ahead and shoot that entire theory down . <p> So why- didnt- Yoda train Leia ? <p> I think there are a lot of factors to consider when asking this question , but for me it really boils down to this : Luke was a dreamer . Now go with me for a moment . Leia , since she was an infant , - has been raised by- Prince Bail Organa and his wife Breha . They have molded her into a leader of- Alderaan and subsequently a member of the Imperial Senate . She was given science , mathematics , art and politics as her cornerstones . She was molded by them . Then she joined the Rebel Alliance and became a pillar of that movement . <p> Now swing over to Luke . While I 'm sure he was given a fine education in the Hutt Galactic Rim School Network , I sincerely doubt he was ever molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days looking out over desert skies tend to make one more open to the possibilities of the spiritual . With the decimation of the Jedi order , even with Leias parents telling her about mystics from a time long ago , it would be hard to justify ones faith in them since the order was wiped out . Guns , manpower , political maneuvering , these were the tangible tools Leia could see and work with . <p> As the trilogy continues though , we can see how Lukes kernel of faith begins to spread like wildfire amongst his friends . Leia goes from being a person of the world to becoming incredibly empathic . Once she was shown the door , her mind began to expand . It took a little longer , but she got there . So asking the question as to why did Yoda teach Luke of Leia , I think it really comes down to the fact that because Luke was more receptive at the time of the story- and that would enable him- to learn faster . That 's it .

" all the while burying that figure in cases filled overwhelmingly with Batman and Superman figures . - Black Widow , Gamora , and Rey have all suffered this fate , despite women making up a large chunk of the geek community . - It is , therefore , with figures like Queen Hippolyta that I wonder what toy pegs would look like if they were overflowing with non-shortpacked , strong , older female characters . - If mothers , grandmothers , and older women walked into toy stores and saw heroic bodies that resembled theirs . - If male characters were sometimes shortpacked to accommodate this . - Some would call that a silly " What If ?

The new clothing line was just launched and as you guys know , I 'm a sucker for the Bombshells !

The material wont wrinkle , which I know because I packed it in a suitcase and it came out after many , many hours in perfect shape . The pic is a little foreshortened because its shot from the top , but you can see the length . Also , the sleeves on this and the Wonder Woman shirt are long enough to make your arms look good . I hate cap sleeves with the fire of a thousand suns . No one looks good in those ! <p> Finally , I got to check out the Harley Quinn bomber jacket , which I am absolutely in love with .

@@108167053 @3567053/ <h> Iron Fist : The Changing Heritage of Danny Rand <h> Iron Fist : The Changing Heritage of Danny Rand <p> Danny Rand AKA Iron Fist is a fun , layered character . As- the recent Iron Fist show on Netflix reminded us , he is also- an example of the white savior narrative trope , one form of which involves- stories where- a white guy- meets another culture of non-white people and not only becomes a master of some aspect of that culture , but is considered better at it than anyone native to that culture , after which he saves the day . Its a part of the character that is difficult to escape unless you just change his ethnicity or alter some aspects of his story . But interestingly , for the first several years of his career , it was actually implied several times that Danny Rand had- mixed ancestry . <p> Let 's quickly review. - Danny Rand- first appeared in 1974 in " Marvel Premiere " #15 , written by Roy Thomas and with art by Gil Kane . The story shows him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Kun Lun and engaging in martial arts tests . During this , - Danny flashes back on his origin . Ten years previously , we see him as a nine-year-old child traveling through the Himalayan mountains with his father Wendell , his mother Heather , and Wendells business partner Harold Meachum . Wendell Rand speaks of Kun Lun , a city that is only accessible to Earth every ten years for a day , and insists that he knows where to find it . Harold secretly desires both Wendells- share of their company and apparently Heather . At the first opportunity , Harold kills Wendell , sending him falling to his death , and- leaves the surviving Rands- to die in the cold . Later , the two reach the bridge to Kun Lun just as hungry wolves approach , and Heather heroically sacrifices by fighting the wolves , dying in the process but buying Danny enough time to escape . Danny is then found seconds later by the people of Kun Lun , who take him in . Hence , he is here ten years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iron Fist , an " immortal weapon . " <p> The origin continues in " Marvel Premiere " #16 , but now Wolverine-creator Len Wein takes over as writer . Len- continues the flashbacks , showing the people of Kun Lun adopting the lost orphan and asking what he wishes . Danny speaks of revenge . Yu-Ti , leader of Kun Lun , speaks of how revenge hurts the person seeking it as much as their target . He suggests Danny learn martial arts in the hopes that such training and the philosophy behind it will cool his anger . Its an interesting and very lovely idea , actually . That brings us back to the present day , where Danny is now a martial arts master and so bad-ass that he is able to face the final test , challenging an- immortal dragon , and earns the title of Iron Fist . Before Danny- leaves Kun Lun to find his fathers killer , Yu-Ti speaks to the 19-year-old again and reveals that Wendell Rand was his brother . <p> This is a pretty heavy revelation , but Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth will soon be gone . It did give some readers questions , though. - This idea is further explored in 1975- in " Iron Fist " issues #6 , #7 and #8 , by writer and artist team Chris Claremont and John Byrne . In these issues , we learn- that Wendell was indeed a native of Kun Lun , known there as Wendell Rand-Kai . What 's more , he was the firstborn son of Kun Luns previous ruler Tuan and was supposed to inherit rulership of the city . " Yu-Ti , " as it turns out was a title . Tuans second son , the man who rules and is called Yu-Ti when Danny Rand comes to Kun Lun , is really named Nuan . <p> Because I like visual aids , heres- an image ( above ) of Tuan as ruler , with Wendell Rand-Kai standing next to his biological brother Nuan . The man in the mask is Lei Kung , the Thunderer , teacher to Danny Rand and father to Dannys later enemy Davos , the Steel Serpent , who never forgave Rand-Kai for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But despite being deemed worthy of becoming an Iron Fist , Rand-Kai turned it down along with rulership of Kun Lun , choosing instead- to explore Earth and live in it under the name " Wendell Rand . " He is there for many years , making his fortune , meeting Heather and having Danny , when he decides- one day to return to his home , to the mystical place that seems better and more peaceful than Earth , and bring his family with him . Yu-Ti confirms all this , admitting as well that he had been envious of his elder brother Rand-Kai . <p> We never saw Wendell Rand-Kais mother , so presumably she was white , but this meant that Dannys father had mixed heritage AND a native connection to Kun Lun . This was again confirmed and further expanded on " Marvel Team-Up " #63 and #64 . So- starting with his second comic book story ever back in 1974 , Danny Rand- subverted the white savior trope by being mixed and- having a legitimate connection of heritage to the culture of Kun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that stories and histories regularly get revised and retconned . In 1981 , seven years after Dannys first appearance and the first mention that his father was native to Kun Lun , the issue " Power Man and Iron Fist " #75 came out , written by Mary Jo Duffy , with art by Kerry Gammill , edited by Dennis ONeil . The story featured a return to Kun Lun and a new version of Wendells connection to the mystical city . According to this story , Wendell is an American who , as a young man , - is exploring the Himalayas- when he unknowingly crosses the " border " into Kun Lun during the one day every decade that it is part of Earth . He comes upon Tuan and young Nuan , both of whom have discovered that the immortal dragon Shou Lao , against whom all Iron Fists are tested , is out of its cave and acting extremely ornery . Wendell saves Tuan and Nuan , but is injured in the process by the irritated dragon who then just wanders back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovers , the doorway to Earth is closed and he s stuck in Kun Lun . Tuan , thankful that he and his son were saved , adopts the adult Wendell Rand as his new , eldest son and names him " RandKai " ( notice the spelling is also different here ) . Later on , Wendell is worthy to become an Iron Fist and take over , but he chooses to leave , blah blah blah . <p> This has been the canon backstory of Danny and Wendell Rand ever since ( although later comics add in that Wendell also met and fought alongside a previous Iron Fist ) . This back story is a shame for a few reasons . First , even taking into account a world where mystical cities and dragons exist , its kind of ridiculous . There 's no reason for Shou Lao to behave the way that it did except for a flimsy excuse to put Tuan and Nuan in trouble . Wendell becoming a trusted ally to Tuan , ok , but the guy is already in his twenties , why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroism make his father decide to consider him now the first born and with first claim to anything Nuan might otherwise inherit ? Furthermore , - this actually not only brings back the white savior trope for Danny by eliminating his mixed heritage and genuine connection to Kun Lun through his father , it actually adds to it- by having Wendell live out a great white hope story as well . <p> But that 's the way its been since and there 's no sign that Marvel intends to change it . Personally , I wouldve liked it if the Netflix Iron Fist series had gone- back to the idea of Wendell being a warrior native to Kun Lun himself . After all , Netflix and the Marvel Studios movies play fast and loose with a lot of the origin and background elements of its characters ( like making Ego into Star-Lords dad , making Peggy Carter British , having an Infinity Stone give birth to Vision , saying Captain Americas shield is made of vibranium instead of being a vibranium-iron alloy , and portraying Howard Stark as Steve Rogers armorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those changes have led to- stories being more interesting and relevant for todays audience . Maybe well get a whole new take on Iron Fist down the line , whether its Danny or someone he passes the mantle to . Time will tell .

@@108167060 @3567060/ <p> Knowing The Vampire Diaries is coming to an end , the show really had n't  felt like it was making final decisions about our beloved Mystic Falls residents , until now . This weeks episode definitely is a zinger and one that hits hard for those.well , who probably still expected it . Even last weeks reunions/forgiveness and spot the old favorite game was n't as final as what Cade has in store for the Vampire Squad . <p> Since Cade is now out of hell- and has destroyed the Sirens ( we never have one bad guy till the end , guess it really is coming up ) . One last thing to worry about I guess . But to get things moving the episode begins with Cade talking to Bonnie in a Coffee shop , clearly , she does n't  realize who it is , yet after she leaves Cade let 's the manager know his employee is banging his wife and all hell breaks loose .. quite literally . <p> Next up is the Salvatore brothers ; Stefan is locked up of course and Damon is reveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updating the youngest brother on what 's happened so far with the Sirens , and how thrilled Damon is with a balanced humanity on life ! <p> On the other side of town , Matt as a Mr. Sheriff is presiding over a time-capsule event . Guess Mystic Falls really likes digging up its old problems . Really , its just the town digging up a capsule from 1790 that was buried by that- town founders . Appropriate timing to something that I may guess will help in their goal to kill Cade . Though in the meantime Caroline finds an old time capsule she , Bonnie , and Elena had buried . Its an incredibly adorable moment of nostalgia as she reads a letter from her younger self , she sends a photo to Bonnie of Bonnies 11-year-old bucket list , and there are a ton- of photos of all the girls as kids . <p> Somewhere on the road to the Maxwell Bell Bonnie and Enzo are laughing over the picture that Caroline sent . Enzo and Bonnie ar still the cutest and still the happiest , I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least Bonnie comes up with a great idea : before Enzo takes the cure he should take advantage of his immortality and do some adventurous things . Then he can create his own humanity bucket list , until then RACE CARS . Still sooooo adorable ! <p> Now that were all caught up with how everyones lives are after last week , the episode gets to the point with Cade . Mr. Hell 2017 ( or whatever year they 're actually in now ) has decided to go after his minions . Aka , he releases Stefan and tells Damon that he has to kill 100 evil residents or kill Caroline . Surprisingly , even Damons good mood isnt- hampered by this revelation . So he just warns Caroline of the impending issue and goes off to work on his own plan . In the meantime , Caroline tries to give a backup plan to Matt , well a blood orange cocktail emphasize on the blood , but he refuses to ever become a vampire . However , Dorian overhears this and is interested . <p> Before talks of becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifact that was found in the time capsule . An artifact that has the Maxwell crest on it , just like the journals . Seems this item may be the key to deciphering the journals and Dorian starts work on that project . <p> As for what Cade is still up to , he runs into Damon at the school grounds and does a great job of showing Damon just how immortal and untouchable he is . He rips out his own heart , he lights himself on fireand basically , every possible normal way of killing the immortals is useless . It only really goes to show that Cade seems to be a bit of a pyro , but also ruins most of Damons plans . Now Damon has to find Caroline and puts some more brain power on this problem . <p> Finding her at the Mystic Falls Grill is easy , and she has a few ideas but they involve using the cure in Elenas blood . Damon is n't happy about this at all , and as it turns out had no idea that Bonnie and Enzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple use ideas , something is bound to get messed up and Damon refuses to be the one stuck human with Elena stuck asleep for decades still . Yet , Caroline cant turn down the idea of giving Cade the cure , aging him 4000 years in no time , and then letting Enzo take the cure back from him . Sounds like a good plan , but wayyy too many variables are never good for our Circle of Trust . <p> Let 's stop back over and visit our favorite happy couple for some good or even adorable news . After their long day of vampire bucket listing , Bonnie and Enzo end up in the middle of nowhere at this small older house . It seems Bonnie owns this house and Enzo thinks it could be for them , but in reality , the house is now the holding place of Elenas coffin . SURPRISE ! Guess tracking down the cure was a little easier than having to go to Brooklyn . Though , Bonnie also realizes that even with the happiness shes experiencing she must still help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since everything seems to come up Cade this go around its only right that he finds some of the gang and let them in on his plans . You know , since he immortal and has zero reasons to think they could ever come up with a way to defeat him , he wants to revel in his plans and destruction . Oh , yeah , and he kills several people before he even decides to talk to them ( refer back to Pyro theory ) . The plan , though , when he finally does share it is the same plan he had given Damon . The trick- being he gave it to Stefan as well , but Stefan had to either kill 100 people OR Elena . Turns out earlier in the episode he has an odd conversation with a woman at the gas station . That woman turns out to be a real estate agent who sold Bonnie the house . If he can change the documents , and he does near the end of the episode , he will be allowed to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what Stefan has to do and Damon has to do are separate . So the body count could be HUGE.except Stefan gets the lease changed and as Bonnie and Enzo are enjoying a moment talking about their future and the future of their friends Enzo is ripped from the house . <p> Damon calls his brother and begs him not to hurt Elena , but his plan of calling the NYPD is n't useful . Turns out Cade meeting Bonnie at the beginning of the episode served as a moment to read her mind . So Cade found out about Bonnies house and sent his loyal puppy dog Stefan after the real estate agent and the house . The only standing between Elena and Stefan is Bonnie and Enzo who ca n't get into the house anymore . So the only Bonnie can think of is to get the cure ready . Before they do n't  have the chance anymore . <p> Stefan is determined no matter how much Damon begs . His reasoning is that if he kills Elena , Damon could never forgive him and hed be rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be pretty nasty when she reads it one day.hopefully . <p> But no one else gets there in time , and while Bonnie is distracted with the cure , Stefan is upon Enzo . In the last minutes of the episode , some of the final actions seeming to happen . When Bonnie walks around the corner , Enzo stands in the doorway as Stefan rips out his heart and kills him ( NOOOOOOO ENZOOOOOO ) . With no remorse , Stefan walks into the house staring down a Bonnie Bennett who is devastated . But , with the last will she has to get to Enzos body , she stabs Stefan with the cure . This heart-shattering episode ends with Bonnie screaming and holding Enzos desiccating body . Her screams so distraught that he body releases a pulse , maybe psychic , into the sky . <p> Enzo is gone , and Stefan is human . <p> Other small things in the episode : <p> Dorian chose not to become a vampire after watching Damon kill an innocent woman . <p> Dorian ALSO has a weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cursed family is likely to come into play somehow . <h> Dash Wilder <p> Dash Wilder is a contributor at Legion of Leia and one of the crazier member of the HD1Jump team .

This year was no different as " The Present " sets up a horrible vision of the future while- getting our villains back on track . <p> **SPOILERS BELOW** <p> To say that reception of Season 3 of- The Flash- has been mixed would be a bit of an understatement . Flashpoint caused a lot of problems for Team- Flash and painted Barry as the unintentional bad guy of the first eleven episodes . As the bright beacon of hope in this universe , - The Flash is something of an immutable symbol of good . Even so , his- intention to- tamper with the timeline has affected every show in the DCW- and its caused Barry to seriously reconsider some of the choices he s made . While all of this has made for a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you combine that feeling of ennui with a murky set of motivations for Alchemy and Savitar , there was a sense that something- major needed to happen before the holiday break . Man , did they deliver . <p> " The Present " had a lot going on , and it only behooves us to start at the beginning with the return of Mark Hamill as- Earth-3s version of- The Trickster . While it was nothing more than a glorified cameo , Mark Hamill delivered a fantastic performance . The look of this- Trickster was clearly a reference to- The Joker , a character Hamill has voiced for a quarter of a century and it was kind of perfect . The homage to the clown prince of crime was a great easter egg that also gave him an opportunity to revive an old rivalry . Of course I 'm talking about his time arching against John Wesley Shipp in the 90s Flash. - Watching Shipp go toe to toe with Hamill was extremely satisfying . <p> In fact one of my only complaints about this weeks episode was Hamills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs going on right now ( looking at you Episode III ) , but I would love to see- Trickster come back for a few more episodes when time permits . Regardless , it was a great stocking stuffer that brought Jay Garrick back in the fold as Barry needed to consult with a contemporary . Since Henry Allens death in Season Two , its been a bit of a balancing act for Shipp has he has to play the same character , " but different " . In some cases there 's a lot of overlap as both Jay and Henry are fundamentally good people . Even so , Jay is n't Barrys father so there is a level of awkwardness that Shipp delivers in just the right amount . While its clear he is n't quit comfortable being Barrys mentor , its obvious that the bond between these two men has grown into something that becomes the cornerstone of- The Flash mythos : lineage . <p> With Jay in an advisory role , pieces of- Savitar and Alchemys- backstory are finally coming to light . The first big reveal was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophers stone , Julian has become an unknowing pawn in- Savitars game against Barry . This was a smart move as it allowed the writers to fake the audience out . Julian has been so anti-metahuman since Season 3 began , to reveal he was really just another bad guy hiding amongst the heroes would have been anticlimactic . What makes Julian works is his moral disdain for the entire concept of costumed super heroes and how they flaunt the law . Now , he finds out that he s been manipulated by one of these " freaks " , just gives Julian- more ammunition for his hatred of the metas. - - I wonder how long before he backslides into jerk mode with Barry ? Time will tell . <p> Flash Fact : Dr. Alchemy is the byproduct of a split personality .

The disembodied voice coming out of a groggy Julian served to show how unnerving the concept of- Savitar really is . Somehow when we see his LotR inspired armor , it detracts from his menace . Regardless , the reveal that- Savitar is n't a god but someone that Barry has wronged n the future .

While a lot of people are betting on Wally , my gut says this is a different version of Barry and the ultimate reason why things have gone so badly in this fractured timeline . <p> His menacing prophecy about betrayal and death seemed to indicate that even though the producers are insisting that- Flashpoint is dead and gone , its really just bubbling under the surface , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should talk about the major reveal that 's been teased for a few weeks now : the Death of Iris West .

Disoriented , he witnessed Savitar killing Iris despite his future selfs best efforts to save her . Ripped back to the present by Jay , Barry has to wrestle with this knowledge of the future . <p> Flash Fact : - in- the comics , - Iris is killed by the Reverse Flash during a costume party where he vibrated his hand through her head . This set off a chain of events that would eventually pit Barry against his nemesis until our hero snapped his neck .

Jays insistence that the future is not set and that focusing on the moment is good advice for all of us . Taking this to heart , the chance to see a traditional West family Christmas was the highlight of the week . Between Wally getting his official Kid Flash- uniform , Hipster Wells decorating- S.T.A.R- Labs in a metric ton of tinsel , the amazing Grandmother Eggnoff ( trademark pending ) , and Caitlin using her wintery powers to ensure a White Christmas ; the mid-season finale- ended on a note of hope and joy , a perfect counterpoint to the instability of the future . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story goes , have a Happy Holidays and watch some Flash reruns ! <h> Shaun Rosado <p> Shaun Rosado is creator and host of a weekly geek podcast called " Shauncastic ! , " where he and a rotating cast discuss everything geeky , nerdy and pop culture-y as well as the creator of " Meet At The Tavern , " a blog dedicated to RPGs .

The cinematography is breathtaking and will capture the hearts of anyone who watches the film . It is a little bit on the dark side in comparison to- Disneys- version , but it is still appropriate enough for the little ones , especially when they run across the little puppy hybrid creatures that make short appearances in the film . <p> Now , let us tackle the- storyline . <p> The storyline , I felt , was very close to the original French fairytale . As a child , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the lexicon in my brain perked up while watching this film . <p> Perducas , upon hearing the Father looking for his son , goes down to confront him . The Father escapes on horseback and stumbles upon the most gloriously beautiful and destitute property of the Beast ( Vincent Cassel ) . In familiar fashion , the Father ends up being attacked by the Beast after he plucks a rose to give to Belle . His life is threatened and he hurries back home after being given a one day reprieve to say good bye to his family . Belle blames herself for the situation that her Father is in and steals his horse , mentioning the secret words to guide her way back to the Beasts castle . <p> Belle meets the Beast and is given all the luxuries she wants but , in exchange , she must obey certain rules . She must meet the Beast for dinner at 7 PM and she can not leave the castle when it is dark . That seems fairly simple enough . Time passes with the Beast prompting Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . She can not . <p> Interspersed throughout the film are dreams that Belle has that provide us with the background origins of the Beast and why he is now the way that he is . I will not reveal what the dreams pertain to because I want to keep some mystery for you guys . <p> One night Belle discovers the Beast devouring a hog and she , realistically , freaks out and runs from the Castle . The Beast pursues her and traps her at a frozen lake . Knowing how heavy the Beast is , the ice cracks underneath Belle and she plunges into the lake . The next day the Beast permits her to leave to visit her family for one day . <p> Meanwhile , the family has declined further . Because of the eldest son and his debts to Perducas , the family is in danger . The sisters are being threatened to be sold as slaves and the Father has been lying in a coma since Belle left . Belle returns and greets her family . The eldest son sees her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle and steal the riches to pay off Perducas . He steals her horse and is followed by the second eldest brother to assist . <p> Belle has a final dream , which influences her hearts ability to accept the Beast as her lover . She finds her way back to the castle with her youngest brother and witnesses the Beasts death at the hands of Perducas . Without revealing much in the way of spoilers , Belle manages to revive him in the castle . <p> The film ends with Belle finishing telling her story to her children . Belle then goes outside to greet her husband , the newly transformed Beast , and everyone lives happily ever after . <p> The Good <p> The cinematography of this film was truly astounding . Visually , I could not find anything that looked out of place . The color palette utilized throughout the film worked well , with everything complementing each other . One of the comments a friend of mine made while we were watching was , " If Guillermo Del Toro had a twin brother with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his baby . " The visual effects , especially when we get to the Beasts castle , gave a magic to the world that was very believable . In some ways , the movies effects reminded me a bit of <p> The costume design was also impeccable . Pierre-Yves Gayraud outdid himself with the costumes , making it very believable to the general time era that the film was tentatively taking place in , which I think was like early 1800s . The change in costumes once we reached the Beasts castle reflected how stuck in time the Beast was . <p> The story sticking to the fairytale I had read growing up was a definite benefit . I have always liked Disneys Beauty and the Beast , but have always had a bigger fascination for the original fairytale versions . Because the filmmaker decided to stick to the majority of the original fairytale , the little pagan homages that he had added into the storyline felt very natural and not forced . Taking into account the visual effects , the storyline made a lot more sense when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a quick note regarding the fairytale whimsy that this film had . Throughout the course of the film , you have Belle telling the story of Beauty and the Beast to her two young children . I thought the decision to include this was a great choice because it helped to enhance the fairytale whimsy that the film seemed keen on embracing . <p> The Bad <p> One of the weakest , yet most vital components of the film was the lack of romance building . Mind you , most people connect the romance in the Beauty and the Beast story to Stockholms Syndrome , which is n't very romantic . However , this particular incarnation of the story has very little in the ways of Stockholms . Whether it was due to poor writing or poor acting , when we came upon the scene where Belle realizes that she is in love with the Beast , it was very unbelievable . Up until that point , Belle had treated him with disgust and disdain . Then one magical dream later , she is in love with him ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secondary plot surrounding Belles brother and Perducas . While watching the film , it made sense why they were included in there to create conflict for the Beast and Belle . However , I felt that it was a highly unnecessary plot point and conflict could have been created without resorting to such an annoying twist . In general , though , I found Belles whole family annoying , except for her youngest brother and her Father . They were actually somewhat okay people . <p> Overall <p> If you are looking for a film that is visually appealing and is fairly okay in terms of the actual plot , this is the movie for you . Its definitely a movie meant to entertain and astound the senses visually . Its definitely not an Oscar worthy film in terms of the acting and writing , but its definitely something I think people could watch again and again if they need a distraction from the real world . I also think its appropriate for children so , perhaps , a different variation that families can show their kids on movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States this Friday , September 23 , 2016. 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

The episode provided a great example of adapting the spirit , rather than the letter , of Terry Brooks work , particularly through the new character Remo . <p> One of the things I had seen in the lead up to the episode was the photo of Amberle with her legs wrapped around Wil , their lips locked , and that initially seemed out of place to me , as not only was the long , slow build up of the feelings between the two of them ( which obviously would not have translated well on television ) so delightful in the novel , but even within the show the two characters did n't  seem to be there yet . Playing it off as a dream sequence worked well as a way of showing that Amberles thoughts were headed in that direction even before she was willing to act on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a bit suspicious of was this weird Elven torturer ( Remo ) . Most of my concern there had to do with pacing , as it already seems like some plot elements are being rushed ( case in point being Arion and Catanias search for the Warlock Lords sword ) , so why dwell on this for so much of one of the small handful of episodes that remain ? In the context of the full episode , however , it struck me that after several episodes in which Demons were monsters-of-the-week , Remo represents a reminder that men and women are just as capable of falling into evil as are supernatural creatures . This is a common theme throughout Terry Brooks work , so well done to the writers for that . <p> In addition , Remos fall serves to highlight the peril Bandon is in , and into which even Allanon is briefly pulled " in the contrast we get a sense of the strength required to resist . Of course , Allanon has more troubles besides , as the Changeling , posing as Eventine ( just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the dark magic blade , then urges his son to use it to kill the Druid .

After Slanter brings Ander and Tilton to see for themselves , the prince let 's him go in order to warn his people , and they part not quite as friends , but not really enemies any more . It seems that the show is setting up the Gnomes to take up the role the Trolls played in the book , which makes me think the combined dialogue of Ander and Slanter is taking the place of the brilliant speech delivered by the Troll leader Amantar about putting differences aside . <p> But getting back to Pykon , aside from outing Eretria as bisexual , it seems the writers went to a lot of trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her back , so its probably safe to assume that this is going to become important some time soon . <p> The scenes of Remo torturing Amberle are uncomfortable to watch , but well enough done that after our heroes have all but escaped and he reappears , there 's such a feeling of satisfaction in her being the one to finish him off that it take some time for the fact to sink in that Amberle just killed a man , which is certainly a new spin on her character . <p> Almost immediately afterwards , the Reaper makes a reappearance of its own , providing Crispin , who at this point is the last remaining Elven soldier in the group , to make a brave attempt ( which lasts almost a handful of seconds ) to cover the others retreat before the Reaper can butcher him . <p> Cephelo and Eretria manage to cross the chasm , but while Cephelo works to make sure the Demon does not make it across , Eretria tries to ensure that Wil and Amberle do .

Of all the changes made to the book thus far this season , this may be the most surprising one . At this point in the book , Wil was still encountering a block when he tried to use the Elfstones . This ended up being a massive point of character development for Wil , which makes me question how ( or whether ) the TV version is going to achieve the same type of growth , or are different psychological themes entirely going to come into play ? <p> First though , well have to find how he survives , since Cephelo finally succeeds in cutting the line , causing Amberle , Wil , Eretria , and the Reaper to plunge into the chasm <p> Legion contributor Jay Scarlet is recapping The Shannara Chronicles this season .

The organizers of the Womens March on Washington announced last month that they were going to host a general strike on International Womens Day. - They have titled the strike as " A Day Without Women " . <p> Now you may be asking , " What is the greater purpose behind this besides disrupting the workforce ? What is so important that you cant just talk it out ? " The second question and variations of it have popped up on my newsfeed frequently , so I must address it . <p> " A Day Without A Woman " was established to acknowledge " the enormous value that women of all backgrounds add to our socio-economic system " while receiving lower wages and experiencing greater inequities , vulnerability to discrimination , sexual harassment , and job insecurity , " according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their support of the strike . <p> Despite the first line of the photo above , this strike is not limited to just taking a day off of work and marching downtown to strike . For those of us who do not have the luxury of taking off of work , there are other ways you can demonstrate the importance of womens role in the day-to-day happenings of the United States . Here are a couple : <p> You can wear red to showcase your support of the movement . If there is a sea of red wherever heads turn , then it will be a message that we can not ignore . Something as simple as wearing a color can be enough if finances limit you . And this statement is flexible enough that you can accommodate it to your work dress codes . <p> Do not shop . At all . Resist . Resist the shopping needs . According to Forbes , women are the largest consumers in our economy . Women not only buy for themselves , but for their households as well . By not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the true extent of womens economic influence in society . If you absolutely need to purchase something , do it tonight or the day after tomorrow . <p> Show your support online . It takes a minute at most and it will spread the word of what the strike is and what it entails . The more support we show via the interwebs , the stronger and more prevalent the message we are trying to send will be . Itll also encourage those who are able to strike that they are not doing this alone . <p> Tell your story or share observations . With social media at our fingertips , we have storytelling platforms available to all of us . Whether you use Facebook or go anonymous on a blog , perhaps share a personal story or experience that highlights what the Womens March people are trying to highlight . Examples can focus on gender wage disparity , sexual harassment , etc . <p> Bug the heck out of your representatives . Call them up and tell them about the concerns women collectively have regarding the workplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more of a chance they will bring the issue to the table later on . <p> There are so many possibilities for how we can showcase the message behind " A Day Without Women " . Whether or not we actively go down and strike ( and trust me when I say I wish I physically could ) , there is so much one can do to show support at work or behind a computer screen . Together , perhaps , we can make as big of an impact as we did during the first Womens March on Washington . 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

@@108167138 @3567138/ <h> The Shannara Chronicles Recap/Review : Season 1 , Ep . 10 " Ellcrys <p> Watching this show is always a bit of an emotional rollercoaster for me " there 's a lot that is really good : great performances , amazing visual effects , etc. , but there are also a lot of moments when I have to repeat the mantra do n't  judge by the book over and over in my head . <p> Case in point , the episode opens with Amberle in the Bloodfire , where she has a vision of herself speaking with the Ellcrys voice telling her that she is the seed . There is n't necessarily anything wrong with this , the emotions she expresses all fit , but why reveal this information to viewers right at the beginning of the episode ? It seems like it could easily have been hinted at ( as in the book ) , while still withholding enough that what happens later is still a surprise to anyone not familiar with the story . <p> Just outside the Bloodfire , Wil uses the Elfstones to heal Eretria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-ignite the Bloodfire , allowing Amberle to return . There are two related aspects in which this series of events left me seriously disappointed . The first is the glaring absence of the Reaper , who I guess we are left to believe was killed back at Pykon , which is a terrible let down . Then there is the fact that Wil is using the Elfstones left and rightover the course of the series he has grown a lot as a magic user , but what insights has he had into himself ? How has the journey changed him as a person , as opposed to merely changing his circumstances ? In contrast , the psychology of his struggle to use the Elfstones in the book was so magnificently wroughtdont judge by the book , do n't  judge by the book <p> Our three heroes head back out the tunnels , pursued by the Trolls . They come to barrier that they can only pass with difficulty , and Eretria decides to remain behind to break the mechanism and give Amberle and Wil a chance to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home after Amberle had rejected the Ellcrys in the Bloodifre . Okay , props to the show , I love Eretria being such a badass , and its interesting that she 's now acting as the moral center as well " this is character development done right . <p> Back at Arborlon , Catania brings some food to Bandon , who is back in chains . He uses her to escape , because the random guard dude apparently cares more about a random ( presumably , from his perspective ) servant than doing his duty or allowing a potentially dangerous prisoner to go free . I feel like there is a metaphor for abusive relationships in Catania coming to visit Bandon and in the dialogue between the two of them , but if there is also intended to be a message there , I do n't  think it quite comes off . <p> Amberle and Wil arrive to the outskirts of Arborlon shortly after the Demon hordes ( so after all that , Safehold is only about half a days horse ride from Arborlon ? And what was the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark to try to get to the city , and pass the time by getting intimate with each other . Somehow during all this Amberle chooses to accept the sacrifice she will have to make . <p> As Amberle and Wil enter the woods around Arborlon , the battle between Elves/Gnomes and Demons begins , and , despite having stated in an earlier strategy meeting that he would lead the Elves in the last line of defense around the Ellcrys Sanctuary , Ander and Tilton are right there on the front lines . Wil and Amberle are nearly caught by a patrol of Demons , but are saved by a group of Gnomes led by Allanon and Slanter . They all begin to run through the dark forest toward the Ellcrys , and I guess we see why the Chosen have to run the Gauntlet . <p> In the course of battle , Ander and Tilton cut their way toward a Demon wielding the Warlock Lords sword , only to discover that it is a reanimated Arion . He is able to kill Tilton before Ander is able to stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Amberle and Wil get close to the Sanctuary , the Dagda Mor tries to stop them , but gets drawn into a duel with Allanon , allowing the young heroes to reach the tree . Amberle finally gets around to telling Wil what has to happen next . Just then the Dagda Mor bursts in , dragging a defeated Allanon with him . Wil is able to use the Elfstones to hold the Demon-Druid back long enough for Allanon to recover sufficiently to get within reach of the Dagda Mor and cut his head off , and for Amberle to get inside the Ellcrys . Instantly , the Demons disappear and the Ellcrys is restored . <p> In general , I like the argument between Wil and Allanon that follows , but Amberle is the " price " of Wils magic use ? I 'm calling shenanigans . At least they got the tension between Ohmsford and Druid right . Despite all of that , as Wil prepares to go back to Safehold for Eretria , the two men agree to face any future evils the Dagda Mors presence may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping up more or less happily in Arborlon , a lone figure in a tattered cloak trudges through a barren landscapeoh wait , turns out its black-eyed Bandon , and he has the Warlock Lords sword . Did they just set Bandon up to become a ( or more likely , the ) Mord Wraith ? Thatd be sweeeet . <p> To be continuedas much as there have been some serious flaws , there 's also been enough good ( and potential for even better ) in the series that I hope it does happen , not least because I love Wishsong so much . Of course they could also move forward with the same cast , filling the generational gap between booksI guess well see what they have planned for season 2 , assuming MTV renews it .

The theories are endless and one theory that has been making the rounds concerns Will Byers sexuality . <p> Today Noah Schnapp , the actor who portrays Will in the series , has spoken out on his Instagram page about the speculation surrounding his characters sexuality and the power of strong writing : <p> So I thought it would be time to jump into the conversation .

Which is what you are all doing . <p> via @noahschnapp <p> This is a point that I agree with immensely in terms of storytelling . Part of the reason why shows like Stranger Things are so memorable and compelling are because they make their viewers question and think about the show . The same goes for novels and movies . Part of the reason why certain novels are introduced to us in school is because , whether you agree or disagree , certain novels carry messages and make people think beyond the written word . <p> However , our societys need to constantly put labels on things makes it more difficult to go about writing in such a manner . People today need constant confirmation as to what they believe a character presents . In the case of Will Byers , many people have projected this idea that he has come to represent the victim of homophobia , labeling him with a sexuality that has n't  even been addressed in the series based off of how the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> For me , Will being gay or not is besides the point . Stranger Things is a show about a bunch of kids who are outsiders and find each other because they have been bullied in some way or are different . Does being sensitive , or a loner , or a teenager who likes photography , or a girl with red hair and big glasses , make you gay ? I 'm only 12 but I do know we all relate to being different . And that 's why I think the Duffers wrote the show the way they did . So you can ask all these questions . I hope the real answer never comes out ! #dufferbrothers- <p> via @noahschnapp <p> In his post , Noah makes several excellent points regarding media , biases , art and the treatment and portrayal of the LGBTQ community .

Stepulov will not say where the attack will be until his son is out of surgery . <p> Because they are now on US soil , this becomes an FBI case . The transplant will take place at their headquarters . Why they have a top notch facility there , I do n't know , but they do . <p> The tension between Jane , Weller , and Keaton is high . Jane confronts Keaton , and he claims it was nothing personal . He was just doing his job , and he would have rather been anywhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with Jane , but none of that matters because Henrik suffers a stroke while in surgery and dies . Now they need to figure out what to tell Stepulov . <p> Jane had spoken with Stepulov , and he hates Keaton for blackmailing him . He thinks it 's unconscionable to use a child that way . Jane believes they should tell Stepulov the truth and then hope he will give up the location , but Keaton wants to pretend Henrik is still alive . They go in , and Keaton begins his story , but Weller interrupts and tells Stepulov the truth . Stepulov does n't take the news very well , refuses to talk , and promises all of NYC will feel his pain . <p> The team jumps into overdrive . Patterson had been working on cracking Stepulov 's phone and laptop . She finds a coded text . It leads them to a warehouse . They split up , and Weller spots a truck filled with basketballs . A man comes out , Weller tries to stop him , and the man runs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to get away with the truck . <p> What is Stepulov planning to do with all those basketballs ? Jane remembers Stepulov told her the worst thing to happen is to lose a child . Keaton 's daughter is playing in the Youth League Nationals at City Rec . They believe this will be the target . <p> They do n't want to risk alerting the Dabbur Zann , so they hold off on evacuating , but Keaton gets a message to his daughter 's agent ( he wants to protect her ) . She gets his daughter out of there , but when they get to the doors , they 're locked . A man arrives and kills the agent . Keaton 's daughter runs . <p> The team plus Keaton arrive , and split up . Reade and Zapata go for the bombs , Weller and Keaton for the daughter , and Jane to provide support everywhere . Reade and Zapata get to the bombs , but there 's no time to disarm them . Patterson decides the only way to stop them is to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . <p> Keaton is not okay with this , because he 's been in contact with his daughter and does n't want to lose knowing where she is . Weller instructs her to go to a locker room , then Patterson kills the towers . No explosions . <p> Weller and Keaton get to the locker room , but his daughter has been taken hostage by one of the men . Weller ca n't get a clean shot . Keaton offers to be the hostage instead and slowly moves towards them . The man tells him to stay back , but Keaton keeps going . Eventually the man moves to shoot Keaton , but Weller gets him first . Keaton and his daughter hug , and Jae arrives just in time to prevent another shooter from taking out Keaton . He thanks her , but she was just doing her job . <p> And while all of that has been going on , Roman has been stuck in his mind . All he does is replay the memory of being in the orphanage over and over again . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane wants to help him , but Weller refuses to let him out . He 's too dangerous . Nas suggests using a criminal profiler she 's worked with in the past - Dr. Karen Sun . Jane initially objects , but Nas thinks it might be good to get fresh eyes on the issue . <p> While they wait for Dr. Sun to arrive , Jane brings Roman coffee and many sugar cubes . When she lost all of her memory , she had to start completely from scratch . She did n't even know if she liked coffee or tea . She knows Roman , so she can at least help him with that . Roman asks if their mother loved them . Jane believes so . Then why did she wipe his memory ? Jane says it was because it was the only chance left to get him back . <p> Later , Dr. Sun arrives . She is tough as nails , highly skilled , and believes she can get Roman to get past the orphanage memory . Jane wants to be there to help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to see Roman . He does n't want her help , but Dr. Sun convinces him she can get him through some of this . She goes into the cell with him , and tries to get him to go through the memory . Roman struggles with it . He can feel and sense it , but it 's too dark ; he ca n't see it . Dr. Sun kills the lights . Roman remembers taking a scrap of the wooden door and being let out . He 's led back to his room , where another kid taunts him . Roman stabs the kid with the door piece . The guard watching him does n't stop him . <p> Concerned by this , Dr. Sun gives Roman an MRI . She shows him happy and traumatic pictures . The results are Roman responds neutrally to both . Jane thinks it 's just a result of the memory wipe , but Dr. Sun disagrees . These sort of things are ingrained in people early on . She believes Roman suffers from extreme Antisocial Personality Disorder . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility for the rest of his life , and to not try and help him remember anymore . Any memories he uncovers risk retriggering and retraumatizing him . <p> Jane refuses to accept this . Later that night , after almost everyone has left , Jane watches Roman play with the sugar cubes in his cell . Patterson comes in . She 's working late on the missing neck tattoo . She asks if Jane believes Dr. Sun . Jane does n't , but she 's not objective . Patterson thinks it helps to have an objective person , because she 's invested . Patterson points out Weller 's non-objective mentality helped bring out the best in Jane . Maybe Roman needs that . Patterson leaves Jane to think about it . <p> Speaking of Patterson , other than her hospital stay , she never took time off after her ordeal with Borden and Shepherd . She 's been getting headaches and taking a lot of aspirin . Zapata is worried about her , but Patterson is obsessed with figuring out the neck tattoo . <p> After her talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts ringing , and she reaches for the aspirin , but she knocks it down , and the pills scatter . As she 's picking up the pills , Patterson has an insight . <p> She calls Nas and Jane in . She has solved the tattoo . The leopard 's spots are set up similarly to a popular South African game , mancala , and Roman has been unknowingly creating the code needed with the sugar cubes . <p> The code is in braille . It points to a Kat Jarett , who is affiliated with the Viper Kings biker gang . Nas pulls up the file the ATF have on her , and in the pictures is Roman . What that means we 'll find out next week . <p> OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST : <p> Weller missed a doctor 's appointment with Allie . He feels awful , because he really does want to be a part of everything . He tries to make it up to her by showing her the nursery he 's created in his apartment , but that 's when Allie drops her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Colorado . She wants to take it , because it will eventually help her career , but she 's willing to stay if Weller wants her to . Weller 's a good guy . He tells her to go , but we can all see how much it hurts him to say that . <p> Reade and Zapata are experiencing some awkwardness . They 're trying to get passed THE KISS . Reade apologizes repeatedly and blames it on the pain meds . Zapata makes fun of it . Eventually , as a sign of moving on , Zapata suggests they grab a drink . They go out , talk , agree they 're just friends , and Zapata notices a woman checking Reade out . So , like a good friend and wingperson , Zapata leaves , but not before telling the woman she can have Reade . While Reade and the woman chat , Zapata looks back and seems almost sad or a little jealous Reade is with someone else . Could this be the beginning of the two realizing they feelings ? I ca n't decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weller are definitely still sleeping together . <p> Weller finds Nas in front of a church with a big electronic marquee . He asks if she 's thinking about going in , but she 's not . Before her source in Sandstorm went dark , they used to send her coded messages on the marquee . She goes there every morning to check , just in case . Weller is concerned about her safety , because her source might have been burned , but Nas , comparing Shepherd to Kali , does n't believe anywhere is safe , so she keeps coming back , because she hopes something will be there . <p> So , what do you think ? Do you think Roman is a lost cause ? Do you think Jane will retrigger him and cause him to flip out ? Will he remember her wiping his memory and turn against her ? I think yes to the latter , but I do n't know if he 's a lost cause just yet . I hope not . I think his journey would be even more interesting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the return of the Dabbur Zann ? And does this mean they still have Stepulov still in custody ? Will the Dabbur Zann try to break him out ? That could be a fun distraction from whatever Sandstorm is doing , unless the Dabbur Zann are a part of Sandstorm 's plan . <h> Andrea Levine <p> Andrea Levine is an East Coast based geek , who has more fandoms than she cares to admit .

Check out our interview below and let us know what you think. - Star Wars Rebels will return to- Disney XD- on- September 24 at 8:30 ! <p> Legion of Leia : - Can you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Season 1 . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - It was pure joy and excitement . And not just for me as an actress , but for me as a fan of Ahsoka . I have become such a massive fan of Ahsoka . I care for her so deeply . She is a member of my family . An extension of me . I worry about her . Its so crazy ! Its so crazy to say that I worry about an animated character . But I do . And so to find out that she was alive , what she was doing , that she was coming back to help the rebels , I was just ecstatic . And happy with her arc and evolution on the show . <p> Legion of Leia : - And how did director Dave Filoni tell you ? <p> Ashely Eckstein : - You know , I 'm trying to think back . Because we talked about it for a while . The thing about Dave and the- Clone Wars castyou know , we became like family and close friends . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , I do n't  think it was like this big announcement . I think it was more just in casual conversation . He let me know like , okay , I 'm going to bring her back ! laughs I do n't  remember the exact moment , but I think it wasyou know Dave . He s usually very sly and coy about things . So I think he just did it in casual conversation one day and I had to keep my cool . I was like , yes , yes I would be happy to come back on the show . <p> Legion of Leia : - I was there at the big Season 2 finale event at Disney , and people in the audience were crying . I 'm curious about when you read that scene and what he told you about that . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - So , I had an interesting moment with that screening because , I walked in , honestly convinced that Ahsoka was going to die ; that I was going to watch her death unfold on the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great lengths to make sure I did n't  know what happened . You know , he had even convinced my husband David that Ahsoka was going to die . So I went in preparing for the worst . I mean , literally , my heart was racing . I 'd seen most of the episodes up until the end . And when it got to the point where it was the scene that I had n't  seen yet , I could feel my heart beating out of my chest and my eyes were welling up with tears because I thought , oh god , this is it . And then , cut to that scene of her walking into what we think is a Sith temple , and I just immediately said out loud , " What ? " laughs And then , a look of just pure confusion came over my face . Because I had more questions than answers at that point . And then I had to go backstage to do a Q&amp;A at that point , and I was n't even prepared to answer any questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went from tears and being terrified to just hope and confusion at the same time . <p> Image credit : Disney XD <p> Legion of Leia : - I think fans felt the same ! And , of course , fans are speculation about everything . She lived , she 's a Force ghost , all that stuff . Have you heard the Daughter theory ? Editors note : You can read about it here , but in essence , its the a piece of the Daughtersthe personification of the Light side of the Forcespirit went into Ahsoka when she gave her life for her in- Clone Wars , and now Ahsoka is more than mortal . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - Yes ! So the funny thing is , that was one of the first theories I heard right after the finale . And that one makes the most sense to me . So , this is purely my opinion and not based on any sort of fact , but I do think there is some connection because that- convoree bird , if you look closely , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life for Ahsoka . So there is something there . What have you heard ? laughs <p> Legion of Leia : - I 've read every theory I could find and that one makes the most sense to me ! I did n't  catch it when it happened , but it feels like that could be right . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - Of course ! I said in an interview somewhere , that theory , and then someone wrote a whole article about it , like , " Ashley Eckstein says " laughs I 'm like , oh sorry , Dave . I 'm like , this is what happens when you do n't  tell me the truth ! I speculate ! <p> Legion of Leia : - I know we 've talked about this before , but he s the master of talking continually but not revealing anything . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - Isnt it brilliant ? I mean , he has n't  told us anything , despite many minutes of conversation , hours at this point , really , but I do know that he s dropped hints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I still havent figured it out . <p> Legion of Leia : The Ahsoka panel you did at Star Wars Celebration in London , what was that like ? I know you got really emotional on stage . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - Yeah , you know , that was such a beautiful panel that Dave and Pablo Hidalgo put on . I felt like I was a fan up there on stage , because half the information they were unveiling , I had never heard . Dave had given me bits and pieces , but to hear it , and then actually see itDave had drawn a lot of these images . He had storyboarded a lot of these moments . It was truly emotional . I joke and say I 'm usually not that emotional a person , but when it comes to Ahsoka , I am . It was the moment he revealed where Ahsloka had gone back to Anakin , and they were working together on another mission right before Order 66 . And Anakin had basically assigned Captain Rex to Ahsoka . She had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her face tattoos . I lost it . I lost it at that moment because Dave had told me Ahsoka and Captain Rex had gotten together at some point . laughs Not gotten together like that ! But they work together ! That 's what I meant ! Theyd worked together at some point , but he had not elaborated . And he did n't  give me the backstory . And that made the Season 2 finale , or the end of Season 2 so much moreI mean , it just hits you in the gut . When you realize the backstory between Ahsoka and Rex and how much they mean to each other . I just lost it on stage . I could have cried the rest of the panel . They were true tears . I had to cover my face because it was totally an ugly cry . Because they released such beautiful information about her . And a lot of backstory . If you 're an Ahsoka fan , you should definitely watch that panel , because I was shocked at the amount of information that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point , were going to see Ahsoka on- Rebels . They did n't  say whether shed be alive or dead , but she will be back . <p> Image credit : Disney <p> Legion of Leia : - Ooh ! And the whole Nyx Okami thing . Where would you have liked to see that go ? <p> Ashley Eckstein : - You know , its so funny . I appreciated that arc , but I would not have been on team Nyx and Ahsoka . It was an important moment for Ahsoka because it was very real , and I think sometimes with Jedi , we forget that they have real emotions . And so I think it was a really good character-building arc for her and to show that it is natural for Jedi to have these feelings . And that she was no longer a Jedi so she- could have these feelings openly . But they werent really a fit at the end of the day . Their small romance would have been short-lived and I was okay with that . <p> Legion of Leia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have and cant have . It is interesting to see her struggle with what she can have and what she cant . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - Yeah , and I think its something she does struggle with . Ahoka is a mix of Anakin and Obi-Wan . Shes never been exactly like Anakin , but she has bits and pieces of Obi-Wan . Shes not exactly like Obi-Wan either . I think shes a bit more by-the-book than Anakin at times . So to have a relationship , like when Anakin ran off and got married , she would n't have done that because she really does try to live the Jedi way and by the rules . But when she 's no longer a Jedi , she can absolutely have more of that . And you know , I have to give Dave and the writing staff credit , because sometimes with girl characters , they give a girl a boyfriend because that 's the " natural storyline . " Weve talked about this before . They wrote the story in the best way possible . It is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had , but they handled it in the best way possible . It was n't a kind of **26;323;TOOLONG story . It was very real . It was very empowering . It was very organic to the characters . It was a good building moment for Ahsoka , while she 's building her personality and her character outside of the Jedi temple . <p> Legion of Leia : - So , have you read the new Ahsoka book ? Editors note : " Star Wars Ahsoka " by E.K. Johnston will be released on October 11 . <p> Ashley Eckstein : - I am a couple chapters in . I am so excited ! I cant really speak too much about it because I 'm not very far in , but I can tell you it starts off with a bang , and you just jump right in , and you 're immediately invested . And alreadyIm only four chapters in , so I 'm not very far along , but already Ive gotten information that as a fan , I want to know . Where she is , how shes feeling , thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great story and I 'm in for a fun ride . <p> Legion of Leia : - If you had control of the story , and I know you 've said in interviews that you do n't  want that , but what would you like her ultimate outcome to be ? <p> Ashley Eckstein : - You know , first of all , ultimate outcome ; I do hope that she 's alive . In my opinion , she 's alive . I do n't  know if that 's the truth , but that 's just my hope , that she 's alive . I think the thing a lot of fans , especially with her walking into this templeyou know , they 're so quick to say , oh my gosh , she 's going to the Dark sidefor me , I just do n't  ever see that for her . I think she is good through and through . That 's another reason I think there- is something there with the Daughter . She represents the Light side . I really do believe Ahsoka is pure and she is good . So I guess , I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do know that I want her to stay good because that 's what I see . I see her far , far from the Dark side . I hope she lives because she has a lot more life yet to live . <p> Are you guys excited for- Star Wars Rebels Season 3 ?

@@108167195 @3567195/ <h> Review : The BFG <p> Back in 1970 , beloved childrens author Roald Dahl , perhaps against his better judgment , hesitantly allowed Paramount to make a film version of his hit 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . The resulting film , 1971s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory- " directed by Mel Stuart and starring Gene Wilder " has become an adored childhood classic for many youngsters , often eclipsing the book , and has enjoyed periodic revival screenings throughout its life . Many love this film . <p> Roald Dahl , however , hated the film . He famously objected to the open change of protagonist from Charlie to Willy Wonka , and he resented that Spike Milligan , his choice for Willy Wonka , was not cast . He hated that there was a villain in the story , and he hated the Fizzy Lifting Drink scene , which was not in his book . Dahl was so angry that he disowned the movie , swearing that Hollywood would never make another movie based on one of his books while he was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 , studios were quick to adapt his books to film as hastily as possible . Nicholas Roeg directed- The Witches- in 1990 . Danny DeVito directed Matilda- in 1996 . Henry Selick directed James and the Giant Peach- in 1996 . Tim Burton re-adapted Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005 . And Wes Anderson made Fantastic Mr. Fox- in 2009 , which is perhaps the best of the lot . Dahl , we can only postulate , would likely have disapproved of every one of these movies . <p> So one has to wonder what he would think of Steven Spielbergs The BFG . Dahl was a famously dour author , whose view of childhood was , as seen in his books , grounded , dirty , and downright Dickensian . Even as fantastical things were happening to his young protagonists , he kept a sharp eye on their bewildered tenacity and realistic frustration with the world . He was careful to temper his adventure with a lingering sense of relatable struggle , not to mention an undercurrent of welcome melancholy . Spielbergs well-documented sense of magical awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spielbergs world , children are all wide-eyed innocents " usually with daddy issues " who live in a constant state of wonder and discovery . In Spielbergs world , the world is meant to conform to the innocence of children , and not the other way round . <p> As a result , the protagonist of Spielbergs version of The BFG , a young girl named Sophie ( played by the moon-faced moppet Ruby Barnhill ) , emerges as an untouchably pure saint , a peaen to childhood innocence . She is seen , in the films opening , taking care of the mail at her orphanage because the house marm is too lazy to do it herself . She threatens drunks from her orphanage window , and retires to her nightly bed with a flashlight and a copy of Nicholas Nickleby . She has large , friendly dark eyes and clear skin . Sophie is a caricature of childhood innocence , ambition , and perfection . Shes also a perfectly dull protagonist . <p> That is not Barnhills fault , but Spielbergs . His insistence on the cleanest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least Matilda lived in a ghoulish suburban hell , and went to school in a dusty , run-down hole run by a monstrous beast . <p> The real triumph , then , of The BFG , is the BFG himself . Played by Mark Rylance in motion-capture , the BFG is a gangly , odd , malapropism-filled fantasy creature of the highest order . Sophie is kidnapped by a friendly giant who lives in a faraway country , eats horrid vegetables called snozzcumbers , and can hear every tiny whisper in the world with his outsize ears . For a touch of silliness , he is also keen on a bubbly drink that causes explosive flatulence .

I ( Sarah ) will be binge-watching- Stranger Things- all week , hopefully posting at least 2 recaps and reviews a day while maneuvering around my life outside of- Legion of Leia . Stay tuned ! Also , be warned . Potential- SPOILERS ! - I repeat with flashing neon lights " - SPOILERSSSS ! ! ! - There was a lot of information in this episode , so I 'm trying to cut stuff as much as I can . <p> This episode begins about an hour or two where we left off . The trio of boys Mike , Lucas , and Dustin had run into the mysterious Eleven in the pouring rain . The boys have brought Eleven to Mikes basement for the time being while they try to figure out who she is and why they have found her in the rain . An awkward moment when Mike offers Eleven clothes and she starts to strip in front of the boys hints at the type of procedural experience she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically discuss what to do with her . They come to a consensus to let her stay at Mikes house overnight and to have Eleven expose herself to his mother in the morning . This allows them , they surmise , to not expose that they went out against their parents wishes , but to also continue to look for Will Byers without any issues . After Lucas and Dustin leave , Mike decides to give Eleven the nickname El . We are then left to see El inside her makeshift tent , cringing as she hears the thunder crack outside . Possible connection to the government facility ? Well see . <p> Sidenote : I 'm seriously getting a Stephen King vibe from the opening sequences . That and the theme song is a strange mix of John Carpenter with Tron influence . It definitely screams the 80s , which I am enjoying immensely . Do any of you guys get this same vibe from the opening credits ? <p> This episode explores the Byers family a bit deeper through a combination of dialogue and exposition . We slowly begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bit strange . We are shown a highly distressed and sleep-deprived Joyce waiting for Sheriff Hopper to return to give her any information and to get an explanation for why her phone has become burnt . He questions the validity of her statements and there is a tense verbal exchange that ends with an awkward silence when Joyce asks whether or not he would know the sound of his own daughters breathing . As we found out in the last episode , Hoppers daughter is dead . Hopper then leaves , but not before giving Jonathan ( Charlie Heaton ) a bit of tough guy love. - When Sheriff Hopper returns to rejoin the search for Will , one of the officers makes a comment about her being psycho . He defends her but , as he walks away , they start guessing about whether or not he s slept with her . <p> We also get a chance to explore the high school a bit , where we are given some idea as to how the students perceive Jonathan . He apparently keeps to himself and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and dares to offer him some kindness . We are offered a flashback to when Jonathan introduces Will to some music , bringing up the topic of how their step-father Lonnie always tries to get Will to do normal things . Jonathan encourages Will to do what he wants because he wants to and not because of what other people want from him . <p> We then shoot back to Mike and Eleven hiding in Mikes- basement . Mike tries to convince Eleven to go up and introduce herself to his mother , saying that shell find a way to help . Eleven refuses , saying that bad people are after her and makes a gun gesture to indicate they have no problem killing people. - Eventually , they move up to Mikes room when Mike plays hooky from school . Eleven gets distracted by the trophies and then noticeably becomes shocked when she recognizes Will in the picture with Mike and his friends . This is around the time Mikes mom returns home and he hides Eleven in his closet . <p> This triggers a flashblack sequence where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosed space . She is screaming for her " Papa " to help her . " Papa " is revealed to be Dr. Brenner ( Matthew Modine ) , the guy we keep seeing being all secretive and suspicious . My theory is that she did something wrong or something that " Papa " did n't  approve of and , as a result , is being locked into the room as a punishment . Later on , when Lucas and Dustin come to visit Mike and freak out when Eleven is still there , Eleven forces the door closed with her mind and reveals her abilities to the boys . She tries to explain to them how she recognizes Will by using Dungeons &amp; Dragonsfigures . They ask who he is hiding from and she pulls out the Demogorgon to represent the creature that has taken him . <p> Speaking of Dr. Brenner , we see that he s been a sneaky little devil . Scientists from the government laboratory have apparently tapped the phone lines in this tiny Indiana town to get any information they can when something wiggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Joyce with the police dispatcher regarding her missing son . Afterwards , Dr. Brenner and a couple other people in hazmat suits straight out of Spielbergs E.T . invade Joyces property to find any signs of creature activity . Dr. Brenner visits the shed where Will went missing and finds a fascinating piece of goop that must have been left behind by the creature . <p> This leads us to finding out a little bit of information regarding the creature . Mikes sister Nancy is invited to a pool party by her crush Steven , who is by far the most annoying guy ever . Her unlucky friend Barb joins her and is disapproving of the entire scenario , thinking that Nancy is selling herself out for a cute guy . Barb eventually gets peer pressured into drinking which leads to her failing and slicing her finger open . While she goes into the house to try to take care of the bleeding , all the drunk teenagers decide to go swim in the pool . Jonathan comes upon the backyard of Stevens house and starts to take pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This will become important later . <p> Eventually , the teenagers all go inside . Barb tries to get Nancy to leave before she does something shell regret , but Nancy refuses . Barb ends up sitting alone outside on the diving board , cradling her finger when a drop of blood makes it into the water . A shadow looms behind her - and she looks up . The creature is there and provides us with a scary- Alien- moment before both Barb and the creature vanish . Of course , this is conveniently when Jonathans camera decides to act up . Oh , 80s technology <p> Netflix <p> We are then brought back to the Byers home with Joyce sleeping next to the phone , waiting for anyone to call her with news on her son . The phone rings and , after some muffled breathing , we get confirmation that Will is indeed trying to reach his mother . His voice is distorted and full of static . Before they can get further in the conversation , the phone experiences another surge and shorts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the house . Its the song that we heard Jonathan introducing Will to earlier in a flashback . The lights start to flicker to the tune of " Should I Stay Or Should I Go " and Joyce gets distracted by a gradually brightening light before one of the bedroom walls starts to warp . It looks like a figure , possibly the creature , is trying to push its way through to get to Joyce . She , like any sane person would hopefully do , freaks out and runs out the house and hops in her car . However , she gathers up her courage and goes back into the house where the lights are still flickering . 150958 @qwx1010958 150960 @qwx1010960

Because this is a superhero-based TV show , Danny survives the fall and is brought back inside the building to meet the strangely alive , former co-founder of Rand Enterprises , - Harold Meachum . This is where we get more of an explanation behind why Harold is still alive . <p> Harold was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer . He tried everything , but nothing was going to stop it from progressing . Due to his love ( ? ) for his family but , more importantly , his family , Harold sought out The Hand and they helped him . However , there are quite a few conditions he had to make in exchange for his life . He can never leave his apartment and he must help out The Hand whenever they demand it of him .

Good to know . <p> Credit : Netflix <p> The Meachum siblings hastily throw together a press conference to introduce Danny Rand back to the corporate world . Although Danny manages to maintain his composure throughout the brief conference , watching the whole thing happen made me overwhelmed due to the lack of preparation for those darn reporters . It looks like , based off of the press conference , that everything is patched up between the Meachum siblings and Danny , but we all know that ai n't  going to be easy . <p> Bless , Danny , but he made his first business faux when he sits in on his first shareholders business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells life-saving drugs for profit , rather than selling them at cost to whoever needs them .

Let 's just say , this company behavior did not surprise me . But it sure surprised Danny . <p> He puts his foot down , of course , and pisses off the Board and Ward . Ward makes Joy become Dannys babysitter of sorts , telling her to find ways to distract him so he does n't  screw things up . This leads to them going on a bonding walk where Danny regails her with tales of how he was trained by monks . This bonding time eventually leads us to our first decent fight from Danny .

Danny stashes Joy at Colleens dojo before hunting down where these Triad gangsters came from .

Danny freaks them out by asking why The Hand would want it . <p> Meanwhile , The Hand aka Madame Gao is super pleased that they now have the Pier and reward Harold with a chance to see his daughter . However , upon seeing her icing her eye , he asks another favor from The Hand . The Hand accompanies him to the restaurant that the Triad gangsters own and allow him to kill the man who harmed his daughter .

Can I kill them now ? <p> All in all , this episode was a lot better than previous episodes . Although I hold the opinion that a show shouldnt take four episodes in to hook a viewer , I 'll be more lenient on Iron Fist because I knew ahead of time that it would be a harder show to sell to the typical Marvel audience . This was a sentiment I shared regarding Doctor Strange as well . <p> Credit : Netflix <p> RANDOM MUSINGS <p> As much as I would have loved to discuss Colleen Wing in this episode , the writers did not have all that much for her to do .

Mezco Toyz debuted their first Marvel figures as an upcoming addition to their prestige format One:12 Collective , while Kotobukiya showed off the latest Marvel-themed statues from their Art FX+ and Bishoujo collections . But it was Hasbro who stole the show with their Marvel product showcase , with an exciting new assortment of action figures and role play toys , all under their Marvel Legends brand . <p> I saw so many cool new products , it was tough to boil this list down to only ten items , but that seemed like a nice , round , SEO-friendly number , so I somehow managed .

I mean , check out this Daredevil he comes in three color variants , including the iconic red suit , yellow and red First Appearance and all-black versions of the hero of Hells Kitchen costume This is quite possibly THE definitive toy based on this hero . <p> 9 .

The coolest part is , they 're releasing figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s-era Rogue . This is actually the first toy , ever to feature the soon-to-be X-Mans green and black costume , and she should fit in perfectly with the previously-released 3.75 ? scale Ms. Marvel and Mystique . <p> 8 . Marvel Legends Movie Doctor Strange ( Hasbro ) <p> While we could n't take any pictures , trust me when I say Hasbro nailed it with their toy version of Benedict Cumberbatchs live action Doctor Strange . The sculpt Hasbros team revealed totally nailed the actor , and his costume looked like the perfect real-world adaptation of the Stephen Strange we know from the comics . <p> 7 . Marvel Legends Deadpool ( Hasbro ) <p> What makes a great Deadpool toy ? A lot of articulation , for sure , so he can unleash his signature brand of mayhem on the other toys in your collection a nice portrait featuring Wade Wilsons expressive white eyes never hurts and a ridiculous arsenal of guns and swords is kind of a requisite . Hasbros Marvel Legends Deadpool hits all these bases , and even gives the Merc with a Mouth an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2016s most fun-looking action figures . <p> 6 . Marvel Legends Phoenix ( Hasbro ) <p> Let me level with you I 'm completely in love with the Dark Phoenix Saga . After over a quarter century , it remains one of the most important stories told in the comic book medium . And the central character in that iconic story is Jean Grey , the Phoenix herself , as she struggles to cope with the god-like powers with which she has found herself imbued . Hasbros new Phoenix action figure commemorates this classic story arc by paying tribute to our protagonist , making this a must-buy addition to the X-Men-themed wave of Marvel Legends toys set to hit retail this summer . <p> 5 . Bishoujo Collection Spider-Gwen ( Kotobukiya ) <p> Japanese company Kotobukiya has been releasing some excellent statues based on the Marvel universe for years . Their Avengers and X-MenArt FX+ collections which were based on the artwork of Adi Granov are some of the coolest statues you 're likely to find based on Marvels most iconic super hero teams . But for all the awesome new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishoujo Spider-Gwen who shined the brightest . If you 're not familiar with the term , " bishoujo " is a Japanese art style which translates roughly to " pretty girl . " This gives leeway for some shady corners of the toy and collectible world to put forth unnecessarily sexualized and objectified versions of female characters , but Kotobukiyas statue line instead taps into a more classical " bombshell " aesthetic , heroes filled with confidence and agency as depicted in the artwork of master illustrator and celebrated video game concept artist Shunya Yamashita , whose work serves as the basis for this series . Yamashita-sans latest design is Gwen Stacys super hero alter ego , sculpted in mid-leap toward whatever action awaits her . The statue offers not only a dynamic anime twist on Spider-Gwen , but includes two swappable headsculpts , so Gwen can be displayed with or without her mask and hood . <p> 4 . Marvel Legends Nico Minoru ( Hasbro ) <p> Of all the things I never imagined I 'd see , a Nico action figure would be on the short list . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member would be getting the toy treatment in 2016 .

A Runaways die-hard like me never thought I 'd see the day when one of my heroes would join the Marvel toy line , but here we are and I could not be more excited . <p> 3 . Marvel Legends Captain America Cosplay Shield ( Hasbro ) <p> Hasbro has been releasing Marvel role play toys for kids for years now . And they 've been paying attention when they attend San Diego Comic Con every year . So I cant believe this has n't  happened sooner , but at Toy Fair they announced their plans to produce adult-sized role play items from the Marvel Universe , perfect for fans , collectors , and cosplayers alike . The first assortment of Marvel Legends role play items will include highly detailed , 1:1 scale replicas of Iron-Mans helmet as well as Captain Americas shield . Weve seen other life-sized Cap shields in the past , but Hasbros toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back about a hundred bucks , making it one of the most affordable cosplay accessory you 're likely to find . <p> Elizabeth Olsens Scarlet Witch definitely got the short shrift in terms of merchandising for 2015s Age Of Ultron , but Hasbro is making good on their promise to course-correct , by including the Avenger in their Marvel Legends collection . Scarlet Witch sports her updated Civil War costume , as well as a great portrait of Olsen and some wicked cool magic effect accessories that clip onto her hands , to replicate her reality- altering super powers . Scarlet Witch was a character sorely lacking in the 6 ? toy line , so I 'm very happy to see Hasbro finally adding her to their toy team . <p> 1 . One : 12 Collective Captain America ( Mezco Toyz ) <p> Mezco Toyz completely blew me away with their One:12 Collective toy line , and the most awesome thing I saw at Toy Fair had to be their Captain America .

@@108167230 @3567230/ <h> Carrie Fisher : A Tribute From a Very Heartbroken Fan <p> By now you 've heard the news . Carrie Fisher has passed away . Ive been getting text messages and emails for the past few minutes . AP and CNN alerts on my phone . My wonderful writer and assistant editor Christina Janke has posted the story . Friends of friends were on the flight , right in front of her when she had a heart attack . Carrie Fisher is gone . <p> It feels weird to be texted when someone I 've only met briefly has died , and yet , it makes sense . My role model , who played the character that has shaped my life is has died . I could go over all the accomplishments of her career , but everyone will be doing that . No part of her interesting and varied life will be left from view . I 'm not a news reporter . I cover the geek world . I started a Legion of Leia- because of what this character did for me . I guess this is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carries humor , her willingness to make fun of herself and what playing Princess Leia did to her career was legendary . What little girls from the 70s know is that we did n't  have many women to look up to . Those of us who did n't  like to play with dolls and wanted to have adventures like the boys knew that Leia was our only hope . She ran part of the Rebellion . She stood up to Darth Vader . She did n't  flinch , even after the loss of her entire planet . She tried to rescue Han Solo , and baring that success , she strangled Jabba the Hutt with her own slave chain . She won over the Ewoks ( that dress came from somewhere and it was likely from their last meal ) and became a General . <p> When I was a girl , the women on TV and in film were largely ornaments . They were prizes . They were decoration . I could n't understand , even from a - young age , why that was . Couldnt we save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy or a lightsaber made of a large stick as well as any boy on my block . Princess Leia evened the playing field for us . She took no shit from anyone . She was lounging on that prison cell- bed , after torture , and joking with her rescuer when she first met Luke . <p> Carrie was so much more than Princess Leia . Please know that I know that . Its just that , as a little girl , born in 1973 , her portrayal of Leia was something that I felt in my bones . Leia was a fire that forged who I am . Leias face in- Rogue One made me cry . Leias heart bolstered mine when it was failing . I thought about her when I was at my lowest . Her snarky tone got me through many a moment when a man thought I could n't do whatever it was that was asked of me . I dressed as Leia for Halloween as a little girl . I fight the good fight , regardless of the backlash because of my early exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Force is with me . Rest in great peace , Carrie . Your work has inspired so many women . May the Force be with you . 150957 @qwx1010957 150959 @qwx1010959 <p> " I think that this would make a fantastic obit- so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go , I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight , strangled by my own bra . " Carrie Fisher in WISHFUL DRINKING <p> This news hit me like a shovel to the face when I saw it . For me , being 11 years older than you , the Princess was my first major boyhood crush and has remained so ever since . Its interesting that the last word I ever heard this character say was " Hope . " and the next day , I read that Ms. Fisher had a massive heart attack on the aircraft bringing her home . From what I was able to gather and being a former paramedic myself , I knew that it was a miracle that she was revived ( most arentmad props to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was hopeful that things would turn out fine , I knew that the chances of that werent good to begin with . So todays news was n't a huge shock , but it hurt all the same . <p> May the Force be with you , Carrie . You 'll always be a Princess and General to this fan . <p> My thoughts on Carrie Fisher : For so many women of my generation Carrie Fisher may have started out as Princess Leia , our first on-screen fighter , alongside of the guys and a commander but she also let us know her , Carrie . <p> A woman who had struggles with her mother , yet found a way back to building a relationship . A woman who had weight issues . A woman who battled addiction , and won . A woman who lived with bipolar disease and anxiety . She not only sought treatment but knew that she required ongoing treatment and was open about it . Open about her need for ECT treatment in the hopes of decreasing the stigma of mental illness . <p> Carrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not one single fuck was given about what others thought . That 's why so many of us admired her , not because she was Leia , but because she was Carrie . <p> Jenna- I share your pain . I was 15 when A New Hope came out . And Carrie was one of my kick-ass idols . As a young Air Force officer , shortly after Return of the Jedi , I used snark and wits to get my job done . I learned from the best that it was about brains and guts . And Carrie , like the character she portrayed , personally had that in spades . I remember the first time I saw her one-woman show . I laughed , I cried , and boy did I relate . But I think its the way she embraced the world , foibles and all , when she was back under the harsh lights of the international fandom , that is going to stick with me now . She was herself . And she was a great person . <p> I was shocked at Carrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She lived a good life and inspired many women and girls . I first met Carrie at a Sci-Fi expo in Plano , TX 2002 on the 25th anniversary of Star Wars and got her autograph and photo op . She will always be remembered not as a damsel in distress , but a distressing damsel . <p> Good lord ! Is there a Carrie Fisher support group . She meant so much to me as the iconic princess but as I 've said most of my life the funniest person on the planet . I had no earthly idea that I would grieve as if she were my sister . Here it is 5 months later and her death has not slipped into sweet nostalgia for a beloved author and personal role model . I 'm still scouring you tube and internet for scraps of interviews I have n't seen . Reading all of her books yet again . Memories enter my head similar to experiences of loss of my own family and friends . Talking aloud in solitude of her because I really have no one to share this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very real grief that I have in my life . She impacted who I am profoundly and I am coping with a loss I cant let go . Is anyone out there experiencing this ?
