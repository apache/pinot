Commissioning determines whether the systems need to be adjusted to improve efficiency , indoor air quality , and acoustic performances . <p> The commissioning process encompassesbut also surpassesthe normal testing , adjusting , and balancing ( TAB ) activities commonly performed in inspections . Commissioning also involves comprehensive functional testing to determine how well mechanical and electrical systems work together . Because so many building systems are now integrated , a deficiency in one component can result in substandard operation and performance among other components . In general practice , a commissioning agent assists the construction team in substantively reducing and eliminating defects before the building is turned over to its occupants . Commissioning may also occur based on a partial system upgrade . <p> Profile : Andrew Manzini is Vice President and Principal Consultant , National Green Building , Inc .
