If a man offended another man 's honour , the only way out was blood revenge . <p> Never before have the Viking art of war , weapons and the history of their conquests been presented together in such detail .

In 1838 , eleven convicts and former convicts were put on trial for the brutal murder of 28 Aboriginal men , women and children at Myall Creek in New South Wales . The trial created an enormous amount of controversy because it was almost unknown for Europeans to be charged with the murder of Aborigines . It would become the most serious trial of mass murder in Australia 's history . The trial 's prosecutor was the Attorney General of New South Wales , John Hubert Plunkett . It proved to be Plunkett 's greatest test , as it pitted his forensic brilliance and his belief in equality before the law against the combined forces of the free settlers , the squatters , the military , the emancipists , the newspapers , and even the convict population .

Instead of examining Kant 's arguments for the transcendental ideality of space and time , his deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding , or his account of the dialectic of human reason , J. Colin McQuillan focuses on Kant 's conception of critique . By surveying the different ways the concept of critique was used during theeighteenth century , the relationship between Kant 's critique and his pre-critical experiments with different approaches to metaphysics , the varying definitions of a critique of pure reason Kant offers in the prefaces and introductions to the first Critique , and the way Kant responds to objections , McQuillan is able to highlight an aspect of Kant 's critical philosophy that is too often overlooked-the reason that philosophy is critical .

Yet , as Andres Resendez illuminates in his myth-shattering The Other Slavery , it was practiced for centuries as an open secret . There was no abolitionist movement to protect the tens of thousands of Natives who were kidnapped and enslaved by the conquistadors . Resendez builds the incisive case that it was mass slavery - more than epidemics - that decimated Indian populations across North America . Through riveting new evidence , including testimonies of courageous priests , rapacious merchants , and Indian captives , The Other Slavery reveals nothing less than a key missing piece of American history . For over two centuries we have fought over , abolished , and tried to come to grips with African American slavery . It is time for the West to confront an entirely separate , equally devastating enslavement we have long failed truly to see .

The head-on clash between US-armed Israeli forces and some 20,000 Soviet servicemen with state-of-the-art weaponry turned the Middle East into the hottest front of the Cold War . The Soviets ' success in this war of attrition paved the way for their planning and support of Egypt 's cross-canal offensive in the 1973 Yom Kippur War .

They provide evidence of Soviet support for Egypt by collecting the testimonies of Soviet veterans and cross-checking them against Western , Israeli and Arab records .

But what do generals do when they are not fighting battles ? The Battles Before examines the role of senior leaders in preparing an army for war fighting bureaucratic battles , mobilising forces for operations , or preparing for a future that is impossible to anticipate . The five cases examined in this book focus on strategic leadership and describe how major organisations grapple with political , strategic , economic and cultural change over time . <p> The first three case studies analyse a series of pivotal moments in the history of the Australian Army : the dramatic downsizing that followed the Vietnam War , the seminal 1985 Dibb Review , and the build-up to the East Timor intervention in 1999 . Further cases describe planning within a large organisation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple operations while facing significant impetus for force modernisation . The final chapter focuses on the crucial role of the Armys leadership in developing the next generation of leaders . The book concludes with a series of insights into the study of command in peacetime and its relevance to wartime command , particularly given the challenges that face peacetime commanders who operate within considerable constraints . <p> The Battles Before uses recently declassified documents and interviews with key participants in a meticulous examination of a 30-year period characterised by profound and far-reaching change . This was a period that would reshape the Australian Army .

In this , the Australian guide , the brothers Clancy overflow with passion for pies and pie-eating . There is a ratings system : 5 pies being ' exceptional ' down to 1 pie for ' would n't give it to me dog ' . There is even a cross-section drawing of how a pie is constructed , although I did notice that gristle was missing .

The themes are significant . The research is serious . Archives have been probed and detail from them is made available that was not public before . Australia and Italy may be quite a long way apart in 2013 and the gap between them may be increasing . Nonetheless they share quite a bit of history . Important aspects of it are recovered in this collection of essays . It is as much a part of Australian history as is more familiar tales about ' resistance ' on the frontier , the growth of mining or the spread of ' Meals on Wheels ' across the nation . -- Professor Richard Bosworth

But what if its most serious challenge comes from within ? There was once a national consensus in Israeli society : politics was split between left and right , but its people were broadly secular and liberal . Over the past decade , the country has fractured into tribes - disparate groups with little shared understanding of what it means to be a Zionist , let alone an Israeli . A once-unified population fights internecine battles - over religion and state , war and peace , race and identity - contesting the very notion of a ' Jewish and democratic ' state .

He presents the war as a drama that evolved and developed as it progressed , a production staged and overseen by four contrasting masters : Roosevelt , Churchill , Hitler , and Stalin . <p> Each leader used all the tools at his disposal to present his own distinctive vision of the global drama that was the Second World War . Each area of the media was fully exploited . Brilliantly conceived oratory was applied to underscore each vision . Impression management , the art of political spin , was employed to drive the message home with the careful use of black and white propaganda . Each side employed uniforms , meticulously staged events , and broadcast their messages via all media availablemotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beyond . Their ambitions were similar , but each leader had his own distinct methods , his own carefully created script for elaborately produced and often wildly successful acts and campaigns of deception to win hearts and minds on the frontlines and the home front . <p> The result of this investigation is a wholly distinctive and often surprising work of history , a book that manages to cast a fresh light on the most obsessively studied conflict in human history . <p> Nathaniel Lande , PhD , is a journalist , filmmaker , and author of eleven books , including Cricket and Dispatches from the Front : A History of the American War Correspondent . He was creative director of the Magazine Group , TIME Inc. ; director of TIME World News Service ; and executive producer for CBS and NBC . He was educated at Oxford University , earned his doctorate at Trinity College in Dublin , and has held appointments as professor to the School of Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lived through World War II as a well-informed teenager , or so I thought . At fifteen , I was hired by my local daily newspaper to replace the sports editor who had enlisted in the Navy . That gave me unique access to the United Press teletype that day and night poured out news of the world in conflict . I listened to FDR 's Fireside chats and network war correspondents on the radio ... I watched newsreels and war films . I was acutely aware of what was going on , right ? Little did I know .

" In 2003 , Bono dropped the F-bomb while accepting a Golden Globe , prompting nation-wide debate . A town in Massachusetts leavens $20 fines on swearing in public . Nothing is as paradoxical as our attitude toward swearing and " bad language " : how can we judge profanity so harshly in principle , yet use it so frequently in practice ? Though profanity is more acceptable today than ever , it is still labeled as rude or at best tolerable only under specific circumstances . Cursing , many argue , signals an absence of character , or poor parenting , and is something to avoid at all costs . Yet plenty of us are unconcerned about the dangers of profanity ; bad words are plainly recorded in dictionaries , and are commonly used in mainstream music , Academy Award-winning films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular people use it in conversation every day . <p> Clearly " dirty words " serve an important purpose . In In Praise of Profanity , Michael Adams offers a provocative , unapologetic defense of profanity , arguing that we 've oversimplified profanity by labeling it as taboo , and we consistently fail to appreciate it as a legitimate means of expressing ourselves , either within our social relationships or in popular culture . Adams skillfully weaves together linguistic and psychological analyses of why we swear - for emotional release , as a way to promote group solidarity , or to create intimate relationships - with colorful examples of profanity in literature , TV , film , and music , such as The Sopranos , James Kelman'sHow Late It Was , How Late , or the songs of Nellie McKay .

Conventional wisdom has it that , guided by motives of punishment and revenge , and based on the untenable claim that Germany had caused the war , the treaty 's chief instigators , United States president Woodrow Wilson , British prime minister David Lloyd George and French prime minister Georges Clemenceau , imposed a Carthaginian peace upon the defeated enemy . <p> Loss of vital industrial and agricultural regions and the imposition of massive reparation payments crippled the economy of the Weimar Republic . This in turn constantly destabilised the Republic 's political life . Thus the gentle seeds of democracy that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great War were not allowed to flourish . Instead , the fourteen years of the Republic were marked by perpetual confrontations , setbacks , and unsurmountable difficulties all linked to the harshness of the Versailles Peace Treaty which in the end drove the German people into the arms of Adolf Hitler , whose evil potential , of course , no one could foresee . <p> In this authoritative and well-written book , Jurgen Tampke argues that Germany got away with its responsibility for World War I and its behaviour during it ; that the treaty was nowhere near as punitive as has been claimed ; that the German hyper-inflation of the 1920s was at least partly deliberate policy to minimise the cost of paying reparations ; and that WWII was a continuation of Germany 's longstanding war aims ( which went back beyond WWI to the late nineteenth century ) .

In true cartoonist style , he had the first and last laugh while bringing a taboo issue ( in this instance the demeaning behaviour of many Indigenous men in remote Aboriginal communities ) to national prominence . Sparking debate while making people laugh is what he does best and that 's why he 's a nine-time Walkley Award winner . Trigger Warning features a host of other insights on the stories of the day , covering a wide range of political and cultural topics and key moments from the year that was . They 're all in the unique Leak style - beautifully drawn and coloured , with erudite , telling word bubbles - and when thumbed through in a bound collection , offer a humorous and thought-provoking take on 2016 , from the demise of Labor attack dog Sam Dastyari , through to the introduction of the Safe Schools program , the election of Donald Trump , and onto the death of Fidel Castro . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 unfolds with the US on tenterhooks , the UK post-Brexit , refugee hordes flooding into Europe , the Middle East being the Middle East , China making inspection tours of the South Seas and a rogue Senate in Australia , the rights to laugh and offend might be the best way ahead .

The publisher was forced to defend the book 's literary merit in a court of law - thus beginning one of the most famous trials of the 20th century ... There to take it all in , armed with her pencil and paper , was Sybille Bedford - who wastes no time complaining about the claustrophobia of Courtroom 1 at the Old Bailey . With her trademark wit and flair , Bedford presents us with a play-by-play of the trial : from the prosecution 's questioning of the novel 's thirteen sexual encounters and their listing of all 66 instances of swear words , to the dozens of witnesses who testified - including the Bishop of Woolwich and E.

In the third century , money began to play a decisive role in these practices , as wealthy Christians took ever more elaborate steps to protect their own souls and the souls of their loved ones in the afterlife .

Much like people who wish to make their own bread , grow their own vegetables or make their own wines and beers , many cheese makers know that you can not replace the quality of handmade cheese with the mass produced supermarket cheeses available today . There is no doubt in my mind that the cheeses I can make myself at home are far superior to the commercially produced cheese at the supermarket . Plus , I can make various boutique cheeses at home which are n't readily available at the stores . Additionally , the importance of eating foods without chemical additives , artificial colourings and preservatives is growing , as the awareness of the negative effects of these non-food additives increases . As with other foods , when you make your own cheeses you control the ingredients and can guarantee that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that you really should not be putting into your body in the first place . While there is a specific science to cheese making , it is also and art form and craft . The more cheese you make , the better you will get at it . Once you have mastered the basics , you can begin to experiment and create your own speciality cheeses to suit your own personal taste and the taste of your family and friends . There have been hundreds of different cheeses developed all over the world , over centuries of cheese making , by artisans who have added their own personal magic to the craft . These cheese makers have contributed to the creation of an incredibly rich culture of cheese making , benefiting both the cheese maker and the cheese consumer . You can now do this in your own kitchen , with minimum equipment , creating your own cheeses for every day consumption and special occasions .

The conquered territory was larger than the Roman Empire at its greatest expansion , and it was claimed for the Arabs in roughly half the time . <p> How they were able to engulf so many empires , states , and armies in such a short period of time is a question which has engaged historians since at least the ninth century . Most recent popular accounts have been based almost solely on the early Muslim sources , which were , in short , salvation history , composed for the purpose of demonstrating that God had chosen the Arabs as his vehicle for spreading Islam throughout the world . <p> While exploiting the rich biographical and geographical information of the early Muslim sources , this groundbreaking work delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Islamic Empire by incorporating different approaches and different bodies of evidence . <p> Robert G. Hoyland , a leading Late Antique scholar , accomplishes this by first examining the wider world from which Mohammed and his followers emerged . For Muslim sources , the revelation of Islam to Muhammad is the starting point for their history , and modern university departments have tended to reinforce this approach . Late Antique studies have done us the service of shedding much needed light on the 4th to 6th centuries , thus giving us a better view of the nature of Middle Eastern society in the decades before the Arab conquests . <p> In particular , Hoyland narrates the emergence of a distinct Arab identity in the region of the Roman province Arabia and western ( Saudi ) Arabia , which is at least as important for explaining the Arab conquests as Muhammad 's revelation . The Arabs are the principal , almost sole , focus of the Muslim conquest narratives , and this is the norm for modern works on this subject . Yet , in the same period the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges of the superpowers of Byzantium and Iran ; in fact , the Khazars and Turks continued to be major rivals of the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries . <p> The role of these peripheral states in the Arab success story is underscored in the narrative .

Hoyland is Professor of Late Antique and Early Islamic Middle Eastern History at New York University 's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and author of Arabia and the Arabs . <p> A splendid new history of the Arab conquests ... Hoyland ... has performed an invaluable service . His book will surely serve as the definitive account of the Arab conquests for many years to come . -Tom Holland , Literary Review In God 's Path is a thoughtful and nuanced guide to an age that was far more complex than we might imagine from older accounts ...

By the end of the day , one of the strongest positions on the Western Front had fallen , a place of such importance that the Germans had pledged to hold it at any cost . It was the greatest British victory in three years of war . The first two years of the First World War had represented an almost unending catalogue of disaster for the Australians . Messines was not only their first real victory , it was also the first test in senior command for Major General John Monash who commanded the newly formed 3rd Division and would later be hailed as Australia 's greatest soldier . Messines was a baptism of fire for the 3rd Division which came into the line alongside the battle-scarred 4th Australian Division , badly mauled at Bullecourt just six weeks earlier in one of the worst defeats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginable savagery , a lethal and sometimes hand-to-hand affair of bayonets , clubs , bombs and incessant machine-gun fire , described by one Australian as ' 72 hours of Hell ' .

While there are many craft and publishing books for writers , ' Fearless Writing ' tackles the writer 's psyche . It explores the common fears all writers share rejection , embarrassment , shame and uses practical advice and exercises to dispel doubts and build confidence . With an emphasis on writing to fulfil your own expectations rather than someone else 's , ' Fearless Writing ' reveals the secret to writing without fear : Embrace your own imagination and curiosity . <p> ' Fearless Writing ' presents an altogether different view of the writing process . Rather than focusing solely on the writing process or the writing life , it combines the two with an emphasis on embracing the process . It addresses writers paralysed by writer 's block , those afraid to share their work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new way of looking at the writing life , one that is enjoyable , obtainable , and fuelled by emotional engagement and curiosity . <p> ' Fearless Writing ' begins by dispelling common myths and fears about writing . It teaches writers to " feel first and write second , " to rely on instinct , and write what you love rather than what you know or what you believe can be published . Once writers have embraced their own passion for the story , the book builds on emotional engagement and craft by asking writers to examine the emotional significance of stories with the three-arc approach and implement conflicting emotions in their stories . <p> Finally , authors are encouraged to embrace marketing with the same confidence and passion by finding an audience that shares their enthusiasm rather than changing themselves to fit an audience . <p> This is n't a ' how-to ' book about writing . It 's a book about how to be a writer .

Hartry Field argues that we can explain the utility of mathematics without assuming it true . Part of the argument is that good mathematics has a special feature ( conservativeness ) that allows it to be applied to nominalistic claims ( roughly , those neutral to the existence of mathematical entities ) in a way that generates nominalistic consequences more easily without generating any new ones . Field goes on to argue that we can axiomatize physical theories using nominalistic claims only , and that in fact this has advantages over the usual axiomatizations that are independent of nominalism .

By the time she died aged ninety-one in 1923 , having outlived seven of her twelve children , motor cars plied the highway near her bush home north of Melbourne , and Australia was a modern , sovereign nation . <p> Like so many pioneering women , Ellen , the wife of a convict , led a life of great hardship .

Drawing upon a lifetime of scientific expertise and abiding love of nature , Fortey uses his small wood to tell a wider story of the ever-changing British landscape , human influence on the countryside over many centuries and the vital interactions between flora , fauna and fungi . <p> The trees provide a majestic stage for woodland animals and plants to reveal their own stories . Fortey presents his wood as an interwoven collection of different habitats rich in species . His attention ranges from the beech and cherry trees that dominate the wood to the flints underfoot ; the red kites and woodpeckers that soar overhead ; the lichens , mosses and liverworts decorating the branches as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beetles and crane-flies . The 300 species of fungi identified in the wood capture his attention as much as familiar deer , shrews and dormice . <p> Fortey is a naturalist who believes that all organisms are as interesting as human beings and certainly more important than the observer . So this book is a close examination of nature and human history . He proves that poetic writing is compatible with scientific precision . The book is filled with details of living animals and plants , charting the passage of the seasons , visits by fellow enthusiasts ; the play of light between branches ; the influence of geology ; and how woodland influences history , architecture and industry . <p> On every page he shows how an intimate study of one small wood can reveal so much about the natural world and demonstrates his relish for the incomparable pleasures of discovery . <p> Richard Fortey retired from his position as senior palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in 2006 .
